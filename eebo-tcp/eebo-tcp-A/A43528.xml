         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

or not, (more than as to some old Formalities of

Duke of <hi>York,</hi> his now onely son, and their daughter <hi>Katherine.</hi> To which
King <hi>Henry</hi> readily condescendeth, upon divers reasons; partly to be assured
of the assistance of the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> against all practises of the <hi>French;</hi> and
partly that so great a Treasure, as the Rents and Profits of the Princesse's Joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
might not be carried out of the Kingdom, as needs must be, if she should
be married to a Prince of another Nation. This being agreed on by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
of either side, Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the 2 d. is sollicited for a Dispensation: to the
Grant whereof he willingly yielded, knowing how necessary it was to the
Peace of Christendom, that those Kings should be united in the strictest
Leagues of Love and Amity. Which comming to the knowledge of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
<hi>Katherine,</hi> who understood her own condition better than her father or
mother, she caused those words, <hi>vel forsan co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nitam,</hi> to be inserted into the
Bull or Dispensation; and this she did for the preventing of all such disputes as
might arise about the validity of the Marriage, in case the consummation of it
should be openly known; though afterwards those words were used as the
shrewdest Argument for the invalidating of the Marriage, when it came in
question. And some such thing was thought to have prevailed with King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:66032:3"/>
the seventh, for deferring the advancement of <hi>Henry</hi> his second son to the
Style, Title, and Dignity of Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> that he might first be well assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that no child was likely to be born of the former Marriage, to whom
that Title might more properly and of right belong.</p>
                  <p>The Dispensation being thus granted, Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> being then eleven
years of age, or thereabouts, is solemnly contracted to the Princesse <hi>Katherine,</hi>
who must needs have a very great stock, as well of Christian-Prudence, as of
Virgin-Modesty, to wait the growing up of a Husband being then a child, and
one of whose affection to her, when he should come to Man's estate, she had
no assurance; and so it proved in the event: For <hi>Henry</hi> had no sooner finished
the fourteenth year of his age, when, either by the compunction of conscience,
the perswasion of some that wish'd him well, or upon consideration of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion
of age which was then between them, (the Princesse being eight
years the elder) he resolved upon the breaking and annulling of the said Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
in which his Parents had engaged him. To which end, making his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
to Doctor <hi>Richard Fox,</hi> then Bishop of Winchester, he openly renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
the said Contract, not by word onely, but by the subscription of his
name to a Legall Instrument, containing the effect of that Renunciation, his
Resolution never to proceed any further in it, and his Reasons for it. Which
Instrument he published in the presence of <hi>John Read,</hi> a publick Notary, (the

self, extant in the History of <hi>John Speed,</hi> may be there consulted. And in
pursuance of this Act, he waived the Consummation of the Marriage from
one time to another, till the death of his father, which happened on the 22 of
<hi>April, An.</hi> 1509. he being then within two months of the age of eighteen
years. But being now come unto the Crown by the death of his father, Reason
of State prevailed so far beyond that of Conscience, that he consented to the
consummation of the Marriage, which before he had solemnly renounced, and
did accordingly celebrate those unhappy Nuptialls (the cause of so much
trouble both to him and others) on the second of <hi>June,</hi> and caused her to be
Crown'd with him on the 24 th. of the same month. This Marriage was blest
within the year by the birth of a son, whom the King caused to be Christned
by the name of <hi>Henry;</hi> and five years after with another, who lived not long
enough to receive his Baptism.</p>

of his Dominions; committed in her Infancy to the care and charge of the
Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> daughter of <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> and by the King (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to her discent from the house of the <hi>Montacutes</hi>) advanced unto the
Style and Title of Countesse of <hi>Sarisbury, An<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 1513. And herein it was
thought, that the Queen had a particular aim beyond that of the King, and
that she rather chose to commit her daughter to the care of that Lady, than of
any other in the Kingdom; to the end, that some affection growing to her by
any of the Countesse's sons, her daughter's Title to the Crown might be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborated

choice of him for her husband before any other, if the necessity of her affairs,

had scarce liv'd to the third year of her age, when she was promised in marriage

                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:66032:3"/>
as ever had been made by any King of that Country. And so far did the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
seem to be acted in earnest, that it was publickly agreed upon in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for the Town of <hi>Tournay,</hi> that the Espousals should be made within four
months, by the said two Kings, in the name of their children; in pursuance
whereof, as the <hi>French</hi> King sent many rich gifts to some leading men of the
Court of <hi>England,</hi> to gain their good liking to this League, so he sent many
costly Presents to the Princesse <hi>Mary,</hi> the designed wife (if Princes could be
bound by such designations) of the heir of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But war beginning to break out between the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> it was
thought fit by <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth,<note place="margin">1522.</note> being then Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> and King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> to court the favour of the <hi>English;</hi> for the obtaining whereof, his neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to Queen <hi>Katherine,</hi> being sister to the Queen, his Mother, gave
him no small hopes. Upon this ground he makes a voyage into <hi>England,</hi> is
royally feasted by the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> installed solemnly Knight of the Order of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
in the Castle of <hi>Windsor,</hi> and there capitulates with the King amongst
other things, to take to wife his daughter <hi>Mary,</hi> as soon as she should come to
the years of marriage; it was also then and there agreed, that as soon as she was
twelve years old, the Emperour should send a proxie to make good the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
&amp; espouse her <hi>per verba de praesenti</hi> in the usual form<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in the mean time
the King of <hi>England</hi> should not give her in marriage unto any other, that a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
should be procured from the Pope, at the charge of both Princes, in
regard that the parties were within the second degree of consanguinity; that
within four months after the contract, the Princesse should be sent to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's
Court, whether it were in <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Flanders,</hi> at the sole charge of the
King of <hi>England,</hi> and married within four dayes after her comming thither, in
the face of the Church; her portion limited to 400000 crowns, if the King
should have no issue male, but to be inlarged to 600000 crowns more, if the
King should have any such issue male to succeed in the Kingdom. A jointure of
50000 crowns <hi>per annum,</hi> to be made by the Emperour, the one part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to be laid in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the other in <hi>Spain;</hi> and finally, that if either of the
said two Princes should break off this marriage, he should forfeit 400000
crowns to the party injured.</p>
                  <p>And now who could have thought but that the Princesse <hi>Mary,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1525.</note> must have
been this Emperour's wife, or the wife rather of any Prince, then one that was
to be begotten by this Emperour, on another woman, though in conclusion
so it hapned. As long as <hi>Charles</hi> had any need of the assistance and friendship
of <hi>England,</hi> so long he seemed to go on really in the promised marriage, and
by all means must have the Princesse sent over presently to be declared Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse,
and made Regent of <hi>Flanders.</hi> But when he had taken the <hi>French</hi>
King at the battel of <hi>Pavia,</hi> sackt <hi>Rome,</hi> and made the Pope his prisoner, he
then conceived himselfe in a condition of seeking for a wife elsewhere, which
might be presently ripe for marriage, without such a tedious expectation,
as his tarrying for the Princesse <hi>Mary</hi> must needs have brought him. And
thereupon he shuts up a marriage with the Lady <hi>Issabell, Infanta</hi> of <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lugull,</hi>
and daughter to another of his Mother's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>isters. For which being questioned by
the King, he layes the blame upon the importunity of his Council, who could
not patiently permit him to remain unmarried, till the Princesse <hi>Mary</hi> came
to age; and who besides had caused a scruple to be started, touching her ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimation,
as being born by one that had been wife to his elder brother.
King <hi>Henry</hi> thereupon proceeds to a new treaty with the <hi>French,</hi> to whom his
friendship at the time of their King's captivity had been very useful; which
is by them as cheerfully excepted, as by him it had been franckly offered. She
had before been promised to the Daulphin of <hi>Franc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> but now she is design'd for
the second son, then Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> who afterwards, by the death of his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
brother, succeeded his father in the Crown. But whilst they were upon this
treaty, the former question touching her legitimation, was again revived by the
Bishop of <hi>Tarb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e,</hi> one of the Commissioners for the <hi>French,</hi> which though it
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66032:4"/>
seem'd not strong enough to dissolve the treaty which the <hi>French</hi> were willing
to conclude (as their affairs then stood) upon any conditions; yet it occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
many troubles in the Court of <hi>Eng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>and,</hi> and almost all Christendome
besides.</p>
                  <p>For now the doubt being started a second time,<note place="margin">1526.</note> and started now by such,
who could not well subsist without his friendship, began to make a deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
in the mind of the King, and to call ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k such passages to his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
as otherwise would have been forgotten. He now bethinks himselfe of
the Protestation which he had made in the presence of Bishop <hi>Fox</hi> before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
never to take the Lady <hi>Katherine</hi> for his wife; looks on the death of
his two sons, as a punishment on him for proceeding in the marriage; and casts
a fear of many inconveniences, or mischiefs rather, which must inevitably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
this Kingdome, if he should dye, and leave no lawful issue to enjoy the
Crown. Hope of more children there was none, and little pleasure to be
taken in a conversation; which the disproportion of their years, and a greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality
in their dispositions, must render lesse agreeable every day then other.
In this perplexity of mind, he consults his <hi>Confessor,</hi> by whom he was advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to make known his griefs to Cardinal <hi>Wolsie,</hi> on whose judgement he
relied in most other matters; which hapned so directly to the Cardinal's
mind, as if he had contrived the project. The Emperour had lately cross'd
him in his suit for the Popedome, and since denied him the Archbish prick
of <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ledo,</hi> with the promise whereof he had before bound him to his side. And
now the Cardinal resolves to take the opportunity of the King's distractions,
for perfecting his revenge against him. In order whereunto, as he had drawn
the King to make peace with <hi>France,</hi> and to conclude a marriage for his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with the Duke of <hi>Orleance;</hi> so now he hopes to separate him from the bed
of <hi>Katherine,</hi> the Emperour's Aunt, and marry him to <hi>Madam Rhinee,</hi> the
<hi>French</hi> Queens sister, who afterwards was wife to the Duke of <hi>Ferrara.</hi> About

                  <p>But <hi>Rochford</hi> brought with him out of <hi>France</hi> another Piece,<note place="margin">1527.</note> which more

in the Court of <hi>England,</hi> she shewed her selfe with so many advantages
above all other Ladies about the Queen, that the King easily took notice of
her. Whether more captivated by the Allurements of her beauty, or the face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousnesse
of her behaviour, it is hard to say; certain it is, that he suffered
himselfe to be so far transpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ted in affection towards her, that he could think
of nothing else, but what might tend to the accomplishment of his desires;
so that the separation from the bed of <hi>Katherine,</hi> which was but coldly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon case of Conscience, is now more hotly prosecuted in the heat of <hi>Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nce.</hi>
In the mean time the King adviseth with the Cardinal, and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
with the most learned men in the Realm of <hi>England.</hi> By whom it was
modestly resolved, that the King had a very just ground to consult the Pope,
and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> lawful means for extricating himselfe out of those perplexities,
in which this marriage had involved him. The Pope had been beholden to the
King, for procuring his liberty, when the <hi>Imperialists</hi> held him prisoner in the

                        </gap>,</hi> and was in reason bound to gratifie him for so great a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.
But then withall, he neither was to provoke the Emperour, nor hazard

the Authority and Reputation of the See Apostolick, by running on the

Oration in the bemoaning of his own misfortunes, and the Queen's
Appeal from the two Cardinals to the Pope, I shall now say nothing; leaving
the Reader for those passages to our common <hi>Annals.</hi> Suffice in this place to
note, that while the businesse went on favourable in the King's behalfe, <hi>Wolsie</hi>
was given to understand of his desperate loves to Mistrisse <hi>Bollen,</hi> which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to him two ensuing mischiefs, not to be otherwise avoided, then by
slackning the course of these proceedings. For first, he saw that if the King
should be divorc'd definitively from his present wife, he should not be able to
draw him to accept of Madam <hi>Rhenee</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Queens sister, which was the
mark he chiefly aimed at. And secondly, he feared that Mistrisse <hi>Anne</hi> had
brought so much of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> with her, as might in time become destructive<note place="margin">1529.</note>
to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Of this he certifies the Pope, the Pope recals <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pegius,</hi>
and revokes his Commission; leaving the King to cast about to some
new wayes to effect his purpose. And at this time it hapned, that Dr <hi>Thomas

not being able to endure so many indignities, as had been lately put upon him,

of this Rub, did not much smooth the way to the King's desires. The
Queen's appeal unto the Pope, was the greatest difficulty, from which since
she could not be removed, it must be made unprofitable and ineffectual, for
the time to come. And thereupon a Proclamation is set forth on the 19 of

what he had example and Authority for, at that very time; for in the year 1520

fifth, who being no lesse displeased with Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth, abolished
the Papal power and jurisdiction, out of all the Churches of his Kingdome in
<hi>Spain,</hi> which though it held but for a while (till the breach was closed) yet
left he an example by it (as my Author noteth) that there was no necessity of

of that learned man, the greatest Princes of those times did look upon the

subject and fit to be pared off, as occasion served. And if they did, or do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

for quieting the King's conscience, and putting an end to that debate, she
would be content to refer the matter to four Bishops, and four temporall
Lords. But this she absolutely refused, saying, She was his lawful Wife,
that she would stand to her Appeal, and condescend to nothing in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
but by the counsel of the Emperour, and the rest of her friends. This
answer makes the King more resolute, more open in the demonstration of his
affections to the Lady <hi>Anne Bollen,</hi> whom he makes Marchionesse of <hi>Pembrook,</hi>

her within few dayes after his return, the divorce being yet unsentenced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and the Queen. Not long after which, it was thought necessary
to the King, to call a Parliament, wherein he caused an Act to passe, that no
person should appeal for any cause out of this Realm, to the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi>
but that all Appeals should be made by the party grieved from the Commissary
to the Bishop, from the Bishop to the Archbishop, and from the Archbishop,
to the King, as had been anciently observed amongst the first Kings of the

it is declared by Proclamation, that Queen <hi>Katherine</hi> should no longer be

the King was willing, for his own ends, to wink at the one, and the Pope was
not in a condition (as the case then stood) to be too peremptory in the other.

the 30th. of <hi>March,</hi> 1533. the Parliament still sitting which before
we spake of. At his first entrance into the House of Convocation, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
two Questions to be considered and disputed by the Bishops and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy;
the first was, Whether the marrying of a Brother's wife, carnally known,
though without any issue by him, be so prohibited by the Will and Word of
God, as not to be dispenc'd withall by the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> The second was,
Whether it did appear, upon the Evidence given in before the Cardinalls,
that <hi>Katherine</hi> had been carnally known by Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> or not. Both Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
being carried in the Affirmative, though not without some Opposition
in either House, in the first especially; it was concluded thereupon in the
Convocation, and not long after in the Parliament also, That the King might
lawfully proceed to another Marriage.</p>
                  <p>These preparations being made, the Marriage precondemned by Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and all Appeals to <hi>Rome</hi> made ineffectuall by Act of Parliament, the

day appointed; which day being come, and no appearance by her made,
either in Person, or by Proxie, (as they knew there would not) she is called
peremptorily every day, fifteen days together; and every day there was great
poasting betwixt them and the Court, to certifie the King and <hi>Cromwell</hi> (a

it, either before, or on the day of passing Sentence, should make her appearance
in the Court: <q>For (saith he) if the noble Lady <hi>Katherine</hi> should, upon
the bruit of this matter, either in the mouthes of the Inhabitants of the
Country, or by her Friends, or Counsell, hearing of this bruite, be moved,
stirred, counselled, or perswaded to appear before me, in the time, or afore
the time of Sentence, I should be thereby greatly staid and let in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
and the King's Grace's Councell here present shall be much uncertain
what shall be then further done therein. For a great bruite and voice of the
people in this behalf, might perchance move her to do the thing, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
she would not if she hear little of it. And therefore I pray you
to speak as little of this matter as you may, and to move the King's High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66032:6"/>
so to do, for consideration above recited.</q> But so it hapned to their
wish, that the Queen, persisting constant in her Resolution of standing to
the Judgment of no other Court than the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> vouchsafed not to
take any notice of their proceeding in the Cause. And thereupon, at the day
and time before designed, she was pronounced to be <hi>Cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Appearance; and by the generall consent of all the Learned men then present,
the Sentence of the Divorce was passed, and her Marriage with the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared

                  <p>Of all these doings, as the Divorced Queen would take no notice, so by her
Officers and Attendants she was served as in her former capacity. Which
comming to the King's knowledge, he sends the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> and some
others in the month of <hi>July,</hi> with certain Instructions given in Writing, to
perswade her, to submit to the Determinations of the King and State, to lay
aside the Title of Queen, to content her self with that of the <hi>Princesse Dowager;</hi>
and to remove her from the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi>'s house at <hi>Bayden,</hi> where she

                     </gap>ion of a Queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
Which at the first was generally refused amongst them, upon a Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which had been made in the Case by <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Berker,</hi> her two Chaplains;
that is to say, That having already took an Oath to serve her as Queen, they
could not with a good conscience take any other. But in the end, a fear of
losing their said places, but more of falling into the King's displeasure, so
prevailed upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Oath was taken by most of them; not suffered
from thenceforth to come into the Queen's presence, (who looked upon
them as the betrayers of her Cause) or to perform any service about her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Some Motives, to induce her to a better conformity, were ordered to be
laid before her; none like to be more prevalent, than that which might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the Interest of her daughter <hi>Mary.</hi> And therefore it was offered to her
consideration, <q>That chiefly, and above all things, she should have regard to
the Honourable, and her most dear Daughter, the Lady Princesse; from
whom, in case the King's Highnesse (being thus enforced, exagitated, and
moved by the unkindnesse of the Dowager) might also withdraw his Princely
estimation, goodnesse, zeal, and affection; it would be to her no little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret,
sorrow, and extream calamity.</q> But the wise Queen knew well enough,
that if she stood, her Daughter could not do amisse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereas there could be
nothing gained by such submissions, but the dishonour of the one, the Bastar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dising
of the other, and the ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

restored in time to come to their first condition.</p>
                  <p>Finding small hopes of any justice to be done her in the Realm of <hi>England,</hi>
and not well able to endure so many indignities as had been daily put upon
her, she makes her complaint unto the Pope, whom she found willing to show
his teeth, though he could not bite. For presently hereupon a Bull is issued,
for accursing both the King and the Realm; the Bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

proclaim the same in <hi>England,</hi> caused it to be set up in some publick places in
the Town of <hi>Dunkirk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> (one of the Haven Towns of <hi>Flanders</hi>) that so the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it might be heard on this side of the Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to which it was not safe to
bring it. But neither the Pope nor the Queen Dowager got any thing by this
rash adventure, which onely served to exasperate the King against them, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
against all which adheared unto them. For in the following Parliament,
which began on the 25 th. of <hi>January,</hi> and ended on the 30 th. of <hi>March,</hi> an
Act was pass'd, inhibiting the payment of First-fruits to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi>

made Lord President of <hi>Wales;</hi> which sell out better for the Tutor,
than it did for the Pupill; Who being left destitute of the counsell of so

place that his Grace will appoint me. But I protest before you, and all
other that be here present, that my conscience will in no wise suffer me to
take any other than my self for Princesse, or for the King's Daughter, born
in lawfull Matrimony; and that I will never wittingly or willingly say or
do, whereby any person might take occasion to think, that I agree to the
contrary. Nor say I this out of any ambition or proud mind, as God is my
Judge; but that if I should do otherwise, I should in my conscience slander
the Deed of our Mother, the holy Church, and the Pope, who is the Judge
in this matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and none other; and also should dishonour the King my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

that he had received a Letter from Sir <hi>William Paulet,</hi> Controller of your House:
the effect whereof was, that I should with all diligence remove unto the Castle of
<hi>Hertford.</hi> Whereupon I desired him to see the same Letter, which he shewed me;
wherein was written, That the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> the King's Daughter, should remove
to the place before-said, leaving out in the same the name of <hi>Princesse,</hi> Which when
I heard, I could not a little marvail, trusting verily, that your Grace was not privy
to the same Letter, as concerning the leaving out of the name of <hi>Princesse;</hi> for asmuch
as I doubt not in your goodnesse, but that your Grace doth take me for your lawfull
Daughter, born in true Matrimony. Wherefore if I should agree to the contrary, I
should in my conscience run into the displeasure of God, which I hope assuredly, that
your Grace would not that I so should. And in all other things, your Grace shall have
me always as humble an obedient Daughter and Handmaid, as ever was child to

                        <p>3. Also, whether she will recognise, accept, take, and repute the King's High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to be supream Head in Earth, under Christ, of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and
utterly refuse the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s pretended Power and Jurisdiction, heretofore

                  </floatingText>
                  <p>To these six Articles, she was required to give a plain and positive answer:
Which plainly shews the doubtfulnesse and uncertainty of her present condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in being either forced to confesse her selfe to be illegitimate, or running
on the last hazzard of the Kings displeasure, if she should do otherwise. But
wisely considering in her selfe, whom she had to deal with, she thought it sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
to strike sale, and to submit her selfe to him, with whom it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for her to dispute that point, if she had been able. She therefore makes a
cleer acknowledgement of the four first Articles, by the subscribing of her
name; but craved leave to demur on the two last, because some persons were
concern'd in them, whom she was not willing to discover. And by this means
she gain'd so far upon the King, that from that time forwards, he held her in the
same ranck with the rest of his children; gave her her turn in the succession of
the Kingdome; assigned her portion of ten thousand pounds, to be paid at her
marriage, and in the interim, three thousand pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> for her perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
maintenance. And more then this he did not do for his daughter <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth;</hi>
notwithstanding the esteem and affection which he bare to her mother;

marriage. Little or nothing more occurreth of her in the time of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
because there was little or nothing altered in the face of Religion, which
might give her any cause of publick or personall dislike. But when the great
alterations hapned in the time of King <hi>Edward,</hi> she then declared her selfe more
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66032:8"/>
openly (as she might more safely) in opposition to the same: concerning
which she thus declared her selfe in a Letter to the Lord Protector, and the rest
of the Council, dated at <hi>Kenninghall, June 22. An.</hi> 1549.</p>

the observation of his Majestie's Laws; who am well assured I have offended no law,
unlesse it be a late law of your own making, which in my conscience is not worthy the
name of Law, both for the King's honors sake, and the wealth of the Realm, and
giving the occasion of an evil bruit throughout all Christendome, besides the partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
used in the same, and (as my conscience is very well perswaded) the offending
God, which passeth all the rest. But I am well assured, that the King his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Lawes, were all allowed and consented to, without compulsion, by the whole
Realm, both spiritual and temporal, and all the Executors sworn upon a book to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil
the same, so that it was an authorized Law. And that I have obeyed, and will
do with the grace of God, till the King's Majesty my brother, shall have sufficient
years to be a judge in this matter himself. Whereto (my Lord) I was plain with you
at my last being in the Court, declaring unto you at that time, whereunto I would
stand; and now do assure you all, that the only occasion of my stay from a tering of
mine opinion, is for two causes. One principally for my conscience; the other, that
the King my brother shall nor hereafter charge me to be one of those that were agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

changes, since the death of the King my Father, to every indifferent person, it well
appeareth, both to the displeasure of God, and unquietnesse of the Realm.</p>

wherein I am at a full point with Gods help, whatsoever shall happen to me, intending
with his grace, to trouble you little with any worldly suits, but to bestow the short

                     </gap>lamation of it to be made in the usual form; which
though it was denied by them, as the case then stood, yet she was gratified
therein by the Mayor of <hi>Norwich,</hi> who firs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> proclaimed her Queen, on the

did prefer the interest of King <hi>Henry</hi>'s children, before that of the

Castle, she faithfully assureu the Gentry, and other inhabitants of
the County of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> that she would not alter the Religion which had been
setled and confirmed in the Reign of her brother. On which assurance, there
was such a confluence to her from those parts of the Kingdom, that in short
space she had an army of fourteen thousand fighting men to maintain her
quarrel. The newes whereof, together with the risings of the people in other
places on the same account, wrought such an alteration in the Lords of the
Council, whom she had before solicited in vain to allow her title, that on
the nineteenth of <hi>July,</hi> she was solemnly proclaimed Queen at Cheapside
Crosse; not only by their general and joint consent, but by the joyful accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
of all sorts of people. But as Mariners seldome pay those vows
which they make in a tempest, when once they are delivered from the danger
of it; so <hi>Mary</hi> once established in the Royal Throne, forgot the services
which she received from those of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> together with the promises which she
made unto them in the case of Religion. Insomuch, that afterwards being
petitioned by them in that behalf, it was answered with more churlishnesse
than could be rationally expected in a green Estate, <hi>That members must obey
their Head, and not look to rule it.</hi> And that she might no more be troubled
with the like Petitions, she caused one <hi>Dobb.</hi> a Gentlemen on <hi>Windham</hi>
side,
who had presumed to put her in remembrance of her former promise, to be
punished by standing in the Pillory three dayes together, to be a gazing stock
to all men. But such is the condition of our humane nature, that we are far
more ready to require a favour, when we stand in need of it, than willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
or requite it, when our turn is served. Of which we cannot easily
meet with a cleerer evidence, than the example of this Queen; who was so
far from gartifying those who had been most aiding to her in the time of her
trouble, that she persecuted them, and all others of the same perswasions, with
fire and faggot, as by the sequel of her story will at large appear.</p>

                     <p>The Pursuivant having communicate his Instructions, found none more
ready to obey them, then the Duke himselfe, who had before dismist his forces,
and now prepared for his departure from that place, though to what he knew
not. But as he was pulling on his boots, he was first slaid by some of the 
Pensioners, who being drawn into the action against their wils, resolved to
have him in a readinesse to bear witnesse to it; and after taken into custody by
<hi>Slegg,</hi> a Serjeant. The businesse being in dispute, another Packet comes from 
the Lords of the Council, by which all parties were required to depart to their
severall dwellings; the benefit whereof the Duke laid claim to for himself, and
was accordingly left by them at his own disposal. And so he passed that night
in some good assurance, that he should fare no worse than the rest of the 
Council, who had engaged him in the same cause, and by whose order he had
undertaken the command of that Army. In the mean time, the Earl of <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell</hi>
had done his errand to the Queen, to so good a purpose, that he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
dispatched with Order to seize upon him. Who coming to <hi>Cambridge</hi>
the next morining, found him preparing for his journy, laid hold upon him,
and committed him to the charge of some of the Guard. It is reported, that
the Duke had no sooner seen the Earle of <hi>Arundell,</hi> but he fell down upon his
knees, and besought him to be good unto him, humbling himselfe before him
with more abjectednesse, than formerly he had insulted over him with pride
and insolence. By safe, but easie journies, he is brought unto the Tower on
the 25 day of <hi>July,</hi> together with the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
the Lord <hi>Hastings;</hi> the Lord <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Henry Dudley,</hi> two of
<hi>Northumberlands</hi> younger sons; Sir <hi>Andrew Dudly,</hi> the Duke's brother, Sir
<hi>John Gates,</hi> and <hi>Henry Gates</hi> his brother, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> Palmer (who formerly had
served his turn in the destruction of the Duke of <hi>Sommerset</hi>), and Dr <hi>Sandys</hi>
Vice Chancelor of the University of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> Followed the next day after
by the Marquesse of <hi>Northampton,</hi> Dr <hi>Nicholas Ridley,</hi> Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> the
Lord <hi>Robert Dudley,</hi> another of <hi>Northumberland</hi>'s sons, and Sir <hi>Robert Corbet;</hi>
who having made their Applications to the Queen at <hi>Framingham,</hi> found
there no better entertainment, than if they had been take in some act of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stility.
The 27 day brings in Sir <hi>Roger Chomley,</hi> Chief Justice of the Kings
Bench, and Sir <hi>Edward Mountague,</hi> Chief Justice of the Common Pleas; the
Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Cheek</hi> on the morrow after shutting up the
Arrer. But the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> stayed not long: for being considered in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66032:11"/>
himself as an easie person, of whom they were to fear no danger, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
no more in fault than the rest of the Council, he was released again
within three dayes after, to the great comfort of his daughter, the late queen
<hi>Jane,</hi> who would have died dayly for her Father, though but once for her
self.</p>
                     <p>But so it fared not with the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> a more dangerous
person; who, together with John Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> his eldest son, and <hi>William</hi>
Marquesse of <hi>Northampton,</hi> was brought to their tryal on the eighth of <hi>August,</hi>
before <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> then sitting as Lord High <hi>Steward</hi> in <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>
Hall. The Duke being brought unto the bar, humbled himself with
great reverence before his Peers, professing his faith and allegiance to the
Queen; against whom he confessed he had so grievously offended, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
not to speak any thing in his own defence. But having been trained
up to the study of the Laws in his younger dayes, he desired the judgement of
the Court in these two points. First, <hi>Whether any man doing any act by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

crime, and those by whose Letters and Commandments he was directed in all his

being delivered by the Court in point of Law, the Duke conceived that it
would be to no purpose for him to plead <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> and thereupon confessed
the Indictment, as the other two prisoners also did; they all received judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the usual form. On the pronouncing whereof, he besought the
Lords to move the Queen, that she would be gratious to his sons, who might
be able to do good service in the time to come; considering that they
went not with him of their own free will, but only in obedience to his
commands, who was their Father; in which as his desires were granted by
the Lords, so the Lords were gratified in them by the Queen; none of his sons
being executed (though all condemned) except <hi>Guilford</hi> only, whose case was
different from the others. The like judgement also pass'd on the morrow after,
on Sir <hi>John Gates,</hi> Sit <hi>Henry Gates,</hi> Sir <hi>Andrew Dudley,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Palmer,</hi>
who confessing the Indictment also, submitted themselves to the Queens mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
without further tryal.</p>
                     <p>In that short interval, which past between the sentence, and the execution,
the Duke was frequently visited by Dr <hi>Nicholas Heath,</hi> then newly restored un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the See of <hi>Worcester.</hi> It was another of the requests which he made to the
Lords, that some godly and learned man, might be licenced by the Queen, to
repair unto him, for the quiet and satisfaction of his conscience; and the resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to send him none (as she did to others in like case) but one of her own,
under a pretence of doing good unto their so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ls, by gaining them to a right
understanding of the faith in Christ. According to which purpose, <hi>He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

bestirs himself with such dexterity, that the Duke, either out of weaknesse, or
hope of life, or that it was indifferent to him in what Faith he died, who had
shewn so little while he lived, retracted that Religion which he had adorned
in the time of King <hi>Edward,</hi> and outwardly professed for some years in the
Reign of King <hi>Henry.</hi> And hereof he gave publick notice when he was on the

words betwixt him and <hi>Gates,</hi> each laying the blame of the late action on the

which possible might make him carry a vindicative mind towards that King's

trained up (as his Father had also been before him) in the study of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

and to find wayes by which to bring their lives in danger. But finding that
the long sword was of more estimation than the long Robe, in the time of that

without so much as any shew of legal processe, or the conventing of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
whom it did concern or any satisfaction given unto the Laws, (which in
some cases favour possession more than right) so strangely violated.</p>
                     <p>But greater was the havock which was made amongst them, when there was
any colour or pretence of Law, as in the case of having wives, or not confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

and pragmatical too many were, to run before the Laws in the like par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.
The Queen was zealous in her way, and by her interesse, strongly by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assed
to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But it concerned her to be wary, and not to
presse too much at once upon the people, which generally were well affected
to the Reformation. Of this she had a stout experiment, within very few
dayes after her first entrance into <hi>London.</hi> For so it hapned, that Dr
<hi>Bourn,</hi>
Arch-Deacon of <hi>London,</hi> and one of the Prebends of St <hi>Paul</hi>'s, preaching
a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
at the Crosse, on the 13th. of <hi>August,</hi> inveighed in favour of Bishop
<hi>Bonner,</hi> who was present at it, against some proceedings in the time of the late
King <hi>Edward.</hi> Which so incensed the people, that suddenly a great tumult
arose upon it; some pelting him with stones, others crying out aloud, pull
him down, pull him down, and one (who never could be known) flinging a
dagger at his head, which after was found sticking in a post of the Pulpit. And
greater had the mischief been upon this occasion, if Mr <hi>Bradford</hi> and Mr
<hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi>
two eminent Preachers in the time of King <hi>Edward,</hi> and of great credit
and esteem with the common people, had not endeavoured to appease the
enraged multitude, and with great difficulty secured the Preacher in the School
adjoining. By reason of which tumult, an Order was taken by the Lords of the
Coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>il, with the mayor and Aldermen of <hi>London,</hi> that they calling the next
day following a Common Council of the City, should thereby charge every
housholder, to cause their children and Apprentices, to keep their own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
Churches, upon the Holy dayes, and not to suffer them to attempt any
thing to the violating of the common peace. Willing them also to signifie
to the said Assembly, the Queens determination uttered to them by her
Highnesse, the 12th. of <hi>August,</hi> in the Tower. Which was, that albeit her
Grace's conscience was staid in matters of Religion; yet she gratiously meant
to compel or strain other mens, otherwise than God should (as she trusted)
put into their hearts a perswasion of that truth which she was in, through the
opening of his word unto them, by godly, vertuous, and learned Preachers;
that is to say, such Preachers only, as were to be hereafter licenced by the
Queen's authority.</p>
                     <p>But yet for fear that these instructions might not edifie with the common
people, Order was taken for preventing the like tumult on the Sunday fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
At what time the Sermon was preached by Dr <hi>Watson</hi> (who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
was Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> but Chaplain only at that time to the Bishop of
<hi>Winchester</hi>). For whose security, not only many of the Lords of the Council,
that is to say, the Lord Treasurer, the Lord Privy Seal, the Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> the
Earl of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> the Lords, <hi>Wentworth</hi> and <hi>Rich,</hi> were
severally desired to be
there present; but <hi>Gerningham,</hi> Captain of the Guard, was appointed with
two hundred of his stourest Yeomen, to stand round about him with their
Halberts. The Mayor had also taken Order, that all the Companies in their
Liveries should be present at it, which was well taken by the Queen. And
because the comming of the Guard on the one side affrighted some, and the
Order of the Lords above mentioned had restrained others from comming to
those publick Sermons; it was commanded by the Lord Mayor, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
of all Companies should give attendance at those Sermons for the
time to come, lest otherwise the Preachers might be discouraged at the sight
of so thin an Auditory. The safety of those publick Preachers being thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for by the Lords of the Council, there next care was, that nothing
should be preached in private Churches, contrary to the Doctrine which was,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66032:13"/>
and should be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> at the Cross by them which were appointed to it.
Whereupon it was further Ordered, that every Alderman in his Ward, should
forthwith send for the Curates of every Church within their Liberties, and
warn them not only to forbear preaching themselves; but also not to suffer
any other to preach, or make any open or solemn reading of Scripture in their
Churches, unless the said Preachers were severally licensed by the Queen. To
which purpose Letters were directed also to the Bishop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to all other Bishops in their several Diocesses. But nothing more disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
the true state and temper of the present time, than a Proclamation pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
by the Queen, on the 18th. of <hi>August.</hi> The Tenor of which is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>

as their lives may indeed express the great hunger and thirst of God's glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which by
rash talk and words, many have pretended: And in so doing, they shall best please
God, and live without danger of the Laws, and maintain the tranquility of the

to make any assemblies of people, or at any publick, assemblies, or otherwise,
shall go about to stir the people to disorder or disquiet, she mandeth according to her
duty, to see the same most severely reformed and punished, according to her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nese's
Lawes.</p>
                     <p>And furthermore, for asmuch as it is well known, that sedition and false rumours
have been nourished and maintained in this Real<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

incur her Highnesse indignation and displeasure.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be denied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that this Proclamation was very cautiously and
cunningly penned; giving encouragement enough to those which had a mind
to outrun the Law, or otherwise to conform themselves to the Queen's Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
to follow their own course therein, without dread or danger; and yet
commanding nothing contrary to the Lawes established, which might give
trouble or offence to the other party. For hereupon many of the people shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves so ready for receiving their old Religion, that in many places of
the Realm, before any Law was made for the same, they erected again their
Altars, and used the Masse, and Latin Service, in such sort as was wont to be
in King <hi>Henry</hi>'s time. Which was so well taken by the Queen, that all such as
stood upon the Lawes which were made to the contrary before, had a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>k of
displeasure set upon them. Which being observed by some of the Clergy, they
were as forward as the rest, in setting up the Pageants of St <hi>Catherine,</hi> and St
<hi>Nicholas,</hi> formerly erected in the Chancels, and to set forth their Processions,
(which they celebrated in the Latin tounge) with their old solemnities, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Lawes and Ordinances of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time. All which irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
activities in the Priest and People, were sheltred under the name of setting
forward the <hi>Queens proceedings.</hi> And by that name the official of the Arch-Deacon
of <hi>Ely,</hi> gave it in charge amongst the Articles of his visitation, that the
Church Wardens should present all such as did disturb the <hi>Queen's proceedings,</hi>
in letting the Latin Service, setting up of Altars, saying of Mass, &amp;c. But
more particularly at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> the Vicechancellor, challenged one
<hi>Pierson,</hi> on
the 3d. of <hi>October,</hi> for officiating the communion in his own Parish Church, in
the English tounge; and on the 26. displaced Dr <hi>Madew,</hi> Master of <hi>Clare Hall,</hi>
for being maried, though they had both as much authority on their side, as the
Lawes could give them. In like manner some of the Popish party in <hi>King</hi>'s
<hi>Colledge</hi> (not tarrying the making of any Law) on the 28th. of the same, officia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Divine Service in the Latin tounge; and on the 6th. of <hi>November</hi> then
next following, a Sermon is preached openly at St <hi>Michaels,</hi> contrary to the
Lawes in that behalf, not as then repealed. Not altogether so eager on the
scent at <hi>Oxon,</hi> as they were at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> though with more difficulty
brought
at first to the Reformation. Only it pleased Dr <hi>Tresham,</hi> one of the Canons of
<hi>Christ Church,</hi> of the last foundation, to cause the great bell there to be new
cast, and christned by the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Mary;</hi> much comforting himself with
the
melodious found thereof, when it toll'd to Mass; which <hi>Marshall</hi> the new
Dean, by his help and counsel, had again restored.</p>
                     <p>But these were only the Essays of those alterations, which generally were
intended in all parts of the Church, assoon as the times were ripe for them,
and the people fitted to receive them; in order whereunto, it was not thought
sufficient to displace the Bishop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now as concerning the Archbishop, the substance of his story is briefly
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>his. He had been a chief instrument in King <hi>Henry</hi>'s time, of setting forward
the divorce; and in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s, of advancing the <hi>Reformation</hi> The
Queen
conceived hereupon such a high displeasure (It had been malice in another)
against the man, that nothing but his death could appease the same. His death
is therefore fully resolved upon, by <hi>Gardiner, Banner,</hi> and the rest of the Popish
Prelates. Of which the first had p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>osecuted the Divorce as far as any; and the
second was as forward as the best in the Reformation, as long as <hi>Cromwel</hi> lived
to perfer and countenance him. But their standings out, and sufferings for it in
King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time were thought sufficient explations for their former errors,
when the good Offices which <hi>Cranmer</hi> had done for her in her Fathers ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e,
were worn out of memory. Die then he must; but by what law he was to
die, proved a knot more difficult, than could be speedily untied. It was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
to charge him with High Treason, as being privy to the plot of the Duke
of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> for excluding the Queen from the succession. But against
this it was objected, that he was the last of the Council who subseribed unto it;
and that the Council would be wary of making that a Capital offence in him,
of which they were all equally guilty. In the next place it was propounded, to
proceed against him in case of Heresie, that being the most likely way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pe, whose favour was to be procured by all means immaginable.
But the worst was, that the Statutes made in the time of King <hi>Richard</hi> 2d.
and King <hi>Henry</hi> 4th. for putting Hereticks to death, had been abrogated in the
time of king <hi>Henry</hi> 8th. as that of the six Articles, more terrible than either
of the other two had been, repealed by the late King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th. No better
course therefore, than to find some occasion for laying him up in some safe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
and when they had him there, to proceed against him as time and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
should administer some fit matter for it.</p>
                     <p>About this time a bruit was raised, that <hi>Cranmer</hi> to ingratiate himself with
the Queen, had promised to celebrate the Exequies of the deceased King, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>sh</hi> manner. To clear himself of which reproach, he drew
up a Manifest, declaring in the same, that he was ready to maintain the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Religion, set forth by his procurement in the time of King <hi>Edward,</hi> to
be consonant to the word of God, the Doctrine of the Apostles, and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the best and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rest times. These papers lying in the window in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
chamber, were seen and liked by Bishop <hi>Scory,</hi> by whom they were tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
and communicated to many others. Coming at last unto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Council, the Archbishop is commanded to appear before them.
Interrogated about the papers, and prompted by Bishop <hi>Heath,</hi> who was then
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66032:15"/>
amongst them, to let them know whether he were not sorry for it. To which
the Archbishop made reply, that as he did not deny himself to be the author
of those papers, so he must needs confesse himself to be sorry that they went
from him in such sort as they did. For I had purposed, saith he, to set out the
<hi>Manifest</hi> in a more large and ample manner; and to have it set upon St <hi>Paul</hi>'s
door, and the doors of all the Churches in <hi>London,</hi> with my own Seal affix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto it. Upon which stout and honest answer, they thought fit to dismiss
him for the present: it being conceived by some of the more moderate spirits,
that it would be punishment enough to deprive him only of his Bishoprick,
and to assign him sufficient maintenance upon the exhibiting of a true Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of his whole estate, with a commandment to keep his house without
medling in matters of Religion. But those who better understood the mind
of the Queen, so ordered it, that on the 14th. of <hi>September,</hi> he was sent to the
Tower, where he remained prisoner till the 3d. of <hi>November.</hi> At what time
he was arraigned in the Guild Hall of <hi>London,</hi> together with the Lord <hi>Guilford
Dadley,</hi> the late Queen <hi>Jane</hi> his wife, and others; all of them being attainted
and condemned of Treason, as before was said. And he lay under this attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
till the year next following, when the old Statutes for putting Hereticks
to death, were revived in Parliament. Which having furnished his adversaries
with a better ground to proceed upon, to the contentment of the Pope and
the Queen together, they waved the prosecuting of the Attaindure, to an
Execution, and wholly fixed themselves on the point of Heresie. At the
hearing whereof, he was right well pleased, because the case was not now his
own, but Christs; not the Queens, but the Churches.</p>
                     <p>The severity of this beginning against the Natives, gave a sufficient warning
to all such strangers, who had tool sanctuary here in the time of King <hi>Edward,</hi> to
provide betimes for their departure. Amongst whom, none more openly aimed
at than <hi>Peter Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>yr,</hi> because none of them had given wider wounds than he to
the Catholick Cause. <hi>Tresham,</hi> a <hi>senior</hi> Canon of <hi>Christ Church,</hi> had held some
points against him at his first coming thither; and now he took the benefit of
the times, in causing both that house, and many others in the University, to
put some publick scorn upon him. Not finding any safety there, he retires to
<hi>Lambeth,</hi> where he was sure of as much safety as that place could give him. A
consultation had been held by some of the more fiery spirits, for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment
unto prison. But he came hither (as it was well known) on the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Faith, which was not to be violated for the satisfaction of some private
persons. It was thought fit therefore to discharge him all further imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to licence him to depart in peace, none being more forward to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
him with all things necessary for his going hence, than the new Lord
Chancellor; whether in honour to his Learning, or out of a desire to send him
packing, shall not now be questioned. But less humanity was shewed unto
him in his wife, whose body having been buried in the Church of St <hi>Frideswide,</hi>
was afterwards by publick order taken out of the grave, and buried in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
dunghil. About the same time also such strangers as were gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into the Church of <hi>John Alasco,</hi> not only were necessitated to forbear
their meetings, but to dissolve their Congregation, and to quit the Countrey.
Such a displeasure was conceived against them, by those which governed the
affairs, that it was no small difficulty for them to get leave for their departure;
and glad they were to take the opportunity of two <hi>Danish ships,</hi> and to put
themselves to sea in the beginning of winter, fearing more storms in <hi>England,</hi>
than upon the Ocean. And so farwel to <hi>John Alasco.</hi> It was an ill wind
which brought him hit her, and worse he could not have for his going back.
The like haste made the <hi>French Protestants</hi> also. And that they might have no
pretence for a long stay, command was sent unto the Mayor of <hi>Rie</hi> and <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ver,</hi>
on the 16th. of <hi>September,</hi> to suffer all <hi>French Protestants</hi> to cross the seas, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
such only, whose names should be signified unto them by the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors.
But notwithstanding these removes, many, both <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French,</hi>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:66032:15"/>
remained still in the Kingdom, some of which being after found in <hi>Wiat</hi>'s
Army, occasioned the banishing of all the rest, except Denizens and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
only, by a publick Edict. At which time many of the <hi>English</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
also, as well Students as others, to the number of 300. or thereabouts;
hoping to find that freedome and protection in a forein Country, which was
denied them in their own. The principal of those which put themselves into
this voluntary exile, were, <hi>Katherine,</hi> the last wife of <hi>Charls Brandon</hi> Duke
of <hi>Suffo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>k, Robert Bertye,</hi> Esquire, husband to the Dutchess; the Bishops of
<hi>Winchester</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Morison,</hi> Sir <hi>Anthony Cook,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Cheek,</hi>
Dr <hi>Cox,</hi> Dr <hi>Sanays,</hi> and Dr <hi>Grindall,</hi> and divers others, of whom we shall hear
more hereafter on another occasion.</p>
                     <p>Of all these things, they neither were, not could be ignorant in the Court
of <hi>Rome,</hi> to which the death of <hi>Edward</hi> had been swiftly posted on the wings
of fame. The newes of the succession of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> staid not long behind,
so much more welcome to Pope <hi>Julius</hi> 3d. who then held that See, because it
gave him some assurance of his re-admission into the power and jurisdiction of
his predecessors in the Realm of <hi>England.</hi> For what less was to be expected,
considering that she was brought up in the Catholick Religion, interessed in
the respects of her mother, and Cosen in the first degree unto <hi>Charles</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour?
In the pursuance of which hopes, it was resolved that Cardinal <hi>Pole</hi>
should be sent Legate into <hi>England,</hi> who being of the Royal blood, a man of
eminent learning, and exemplary life, was looked on as the fittest instrument
to reduce that Kingdome. The Cardinal well knowing that he stood attainted
by the Lawes of the Land, and that the name of <hi>Henry</hi> was still preserved in
estimation amongst the people; thought it not safe to venture thither, before
he fully understood the state of things. He therefore secretly dispatcheth <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendonius,</hi>
a right trusty Minister, by whom he writes a private Letter to the
Queen. In which commending first her perseverance in Religion in the time
of her troubles, he exhorteth her to a continuance in it in the days of her
happiness. He recommended also to her, the salvation of the souls of her people,
and the restitution of the true worship of God. <hi>Commendonius,</hi> having diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inform'd himself of all particulars, found means of speaking with the Queen.
By whom he understood not only her own good affections to the See Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
but that she was resolved to use her best endeavours for re-establishing
the Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in all her Kingdomes. Which being made
known unto the Cardinal, he puts himself into the voyage. The newes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
being brought to <hi>Charls</hi> (who had his own design apart from that of the
Pope) he signified by <hi>Dandino,</hi> the Pope's <hi>Nuncio</hi> with him; that an Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Legate could not be sent into <hi>England</hi> as affairs then stood, either with
safety to himself, or honour to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and therefore that he
might do well to defer the journy, till the English might be brought to a better
temper.</p>
                     <p>But the Queen knowing nothing of this stop, and being full of expectation
of the Cardinals coming, had called a Parliament to begin on the 10th. of
<hi>October.</hi> In which she made it her first Act, to take away all Statutes passed by
the two last Kings, wherein certain offences had been made High Treason, and
others brought within the compass of a <hi>Premunire.</hi> And this she did, especially
for <hi>Pole</hi>'s security, that neither he by exercising his Authority, nor the Clergy
by submitting to it, might be intangled in the like snares, in which Cardinal
<hi>Wolsie,</hi> and the whole Clergy of his time had before been caught. It was designed
also to rescind all former Statutes which had been made by the said two Kings
against the jurisdiction of the Pope, the Doctrine and Religion of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to reduce all matters Ecclesiastical to the same estate, in which
they stood in the beginning of the Reign of the King her Father. But this was
looked upon by others as too great an enterprise to be attempted by a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
especially in a green estate, and amongst people sensible of those many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
which they enjoyed by shaking off their former vassalage to a forein
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66032:16"/>
power. It was advised therefore to proceed no further at the present, than to
repeal all Acts and Statutes which had been made in derogation to the Doctrine
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of her brother; which being passed in his
minority, when all affairs were carried by faction and strong hand, contrary to
the judgement of the best and soundest part of the Clergy and Laity, might
give a just pretence for their abrogation, till all particulars might be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and debated in a lawful Synod. According to which temperament, the
point was carried, and the Act pass'd no higher than for <hi>Repea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ing certain Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of the time of King</hi> Edward; by which one blow she felled down all which
had been done in the Reformation in seven years before.</p>
                     <p>For by this Act, they took away all former Statutes for Administring the
Communion in both kinds; for establishing the first and second Liturgie; for
confirming the new <hi>Ordinal,</hi> or form of consecrating Archbishops and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> for abrogating certain Fasts and Feastivals which had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
observed; for authorizing the marriage of Priests, and Legitimation of
their children; not to say any thing of that Statute (as not worth the naming)
for making Bishops by the King's Letters Patents, and exercising their Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
jurisdiction in the King's name only. So that upon the matter, not only
all things were reduced to the same estate in which they stood at <hi>Edward</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Crown, but all those Bishops and Priests which had maried by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the former Statutes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were made uncanonical, and consequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to a deprivation. So that for want of Canonical Ordination on the
one side, and under colour of uncanonical Mariages on the other, we shall
presently find such a general remove amongst the Bishops and Clergy, as is not
any where to be parallel'd in so short a time. And because some affronts had
been lately offered to such Priests as had been forward in setting up the Mass
in their several Churches, and that no small danger was incurred by Dr <hi>Bourn</hi>
above mentioned, for a Sermon preached at St <hi>Paul</hi>'s Cross; an Act was pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for the preventing of the like for the time to come, Entituled <hi>An Act
against offenders of Preachers, and other Ministers, in the Church.</hi> Which two
Acts were no sooner passed, but they were seconded by the Queen with two
Proclamations on the 5th. of <hi>December.</hi> By one of which it was declared,
That all Statutes made in the time of the late King <hi>Edward,</hi> which concerned
Religion, were repealed by Parliament; and therefore that the Mass should
be said as formerly, to begin on the 20th of that month: And by the other it
was commanded, that no manner of person from thenceforth, should dare to
disturb the Priests in saying Mass, or executing any other divine Office, under
the pains and penalties therein contained. According unto which appointment,
the Mass was publickly officiated in all parts of the Kingdome, and so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
during the Reign of this Queen, without interruption.</p>
                     <p>There also past another Act, wherein it was Enacted, That the mariage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. and Queen <hi>Katherine</hi> his first wife, should be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitively,
cleerly, and absolutely declared, deemed, adjudged to be, and stand
with God's Laws, and his most Holy word, and to be accepted, reputed and
taken of good effect and validity to all intents and purposes whatsoever;
that the Decree or Sentence of Divorce heretofore passed between the said
King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, and the said Queen, by <hi>Thomas Cranmer</hi> Archbishop of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> should be deemed, taken, and reputed to be void and null; with a
repeal of all such Statutes or Acts of Parliament, in which the Queen had been
declared to be illegitimate. The making of which Act, as it did much conduce
to the establishment of the Queen's estate; so did it tacitly and implicitly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlege
the supremacy to be in the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> which could not be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
explicitly and in terms expresse, as affairs then stood. For since the mariage
neither was nor could be reputed valid, but by the dispensation of Pope <hi>Julius</hi>
the 2d. the declaration of the goodness and validity of it, did consequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Popes authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from which that dispensation issued. And therefore it
was well observed by the Author of the <hi>History</hi> of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> that it
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66032:16"/>
seemed ridiculous in the English Nobility, to oppose the restitution of the
Popes supremacy, when it was propounded to them by the Queen in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Session; considering that the yielding <hi>to this demand was virtually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in their assent to the Mariage.</hi> There also past another Act, in which there
was a clause for the invalidating of all such Commissions, as had been granted
in the time of the late Queen <hi>Jane;</hi> and one in confirmation of the attainders
of the late Duke of <hi>Northumberland, Thomas</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> &amp;c.
Which shews, that there was somewhat in the said proceedings not so cleer in
Law, but that there seem'd necessity of calling in the Legislative power to
confirm the same, for the indempnity of those who had acted in them. Toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with this Parliament, the Queen was pleased to summon a Convocation,
to the end that all matters of Religion might be first debated and concluded in
a Synodical way, before they were offered to the consideration of the other
Assembly. In the writs of which summons, she retained the Title of Supream
Head on earth of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. the want whereof in those of
the present Parliament, occasioned a dispute amongst some of the members,
Whether they might lawfully proceed or not, in such publick businesses as were
to be propounded to them in that Session. Archbishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
imprisoned in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and was detained there all the time of
this Convocation, so that he could not do that service to God and the
Church, which his place required. This took for a sufficient ground to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far
the Presidentship of the Convocation upon <hi>Bonner</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> privileged in
respect of his See, to preside in all such Provincial Synods, which were either
held during the vacancy of the See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> or in the necessary absence
of the <hi>Metropolitan.</hi> The lower house of the Clergy also, was fitted with a
Prolocutor, of the same affections, Dr <hi>Hugh Weston,</hi> then newly substituted
Dean of <hi>Westminster</hi> in the place of <hi>Cox,</hi> being elected to that Office. On
<hi>Wednesday</hi> the 18th. of <hi>October,</hi> it was signified by the Prolocutor, that it was
the Queens pleasure, that they of the House should debate of matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and proceed to the making of such constitutions as should be found ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
in that case. But there was no equality in number between the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and reason was of no authority where the major part had formerly resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
upon the points. So partially had the elections been returned from the
several Diocesses, that we find none of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Clergy amongst the
Clerks; and such an alteration had been made in the Deans and Dignitaries,
that we find but six of that ranck neither to have suffrage in it, that is to say,
<hi>James Haddon</hi> Dean of <hi>Exeter, Walter Philips</hi> Dean of <hi>Rochester, John Philpot</hi>
Arch Deacon of <hi>Winchester, John Elmer</hi> Arch Deacon of <hi>Stow,</hi> in the Diocess of
<hi>Lincoln, Richard Cheny</hi> Arch Deacon of <hi>Hereford.</hi> One more I find, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any name, in the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> who joined himself to the other five in the
disputation. Nor would the Prolocutor admit of more, though earnestly
desired by <hi>Philpot,</hi> that some of the Divines which had the passing of the Book
of Articles in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time, might be associated with them in the defence
thereof.</p>
                     <p>Which motion he the rather made, because one of the points proposed by the
Prolocutor, related to a Catechism set forth in the said Kings time, intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to the said Convocation in the year 1552. Of which it was to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
whether or no it was the work of that Convocation. But that matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
passed lightly over, the main point in debate concerned the manner of
<q>Christs presence in the blessed Sacrament. It was not denied by <hi>Philpot,</hi> and
the rest of the Protestant party, that Christ was present in his Sacrament,
rightly ministred according to his institution, but only that he was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
after the gross and carnal manner, which they of the Popish party had
before subscribed to.</q> Six days the disputation lasted, but to little purpose;
for on the one side it was said by <hi>Weston</hi> and his associates, that their adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
were sufficiently confuted, and all their Arguments fully answered. And
on the other side it was affirmed by the Divines of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time, that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:66032:17"/>
neither any satisfaction had been given to their Arguments, nor that any right
judgement could be made in the points disputed, where the adverse party late
as Judges in their own concernments. Many checks had been given by <hi>Weston</hi>
to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ix Divines, but especially to the Arch-Deacon of <hi>Winchester;</hi> and there
was much disorder otherwise in the disputation (though certain great Lords
were present at it) which hindered it from producing any good effect. So that
being weary at the last of their own confusions, it was thought fit to put an
end to the dispute. Which <hi>Weston</hi> did accordingly in these following words.
It is not (saith he) the Queens pleasure that we should spend any longer time
in these debates, and ye are well enough already, <hi>For you</hi> (saith he) <hi>have the
Word, and we have the Sword.</hi> So powerful is the truth, that may times it will
find some means to vent it self, when we least intend it, and sometimes also
when we most labour to suppress it.</p>
                     <p>The Parliament and Convocation had thus concluded on the point, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
question would be made, but that such Bishops as disliked the alterations
in the time of King <hi>Edward,</hi> will be sufficiently active in advancing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults
of both. But <hi>Bonner</hi> will not stay so long; he is resolved to go along
with the Parliament, if not before it. For after the ending of the Even song
on St. <hi>Katherine</hi>'s day, before the consultations of the Parliament had been
confirmed by the Royal assent, he caused the Quire of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s to go about
the steeple, singing with lights after the old custome. And on St <hi>Andrew</hi>'s
day next following, he began the Procession in Latine, himself, with many
Parsons and Curates, and the whole Quire, together with the Lord Mayor,
and divers of the Aldermen, the Prebends of the Church attired in their old
<hi>gray Amises</hi> (as they used to call them) in which manner they continued it for
three dayes after. In setting up the Mass, with all the Pomps and Rites there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
at the time appointed, it is not to be thought that he could be backward,
who shewed himself so forward in the rest of his actings. And therefore it can
be no news to hear that on the 14th. of <hi>January,</hi> he restored the solemn <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days
Procession</hi> about the Church, with the Mayor and Aldermen in their
Clokes; the Preacher taking his benediction in the midst of the Church, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ancient custome; or that he should send out his Mandates to
all Parsons and Curates within his Diocess, for taking the names of all such as
would not come the Lent following to Auricular confession, and receive at
<hi>Easter;</hi> or finally, that he should issue out the like commands to all Priests
and Curates, which lived within the compass of his jurisdiction, for the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
of such Paintings and Sentences of holy Scripture, as had been pensiled
on the Church walls, in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s dayes. He knew full well, that as the
actions of the Mother Church would easily become exemplary to the rest of the
City, so the proceedings of that City, and the parts about it, would in time
give the law to the rest of the Kingdom; and that there was no speedier way
to advance a general conformity over all the Kingdom, than to take begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at the head, from whence both sence and motion is derived to the rest of
the body. Which makes it seem the greater wonder, that he should be so back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in advancing Images (if at the least his actings in that kind have not been
misplaced) as not to go about it till the year next following; unless it were
that he began to be so wise as to stay until the Queen's affairs were better set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
But no sooner was her marriage past, when we find him at it. For having
by that time prepared a fair and large Image of our Saviour, which they called
the <hi>Rood,</hi> he caused it to be laid along upon the pavement of St <hi>Paul</hi>'s Quire,
and all the doors of the Church to be kept close shut, whilst he together with
the Prebends, sung and said divers prayers by it. Which done, they anointed
it with oyl in divers places, and after the anointing of it, crept unto it, and
kissed it, and after weighed it up, and set it in its accustomed place; the whole
quire in the mean time singing <hi>Te Deum,</hi> and the bels publishing their joy at
the end of the Pageant. After which a command is given to Dr <hi>Story</hi> (who
was then Chancellor of his Diocess, and afterwards a most active instrument in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66032:17"/>
all his butcheries) to visit every Parish Church in <hi>London</hi> and Middlesex, to
see their <hi>Rood lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ts</hi> repaired, and the Images of the Crucifix with Mary and
<hi>John</hi> to be placed on them.</p>
                     <p>But it is time that we return to the former Parliament; during the sitting
whereof, the Queen had been desired to mary, and three husbands had been
nominated of several qualities, that she might please her self in the choice of
one. That is to say, <hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>Courtney,</hi> whom she had lately restored to
the Title of Earl of <hi>Devon, Reginald Pole,</hi> a Cardinal of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
descended from <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence;</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> the eldest son of <hi>Charles</hi>
the Emperour. It is affirmed, that she had carried some good affections to the
Earl of <hi>Devonshire,</hi> ever since she first saw him in the Tower, as being of a
lovely personage and Royal extraction, the Grandson of a Daughter of King
<hi>Edward</hi> the 4th. But he being sounded afar off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had declined the matter. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which there goes a story, that the young Earl pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>itioning her for leave
to travel, she advised him to mary and stay at home, assuring him that no Lady
in the land how high soever, would refuse to accept him for an husband. By
which words though she pointed out her self unto him, as plainly as might ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
stand with the Modesty or Majesty of a Maiden Queen; Yet the young
Gentleman not daring to look so high as a Crown, or being better affected to
the person of the Princess <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> desired the Queen to give him leave to
mary her sister. Which gave the Queen so much displeasure, that she looked
with an evil eye upon them both for ever after; upon the Earl for not accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that love which she seemed to offer, and on her sister as her Rival in the
Earls affections. It was supposed also, that she might have some inclinations
to Cardinal <hi>Pole,</hi> as having been brought up with him in the house of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the late Countess of <hi>Salisbury.</hi> But against him it was objected, that he
began to grow in years, and was so given unto his book, that he seemed fitter
for a Coul than to wear a Crown; that he had few dependances at home, and
fewer alliances abroad; and that the Queen's affairs did require a man both
stout and active, well back'd with friends, and able at all points to carry on the
great concernments of the Kingdom. And then what fitter husband <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ould be
found out for her, than <hi>Philip</hi> Prince of <hi>Spain?</hi> A Prince in the verdure of his
years, and eldest son to the most Mighty Emperour, <hi>Charles</hi> the 5th. by whom
the <hi>Netherlands</hi> being laid to <hi>England,</hi> and both secured by the assistance and
power of <hi>Spain,</hi> this nation might be render'd more considerable both by sea
and land, than any people in the world.</p>
                     <p>To this last Match the Queen was carefully sollicited by the Bishop of
<hi>Winchester,</hi> who neither loved the person of <hi>Pole,</hi> nor desired his company, for
fear of growing less in power and reputation, by coming under the command of
a Cardinal Legate. To which end he encouraged <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour to go
on with this mariage for his son; not without some secret intimation on his
Advice, for not suffering <hi>Pole</hi> to come into <hi>England</hi> (if he were suffered to
come at all) till the Treaty were concluded, and the Match agreed on. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
whereunto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lord <hi>Lamoralle</hi> Earl of <hi>Edgmond, Charles</hi> Earl of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi>

from the Emperour. In the beginning of <hi>January</hi> they began to treat
upon the mariage,<note place="margin">1553/4;.</note> which they found so well prepared before their coming,
that in short time it was accorded upon these conditions. <q>1. That it
should be lawful for <hi>Philip</hi> to assume the Title of all the Kingdoms and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
belonging to his wife, and should be joint Governour with her over
those Kingdoms; the Privileges and Customes thereof always preserved
inviolate, and the full and free distribution of Bishopricks, Benefices, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
and Offices, alwayes remaining intire in the Queen. 2. That the
Queen should also carry the Titles of all those Realms, into which <hi>Philip</hi>
either then was, or should be afterwards invested. 3. That if the Queen sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
<hi>Philip,</hi> 60 thousand pounds <hi>per annum</hi> should be assigned to her for
her joynture, as had been formerly assigned to the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> Sister to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:66032:18"/>
King <hi>Edward</hi> the 4th. and Wife to <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">An. Reg. Mar. 1. 1553/4;.</note> That the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
begotten by this mariage, should succeed in all the Queens Dominions, as
also in the Dukedom and County of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and all those Provinces in the
<hi>Neatherlands,</hi> of which the Emperour was possessed. 5. That if none but
daughters should proceed from this mariage, the eldest should succeed in
all the said Provinces of the <hi>Neatherlands,</hi> provided that by the Counsel and
consent of <hi>Charles</hi> (the son of <hi>Philip,</hi> by <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Portugal</hi> his first wife) she
should make choice of a husband out of <hi>England</hi> or the <hi>Neatherlands,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
to be deprived of her right in the succession in the said estates, and
<hi>Charles</hi> to be invested in them; and in that cafe convenient portions to be
made for her and the rest of the daughters. 6. And finally, That if the said
<hi>Charles</hi> should depart this life without lawful issue, that then the Heir
surviving of this mariage, though female only, should succeed in all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of <hi>Spain,</hi> together with all the Dominions and Estates of <hi>Italy</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
belonging.</q> Conditions fair and large enough, and more to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> than the Crown of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But so it was not understood by the generality of the people of <hi>England,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of which out of a restless disposition, or otherwise desirous to restore the
reformed Religion, had caused it to be noised abroad, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were by
this accord, to become the absolute Lords of all the Kingdom; that they were
to have the managing of all affairs; and that abolishing all the ancient Laws
of the Realm, they would impose upon the land a most intolerable yoke of
servitude, as a conquered Nation. Which either being certainly known, or
probably suspected by the Queen and the Council, it was thought fit that the
Lord Chancelor should make a true and perfect declaration of all the points of
the Agreement, not only in the Presence Chamber to such Lords and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
as were at that time about the Court and the City of <hi>London;</hi> but also
to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, and certain of the chief Commoners of that
City, purposely sent for to the Court upon the occasion: Which services he
perform'd on the 14th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 15th. days of <hi>January.</hi> And having summarily
reported all the Articles of the capitulation, he shewed unto them how much
they were bound to thank God, <hi>That such a Noble, Worthy, and Famous Prince,
would vonchsafe so to humble himself, as in this mariage to take upon him rather
as a subject than otherwise. Considering that the Queen and her Council were to
Rule and Govern all things as they did before; and that none of the</hi> Spaniards <hi>or
other strangers, were to be of the Council, nor to have the custody of any Castles,
Forts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>nor to have any office in the Queen's house, or elsewhere throughout the
Kingdom.</hi> In which respect it was the Queens request to the Lords and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
<hi>That for her sake they would most lovingly receive the said Prince with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>oy
and honour:</hi> and to the Lord Mayor and the Citizens, <hi>That they would behave
themselves to be good subjects with all humility and rejoycing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which declaration notwithstanding, the subjects were not easily satisfied
in those fears and jealousies, which cunningly had been infused into them by
some popular spirits, who greedily affected a change of Government; and to
that end sowed divers other discontents amongst the people. To some they
secretly complained, <q>That the Queen had broke her promise to the <hi>Suffolk</hi>
men, in suppressing the Religion setled by King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th. to others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
That the mariage with the Prince of <hi>Spain,</hi> was but the introduction to a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
vassalage to the Popes of <hi>Rome;</hi> sometimes they pitied the calamity of
the Lady <hi>Jane,</hi> not only forcibly deposed, but barbarously condemned to a
cruel death; and sometimes magnified the eminent vertues of the Princess
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as the only blessing of the Kingdom;</q> and by those Articles, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
the people in most places for the act of Rebellion. And that it might
succeed the better, nothing must be pretended but the preservation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of their Civil Liberties, which they knew was generally like to take
both with Papists and Protestants; but so that they had many engines to draw
such others to the side, as either were considerable for power or quality. The
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:66032:18"/>
Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> was hooked in, upon the promise of re-establishing his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the Royal throne; the <hi>Carews,</hi> and other Gentlemen of <hi>Devonshire,</hi> upon
assurance of marying the Lord <hi>Courtney</hi> to the Princess <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and setting
the Crown upon their heads; and all they that wished well to the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
upon the like hopes of restoring that Religion which had been setled by
the care and piety of the good King <hi>Edward,</hi> but now suppressed, contrary to
all faith the promise, by the Quee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and her Ministers. By means of which
suggestions and subtil practices, the contagion was so generally diffused over
all the Kingdom, that if it had not accidently broke out before the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by them, it was conceived by many wise and knowing men, that the
danger might have proved far greater, the disease incurable.</p>
                     <p>For so it hapned, that the <hi>Carews</hi> conceiving that the deferring of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the plot thus laid, might prove destructive to that cause, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
fatally thrust on by their own ill destiny, began to leavy men in <hi>Cornwal,</hi>
which could not be so closely carried, but that their purpose was discovered,
and the chief of them forced to flye the Kingdom. The news whereof gave
such an allarum to the confederates, that they shewed themselves in several
places before the people were prepared and made ready for them. Insomuch,
that the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> together with the Lord <hi>Thomas Gray,</hi> and the Lord
<hi>Leonard Gray,</hi> having made Proclamation in divers places on the 25th. of that
month, against the Queens intended mariage with the Prince of <hi>Spain,</hi> and
finding that the people came not in so fast unto them as they did expect, were
forced to dismiss their slender company, and shift for themselves, upon the first
news that the Earl of <hi>Huntington</hi> was coming toward them with 300 horse.
An action very unfortunate to himself and to all his family. For first, The
Queen finding that she was to expect no peace or quiet as long as the Lady
<hi>Jane</hi> was suffered to remain alive, caused her and the Lord <hi>Guilford
Dudley,</hi> to be openly executed on the 12th. of <hi>February</hi> then next following. His daughter
<hi>Katherine</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ormerly maried to <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> eldest son to the Earl of
<hi>Pembrook,</hi> (but the mariage by reason of her tender years, not coming unto a
Consummation by carnal knowlege) was by him repudiated and cast off, and a
mariage presently made betwixt him and another <hi>Katherine,</hi> a daughter of
<hi>George</hi> Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury.</hi> His brothers, <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> committed priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to the Tower; of which two, <hi>Thomas</hi> suffered death about two months
after. And for himself, being compelled to hide his head in the house of one
<hi>Underwood,</hi> whom he had preferred unto the keeping of one of his Parks, he was
by him most basely and treacherously betrayed to the said Earl of <hi>Huntington,</hi>
on the 11th. of <hi>February.</hi> Arrained on the 17th. of the same month, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed
on the 23d.</p>
                     <p>Nor fared it better with the rest, though they of <hi>Kent,</hi> conducted by Sir
<hi>Thomas Wiat</hi> (the chief contriver of the plot) were suddenly grown conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
for their number, and quickly formidable for their power. The newes
of whose rising being swiftly posted to the Court, the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> was
appointed to go against him, attended with few more than the Queen's ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Guards, and followed by 500 <hi>Londoners</hi> newly raised, and sent by water to
<hi>Graves</hi> End, under the charge of Captain <hi>Alexander Bret.</hi> With which few
forces he intended to assault the Rebels, who had put themselves into <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
Castle, and fortified the bridge with some pieces of Canon. But being
ready to fall on, <hi>Bret</hi> with his <hi>Londoners</hi> fell off to <hi>Wiat,</hi> and so necessitated
the old Duke to return to <hi>London</hi> in great haste, accompanied by the Earl of
<hi>Arundel</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Gerningham,</hi> with some few of their horse, leaving
their foot, eight pieces of Canon, and all their ammunition belonging to them,
in the power of the enemy. This brings the Queen to the Guild Hall in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
on the first of <hi>February,</hi> where she finds the Lord Mayor, the Aldermen,
and many of the chief Citizens in their several Liveries. To whom she signified,
<q>That she never did intend to marry, but on such conditions, as in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her Council should be found honourable to the Realm, and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:66032:19"/>
ble to her subjects; that therefore they should give no credit to those many
calumnies, which <hi>Wiat</hi> and his accomplices, who according to the guise of
Rebels, had purposely dispersed to defame both her and her government; but
rather that they should contribute their best assistance for the suppressing of
those, who contrary to their duty, were in arms against her.</q> And though she
had as good as she brought, that is to say, fair promises for her gracious words;

proved best for her preservation. For had she trusted to the City, she had been

were finely feasted by the people. But when he hoped to have found the way
open to the rest of the City, he found the draw-Bridge to be cut down, the
bridge-Gate to be shut, and the Ordinance of the Tower to be bent against him,
by the appointment and direction of the Lord Lieutenant. Two dayes he tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled
out in <hi>Southwark</hi> to no purpose at all, more than the sacking of <hi>Winchester</hi>
House, and the defacing of the Bishops Library there, unless it were to leave
a document to posterity, that God infatuates the Counsels of those wretched
men, who traiterously take up arms against their Princes. And having liberally
bestowed these two dayes upon the Queen, the better to enable her to provide
for her safety, he wheels about on Sunday the 6th. of the same month to <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi>
bridge. And though the bridge was broken down before his coming, and
that the opposite shore was guarded by 200. men, yet did he use such diligence,
that he removed away those forces, repaired the bridge, past over both his men
and Canon, and might in probability have surprised both the Court and City
in the dead of the night, if the same spirit of infatuation had not rested on him.
For having marched beyond <hi>Brainford</hi> in the way towards <hi>London,</hi> without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
or taking the allarum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it hapned that one of his great piecs was dismoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the breach of its wheels. In the mending and mounting whereof, he
obstinately wasted so much time, notwithstanding all the perswasions which his
friends could make unto him, that many of his men slipped from him, and some
gave notice to the Court, not only of his near approach, but also what his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
was, and what had hindred him from putting it in execution. On this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisment

(when it was too late for his intendments) he found the Gates fast shut against

when he was before in <hi>Southwark.</hi> So that being hemmed in on both sides with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

the Court, from thence committed to the Tower, arraigned at <hi>Westminster</hi> on

                     <p>It can not be denied but that the restitution of the Reformed Religion,
was the matter principally aimed at in this Rebellion, through nothing but the
Match with <hi>Spain</hi> appeared on the outside of it. Which appears plainly by a
Book writ by <hi>Christopher Goodman</hi> (associated with <hi>John Knox,</hi> for setting up
Presbytery and Rebellion in the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi>) in which he takes upon him
to shew <hi>How far Superio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Gospel, to have risen with him for maintenance of the same. His
cause was just, and they were all Traytors that took not part with him. O

                           </hi> thou art now with God, and those worthy men that dyed in
that happy enterprise.</q> But this Book was written at <hi>Geneva,</hi> where <hi>Calvin</hi>
reigned. To whom no pamphlet could be more agreeable, than such as did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
this Queen; whom in his Comment upon <hi>Amoz,</hi> he entituleth by
the name of <hi>Porserpine,</hi> and saith, that she exceeded in her cruelties all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
in hell. Much more it is to be admired, that Dr <hi>John Poynct,</hi> the late Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Winchester,</hi> should be of Counsel in the plot, or put himself into
their Camp, and attend them unto the place where the carriage brake. Where
when he could not work on <hi>Wiat</hi> to desist from that unprofitable labour in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting
the Cannon, he counselled <hi>Vauham, Bret,</hi> and others, to shift for
themselves, took leave of his more secret friends, told them that he would
pray for their good success, and so departed and took ship for <hi>Germany,</hi> where
he after died.</p>
                     <p>The fortunate suppressing of these insurrections, secured the Queen from
any fear of the like dangers for the present. And thereupon it was advised to
make use of the opportunity for putting the Church into a posture, when the
spirits of the opposite party were so crush'd and broken, that no resistance
could be looked for. Articles therefore are sent into every Diocess, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:66032:20"/>
proceedings,<note place="margin">An. Reg. Mar. 1. 1554.</note> were startled more than ever at the noise of these Articles; none
more exasperated than those whose either hands or hearts had been joyned
with <hi>Wiat.</hi> But not being able to prevail by open army, a new device is found
out to befool the people, and bring them to a misconceit of the present go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
A young maid called <hi>Elizabeth Crofts,</hi> about the age of eighteen
years, was tutored to counterfeit certain speeches in the wall of a house not
far from <hi>Aldersgate,</hi> where she was heard of many, but seen of none, and that
her voice might be conceived to have somewhat in it more than ordinary, a
strange whistle was devised for her, out of which her words proceeded in such
a tone, as seemed to have nothing mortal in it. And thereupon it was affirmed
by some of the people (great multitudes whereof resorted dayly to the place)
that it was an Angel, or at least a voice from Heaven, by others, that it could
be nothing but the Holy Ghost; but generally she pass'd by the name of the
<hi>Spirit in the wall.</hi> For the interpreting of whose words, there wanted not some
of the confederates, who mingled themselves by turns amongst the rest of the
people, and taking on them to expound what the Spirit said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> delivered many
dangerous and seditious words against the Queen, her mariage with the Prince
of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Mass, Confession, and the like. The practice was first set on
foot on the 14th. of <hi>March,</hi> which was within ten days after the publishing
of the Articles, and for a while it went on fortunately enough, according to
the purpose of the chief contrivers. But the abuse being searched into, and
the plot discovered, the wench was ordered to stand upon a scaffold neer St
<hi>Paul</hi>'s Cross, on the 15th. of <hi>July,</hi> there to abide during the time of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and that being done, to make a publick declaration of that lewd impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture.
Let not the Papists be from henceforth charged with <hi>Elizabeth Barton</hi>
whom they called the Holy made of <hi>Kent;</hi> since now the <hi>Zuinglian Gospellers,</hi>
(for I cannot but consider this as a plot of theirs) have raised up their <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
Crofts,</hi> whom they called the Spirit in the wall, to draw aside the people
from their due Allegiance.</p>

                        <hi>Wiat</hi>'s Rebellion being quenched,<note place="margin">1554.</note> and the Realm in a condition capable of
holding a Parliament, the Queen Convenes her Lords and Commons on the
2d. of <hi>April,</hi> in which Session the Queens mariage with the Prince of <hi>Spain,</hi>
being offered unto consideration, was finally concluded and agreed unto upon
these conditions, that is to say, <q>That <hi>Philip</hi> should not advance any to any
publick office or dignity in <hi>England,</hi> but such as were Natives of the Realm,
and the Queens subjects. That he should admit of a set number of <hi>English</hi>
in his houshold, whom he should use respectively, and not suffer them to be
injured by foreiners. That he should not transport the Queen out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
but at her intreaty, nor any of the issue begotten by her, who should
have their education in this Realm, and should not be suffered but upon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
and good reasons, to go out of the same, not then neither but with the
consent of the <hi>English.</hi> That the Queen deceasing without children, <hi>Philip</hi>
should not make any claim to the Kingdom, but should leave it freely to
him to whom of right it should belong. That he should not change any
thing in the Lawes, either publick or private, nor the immunities and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
of the Realm, but should be bound by oath to confirm and keep
them. That he should not transport any Jewels, nor any part of the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drobe,

should not any way derogate from the League lately concluded between
the Queen, and the King of <hi>France,</hi> but that the peace between the <hi>English</hi> and

make the English sensible of the benefits which they were to partake of by
this Marriage, and to engratiate himself with the Nobility and People in all

brought unto the Court, where having obtained the leave to travell, for which
before he had petitioned in vain, he pass'd the Seas, cross'd <hi>France,</hi> and came
into <hi>Italy;</hi> but he found the air of <hi>Italy</hi> as much too hot for him, as that of
<hi>England</hi> was too cold, dying at <hi>Padua</hi> in the year 1556. the eleventh and last
Earl of <hi>Devonshire,</hi> of that noble Family. About ten days after his enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
followed that of the Princesse <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whose comming to the Court,
her entertainment with the Queen, and what else followed thereup on, we
shall see hereafter.</p>
                     <p>But we have run our selves too far upon these occasions, and therefore
must look back again on that which followed more immediately on the Kings
reception; the celebrating of whose Marriage opened a fair way for the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
comming, so long expected by the Queen, and delayed by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
by whom retarded for a while when he was in <hi>Italy,</hi> and openly detained
at <hi>Dilling,</hi> a Town in <hi>Germany,</hi> as he was upon his way towards <hi>England.</hi> From
thence he writes his Letters of Expostulation, representing to the Emperor
the great scandal which must needs be given to the Churches enemies, in
detaining a Cardinal-Legat, Commissioned by his Holinesse for the peace of
Christendom, and the regaining of a Kingdom. Which notwithstanding, there
he stayeth, till the Articles of the Marriage were agreed on by the Queen's
Commissioners, and is then suffered to advance as far as <hi>Brussells,</hi> upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that he should not passe over into <hi>England</hi> till the consummation of
the Marriage. The Interim he spends in managing a Treaty of Peace betwixt
the <hi>Emperour</hi> and the <hi>French;</hi> which sorted to no other effect, but onely to the
setting forth of his dexterity in all publick businesses. And now the Marriage
being past, the Emperour is desired to give him leave to come for <hi>England;</hi> and
<hi>Pole</hi> is called upon by Letters from the King and Queen to make haste unto
them, that they might have his presence and assistance in the following Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
and in the mean time, that they might advise upon such particulars
as were to be agreed on, for the honour and advantage of the See <hi>Apostolick.</hi>
Upon the Emperor's dismission he repairs to <hi>Calais,</hi> but was detained by cross
winds till the 24 th. of <hi>November;</hi> at which time we shall find the Parliament
sitting, and much of the businesse dispatched to his hand in which he was to
have been advised with.</p>
                     <p>The businesse then to be dispatched was of no small moment, no lesse than
the restoring of the Popes to the Supremacy, of which they had been disposses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> For smoothing the way to which great work,
it was thought necessary to fill up all Episcopall Sees, which either Death or
Deprivation had of late made vacant. <hi>Holgate</hi> Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> had been
committed to the <hi>Tower</hi> on the 4 th. of <hi>October, Anno</hi> 1553. from whence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased

King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, <hi>Anno</hi> 1534. and having spent the intervening twenty
years in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> returned a true servant to the Pope, every way

Reader in <hi>Paris</hi> in the time of King <hi>Francis,</hi> was consecrated Bishop of that
Church; a man of better parts, but of a more inflexible temper than his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor.</p>
                     <p>And now the Parliament begins, opened upon the 11 th. of <hi>November,</hi> and
closed on the 16 th. of <hi>January</hi> then next following. It had been offered to
consideration in the former Session, That all Acts made against the Pope in the
Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> might be declared null and void, for the better encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of the Cardinal to come amongst us. But the Queen had neither
eloquence enough to perswade, nor power enough to awe the Parliament, to
that Concession: Nothing more hindred the designe than general fear, that
if the Popes were one restored to their former power, the Church might
challenge restitution of her former possessions; Do but secure them from
that fear, then Pope and Cardinals might come and welcome. And to secure
them from that fear, they had not onely the promise of the King and Queen,
but some assurance underhand from the Cardinal-Legat, who knew right
well, that the Church Lands had been so chopped and changed by the two
last Kings, as not to be restored without the manifest ruine of many of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
and most of the Gentry, who were invested in the same. Secured on
both sides, they proceed according to the King's desires, and passe a general
Act for the repealing of all Statutes, which had been made against the Power
and Jurisdiction of the Popes of <hi>Rome.</hi> But first they are to be intreated to it
by the Legate himself; for the opening a way to whose reception, they prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a Bill, by which he was to be discharged of the Attainture which had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
upon him in the year 1539. restored in Blood, and rendred capable of
enjoying all those Rights and Privileges, which formerly he stood possessed
of in this Kingdom. For the passing of which Bill into Act, the King and
Queen vouchsafed their presence, as soon as it was fitted and prepared
for them, not staying till the end of the Session as at other times, because the
businesse might not suffer such a long delay.</p>
                     <p>It was upon the 24 th. of <hi>November</hi> that the Cardinal came first to <hi>London,</hi>
and had his Lodgings in or near the Court, till <hi>Lambeth</hi> -house could be made
ready to receive him. Having reposed himself for a day or two, the Lords
and Commons are required to attend their Majesties at the Court, where the
Cardinal, in a very grave and eloquent speech, first, gave them thanks for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
restored unto his Country; in recompence whereof he told them, that he
was come to restore them to the Country and Court of Heaven, from which,
by their departing from the Church, they had been estranged. He therefore
earnestly exhorts them to acknowledge their errors, and cheerfully to receive
that benefit which Christ was ready by his Vicar to extend unto them. His
Speech is said to have been long and artificial, but it concluded to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
That he had the Keys to open them a way into the Church, which they
had shut against themselves, by making so many Laws, to the dishonour and
reproach of the See Apostolick; on the revoking of which Laws, they should
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ind him ready to make use of his Keys, in opening the doors of the Church
unto them. It was concluded hereupon by both Houses of Parliament, that
a Petition should be made in the name of the Kingdom, wherein should be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66032:23"/>
declared how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>orry they were, that they had withdrawn their obedience from
the Apostolick See, and consenting to the Statutes made against it; promising
to do their best endeavour hereafter, that the said Laws and Statutes should
be repealed; and beseeching the King and Queen to intercede for them with
his Holiness, that they may be absolved from the Crimes and Censures, and
be received as penitent children into the bosom of the Church.</p>
                     <p>These things being thus resolved upon, both Houses are called again to the
Court on St. <hi>Andrews</hi> day; where being assembled in the presence of the
King and Queen, they were asked by the Lord Chancellor <hi>Gardiner,</hi> whether
they were pleased, that Pardon should be demanded of the Legat, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they would return to the Unity of the Church, and Obedience of the
Pope, Supream Head thereof. To which, when some cryed Yea, and the rest
said nothing, their silence was taken for consent; and so the Petition was
presented to their Majesties in the name of the Parliament. Which being
publickly read, they arose, with a purpose to have moved the Cardinal in it;
who meeting their desires, declared his readinesse in giving them that satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
which they would have craved. And having caused the Authority gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him by the Pope to be publickly read, he showed how acceptable the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
of a s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nner was in the sight of God, and that the very Angels in
Heaven rejoyced at the conversion of this Kingdom. Which said, they all
kneeled upon their knees, and imploring the mercy of God, received absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for themselves and the rest of the Kingdom; which Absolution was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
in these following words:</p>
                     <p>Our Lord Jesus Christ, which with his most precious blood hath redeemed and
wash'd u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> from all our sins and iniquities, that he might purchase unto himself a
glorious Spouse, without spot or wrinckle; and whom the Father hath appointed
Head over all his Church, He by his mercy absolve you. And we by Apostolick
Authority given unto us (by the most holy Lord Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the 3<hi>d</hi> his Vicegerent
here on earth) do absolve, and deliver you, and every of you, with the whole Realm
and the Dominions thereof, from all Heresie and Schism, and from all and every
Judgment, Censures and Pains, for that cause incurred. And also we do restore
you again unto the unity of our Mother, the holy Church, as in our Letters more
plainly it shall appear; In the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.</p>
                     <p>Which words of his being seconded with a loud <hi>Amen</hi> by such as were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
he concluded the days work with a solemn Procession to the Chapel,
for rendring Prayers and Thanks to Almighty God. And because this great
work was wrought on St. <hi>Andrews</hi> day, the Cardinal procured a Decree or
Canon to be made in the Convocation of the Bishops and Clergy, that from
thenceforth the Feast of St. <hi>Andrew</hi> should be kept in the Church of <hi>England</hi>
for a <hi>Majus Duplex,</hi> as the <hi>Rituals</hi> call it, and celebrated with as much so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
as any other in the year. It was thought fit also, that the actions of
the day should be communicated on the <hi>Sunday</hi> following, being the second
of <hi>December,</hi> at St. <hi>Paul's Crosse,</hi> in the hearing of the Lord Mayor, Aldermen,
and the rest of the City. According to which appointment, the Cardinal
went from <hi>Lambeth</hi> by water, and landing at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Wharf, from thence
proceeded to the Church, with a Cross, two Pillars, and two Pole-axes of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
born before him. Received by the Lord Chancellor with a solemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>arried till the King came from <hi>Westminster;</hi> Immediately upon
whose comming, the Lord Chancellor went into the Pulpit, and preached up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on those words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 13. <hi>Fratres, scientes quia hora est jam nos de
somno surger<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, &amp;c.</hi> In which Sermon he declared what had been done on the
<hi>Friday</hi> before, in the submission which was made to the Pope by the Lords and
Commons, in the name of themselves and the whole Kingdom; and the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
granted to them by the Cardinal in the name of the Pope. Which
done, and Praiers being made for the whole Estate
of the Catholick Church,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:66032:23"/>
the company was for that time dismissed. And on the <hi>Thursday</hi> after, being
the Feast of St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> day, the Bishops and Clergy then assembled in their
Convocation, presented themselves before the Cardinal at <hi>Lamboth,</hi> and
kneeling reverently on their knees, they obtained pardon for all their Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
Schisms, and Heresies: From which a formal Absolution was pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
also, that so all sorts of people might partake of the Pope's Benediction,
and thereby testifie their obedience and submission to him. The news whereof
being speedily posted over to the Pope, he caused not onely many solemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
to be made in <hi>Rome,</hi> and most parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> but proclaimed a Jubile
to be held on the 24th. of <hi>December</hi> then next comming. For the anticipating
of which solemnity, he alleged this reason, That it became him to imitate
the father of the Prodigal child; and having received his lost son, not onely to
expresse a domestical joy, but to invite all others to partake thereof.</p>
                     <p>During this Parliament was held a Convocation also, as before was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated,
<hi>Bonner</hi> continuing President of it, and <hi>Henry Cole,</hi> Archdeacon of
<hi>Ely,</hi> admitted to the office of Prolocutor. They knew well how the Cards
were plaid, and that the Cardinal was to be entreated not to insist on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
of Church Lands, rather to confirm the Lords and Gentry in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
possessions. And to that end, a Petition is prepared to be presented in the
name of the Convocation, to both their Majesties, that they would please to
intercede with the Cardinal in it. Which Petition being not easie to be met
withall, and never printed heretofore, is here subjoyned, according to the
tenour and effect thereof in the Latine Tougne.</p>
                     <p>WE the Bishops and Clergy of the Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> assembled in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
during the sitting of this Parliament, according to the antient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
with all due reverence and humility do make known to your Majesties, That
though we are appointed to take upon us the care and charge of all those Churches,
in which we are placed as Bishops, Deans, Archdeacons, Parsons, or Vicars; as also
of the Souls therein committed to us, together with all Goods, Rights and Privileges
thereunto belonging, according to the true intent and meaning of the Canons made
in that behalf; and that in this respect we are bound to use all lawfull means for the
recovery of those Goods, Rights, Privileges, and Jurisdictions, which have been
lost in the late desperate and pernicious Schism, and to regain the same unto the
Church, as in her first and right estate; Yet notwithstanding, having took mature
deliberation of the whole matter amongst our selves, we cannot but ingenuously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
that we know well how difficult a thing, if not impossible, it is, to recover the
said Goods unto their Churches, in regard of the manifold unavoidable Contracts,
Sales, and Alienations, which have been made about the same; and that if any such
thing should be attempted, it would not onely redound to the disturbance of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
peace, but be a means, that the unity in the Catholick Church, which by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of your Majesties had been so happily begun, could not obtain its desired effect,
without very great difficulty. Wherefore preferring the publick good and quiet of the
Kingdom, before our own private commodities, and the salvation of so many
souls, redeemed with the precious blood of Christ, before any earthly things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
and not seeking our own, but the things of Jesus Christ, we do most earnestly
and most humbly beseech your Majesties, that you would graciously vouchsafe to
intercede in our behalf with the most reverend Father in God, the Lord Cardinal
<hi>Pole,</hi> Legat à <hi>Latere,</hi> from his Holinesse, our most serene Lord, Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the
third, as well to your most excellent Majesties, as to the whole Realm of <hi>England,</hi>
that he would please to settle and confirm the said Goods of the Church, either in
whole or in part, as he thinks most fit, on the present occupants thereof, according
to the powers and faculties committed to him, by the said most serene Lord the Pope;
thereby preferring the publick good before the private, the peace and tranquillity of
the Realm before sutes and troubles, and the salvation of Souls before earthly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.
And for our parts, we do both now, and for all times comming, give consent
to all and every thing, which by the said Lord Legate shall, in this case, be finally
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:66032:24"/>
ordained and concluded on; humbly beseeching your Majesties,<note place="margin">An. Reg. Mar. 1. 1553/4.</note> that you would gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Majesties, that you would please, according to your wonted goodnesse, to take such
course, that our Ecclesiastical Rights, L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

been taken from us, by the iniquity of the former times, and without which we

                        </gap>e both to us and our Churches; and that
all lawes which have been made to the prejudice of this our jurisdiction, and other
Ecclesiastical liberties, or otherwise have proved to the hindrance of it, may be repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>nour of God, as also to the temporal and spiritual profit, not only of your
said most excellent Majesty, but of all the Realm; giving our selves assured hope,
that your most excellent Majesties, according to your singular pie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y to almighty God,
for so many and great benefits received from him, will not be wanting to the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Kingdom, and the occasions of the Churches, having cure of souls, but that
you would consider and provide as need shall be, for the peace thereof.</p>
                     <p>Which Petition being thus drawn up, was humbly offered to the Legate, in
the name of the whole Convocation, by the Lord Chancellor, (who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at the making of it) the Prolocutor and six others of the lower house. And
it may very well be thought to be welcome to him, in regard it gave him some
good colour for not touching on so harsh a st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ing, as the restoring of Church
lands. Concerning which, he was not ignorant that a message had been sent
to the Pope in the name of the Parliament, to desire a confirmation of the sale
of the lands belonging to Abbies, Chanteries, &amp;c. or otherwise to let him know
that nothing could be granted in his behalf. And it is probable, that they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
some fair promises to that effect, in regard that on the New years day
then next following,<note place="margin">1554/5.</note> the Act for restoring the Pope's supremacy, was passed in
both houses of Parliament, and could not but be entertain'd for one of the
most welcome New years Gifts which ever had been given to a Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi>
What the Pope did in retribution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we are told by <hi>Sleidan,</hi> in whom we find that
he confirmed all those Bishops in their several Sees, which were of Catholick
perswasions, and had been consecrated in the time of the Schism, as also that he
established such new Bishopricks which were erected in the time of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the 8th. and made good all such mariages, as otherwise might be subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
dispute. He adds a confirmation also, (which I somewhat doubt) of the
Abby lands, and telleth, that all this was ratified by the Bull of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the
4th. He dispensed also by the hand of the Cardinal, with irregularity in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
persons, confirmed the Ordination and Institution of Clergy men in their
Callings and Benefices; legitimated the children of forbidden mariages, and
retified the processes and sentences in matters Ecclesiastical. Which general
favours notwithstanding, every Bishop in particular, (except only the Bishop
of <hi>Landaff</hi>) most humbly sought, and obtained pardon of the Pope for their
former errour, not thinking themselves to be sufficiently secured by any gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
dispensation, how large soever. And so the whole matter being transacted
to the content of all parties, (the poor Protestants excepted only) on <hi>Friday</hi> the
25th. of <hi>January,</hi> being the Feast of the Conversion of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> there was a
general and solemn Procession throughout <hi>London,</hi> to give God thanks for
their conversion to the Catholick Church. Wherein (to set out their glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
pomp) were ninety Crosses, one hundred sixty Priests and Clarks, each of
them attired in his Cope; and after them eight Bishops in their <hi>Pontificalibus,</hi>
followed by <hi>Bonner,</hi> carrying the Popish <hi>Pix</hi> under a Canopy, and attended by
the Lord Mayor and Companies in their several Liveries. Which solemn
Procession being ended, they all returned into the Church of St <hi>Paul,</hi> where the
King and Cardinal, together with all the rest, heard Mass<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the next day the
Parliament and Convocation were dissolved.</p>

Nothing now rested, but the sending of a solemn Embassery in the name of
the King and Kingdom,<note place="margin">An. Reg. Mar. 2. 1554/5.</note> to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> for testifying their submission to
his Holiness, and receiving his Apostolical benediction. To which employment

with Sir <hi>Edward Kar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>,</hi> appointed to recide as Ordinary in the Papal
Court. On the 18th day of <hi>February,</hi> they began their journy, but found so
great an alteration when they came to <hi>Rome,</hi> that Pope <hi>Ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>us</hi> was not only
dead, but that <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who succeeded him, was deceased also; so that the
honour and felicity of this address from the King of <hi>England,</hi> devolved on
Cardinal <hi>Caraffa,</hi> (no great friend of <hi>Poles</hi>) who took unto himself the name of
<hi>Paul</hi> the 4th. on the first day of whose Papacy, it chanced that the three Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
came first to <hi>Rome.</hi> It was in the first Consistory also, after his <hi>inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration,</hi> that the Ambassadors were brought before him: Where prostrating
themselves at the Pope's feet, they in the name of the Kingdom, acknowledged
the faults committed, relating them all in particular, (for so the Pope was
pleas'd to have it) confessing that they had been ungrateful for so many bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
received from the Church, and humbly craving pardon for it. The pardon
was not only granted, and the Ambassadors lovingly imbraced; but as an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus,
the Pope was pleas'd to honour their Majesties with the Title of Kings
of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Which Title he conferred upon them, by the authority which the
Popes pretend to have from God, in erecting and subverting Kingdoms. He
knew right well that <hi>Ireland</hi> had been erected into a Kingdom by King <hi>Henry</hi>
the 8th. and that both <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th. and the Queen now reigning, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
used the Title of Kings of <hi>Ireland</hi> in the style Imperial: But he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
himself not bound to take notice of it, or to relinquish any privilege
which had been exercised in that kind by his predecessors. And thereupon he
found out this temperament, that is to say, to dissemble his knowlege of that
which had been done by <hi>Henry,</hi> and of himself to erect the Island into a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
that so the world might be induced to believe, that the Queen rather
used that Title as indulged by the Pope, than as assumed by her Father. And
this he did according to a secret mystery of Government in the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> in giving that which they could not take from the possessor; as on the
other side some Kings to avoid contentions, have received of them their own
proper goods, as gifts; and others have dissembled the knowledge of the Gift,
and the pretence of the Giver.</p>
                     <p>These things being thus dispatched in publick, the Pope had many private,
discourses with the Ambassadors, in which he found fault that the Church
goods were not wholly restored; saying, that by no means it was to be tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
and that it was necessary to render all, even to a farthing. He added, that
the things which belong to God, could never be applied to humane uses, and
that he who withholdeth the least part of them, was in continual state of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
that if he had power to grant them, he would do it most readily, for
the fartherly affection which he bare unto them, and for the experience
which he had of their filial obedience; but that his authority was not so large
as to prophane things dedicated to Almighty God; and therefore he would
have the people of <hi>England</hi> be assured, that these Church lands would be
an <hi>Anathema,</hi> or an accursed thing, which by the just revenge of God would keep
the Kingdom in perpetual infelicity. And of this he charged the Ambassadors
to write immediately, not speaking it once or twice only, but repeating it upon
all occasions. He also told them that the <hi>Peter-Pence</hi> ought to be paid assoon as
might be, and that according to the custome he would send a Collector for
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:66032:25"/>
that purpose,<note place="margin">An. Reg. Mar. 2. 1555.</note> letting them know, that
himself had exercised that charge in
<hi>England,</hi> for three years together; and that he was much edified by seeing the
forwardness of the people in that contribution. The discourse upon which
particular he closed with this, that they could not hope that St <hi>Peter</hi> would
open to them the gates of Heaven, as long as they usurped his goods on earth.
To all which talk the Ambassadors could not chuse but give a hearing, and
knew that they should get no more at their coming home.</p>
                     <p>At their departure out of <hi>England,</hi> they left the Queen in an opinion of
her being with child, and doubted not but that they should congratulate her
safe delivery, when they came to render an account of their imployment; but
it proved the contrary. The Queen about three months after her mariage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to find strong hopes, not only that she had conceived, but also that she was
far gone with child. Notice whereof was sent by Letters to <hi>Bonner,</hi> from the
Lords of the Council, by which he was required to cause <hi>Te Deum</hi> to be sung
in all the Churches of his Diocess, with continual prayers to be made for the
Queen's safe delivery. And for example to the rest, these commands were
executed first on the 28th. of <hi>November,</hi> Dr <hi>Chadsey</hi> one of the Prebends of
<hi>Paul</hi>'s preaching at the Cross, in the presence of the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and nine
other Bishops, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen attending in their scarlet Robes,
and many of the principal Citizens in their several Liveries. Which opinion
gathering greater strength with the Queen, and belief with the people, it was
Enacted by the Lords and Commons then sitting in Parliament, <q>That if it
should happen to the Queen otherwise than well in the time of her travel,
that then the King should have the politick Government, Order and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of this Realm, during the tender years of her Majestie's issue, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Rule, Order, Education and Government of the said issue.
Which charge as he was pleased to undergo at their humble sute, so they
were altogether as forward to confer it on him; not doubting, but that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the time of such Government, he would by all wayes and means, study,
travail, and imploy himself to advance the weal, both publick and private, of
this Realm, and Dominions thereunto belonging, according to the trust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in him, with no less good will and affection, than if his Highness had
been naturally born amongst us.</q> Set Forms of Prayers were also made for
her safe delivery, and one particularly by <hi>Weston,</hi> the Prolocutor of the first
Convocation; in which it was prayed, <hi>That she might in due season bring forth a
child, in body beautiful and come<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>y, in mind noble and valiant. So that she forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the trouble, might with joy, laud and praise,</hi> &amp;c. Great preparations were
also made of all things necessary, against the time of her delivery, which was
supposed would fall out about <hi>Whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>sun</hi> tide, in the month of <hi>June,</hi> even to the
providing of Midwives, Nurses, Rockers and the Cradle too. And so far the
hopes thereof were entertained, that on a sudden rumour of her being delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the bels were rung, and bonfires made in most parts of <hi>London.</hi> The like so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities
were used at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> by discharging all the Ordnance in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
ships; for which the Mariners were gratified by the Queen Regent with
100 Pistolets. In which, as all of them seem'd to have a spice of madness in
them, so none was altogether so wild as the Curate of St <hi>Anns</hi> neer <hi>Aldersgate,</hi>
who took upon him after the end of the Procession, to describe the proportion
of the child, how fair, how beautiful, and great at Prince it was, the like where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
had never been seen.</p>
                     <p>But so it hapned, that notwithstanding all these triumphs, it proved in fine,
that the Queen neither was with child at the present, nor had any hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so for the time to come. By some it was conceived, that this report was
raised upon policy only, to hold her up in the affection of her husband, and the
love of her subjects, by others, that she had been troubled with a Timpany,
which not only made her belly swell, but by the windiness of the disease, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
her with a fancy of her being quick. And some again have left in writing,
that having had the misfortune of a false conception, which bred in her a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66032:25"/>
fleshy and informed substance, by the Physicians called a <hi>Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>a,</hi> the continual
increase whereof, and the agitation it made in her, occa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ioned her to believe
what she most desired, and to report what she believed. But this informed
lump being taken from her with no small difficulty, did not onely turn her
supposed joy to shame and sorrow, but made much game amongst some of the
<hi>Zu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nglian</hi> Gospellers, (for I cannot think, that any true English Protestant
could make sport thereat) who were so far from desiring that the Queen
should have any Issue to succeed in the Throne, that they prayed God by
shortning her days to deprive her of it. Insomuch that one <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>se,</hi> the Minister
to a private Congregation in <hi>Bow Church-yard,</hi> did use to pray, <hi>That God would
either turn her heart from Idolatry, or else shorten her days.</hi> On which occasion,
and some others of the like ill nature, an Act was made in the said Parliament,
for punishing of traiterous words against the Queen; in which it was enacted,
That the said Praiers, and all others of the like mischievous quality, should be
interpreted to be high treason against the Queen. The like exhorbitances I
find too frequent in this Queens Reign, to which some men were so trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by a furious zeal, that a Gun was shot at one Doctor <hi>Pendleton,</hi> as he
preached at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Cross on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 10th. of <hi>June, Anno</hi> 1554. the
Pellet whereof went very near him; but the Gunner was not to be heard of.
Which occasioned the Queen to publish a Proclamation within few days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
prohibiting the shooting in Hand-guns, and the bearing of weapons. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which time, that is to say, on the 8th. of <hi>April,</hi> some of them had caused
a Cat to be hanged upon a Gallows, near the Cross in <hi>Cheapside,</hi> with her
head shorn, the likeness of a Vestment cast upon her, and her two fore-feet
tied together, holding between them a piece of paper in the form of a Wafer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Which tending so apparently to the disgrace of the Religion then by Law
established, was showed the same day, being <hi>Sunday,</hi> at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Crosse, by

                     <p>Such were the madnesses of those People; but the Orthodox and sober Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
shall be brought to a reckoning, and forced to pay dearly for the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of those men, which it was not in their powers to hinder. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours

of some antient Statutes made in the time of King <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d. King
<hi>Henry</hi> the 4th. and King <hi>Henry</hi> the 5th. for the severe punishment of obstinate
<hi>Hereticks,</hi> even to death it self. Which Act being passed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the three great Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of the time were not alike minded for the putting it in execution. The
Lord Cardinal was clearly of opinion, that they should rest themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with the restitution of their own Religion; that the said three Statu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>es
should be held forth for a terrour onely, but that no open persecution should
be raised upon them; following therein, as he affirmed, the counsell sent unto
the Queen by <hi>Charls</hi> the Emperour, at her first comming to the Crown, by
whom she was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>dvised to create no troubble unto any man for matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
but to be warned unto the contrary by his example, who by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to compell others to his own Religion, had tired and spent himself
in vain, and purchased nothing by it but his own dishonour. But the Lord
Chancellor <hi>Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

never to have revived the said three Statutes, as not to see them put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
That some blood should be drawn in case of refractorinesse, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible
non-conformity, he conceived most necessary. But he would have
the Ax laid onely to the Root of the Tree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the principal supporters of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
to be taken away, whether they were of the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy,
or the Lay-Nobility; and some of the more pragmatick preachers to be cut
off also; the rest of the people to be spared, as they who meerly did depend on
the power of the other. Let but the Shepherds be once smitten, and the whole
flock will presently be scattered, without further trouble.</p>

Well then, said <hi>Bonner</hi> to himself, I see the honour of this work is reserved
for me, who neither fear the Emperor's frow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, nor the peoples curses. Which
having said, (as if he had been pumping for a re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>olution) he took his times to
make it known unto the other two, that he perceived they were as willing as
himself, to have the Catholick Religion entertained in all parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
though neither of them seemed desirous to act any thing in it, or take
the envy on himself; that he was well enough pleased with that reservednesse,
hoping they did not mean it for a precedent unto him or others, who had a mind
to shew their zeal and forwardness in the Catholick cause. Have I not seen
(saith he) that the hereticks themselves have broke the Ice, in putting one of
their own number (I think they called him by the name of <hi>Servetus</hi>) to a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
death. Could it be thought no crime in them, to take that more severe
course against one of their brethren, for holding any contrary doctrine, from
that which they had publickly agreed amongst them? And can they be so silly, or
so partial rather, as to reckon it for a crime in us, if we proceed against them
with the like severity, and punish them by the most extream rigour of their
own example? I plainly see, that neither you my Lord Cardinal, nor you
my Lord Chancellor, have any Answer to return to my present Argument,
which is sufficient to encourage me to proceed upon it. I cannot act Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
against any of them, but such as live within the compasse of my juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
in which I shall desire no help nor countenance from either of you.
But as for such as live in the Diocesse of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> or that of <hi>Winchester,</hi> or
otherwise not within my reach in what place soever, let them be, sent for up
by order from the Lords of the Council, committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> the <hi>Fleet,</hi>
or any other Prison within my Diocesse, And when I have them in my clutches,
let God do so, and more to <hi>Bonner,</hi> if they scape his fingers.</p>
                     <p>The Persecution thus resolved on, home goes the bloody Executioner,
armed with as much power as the Law could give him, and backed by the
Authority of so great a King, taking some other of the Bishops to him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
before him certain of the Preachers of King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, who former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
had been committed to several prisons; of whom it was demanded, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they would stand to their former doctrines, or accept the Queens Pardon
and Recant? To which it was generally and stoutly answered, That they
would stand unto their doctrines. Hereupon followed that <hi>Inquisition for
blood</hi> which raged in <hi>London,</hi> and more or less was exercised in most parts of
the Kingdom. The first that led the way was Mr. <hi>John R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was by Bishop <hi>Ridley</hi> preferred to the Lecture of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and made one of

                     <p>The like course was also taken with Bishop <hi>Earrar,</hi> but that I do not find
him restrained from speaking his mind unto the people, as the other was: A man
of an implausible nature, which rendred him the less agreeable to either side;
cast into prison by the Protestant, and brought out to his death and martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
by the Popish party. Being found in prison at the death of King <hi>Edward,</hi>
he might have fared as well as any of his ranck and order, who had no hand in
the interposing for Queen <hi>Jane,</hi> if he had governed himself with that discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and given such fair and moderate Answers, as any man in his condition
might have honestly done. But being called before Bishop <hi>Gardiner,</hi> he behaved
himself so proudly, and gave such offence, that he was sent back again to
prison, and after condemned for an obstinate Heretick. But for the sentence
of his condemnation, he was sent into his own Diocess, there to receive it at

<hi>Bocardo,</hi> from the top whereof he beheld that most dolefull spectacle; and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting himself upon his knees, he humbly beseeched the Lord to endue them
with a sufficient strength of Faith and Hope; which he also desired for himself,
whensoever he should act his part on that bloody Theater.</p>
                     <p>But he must stay the Popes leisure before he was to be brought on the
Stage again. The Queen had been acquainted with such discoutses, as had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
betwixt the Pope and her Ambassadors, when they were at <hi>Rome;</hi> and she
appeared desirous to have gratified him in his demands. But the Kings absence,
who set sail for <hi>Calais</hi> on the fourth of <hi>September,</hi> and the next morning
took his journey to the Emperor's Court, which was then at <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the matter not so feasible as it might have been, if he had continued in the
Kingdom. For having called a Parliament to begin on the 21 of <hi>October,</hi> she
caused many of the Lords to be dealt withall touching the passing of an Act
for the restoring of all such Lands as had belonged unto the Church, and were
devolved upon the Crown, and from the Crown into the hands of privat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
by the fall of Monasteries, and other Religious Houses, or by any other
ways or means whatsoever. But such a general avers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ess was found amongst
them, that she was advised to desist from that unprofitable undertaking. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is, that many who were cordially affected to the Queens Religion,
were very much startled at the noise of this Restitution, insomuch that some
of them are said to have clapt their hands upon their swords, affirming, not
without some Oaths, that they would never part with their Abbey-Lands as
long as they were able to were a sword by their sides. Which being signified
to the Queen, it seemed good to her to let fall that sute for the present, and
to give them good example for the time to come, by passing an Act, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leasing
the Clergy from the payment of first Fruits and Tenths, which had
been formerly vested in the Crown in the Reign of her Father. Against
which when it was objected by some of the Lords of the Council, that the
state of her Kingdoms and Crown Emperial could not be so honourably
maintained as in former times, if such a considerable part of the Revenue
were dismembered from it; she is said to have returned this answer, That she
prefetted the salvation of her Soul before ten such Kingdoms. She procured
another Act to be passed also, which very much redounded to the benefit of
the two Universities, inhibiting all Purveyors from taking up any provisions
for the use of the Court within five miles of <hi>Oxon</hi> or <hi>Cambridge;</hi> by mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
whereof, those Markets were more plentifully served with all sorts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
than in former times, and at more reasonable rates than otherwise
they could have been, without that restraint. In her first Parliament, the better
to indear her self to the common subject, she had released a Subsidie which was
due unto her, by an Act of Parliament made in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth.
And now to make her some amends, they gave her a Subsidie of four shillings
in the Pound for Lands, and two shillings eight-pence in the pound for
Goods. In the drawing up of which Act, an Oath, which had been formerly
prescribed to all manner of persons, for giving in a just account of their estates,
was omitted wholly, which made the Subsidie sinck beneath expectation. But
the Queen came unto the Crown by the love of the people, and was to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the hazard of their affections, which she held it by.</p>
                     <p>At the same time was held a Convocation also, for summoning whereof, a
Writ was issued in the name of the King and Queen, to the Dean and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

of it, and Doctor <hi>John Christoperson,</hi> Dean of <hi>Norwich,</hi> is chosen Prolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
for the House of the Clergy. But the chief businesse done therein was the
granting of a Subsidie of six shillings in the pound to be paid out of all their
Ecclesiastical Promotions in three years then following. Nor was it without
reason that they were enduced to so large a grant; The Queen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ad actually
restored unto them their First-fruits and Tenths, though at that time the
Crown was not in such a plentiful condition, as to part with such an annual
income. And she had promised also, (as appears by the Records of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocarion) to
render back unto the Church all such Impropriations, Tithes, and
portion of Tithes, as were still remaining in the Crown. For the disposing of
which Grant to the best advantage, the Cardinal-Legat, at the Queens desire,
had conceived an Instrument, which was then offered to the consideration of
the Prolocutor, and the rest of the Clergy; it was proposed also by the Bishop
of <hi>Elie,</hi> that some certa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n learned men might be chosen out of the House, to
review all the antient Canons, to fit them to the present state of the Church;
and were they sound any thing defective in them, to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pply that defect, by
making such new C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nons and Constitutions, as being approved of by the
Lords, should be made obligatory to the Clergy, and the rest of the Kingdom.
This was well mov'd, and serv'd to entertain the time; but I find nothing
in pursuance of it.</p>
                     <p>But on the other side, the Prolocutor bringing up the Bill of the Subsidies
in the end of <hi>October,</hi> propounds three points unto their Lordships, which
much conduced to the establishment and advantage of the prejudiced Clergy.
The first was, That all such of the Clergy as building on the common report,
that the Tenths and First fruits were to be released in the following Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
had made no composition for the same with her Majesties Officers,
might be discharged from the penalty inflicted by the Laws in that behalf. The
second, That their Lordships would be pleased to intercede with the Lord
Cardinal-Legat, for setling and confirming them in their present Benefices by
some special Bull. The third, That by their Lordships means, an Act may be
obtained in the present Parliament, for the repealing of the Statute, by which
the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> which refused to make payment of their Tithes, were
to be ordered at the discretion of the Lord Mayor of that City; And that
from thenceforth, all such censures as concerned Tithes might be heard and
determined by the Ordinary, as in other places. To all which Propositions
the Bishops cheerfully consented, and so adjurned the Convocation from St.
<hi>Pauls</hi> to <hi>Westminster,</hi> that they might have the better opportunity of consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Lord-Cardinal in the businesse; of whom it was no hard matter to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the second, and by his power to secure the Clergy in the first; but as for
the removall of the Cognisance of the <hi>London</hi> Tithes from the Lord Mayor
unto the Bishops, there was nothing done, that Statute still remaining as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it did, to the continual impoverishing and vexation of the City Clergy.
Nothing else memorable in this Convocation, but the comming in of the two
new Bishops, which had never voted there before; <hi>Purefew</hi> the Bishop of St.
<hi>Asaph,</hi> being translated unto <hi>Hereford</hi> in the former year, had made such ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock
of the Patrimony of the Church of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> that it lay void above a
twelve month before any became Suter for it. But being a Bishoprick,
though impoverished, and consequently a step to some richer preferment, it
was desired and accepted by Mr. <hi>Thomas Goldnel,</hi> a right zealous <hi>Romanist,</hi>
consecrated Bishop hereof in the beginning of <hi>October, Anno</hi> 1555. not many
days before the opening of the Parliament and Convocation. And being Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
here, he procured many Indulgences and other Graces from the Pope
then being, for all such persons of each sex, as went on Pilgrimage, or for
health, to St. <hi>Winifrids</hi> Well. The like havock had been made of the Lands
and Patrimony of the Church of <hi>Bangor,</hi> by <hi>Buckley</hi> the present Bishop of it,
preferred unto this See <hi>Anno</hi> 1541. and continuing on it till this year; who
not content to alienate the Lands, and weaken the Estate thereof, resolved to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:66032:29"/>
rob it of its Bells, for fear perhaps of having any Knell rung out at the
Churches Funetal. And not content to sell the Bells, which were five in
number<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he would needs satisfie himself with seeing them conveyed on ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,
and had searce given himself that satisfaction, but he was p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

struck blind, and so continued from that time to the day of his death. To
whom succeeded Doctor <hi>William Glyn,</hi> a <hi>Cambridge</hi> man, but one of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants
at <hi>Oxford,</hi> who received his Episcopal Consecration (if I guesse aright)
on the same day with Bishop <hi>Goldne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And now it will be time to look back on <hi>Cranmer,</hi> whom we left under a
Citation to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> without which, nothing could be done; for
by an antient privilege, no Judgment could be past upon the person of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan,
before the Pope have taken cognisance of the cause; and eighty
days had seemingly been given to <hi>Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Ely,</hi> to proceed to the Degradation of the said Archbishop: In which
Commission it was said with most horrible falshood, That all things had been
so indifferently examined in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that is to say, as well the
Articles laid unto his charge, as the Answers which he made unto them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Allegations, Witnesses, and Defences, made or produced by
the Counsel on either side, so that nothing had been wanting which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to his just defence. According to which supposition, the said two Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
being commanded to proceed against him, caused him to be Degraded on
the 14 th. of <hi>February,</hi> notwithstanding that he appealed from the Pope and
them to a General Council, and caused the said Appeal to be drawn and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in due form of Law. During the interval between his degradation and the
time of his death, great pains was taken by some learned men in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
to perswade him to a Retractation of his former Opinions; in which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
undertaking, no man prevailed so far as a <hi>Spanish</hi> Ftier, by whom it was
suggested to him, How acceptable it would be to the King and Queen, how
pleasing to the Lords, who most dearly loved him, and how gainfull to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
in regard both of his soul and his temporal being; assuring him (or at
least putting him in good hope) that he should not onely have his life, but be
restored again to his antient dignity, and that there should be nothing in the
Realm which the Queen would not easily grant him, whether it pleased him to
make choice of Riches and Honors, or otherwise should desire the sweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements
of a private life, without the charge and trouble of a publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery;
and all this to be compassed without putting himself to any more pains,
than the subscribing of his name to a piece of paper, which was made ready for
his hand.</p>
                     <p>By these temptations, and many others of the like alluring and deceitfull
nature, he suffered himself to be prevailed upon so far, as to sign the Writing,
in which were briefly comprehended the chief points of Doctrine defended in
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by him formerly condemned both in publick and
private. The obtaining whereof occasioned great joy amongst the Papists, and
no lesse sorrow and astonishment in the hearts of those, who cordially were
affected to the Reformation. But all this could not save him from being made
a sacrifice to revenge and avarice; The Queen had still a vindicative<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> spirit
against him, for the injury which she conceived had been done to her mother;
and the Cardinal, who hitherto had enjoyed the profits of the See of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
as an usu-fructuary, was altogether as solicitous for getting a right and
title to them as the sole Proprietary; No way to pacifie the one, and satisfie
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:66032:30"/>
the desires of the other, but by bringing him (when he least looked for it) to
the fatall Stake. And to the fatall Stake they brought him on the 21 of <hi>March,</hi>
when he had for some time flattered himself in a conceit, like the King of
<hi>Amaleck, that the bitternesse of dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by holding it forth into the flame, and suffering it to be consumed before the
rest of his body had felt the fire. The residue of his body being burnt to ashes,
his heart was found entire &amp; untouched in the midst of the sinders; Which
possibly may serve as a witnesse for him, that his heart stood fast unto the
Truth, though with his hand he had subscribed some Popish Errors: Which
whether it were done out of human frailty on the hope of life, or out of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire

he alledged for himself in a Letter to one of his friends; Certain it is, that it
had too much in it of a sinful compliance, so much as might have blasted both
his fame and memory to all times succeeding, if he had not taken off the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,
and expiated the offence in so brave a manner. And thus he dyed, leaving
an excellent example to all posterity, as well of mans infirmity in so strange

that though many persecutions have lasted longer, yet none since <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>'s

from the Church, and her two daughters guilty of the same neglect. Upon this
they were presented before <hi>Jaques Amy,</hi> then Dean of the Island, who finding
in them that they held opinions contrary to those then allowed, about the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of
the Altar, pronounced them Hereticks, and condemned them to
the fire. The poor women on the one side pleaded for themselves, that that
doctrine had been taught them in the time of King <hi>Edward;</hi> but if the Queen
was otherwise disposed, they were content to be of her Religion. This was
fair, but this would not serve; for by the Dean they were delivered to <hi>Eli'er
Gosling,</hi> the then Bayliff, and by him unto the fire, <hi>July</hi> the 8th. 1556. One of
the daughters (<hi>Perotine Massey</hi> she was called) was at that time great with
child; her husband a Minister being in those dangerous times fled the Island;
In the middle of the flames and anguish of her torments, her belly brake in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and her child, a goodly boy, fell down into the fire, but was presently
snatched up by one <hi>W. House,</hi> one of the By standers. Upon the noise of this
strange accident, the cruel Bayliff returned command, that the poor infant must
be cast again into the flames; which was accordingly performed; and so that
pretty babe was born a <hi>Martyr,</hi> and added to the number of the <hi>Holy innocents.</hi>
A cruelty not parallel'd in any story, not heard of amongst the Nations. But
such was the pleasure of the Magistrate, as once in the Massacre of the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

been said before, and he knew well that Cardinal <hi>Carraffa</hi> (now Pope <hi>Paul</hi>
the 4th.) loved him less than he. This put him first upon an hope, that the
Pope might be prevailed with to revoke the Cardinal (who had before been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a suspicion in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> of having somewhat of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> in
him) and to bestow the Cardinal's Cap, together with the <hi>Legantine</hi> power,
upon himself, who doubted not of sitting in the chair of <hi>Canterbury</hi> if he gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the rest. Upon which ground he is supposed to have hindered all procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
against the three <hi>Oxon</hi> Martyrs, from the ending of the Parliament on
the 26th. of <hi>January,</hi> till the 12th. of <hi>September</hi> then next following, the Pope

not sending out any Commission in all that interval,<note place="margin">An. Reg. Mar. 3. 1555/6.</note>
without which <hi>Cranmer</hi>
was not to be brought to a condemnation. But at the last, not knowing how
much these procrastinations might offend the King, and perhaps prest unto it
by <hi>Karn,</hi> the Queen's Ambassadour, he found himself under a necessity to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch
Commission, though he proceeded not to the execution of any part
of the sentence, till more than ten weeks after the 80 dayes, which had been
given for his appearance in the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                     <p>During which time, death puts an end to <hi>Gardiners</hi> projects, who left his
life at <hi>Whitehal</hi> on the 12th. of <hi>November.</hi> From whence conveyed by water
to his house in <hi>Southwark,</hi> his body was first lapt in lead, kept for a season in
the Church of St <hi>Mary Over-Rhe,</hi> and afterwards solemnly interred under a
fair and goodly Monument in his Cathedral. The custody of the Great Seal,
together with the Title of Lord Chancellor,<note place="margin">1555/6.</note> was upon New years day conferred
on Dr <hi>Nicholas Heath,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> a man of great prudence and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration;
but the revenues of the Bishoprick were appropriated to the use
of the Cardinal Legate, who purposed to have held it in <hi>Commendam</hi> with the
See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to which he received consecration on the very next Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
after <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s death. But Dr <hi>John White</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> having been
born at <hi>Winchester,</hi> and educated in that School, of which he was afterwards
chief Master, and finally Warden of that College, ambitiously affected a
translation thither. And so far he prevailed by his friends at Court, that on
the promise of an annual pension of 1000 l. to the use of the Cardinal, he
was permitted to enjoy the Title with the rest of the profits. Which I have
mentioned in this place, though this transaction was not made, nor his tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
actually performed till the year next following. No other alteration
made amongst the Bishops of this time, but that <hi>Voysie</hi> of <hi>Exon,</hi> dies in some
part of the year, 1555. and Dr <hi>James Turbervile</hi> succeeds him in the beginning
of the year 1556. A man well born, and well befriended, by means whereof he
recovered some lands unto his See, which had been alienated from it by his
predecessor; and amongst others, the rich and goodly Mannors of <hi>Credinson,</hi>
or <hi>Kirton,</hi> in the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> (in former times the Episcopal seat of the
Bishop of <hi>Exon</hi>) though afterwards again dismembred from it in the time of

not to shew it self visibly in open action yet such as formerly had declared for
it, or wish'd well unto it, had many secret writings against the Queen, every
day growing more and more in dislike of her Government, by reason of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
butcheries as were continually committed under her authority. Upon
which ground as they had formerly instructed <hi>Elizabeth Crofts</hi> to act the <hi>spirit
in the wall;</hi> so afterwards they trained up one <hi>William Cunstable, alias Feather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,</hi>
to take upon himself the name of King <hi>Edward,</hi> whom he was said to
have resembled, both in age and personage. And this they did in imitation of
the like practice used in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 6th. by <hi>Richard Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genet,</hi>
Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who when he had a mind to claim his Title to the Crown,
in regard of his descent by the House of <hi>Mortimer,</hi> from <hi>Lionel</hi> of <hi>Antwerp</hi>
Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> he caused one <hi>Jack Cade</hi> (a fellow altogether as obscure as
this) to take upon himself the name of <hi>Mortimer,</hi> that the might see how well
the people stood affected unto his pretensions, by the discovery which might
be made thereof on this false allarum. And though this <hi>Featherstone</hi> had been
taken and publickly whip'd for it in <hi>May</hi> last past, and thereupon banished into
the <hi>North,</hi> where he had been born; yet the confederats resolved to try their
fortune with him in a second adventure. The design was to raise the people
under colour of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s being alive, and at the same time to rob the
Exchequer, wherein they knew by some intelligence or other, that 50000. l.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:66032:31"/>
in good <hi>Spanish</hi> money had been lately lodged. Few persons of any quality
appeared in it, not thinking fit to shew themselves in any new practice against
the Queen, till made prosperous by some good success. The chief whom I
find mentioned to be privy to it, were <hi>Henry Peckam,</hi> the son of that Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond

<hi>Howards,</hi> to have a hand in this conspiracy; and possibly enough it is, that
some of greater eminence than any of those before remembred, might be of
counsel in the practice, though they kept themselves out of sight as much as
they could, till they found how it would succeed amongst the people.</p>
                     <p>In this unquiet condition we must leave <hi>England</hi> for a time, and look on the
estate of the <hi>English</hi> Churches on the other side of the sea, That many of the
<hi>English</hi> Protestants had forsook the Kingdom, to the number of 800. as well
Students as others, hath been said before; who having put themselves into
several Cities, partly in <hi>Germany,</hi> and partly among the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and their
confederates, kept up the face and form of an <hi>English</hi> Chruch, in each of their
several congregations. Their principal retiring places amongst the last, were
<hi>Arrow, Zurick,</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> and in the first, the Cities of <hi>Embden, Stralsburge,</hi>
and <hi>Franckfort.</hi> In <hi>Franckfort</hi> they enjoyed the greatest privileges, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
resorted thither in the greatest numbers, which made them the more apt
unto Schisms and factions. At their first coming to that place, which was on
the 27th. of <hi>June, Anno</hi> 1554. by the power and favour of <hi>John Glauberge,</hi> one
of the Senators of that City, they were permitted to have the use of one of
their Churches, which had before been granted to such <hi>French</hi> exiles, as had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
thither on the like occasion; yet so, that the French were still to hold
their right; the <hi>English</hi> to have the use of it one day, and the <hi>French</hi> another,
and on the Lords day so to divide the hours between them, that the one might
be no hinderance unto the other. It hath been said also, that there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
condition imposed upon them, of being conform unto the <hi>French</hi> in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Ceremonies. Which condition if it were imposed by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
not sought by themselves, must needs be very agreeable to the temper
and complexion of their principal Leaders; who being for the most part of the
<hi>Zuinglian-Gospellers,</hi> at their going hence, became the great promoters of the
<hi>Puritan</hi> faction at their comming home. The names of <hi>Whittingham,
Williams,
Goodman, Wood</hi> and <hi>Sutton,</hi> who appeared in the head of this congregation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
sufficiently of what Principles and strain they were, how willing they
would be to lay aside the face of an <hi>English</hi> Church, and frame themselves to
any Liturgie but their own.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>July</hi> the 14th. they first obtained a grant of their Church, and on the 29th.
took possession of it. The interval they spent in altering and disfiguring the
English Lyturgie, of which they left nothing but the reading of the Psalms
and Chapters. Those comfortable interlocutories between the Minister and
the People, were no longer used, as savouring in their opinion, of some disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the course of the ministration; the Letany and the Surplice they cast
aside, as having too much in them of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> the <hi>Confession</hi> they
had altered so, as they conceived most agreeable to their present condition;
and for the Hymns which intervened between the Chapters and the <hi>Creed,</hi>
they changed them for such Psalms in the English Meerer, as had been made by
<hi>Sternhold</hi> and <hi>Hopkins</hi> in the time of King <hi>Edward.</hi> The Psalm being done, the
Preacher goes into the Pulpit, in which the Minister prayed for the assistance
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:66032:32"/>
of God's Spirit, and so proceeded to the Sermon. Which done, an other Prayer
was made for all orders and estates of men, but more particularly for the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> composed in imitation of the Prayer for the
<hi>Church Militant</hi> here on earth, but ending (as that did not) with the <hi>Pater<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>noster.</hi>
After which (most extreamly out of order) followed the rehearsal of
the Articles of the Christian Faith, another Psalm, and finally the dismission
of the people, with <hi>The Peace of God.</hi> This was the form devised for that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
for the imposing whereof on all the rest of the English Churches,
they did then use their best endeavours, and for obtruding which on the whole
Church of <hi>England</hi> they raised such tumults and commotions in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
times. Growing in love with this fair Babe of their own begetting, they
write their Letters of the second of <hi>August</hi> to such of the English as remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at <hi>Stralsburge</hi> and <hi>Zurick,</hi> inviting them to repair to <hi>Franckfort,</hi> and unite
themselves unto that Church, which had been there erected with the leave of
the Magistrate. But they had heard in both places of those Alterations which
had been made at <hi>Franckfort,</hi> in the form of Gods publick Service, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
refused to accept of the invitation, though it seemed to promise them
some advantages by the commodious situation of that City in respect of
<hi>England,</hi> the great resort of strangers thither at the yearly Marts, plenty of
Books, and other helps in the way of study, which were not to be found in
the other two Cities. From <hi>Stralsburge</hi> modestly, from <hi>Zurick</hi> resolutely, but
from both it was plainly signified, that they resolved to maintain the Order of
the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The like Letter had been writ to the <hi>English</hi> at <hi>Embden,</hi> of which Congregation Doctor <hi>Scory,</hi> the late Bishop of <hi>Chichester,</hi>
was the Super-intendent; and we may readily believe, that they received the
like repulse from his Church at <hi>Embden,</hi> as they had from <hi>Gryndal, Sandys,</hi> and
<hi>Haddon,</hi> or who had the constituting of the Church of <hi>Stralsburge;</hi> or from
<hi>Horn, Chambers, Parkhurst,</hi> and other of the Students which remained at
<hi>Zurick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The noise of this new Church at <hi>Franckfort</hi> occasioned <hi>Knox,</hi> who after
proved the great incendiary of the Realm and Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to leave his
Sanctuary in <hi>Geneva,</hi> in hope to make a better market for himself in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.
He had not long before published a seditious Pamphlet, entituled,
<hi>The first blast of the Trumpet,</hi> in which he bitterly inveighed against the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Women,</hi> aiming there especially at the three Queen <hi>Maries,</hi> that
is to say, <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>England, Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>
Queen Regent of <hi>Scotland.</hi> By which seditious Pamphlet, he had made
not onely his own Country too hot for him, but could assure himself of no
safety in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>England.</hi> To <hi>Geneva</hi> therefore he retires, and from thence
removes to <hi>Franckfort,</hi> as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>itter <hi>Scene</hi> for his intendments, hoping to get as
great a name in this new Plantation, as <hi>Calvin</hi> had gotten in the old. It was
about the end of <hi>September</hi> that he came to <hi>Franckfort,</hi> where he took the
charge of that Church upon him, <hi>Whittingham</hi> and the rest submitting unto
his Apostleship. This gave a new dis-satisfaction to the English at <hi>Stralsburge</hi>
and <hi>Zurick,</hi> who knew the spirit of the man, and feared the dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents
and effects thereof. Nor was the condition of affairs much bettered
by the coming of <hi>Whitehead,</hi> (who afterwards refused the Archbishoprick of
<hi>Canterbury</hi>) though far the more moderate of the two. New Letters are reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procated
between <hi>Franckfort</hi> and <hi>Zurick;</hi> from <hi>Franckfort</hi> on the 15th. of
<hi>November,</hi> in open defiance as it were to the English Liturgy; from <hi>Zurick</hi>
on the 28th. in defence thereof, and of their constancy and resolution for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
to it. The breach growing every day more wide than other, <hi>Gryndal</hi> and
<hi>Chambers</hi> came from <hi>Stralsburge</hi> to attone the difference, by whom it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
unto them, That the <hi>substance</hi> of the English Liturgy being retained,
there might be a forbearance of some <hi>ceremonies</hi> and <hi>offices</hi> in it. But <hi>Knox</hi> and
<hi>Whittingham</hi> were as much bent against the <hi>substance</hi> of the Book, as against any
of the <hi>circumstantials</hi> and <hi>extrinsicals</hi> which belonged unto it. So that no good
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:66032:32"/>
effect following on this interposition, the Agents of the Church of <hi>Stralsburge</hi>
return back to their brethren, who by their Letters of the 13th. of <hi>December</hi>
expostulate in vain about it.</p>
                     <p>In these distractions, some of the <hi>Franckfort</hi> Schismaticks desire, that all
divine Offices might be executed according to the order of the Church of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva;</hi>
which <hi>Knox</hi> would by no means yield unto, thinking himself as able to
make a Rule for his own Congregation, as any <hi>Calvin</hi> of them all.
But that the mouths of those of <hi>Stralsburge</hi> and <hi>Zuri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

ever, he is content to make so much use of him, as by the authority of his
judgment to disgrace that Liturgy, which those of <hi>Zurick</hi> did contend for.
He knew well how he had bestirred himself in quarrelling the first Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy
of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th. and nothing doubteth, but that the second
(though reviewed on his importunity) would give him as little satisfaction as
the other did. To this intent, the Order of the <hi>English Liturgy</hi> is drawn up in
Latine, transmitted to him by <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Whittingham,</hi> by this infallible judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

remained affected to the former Liturgy, it was agreed upon, That a mixt.
Form, consisting partly of the Order of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and partly of the Book of
<hi>England,</hi> should be digested and received till the first of <hi>April;</hi> consideration
in the mean time to be had of some other course which should be permanent,
and obliging for the time to come.</p>
                     <p>In this condition of affairs, Doctor <hi>Richard Cox,</hi> the late Dean of <hi>Christ-Church</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> first Schoolmaster, and after Almoner to King <hi>Edward</hi>
the sixth, putteth himself into <hi>Franckfort March</hi> 13. accompanied with many
English Exiles, whom the cause of Religion had necessitated to forsake their
Country: Being a man of great learning, of great authority in the Church, and
one that had a principal hand in drawing up the Liturgy by Law established; he
could with no patience endure those innovations in it, or rather that rejection
of it, which he found amongst them. He thereupon first begins to answer the
Minister contrary to the Order there agreed on, and the next <hi>Sunday</hi> after
causeth one of his company to go into the Pulpit and read the Letany. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
which doings of his, <hi>Knox</hi> in a Sermon the same day inveigheth most
bitterly, affirming many things in the Book of <hi>England</hi> not onely to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
but superstitious, For the which he is not onely rebuked by <hi>Cox,</hi> but
forbidden to preach. Wherewith <hi>Whittingham</hi> being much offended, deals
with some of the Magistrates, from whom he procureth an Order of the 22 of
<hi>March,</hi> requiring, That the English should conform themselves to the Rules
of the <hi>French. Knox</hi> had not long before published a seditious Pamphlet, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled,

the use of that Church. Having thus setled all things answerable to his own
desires, he gives an account thereof to <hi>Calvin,</hi> subscribed by fourteen of the
chief men in that Congregation, partly excusing themselves that they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
so far without his consent, and partly rejoycing, that they had drawn
the greatest part of that Church to their own opinions. <hi>Calvin</hi> returns his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

is to say, to have the whole business referred to some Arbitrators, equally chosen
on both sides. But <hi>Cox</hi> was already in possession, great in esteem with the

Some words had passed at a supper, intended rather for increase of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

the house of one of the Elders, to answer for some words which he had spoken
in contempt of the Ministry. But from the Elders, he appeals to the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
amongst whom he prevails so fat, that they send a message by two of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:66032:33"/>
their company to the Pastor and Elders, requiring them to proceed no further
in the cause. <hi>Horn</hi> being backed by <hi>Chambers,</hi> the publick Treasurer, excepts
against this message, as decreed at a private Conventicle, not by the general
suffrages of the Congregation, and thereupon resolves to stand to that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
which formerly had been conferred on him and the rest of the Elders,
by the Rules of their Discipline. <hi>Ashley</hi> and his adh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>onventicle, protest against
the Pastor and Elders, as an adverse party, and therefore not in a capacity to sit
as Judges in the present case, and set themselves upon the making of a Book
of Discipline, for the curbing the exorbitant power (for such they thought it)
of the Pastor and Elders. The Pastor and Elders thereupon forsake their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and on the 5th, of <hi>February,</hi> being the next day of publick meeting, take
place amongst the rest as private persons; The Congregation full, but the
Pulpit empty, which put the rest upon a humour of electing others to take the
publick charge upon them. The noise of these disorders awakes the Magistrates,
who command <hi>Horn</hi> and <hi>Chambers</hi> to forbear the congregation, until further
Order, and afterwards restoring them to their former authority by publick E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,
were contradicted in it by <hi>Ashley</hi>'s party, who having got some power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their hands, were resolved to keep it.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, a Book of Discipline had been drawn and tendered to the
Congregation, on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

supreme power in all Ecclesi astical causes was put into the hands of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,
and the disposing of the publick monies committed to the trust of
certain Officers, by the name of Deacons. This makes the breach wider than
before, <hi>Horn</hi> and his party labouring to retain the old, the other to establish
the new Discipline of their own devising. The Magistrates not able to agree
the difference, dispatch their Letters unto <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <abbr>Esq</abbr> to undertake the
closing of the present rupture. To their arbitrement each party is content to
submit the controversie, but differ in conclusion, in the terms of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
Much talk, and no small scandal groweth upon these divisions, not
made the less by the Pen-combats between <hi>Horn</hi> and <hi>Whitehead.</hi> In the end, a
form of reconciliation is drawn up by some of the <hi>English,</hi> who more endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the peace of the Church, than the interess of either party. But those
who stood for the new Discipline being grown the stronger, refused to submit
themselves to any establishment, by which the power of the diffusive body of
the Congregation might be called in question. Whereupon <hi>Horn</hi> and <hi>Chamb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

proceeded to the election of some new Ministers, <hi>March</hi> the 22d. Against
which, though <hi>Horn</hi> and his opposed, yet they concluded it for the present, on
the 29th. and now they mean to stand unto the conclusion, let <hi>Horn</hi> and <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
go or tarry, as best pleased themselves. Such were the troubles and disorders
in the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hurch of <hi>Franckfort,</hi> occasioned first by a dislike of the publick Liturgy,
before which they preferred the nakedness and simplicity of the <hi>French</hi> and
<hi>Genevian</hi> Churches, and afterwards continued, by the opposition made by the general body of the Congregation, against such as were appointed to be Pastors
and Rulers over them. Hence the beginning of the Puritan faction, against the
Rites and Ceremonies of the Church; that of the Presbyterians against the
Bishops, of Episcopal Government; and finally that also of the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
against the superintendency of the Pastors and Elders. The terrible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,

to the Civil Magistrate, and some as scandalous in respect of Episcopal
Government. From this time the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Doctrine of <hi>Predestination</hi> began
to be dispersed in <hi>English</hi> Pamphlets, as the only necessary, Orthodox, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
truth. <hi>Knox</hi> publisheth a book <hi>Against an adversary of God's predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
wherein it is declared, <hi>That whatsoever the Ethnicks and ignorant did attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute

counsel of God; and finally, that it would be displeasing unto God, if we should esteem
any thing to proceed from any other; and that we do not only behold him as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
cause of all things, but also the author, appointing all things to the one or the
other by his only counsel.</hi> After comes out a Book first written in <hi>French,</hi> and
afterwards by some of them translated into <hi>English,</hi> which they called <hi>A brief
Declaration of the Table</hi> of predestination, in which it is put down for a principal
<hi>Aphorism,</hi> that in like manner, <hi>as God hath appointed the end, it is necessary also,
that God should appoint the causes leading to the same end;</hi> but more particularly,
<hi>that by vertue of God's will all things are done; yea, even those things which are
evil and execrable.</hi> In another book Entituled <hi>Against a privy Papist,</hi> it is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
more agreeably to <hi>Calvin's</hi> Doctrine, <hi>That all evil springeth of Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,

And in a fourth book published by <hi>Robert Crowley,</hi> who afterwards was
Rector of the Church of St <hi>Giles</hi>'s nere <hi>Cripple-gate,</hi> Entituled <hi>The confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

that there was in him no lust to sin, and yet so weak, that of himself he was not able to
withstand the assault of the subtil Serpent;</hi> that <hi>therefore there can be no remedy,
but that the only cause of his fall, must needs be the predestination of God.</hi> In which
book it is also said, <hi>That the most wicked persons that have been, were of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be even as wicked as they were;</hi> and finally, <hi>that if God do predestinate
man to do things rashly, and without any deliberation, he shall not deliberate at all,
but run headlong upon it, be it good or evil.</hi> By which defenders of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
decree of reprobation, as God is made to be the Author of sin, either in
plain terms or undeniable consequence; so from the same men, and the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevian</hi>

                     <p>Upon this opening of her mind, the Lords perceived it would be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to perswade the contrary, and therefore thought it requisite to direct
some course wherein she might satisfie her desires to her own great honour, and
yet not alienate too much at once of the publick Patrimony. The Abby of
<hi>Westminster</hi> had been founded in a Convent of <hi>Benedictines,</hi> or black Monks,
by King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor; valued at the suppression by King <hi>Henry</hi> the
8th. at the yearly sum of 3977. pounds, in good old rents, <hi>Anno</hi> 1539. At
what time having taken to himself the best and greatest part of the Lands
thereof, he founded with the rest a Collegiat Church, consisting of a Dean
and secular Canons; <hi>Benson</hi> the last Abbot, being made the first Dean of this
new erection. To <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Weston,</hi> in the first of this Queen. And being preferred unto the place by her
special favour, 'twas conceived to be no hard matter to perswade him to make a
surrendry of his Church into the hands of the Queen, that so it might return
to its former nature, and be erected into a Convent of <hi>Benedictines,</hi> without
any charge unto the Crown. And this they thought would be the easier
brought to pass, because by the preferment of Dr <hi>Owen Ogl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

compensation, if bestowed on <hi>Weston,</hi> for his surrendry of the other. But
they found a greater difficulty in it than was first imagin'd, <hi>Weston</hi> appearing
very backward in conforming to the Queens desires, partly out of a dislike
which he had of the project (he being one that never liked the profession of
<hi>Monkery</hi>) and partly out of an affection which he had to the place seated so
opportunely for the Court, and all publick businesses. But at the last he yielded
to that opportunity which he was not able to resist, and thereby gained so
much displeasure from the Cardinal Legate, that before the end of the next
year, <hi>Anno</hi> 1557. he was outed of his Deanry of <hi>Windsor,</hi> and all his other Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
promotions, upon an information of his being taken in the act of
adultery, which otherwise perhaps might have been pardoned or connived at in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:66032:35"/>
him, as in many others. But willing or unwilling he had first surrender'd
the Church of <hi>Westminster,</hi> which the Queen stocked with a new Convent of

were as many as the Lands then left unto it could well maintain. And for
the first Abbot, she made choice of Dr <hi>John Fecknam,</hi> a learned, grave, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
man, whom she had formerly made Dean of St <hi>Paul</hi>'s, in the place of Dr
<hi>William May,</hi> and now made choice of Dr <hi>Henry Cole,</hi> Arch-Deacon of Ely,
and Prolocutor of the Convocation, <hi>Anno</hi> 1555. to succeed him in it.</p>
                     <p>It was upon the 21 of <hi>November,</hi> that the new Abbot and his Monks entred
on the possession of their ancient Convent, which they held not fully out three
years, when it was once again dissolved by Act of Parliament, of which more
hereafter. Which fate befel the rest of her foundations also, two of which cost
her little more than this at <hi>Westminster.</hi> A Convent of <hi>Observants</hi> (being a
reformed Order of <hi>Franciscan</hi> Friers) had been founded by King <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th.
neer the Mannor of <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and was the first which felt the fury of King
<hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. by reason of some open opposition made by some of the Friers
in favour of Queen <hi>Katherine,</hi> the mother of the Queen now reigning. Which
moved her in a pious gratitude, to re-edifie that ruined house, and to restore as
many as could be found of that Order, to their old habitations; making up
their Corporation with some new <hi>Observants,</hi> to a competent number. She ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together also a new Convent of <hi>Dominicans,</hi> or <hi>black Friers,</hi> for whom
she provided an house in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> in the City of <hi>London,</hi>

                        </gap>itting the same
with all conveniences both for divine Offices, and other necessary uses. And
having done this, she was at no more charges with either of them; for both
the <hi>Observants</hi> and <hi>Dominicans</hi> being begging Fryers, might be resembled not

                        <hi>Sion</hi> nere <hi>Brentford,</hi> in the Country of <hi>Middlesex,</hi>
there had been anciently a house of religious women, Nuns of the Order of
St <hi>Bridget,</hi> dissolv'd as were all teh rest, by King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. Most of the
old ones dead, and the younger maried. Yet out of such of the old Nuns as
remained alive, and the addition of some others, who were willing to embrace
that course of life, a competent number was made up for a new Plantation;
but seated as before at <hi>Sion,</hi> which the Queen repaired, and laid unto it a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
estate in Lands for their future maintenance. Which house being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
dissolved also by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> came first to the possession of Sir

King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, for the relief of such pilgrims, as either went on their
Devotions to the shrine of St. <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> or any other emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Shrine or Saint in those parts of the Kingdom. On a suggestion made to
King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, that it served onely for a recepracle of vagrant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
it was surrendred to him in the last year of his Reign by the Master and
Brethren of the same; out of the Lands whereof he assigned the yearly Rent
of seven hundred Marks for the maintenance of his new working house of
<hi>Bridewel,</hi> which he had given for ever to the Lord Mayor and City of <hi>London,</hi>
as hath been signified before in the life of that King, (together with all the
beds, bedding, and other furniture, which were found in this Hospital.) And
though this Grant bare date on the 26 of <hi>June,</hi> in the last year of his Reign,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1553. yet the Lord Mayor and Aldermen entred not on the possession
of it till the month of <hi>February</hi> now last past, <hi>Anno</hi> 1555. But having took
possession of it, and so much of the Lands of this Hospital being setled on it,
the Hospital in the <hi>Savoy</hi> could not be restored to its first condition, but by a
new Endowment, from such other Lands belonging to Religious Houses
which were remaining in the Crown. But the Queen was so resolved upon
it, that she might add some works of Charity unto those of Piety, or else in
honour of her Grandfather, whose foundation she restored at <hi>Greenwich</hi> also,
the Hospital was again refounded on the third of <hi>November,</hi> and a convenient
yearly Rent allotted to the Master and Brethren for the entertainment of the
Poor, according to the tenour and effect of the first Institution. Which Prince-like
Act so wrought upon the Maids of Honor, and other Ladies of the
Court, that for the better attaining of the Queens good grace, they furnished
the same at their own costs with new beds, bedding, and other necessary fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture,
in a very ample manner. In which condition it continueth to this very
day, the Mastership of the Hospital being looked on as a good preferment for
any well deserving man about the Court; but for the most part given to some
of their Majesties Chaplains for the encouragement of learning, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of their service.</p>
                     <p>How far the Queens example, seconded by the Ladies about the Court,
countenanced by the King, and earnestly insisted on by the Pope then being,
might have prevailed on the Nobility and Gentry for doing the like, either in
restoring their Church Lands, or assigning some part of them to the like Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
it is hard to say; most probable it is, that if the Queen had lived some
few years longer, either for love to her, or for fear of gaining the Kings dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
(who was now grown too great to be disputed with, if the point
were questioned) or otherwise out of an unwillingnesse to incur the Popes
curse, and the Churches censures, there might have been very much done that
way, though not all at once. For so it was, that <hi>Philip</hi> having past over to
<hi>Calais</hi> in the month of <hi>September, Anno</hi> 1555. And the next day departing to
the Emperors Court, which was then at <hi>Brussels,</hi> where he found his father in

of so many Armies, reduced to such a low estate, as to perform the office of
an ordinary servant to his Brothers Minister. Such was the greatness to which
<hi>Philip</hi> had attained at the present time, when the Queen was most intent on
these new foundations.</p>
                     <p>As for the Pope, he had published a Bull in print at the same time also, in
which he threatned Excommunication to all manner of persons without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
as kept any Church Lands unto themselves; as also to all Princes, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen,
and Magistrates, as did not forthwith put the same in execution:
Which though it did not much edifie at the present in the Realm of <hi>England,</hi>
yet it found more obedience and conformity in that of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in which a
Parliament being called toward the end of this year, (that is to say, in the
month of <hi>June, Anno</hi> 1557.) there past a Statute for repealing all Acts, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
and Provisions made against the See Apostolick, since the 20th. year of
King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. and <hi>for abolishing of several Eccelesiastical possessions conveyed
to the Laity,</hi> as also for the extinguishment of First-fruits and Twentieth parts,
(no more than the yearly payment of the twentieth part having been laid by
Act of Parliament on the Irish Clergy) in the first and last clause whereof,
as they followed the example of the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> so possibly they might
have given a dangerous example to it in the other point, if by the Queens
death following shortly after, as well K. <hi>Philip</hi> as the Pope had not lost all their
power &amp; influence on the English Nation; by means whereof, there was no
farther progresse in the restitution of the Abbey-Lands, no more re-edifying of
the old Religious Houses, and no intention for the founding of any new.

                     <p>Thus have we seen how zealously the Queen proceeded in her way, towards
the re-establishing of the Papal greatness. Let us next look on the proceedings
of the Cardinal Legat, not as a <hi>Legat a latere</hi> from the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> but as
<hi>Legatus natus,</hi> a Metropolitan, or Archbishop of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> As Cardinal-Legat he had been never forward in the shedding of blood, declaring
many ways his aversnesse from that severity, which he saw divers of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Bishops, but especially the Butcher of <hi>London,</hi> were so bent upon. And
when he came to act as Metropolitan, he was very sparing in that kind, as far
as his own person was concerned therein; though not to be excused from suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
the under Officers of his Diocess to be too prodigal of the blood of their
Christian brethren. He had been formerly suspected for a favourer of the

the Articles of his Visitation. In two points onely he appeared to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
singular, and therefore found no followers in the times succeeding; the
first whereof was, The Registring of the names of the Godfathers and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers,
as well as of the child Baptized; which why it should be laid aside I
can see no reason, the Rubrick of the Church allowing none to perform that
office, before they have received the holy Communion. The second was, an
Enquiry, whether the Parsons, Vicars, and Curats were diligent in teaching
the Midwifes how to Christen children in time of necessity, according to the
Canons of the Church; which seemed sufficiently necessary to be put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,

thought to manifest his greatest zeal towards the maintenance of the Doctrins
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as if he had inflicted the like censures on them when
they were alive. This prompts him to a Visitation of the University of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>

to stand in need of a Reformation; but principally to exercise some more than

the wits of so many persons, Bishops, Deans, Doctors in Divinity, Canonists,
common Lawyers, Knights, and Gentlemen. But what the business was, and
how little it required such preparations, we are next to see.</p>
                     <p>The Cardinals Commissioners came to <hi>Cambridge</hi> on the 9th. of <hi>January,</hi>
where they found the rest ready to receive them, and the next day they
inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
the two Churches above mentioned, for daring to entertain the dead
bodies of such desperate Hereticks. I pretermit the eloquent speech made by
<hi>Stoaks</hi> the University-Orator, the Answer thereunto by <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Chester,</hi> the Latine Sermon preached by <hi>Peacock</hi> against Sects and
Hereticks,
together with the Solemn Mass, with which this weighty businesse was to take
beginning. Which preparations being past over, a Petition is presented to the
Cardinals Delegates in the name of the Vice-chancellor, and Heads of the
University, for taking up the bodies of the said <hi>Martin Bucer and Panlus Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glus,</hi>
to the end that some legal proceedings might be had against them, to the
terrour of others, in regard of those many dangerous and heretical Doctrines
by them formerly taught. The Petition being granted, and the dead bodies
condemned to be taken out of their graves, a publick Citation is set up at St.
<hi>Mary</hi>'s Church, the Market-place, and the common Schools, requiring the
said <hi>Martin Bucer</hi> and <hi>Paulus Fagius,</hi> or any other in their names, or in their
behalf, to appear before the Lords Commissioners on <hi>Monday</hi> the 18th. of
that Month, to answer to such Articles as then and there should be objected
against them. But the dead bones not being able to come unless they were
carried, and no body daring to appear as their Proctor or Advocate, they might
have been taken <hi>pro confessis,</hi> but that the Court was willing to proceed by
Witnesses; and to that end they took the Depositions of several persons,
touching the Doctrine taught by the said two Hereticks; and then upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
deliberation they condemned them of Heresie, ordered them to be taken
out of their graves, degraded from all holy Orders, and delivered to the secular
Magistrate. Of all this, an account is given to the Cardinal-Legat, who is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to take some course that the ordinary Writ (<hi>de comburendo Haeretic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the burning of Hereticks, might be taken out, and sent unto the Mayor of
<hi>Cambridge,</hi> without which, nothing could be done, in order to the execution
of the rest of the Sentence. The Writ accordingly comes down, and <hi>Saturday</hi>
the sixth day of <hi>February</hi> is appointed for the burning of the two dead bodies;
which being taken out of their graves, and laid in their coffins on mens shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,

as many of their Books as could be gotten, which were cast into the same

                     <p>And because one University should not mock the other, the like cruelty
was also exercised upon the dead body of <hi>Peter Martyr</hi>'s wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

grave, and sober matron while she lived, and to the poor people there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
charitable. It was supposed, that <hi>Oxon</hi> stood as much in need of a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation
as <hi>Cambrige</hi> did. A Commission is therefore granted by the Cardinal-Legat
to Doctor <hi>James Brooks</hi> Bishop of <hi>Glocester, Ormanete</hi> the Popes <hi>Datary,
Cole</hi> and <hi>Wright</hi> Doctors of the Civil Law, &amp;c. to rectifie such things as they
foundamiss in that University, or in any College of the same. It was given
them also in charge amongst other things, that they should take the body of
this good woman out of her grave, into which she had been laid <hi>Anno</hi> 1552.
and to consume the same with fire, not doubting but she was of the same
Religion which her husband had professed before. But when the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
came to execute that part of their business, they could find no witnesse
to depose any thing for certain touching her Religion, such as were brought
before them agreeing generally in this answer, That they did not understand
her Language, and therefore could not tell of what Religion she was. It was
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:66032:37"/>
therefore signified to the Cardinal, that for want of legal evidence against her,
they could not lawfully proceed in burning her body, as they had done the
bodies of <hi>Bucer</hi> and <hi>Fagius,</hi> against whom there was evidence enough to be
found in their writings, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> of
Witnesses. The Cardinal thereupon gives order to Doctor <hi>Marshal</hi> Dean of
<hi>Christ-Church,</hi> to take up her body (which had been buried near to that of St.
<hi>Frideswide</hi>) and to lay it out of Christian burial; who very readily obeyed,
took up the bones of that vertuous woman; and most prophanely buried them
in a common dunghil. But long they lay not in that place, for Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
comming to the Crown within two years after; gave order, that this body should
be decently interred, as became the quality of her person, and the reverence due
unto her husband; as also that <hi>Bucer</hi> &amp; <hi>

publickly restor'd to their former honors. In obedience unto whose commands,
the body of the one is taken out of the dunghil, and laid into the grave of
St. <hi>Frideswide,</hi> their bones so intermingled with one another, that there could be
no fear of offering the like inhumanity to them for the time to come. And that
the like honour might be done to <hi>Bucer</hi> and <hi>

Orator, in setting forth their due praises, and deserved commendations.</p>
                     <p>But we must now look back again on the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> in which
we find little more to do than the magnificent reception of <hi>Osep Napea,</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador from the great Duke of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> upon this occasion: The English
Merchants at the sollicitation of <hi>Sebastian Cabot,</hi> had furnished out some ships
for the discovery of a North-East passage towards the rich Countries of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thai</hi>
and <hi>China;</hi> in which they made so good a progress, that they attained as
far as the Port of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> one of the principal Port-towns of the Empire
of <hi>Russia,</hi> and laid the first foundation of a wealthy Trade with that mighty
Empire. For their encouragement therein, the Privileges of the <hi>Easterlings,</hi>
commonly called the Merchants of the <hi>Stilyard,</hi> (who before had managed all
the Trade of the North East parts) were seized on by King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th.
and the way thereby laid open to the Merchant-Adventurers, to encrease
their shipping with their wealth. For the continuance of which Trade betwixt
the Nations, the Emperor <hi>John Basiliwits</hi> sends his Ambassador above named,
imbarked in one of the English ships, under the conduct and government of
<hi>Richard Chancellor,</hi> the most expert Pilot of that age. But so it hapned, that
the rest of the ships being scattered by a strong tempest on the coast of <hi>Norway,</hi>
the ship which carried the Ambassador was wreckt upon the coast of <hi>Scotland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
the lading for the most part lost, amounting to twenty thousand pounds and
upwards, besides many rich presents sent from the <hi>Russian Emperor</hi> to the King
and Queen. The Ambassador with much ado was preserv'd from drowning,
but the Pilot lost, who by labouring to preserve the life of the other, neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the best opportunity to save his own. The news wherof being brought to
the Merchants of <hi>London,</hi> (who by this time were grown into a Company of
140.) they procured Letters from the King to the Regent of <hi>Scotland;</hi> for the
courteous entertainment of the said Ambassador, and the restoring of such
goods as had escaped the wreck: and having furnished him with mony and all
other necessaries, caused him to be conducted towards the Court.</p>
                     <p>Taking his leave of <hi>Scotland</hi> on the 14th. of <hi>February,</hi> he is brought

King had brought into this Realm the number of twelve thousand <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
who had possess'd themselves of twelve of the best Holds in all the Kingdome;
upbraiding the Queen with her misgovernment, and taking to himself the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

the Earl of <hi>Westmorland,</hi> and other Noble men of those parts, to watch the
Coasts, and have a care unto the safety of those Northern Provinces, By whom
he was so closely watch'd, and so well attended, that having put himself into

that he had aided and encouraged <hi>Stafford</hi> with shipping, men, mony,

of her Crown. She therefore gives notice to her subjects, that they should
forbear all traffick and commerce with the Realm of <hi>France:</hi> from which she
had received so many injuries, as could admit no reparation but by open war.
And that she might not seem to threaten what she never intended, she causeth
an army to be raised consisting of one thousand horse, four thousand foot, and
two thousand pioners, which she puts under the command of the Earl of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook,</hi>

                     <p>All which remains to be remembred in this present year, relates unto such
changes and alterations, as were made amongst the Governors of the Church,
and the Peers of the Realm. It hath been signified before, that <hi>White</hi> of <hi>Lincoln</hi>
had prevailed by his friends in Court, to be translated unto <hi>Winchester,</hi> as the

And finally, in the place of <hi>Aldrick</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carlisle,</hi> who died on the

of this year; but the particular day and time thereof I have no where found.
Within the compass of this year (that is to say the 4th. year of the Reign of
this Queen) died two other Bishops, <hi>Salcot</hi> or <hi>Capon</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Salisbury,</hi> and
<hi>Chambers</hi> the first Bishop of <hi>Peterborough;</hi> to the first of which there was no

But the <hi>French</hi> shall have it now at an easier rate; The Queen had broke

and not well pleased with the loss of that opportunity which seemed to have
been offered to him for the conquest of <hi>Naples,</hi> resolved of doing somewhat
answerable unto expectation, as well for his own honor as the good of his
Country. He had long fixed his eyes on <hi>Calais,</hi> and was informed by <hi>Senarpont</hi>
Governor of <hi>Bolloigne,</hi> and by consequence a near neighbour to it, that
the Town was neither so well fortified, nor so strongly garrisoned, but that it
might be taken without any great difficulty. For confirmation whereof, <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur,
a' Strozzie</hi> one of the Marshals of <hi>France,</hi> under the favour of a disguise,
takes a view of the place, and heartneth on the Duke with the feasibility of

had often advised the Queen to have a care of that Piece, and freely offered his

                        </gap> advice and proffer. Nay, so extreamly careless were the
Council of <hi>England</hi> in looking to the preservation and defence of this place,
that when the Duke sate down before it, there was not above 500 Soldiers, and
but two hundred fighting men amongst the Townsmen,<note place="margin">1557/8</note> although the whole
number of Inhabitants amounted to 4200 persons. On New years day the
Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> sate down before it, and on Twelfth-day, had it surrendred up
unto him by the Lord Deputy <hi>Wentworth,</hi> who had the chief command and
government of it. The noise of the thundring Canon heard as far as <hi>Antwerp,</hi>
could not but rouse the drousie <hi>English</hi> to bethink themselves of some relief to
be sent to <hi>Calais,</hi> and they accordingly provided both ships and men to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
that service. But the winds were all the while so strong and so cross
against them, that before the English ships could get out of their Havens, the
French were Masters of the Town. Some greater difficulty found the Duke
in the taking of the Castle of <hi>Guisnesse,</hi> where the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> a valiant and
expert Soldier, had the chief command. But at length the Accessories follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the same fortune with the Principal, both <hi>Guisnesse</hi> and <hi>Hanine,</hi> and all the
other Pieces in the County of <hi>Oye,</hi> being reduced under the power of the
<hi>French</hi> within few days after.</p>
                     <p>There now remained nothing to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> of all its antient
Rights in <hi>France,</hi> but the <hi>Islands</hi> of <hi>Gernsey, Jersey, Sark,</hi> and <hi>Aldernay,</hi> all
lying on the coast of <hi>Normandy,</hi> of which Dukedome heretofore accounted
members. Held by the English ever since the time of the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest,
they have been many times attempted by the French, but without successe;
never so much in danger of being lost as they were at this present. Some of the
French had well observed, that the Island of <hi>Sark</hi> (an Island of six miles in
compass) enjoyned the benefit of a safe and commodious Haven, but without
any to defend it but a few poor Hermites, whom the privacy and solitariness
of the place had invited thither. The Island round begirt with Rocks, lying
aloft above the Sea, and having onely one streight passage or ascent unto it,
scarce capable of two abreast. Of this Island the <hi>French</hi> easily possest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sevles,
dislodged the Hermites, fortifie the upper part of the Ascent with some
pieces of Ordnance, and settle a small Garrison in it to defend the Haven. But
long they had not nested there, when by a Gentleman of the <hi>Neatherlands,</hi>
one of the subjects of King <hi>Philip,</hi> it was thus regained: The Flemmish Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
with a small Bark came to Anchor in the Road, and pretending the
death of his Merchant, besought the French that they might bury him in the
Chapel of that Island, offering a present to them of such Commodities as
they had aboard. To this request the French were easily entreated, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that they should not come to shore with any weapen, no not so much

Coffin in their skiff for that us purposely provided, and manned with Swords

impossible to hide a Pen-kife, they were permitted to draw their Coffin up the
Rocks, some of the <hi>French</hi> rowing back unto the ship to fetch the Present,
where they were soon made fast enough and laid in hold. The <hi>Flemmings</hi> in the

and having taken thence their weapons gave an Alarum unto the <hi>French,</hi> who
taken thus upon the suddain, and seeing no hopes of succour from their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
yielded themselves, and abandoned the possession of that place. A Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem

round about, returned with safety to his ships. But the Flemish somewhat
more greedy on the spoil, and negligent in observing Martial Discipline, are
valiantly encountred by a Nobleman of that Country, and sent back fewer by
five hundred than they came on shoar. This was the sum of what the English
did this year, in order to the recovery of the honour which they lost at <hi>Calais;</hi>

Lawyers found for doing nothing, proceeded rather from the noise of the wars,
in which the voice of the Law cannot easily be heard, than from the quietness &amp;

been much encreased, as may be gathered from the words of <hi>Heiwood</hi> the old

Nothing else memorable in this Session, but that <hi>Fecknam</hi> the new Abbot of

                        </q> And finally taking into consideration the great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
of the State, and preparation of the enemies, they granted first unto
the Queen, a Subsidy of eight shillings in the pound, to be paid in four years,
beginning after the last payment of the former grant; and because the Laity at
that time had charged themselves with horse and armour for defence of the
Realm; the Clergy also did the like according to their several Orders and
abilities. For the imposing whereof upon the rest of the Clergy, they had no
recourse at all unto the <hi>Midwifry</hi> of an Act of Parliament, but acted the whole
business in their own Synodical way, without contradiction.</p>

an inveterate grudge, sharpned by the suggestions of Bishop <hi>Gardiner,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was signified. Being of himself a rigorous man, and one that was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
wedded to his own opinion, he had so passionately espoused the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
of the <hi>French</hi> against the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that he intended to divest <hi>Philip</hi> of the
Realm of <hi>Naples,</hi> and to confer it on the <hi>French.</hi> For this cause <hi>Francis</hi> Duke
of <hi>Guise</hi> with a puissant army is drawn into <hi>Italy</hi> for the subduing of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
but suddenly recalled again, upon the routing of the <hi>French</hi> before St
<hi>Quintin,</hi> wherein the <hi>English</hi> forces had appeared so serviceable. Which gave
the Pope so much displeasure, that he resolved to let his greatest enemies feel
the dint of his spirit. But not daring upon second thoughts to fall foul with
the Queen, he turned his fury against <hi>Pole,</hi> by whose perswasion it was thought
that the Queen had broke her league with <hi>France</hi> to take part with her husband.
In which humour he deprives him of the <hi>Legantin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Agent with the Pope, advertiseth her Majesty of these secret practices, which
the Queen concealing from the Cardinal, endeavoureth by all fair and gentle
means to mitigate the Pope's displeasure, and confirm the Cardinal in the
place and power which he then enjoyed. But the Pope not a man to be easily
altered, <hi>Pole</hi> in the mean time understanding how things went at <hi>Rome,</hi> laid
by the Cross of his Legation, and prudently abstaineth from the exercise of his
<hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Faculties. Peitow</hi> the new Cardinal Legate, puts himself on the way
to <hi>England,</hi> when the Queen taking to her self some part of her fathers spirit,
commands him at his utmost peril, not to adventure to set foot upon <hi>English</hi>
ground; to which he readily inclined, as being more affected unto Cardinal
<hi>Pole,</hi> than desirous to shew himself the servant of another mans passion. In
the end, partly by the Queens mediation, the intercession of <hi>Ormaenete,</hi> the good
successes of the <hi>French</hi> in the taking of <hi>Calais,</hi> but principally by the death of
<hi>Peitow</hi> in the <hi>April</hi> following, the rupture was made up again, and <hi>Pole</hi> confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

Which Proclamation was as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                        <q>Whereas divers books filled
with Hersie, Sedition, and Treason, have of late been dayly brought into this

printed within this Realm, and cast abroad in sundry parts thereof;
whereby not only god is dishonoured, but also incouragement given to
disobey lawful Princes and Governours; the King and Queens Majesties
for redress hereof, do by their present Proclamation, declare and publish to
all their subjects, that whosoever shall after the Proclamation hereof, be
found to have any of the said wicked and seditious books, or finding them,
do not forthwith burn the same, without shewing or reading the same to
any other persons, shall in that case be reputed and taken for a rebel, and shall
without further delay be executed for that offence, according to the order
of Martial Law.</q> Which Proclamation though it were very smart and quick,
yet there was somewhat of more mercy in it, than in another which came out
in the very same month, at the burning of seven persons in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
both at <hi>Newgate,</hi> where they were imprisoned, and at the stake where they
were to suffer; whereby it was straightly charged and commanded, <hi>That no

more odious than that of <hi>Domitian,</hi> or any of the greatest Tyrants of the elder

                        <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> telleth us of a friend
of his in the Dukedom of <hi>Saxony,</hi> that he was generally hated by the rest of
Country-men, for being hospitable to some few of the English Nation, who
had been forced to abandon their native soil. And it is further signified by
<hi rend="sup">b</hi> 
                        <hi>Ph. Melancthon</hi> with no small dislike, in an Epistle of this year, that many of
those <hi>rigid Luthe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

such as suffered death in <hi>England</hi> in defence of Religion; so that they seemed
to act the part of <hi>Diotrephes</hi> in St <hi>John, not only prating against us with malicious
words, and refusing to receive the brethren</hi> in the day of their trouble, but <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding</hi>
and condemning <hi>them that would.</hi> But <hi>John Alasco</hi> and his company
had been lately there, where they spoke so reprochfully of <hi>Luther,</hi> the <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan</hi>
Confession, the Rites and Ceremonies of their Churches, as rendred them
uncapable of any better entertainment than they found amongst them. And
by the behaviour of these men coming then from <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>rigid Lutherans</hi>
passed their judgement on the Church it self, and consequently on all those
who suffered in defence thereof. For stopping the course of which unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
censures, it was thought fit by some of the Divines in <hi>Embden,</hi> that
Archbishop <hi>Cranmers</hi> book about the Sacrament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> should be translated into La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,
and forthwith published in Print, which was done accordingly. Some of the
<hi>Lutherans</hi> had given out on the former ground, that the <hi>English</hi> had deservedly
suffered the greatest hardships both at home and abroad, because they writ and
spake less reverently of the blessed Sacrament; and it was hoped that by the
publishing of this book, they would find the contrary. The like course taken
also at <hi>Geneva</hi> by the <hi>English</hi> exiles, by publishing in the Latin tongue, a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
writ by Bishop <hi>Ridley</hi> on the self same Argument, to the end it might
appear unto all the world how much their brethren had been wronged in these
odious calumnies.</p>

                     <p>BUt in the middest of all these sorrowes, I see some hope of comfort coming
by the death of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> whose Reign polluted with the blood of so
many Martyrs, unfortunate by the frequent insurrections, and made inglorious
by the loss of the Town of <hi>Calais,</hi> was only commendable in the brevity or
shortnesse of it. For now to bring it to an end, a dangerous and contagious
Feaver began to rage in most parts of the land, insomuch that if the whole
Realm had been divided into four parts, three parts of the four would have
been found infected with it, so furiously it raged in the month of <hi>August,</hi>
that no former plague or pestilence was thought to have destroyed a greater
number, so that divers places were left void of Justices and men of worth to
govern the Kingdom. At which time died also so many Priests, that a great
number of Parish Churches in divers places were unserved, and no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>urats
could be gotten for mony: Much corn was also lost in the field for want of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers
and workmen to get it in; both which together seemed to threaten
not onely a spiritual but a temporal famine; though God so ordered it, that
by the death of so many of the present Clergy, a door was opened for the
preaching of sounder Doctrine, with far less envy and displeasure from all
sorts of people than it had been otherwise: Nor were the heats of the disease
abated by the coldness of the winter, or the malignity of it mitigated by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal
courses. It took away the Physicians as well as the Patients, two of the
Queens Doctors dying of it not long before her, and spared not more the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
than it did the Priest, insomuch that within less than the space of a
twelvemonth, almost the one half of the English Bishops had made void their
Sees; which with the death of so many of the Priests in several places, did
much facilitate the way to that Reformation, which soon after followed.</p>
                     <p>This terrible disease, together with the said effects which followed on it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the Queens death which came along with it, though not caused by it,
may seem to have been prognosticated or foretold by a dreadful tempest of
thunder, hapning on the 11th. of <hi>July</hi> near the Town of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> which
Tempest as it came through two Towns, beat down all the Houses and
Churches, the Bells were cast to the outside of the Church-yard, and some
sheets of Lead four hundred foot into the field, wri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hen like a pair of gloves.
The River of <hi>Trent</hi> running between which two Towns, the water with the
mud in the bottom was carried a quarter of a mile and cast against the trees,
the trees plucked up by the roots, and from thence cast twelve-score paces; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
a child was was taken forth of a mans hand, and by the fury of it carried an
hundred foot, two spears length from the ground, and so fell down, broke its
arm, and dyed. Five or six men thereabouts were slain, and neither flesh nor
skin perished; at what time also there fell some Hailstones that were fifteen
inches about, &amp;c. But neither that terrible disease, nor this terrible tempest,
nor any other publick signe of God's displeasure, abated any thing of the fury
of the Persecution, till he was pleased to put an end unto it by the death of
the Queen. It was upon the tenth day of <hi>November</hi> that no fewer than five
at once were burned at <hi>Canterbury.</hi> The Cardinal and the Queen both lying
on the bed of sickness, and both dying within seven days after. It had been
prayed or prophesied by those five Martyrs when they were at the stake, that
they might be the last who should suffer death in that manner, or on that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion;
and by Gods mercy so it proved, they being the last which suffered
death under the severity of this persecution.</p>
                     <p>Which Persecution, and the carriage of the Papists in it, is thus described
by Bishop <hi>Jewel,</hi>

the fire.</q> By all which several ways and means, the Martyrs in all parts of the
Kingdom amounted to the number of two hundred seventy seven persons of
all sorts and sexes; But more particularly there are said to have perished in
these flames five Bishops, twenty one Divines, eight Gentlemen, eighty four
Artificers, one hundred Husbandmen Servants and Labourers, twenty six
Wives, twenty Widows, nine Virgins, two Boys, and two Infants; the one
springing out of his mothers womb as she was at the stake, and most unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully
flung into the fire in the very birth. Sixty four more in those furious
times were presented for their faith, whereof seven were whipped, sixteen peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in prison, twelve buried in Dunghills, and many more lay in captivity
condemned, which were delivered by the opportune death of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi>
and the most auspicious entrance of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whose gracious go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
blotted out the remembrance of all former sufferings; the different
conditions of whose Reigns, with the former two, may seem to have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
in them of those appearances which were presented to <hi>Elijah</hi> in the
Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> in the first B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

written, <hi>That a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the
rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind; and after the wind an
earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake; and after the earthquake a
fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and</hi> finally <hi>after the fire a still small voice,</hi>
in which the Lord spake unto his Prophet: So in like manner it may be feared,
that God was neither in that great and terrible wind, which threw down so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Monasteries and Religious houses in the Reign of King <hi>Henry;</hi> nor in that
Earthquake, which did so often shake the very foundations of the State in the
time of King <hi>Edward;</hi> nor in the Fire, in which so many godly and religious
persons were consumed to ashes in the days of Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> but that he
shewed himself in that <hi>still small Voice,</hi> which breathed so much comfort to the
souls of his people, in the most gracious and fortunate Government of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin-Queen.</p>
                     <p>For now it pleased God to hearken to the cry of those his Saints which lay
under the <hi>Altar,</hi> and called upon him for an end of those calamities, to which
their dear brethren were exposed. The Queen had inclined unto a D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ever since the time of her supposed being with child; which inclination ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in her more and more, when her swelling fell from the right place to
her lower parts, increasing irrecoverably in despight of Physick, till at last it
brought her to her death. But there are divers other causes which are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to have contributed their concurrence in it; <hi>Philip,</hi> upon the resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his fathers Kingdoms and Estates, had many necessary occasions to be
out of the Kingdom, and yet she thought, that he made more occasions than
he needed, to be absent from her; This brought her first into a fancy that he
cared not for her, which drew her by degrees into a fixed and setled melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly,
confirmed, if not encreased, by a secret whisper, that <hi>Philip</hi> entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
some wandring Loves when he was in <hi>Flanders.</hi> Her Glasses could not so
much flatter as not to tell her, that she had her fathers feitures with her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
complexion; and she was well enough able to inform her self, that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of her humour had no great charms in it, so that on the point she want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
many of those natural and acquired attractions, which might have served to

the Emperour, which hapned on the 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a Prince, upon whose countenance and support she had much depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
both when she was in disgrace with her father, and out of favour with her
brother. But that which came nearest to her heart was the loss of <hi>Calais,</hi> first
lost for want of giving credit to the intelligence which had been sent her by
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:66032:43"/>
her Husband; and secondly by the loss of that opportunity which might have
been taken to regain it. <hi>Monsieur <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

near <hi>Graveling</hi> on the 13th. of <hi>July,</hi> he lost not onely his own liberty, but
more then five thousand of his men; the fortune of the day falling so heavily
on the Soldiers of <hi>Calais,</hi> that few of them escaped with life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that if the
Queens Navy, which had done great service in the fight, had showed it self
before the Town, and Count <hi>Egmond</hi> who commanded the <hi>Flemmings</hi> had
sate down with his victorious Army to the Landward of it, it might have been
recovered in as few days as it had been lost.</p>
                     <p>This opportunity being neglected, she gave her self some hopes of a resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
upon an agreement then in treaty between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> But when all other matters were accorded between those Crowns, and that nothing else
was wanting to compose all differences but the restoring of this Town, the
French were absolutely resolved to hold it, and the Spaniards could in honor
make no Peace without it. So the whole Treaty, and the deceiptful hopes
which she built upon it, came at last to nothing. And though she had somewhat
eased her self not long before, by attainting the Lord <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ntworth</hi> and certain
others, for their cowardly quitting of the place, which they could not hold;
yet that served onely like a cup of Strong-waters for the present qualm, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
removing the just cause of the present distemper. And it encreased so
plainly in her, that when some of her Visitants, not knowing the cause of her
discomforts, applyed their several cordials to revive her spirits, she told them
in plain tearms, that they were mistaken in the nature of her disease; and that
if she were to be dissected after her death, they would find <hi>Calais</hi> next her
heart. Thus between jealousie, shame, and sorrow, taking the growth of her
infirmity amongst the rest, she became past the help of Physick. In which extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
she began to entertain some thoughts of putting here sister <hi>Elizabeth</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
the Crown, and setling the Succession of it on her cousen the Queen of
<hi>Scots;</hi> and she had done it, (at the least as much as in her was) if some of the
Council had not told her, That neither the Act of the Succession, nor the Last
Will and Testament of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth which was built upon it,
could otherwise be repealed, than by the general consent of the Lords and
Commons assembled in Parliament. So that being altogether out of hope of
having her will upon her sister, of recovering <hi>Calais,</hi> of enjoying the company
of her husband, and reigning in the good affection of her injured subjects; she
gave her self over to those sorrows which put an end to her life on the 17th.
of <hi>November,</hi> some few hours before day, when she had reigned five years and
four months wanting two days onely. Her death accompanied within few
howers after by that of the Lord Cardinal-Legat, ushered in by the decease of

<hi>Hopton</hi> Bishop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and <hi>Brooks</hi> of <hi>Glocester:</hi> As if it had been necessary
in point of State, that so great a Princess should not die without some of her

than what may be gathered from her story, much less in descanting on that
which is made by others, who have heaped upon her many gracious praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
qualities of which, whether she were Mistress or not, I dispute not
now. She was indeed a great Benefactresse to the Clergy, in releasing them of
their Tenths and First-fruits; but she lost nothing by the bargain, the Clergy
paid her back again in their Bills of Subsidies, which growing into an annual

clearly out of her purse without retribution, was the re-edifying and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was an usual <hi>Saying</hi> of <hi>King JAMES</hi>
(Your <hi>Majestie's most Learned</hi> Grand-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
of Blessed Memory, that, <hi>Of all the
Churches in the</hi> World, <hi>He knew not any
which came nearer to the</hi> Primitive <hi>Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,
for Doctrine, Government, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
then the</hi> Reformed Church <hi>of</hi> England.
A <hi>Saying,</hi> which He built not upon Fancy, and Affection onely;
but on such Just, and Solid Reasons, as might sufficiently endear
it to all Knowing Men. The Truth, and Certainty whereof, will be
made apparent by the following <hi>History,</hi> which here, in all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
is offered to Your <hi>Majestie's</hi> View. It is <hi>(Dread Sir)</hi> an
<hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Reformation of the Church of ENGLAND,</hi>
with all the Various Fortunes, and Successes of it, from the first
Agitations in <hi>Religion</hi> under <hi>HENRY the Eight</hi> (which
served for a Preamble thereunto) until the Legal Settling, and
Establishment of it by the great <hi>Queen ELIZABETH,</hi> of Happy
Memory. A <hi>Piece</hi> not to be Dedicated to any other, then Your
<hi>Sacred Majesty;</hi> who, being rais'd by God, to be a <hi>Nursing-Father</hi>
to this part of His <hi>Church,</hi> may possibly discharge that
<pb facs="tcp:66032:47"/>
Duty with the Greater Tenderness, when You shall finde upon
what <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Piety,</hi> and <hi>Christian Prudence,</hi> the Work was
carryed on by the first <hi>Reformers.</hi> Which being once found, it
will be no hard matter to determine of such Means, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
whereby the <hi>Church</hi> may be restored to her Peace, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
from which She is most miserably fallen by our late <hi>Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</hi>
It cannot be denyed, but that some <hi>Tares</hi> grew up almost
immediatly with the <hi>Wheat</hi> it self; and seem'd so specious to
the <hi>Eye,</hi> in the <hi>Blade,</hi> or <hi>Stalk,</hi> that they were taken by some
<hi>Credulous,</hi> and <hi>Confiding</hi> Men, for the better <hi>Grain.</hi> But
still they were no more then <hi>Tares,</hi> distinguished easily in the
<hi>Fruits</hi> (the Fruits of <hi>Errour,</hi> and <hi>False Doctrine;</hi> of <hi>Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Schism, Disorder,</hi> and perhaps <hi>Sedition)</hi> from the <hi>LORD'S
good Seed.</hi> And, being of an a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

neither can pretend to the same <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and much less to the
<hi>Purity</hi> of that <hi>Sacred Seed,</hi> with which the <hi>Field</hi> was sown, at
first, by the <hi>Heavenly Husband-man.</hi> I leave the <hi>Application</hi>
of this <hi>Parable</hi> to the following <hi>History,</hi> and shall conclude with
this <hi>Address</hi> to <hi>Almighty God;</hi> That, as He hath restored
Your <hi>Majesty</hi> to the Throne of Your <hi>Father,</hi> and done it in so
strange a manner, as makes it seem a <hi>Miracle</hi> in the Eyes of
<hi>Christendom;</hi> so He would settle You in the same, on so sure
a Bottom, that no Design of <hi>Mischievous,</hi> and <hi>Unquiet</hi> Men
may disturb Your <hi>Peace,</hi> or detract any thing from those <hi>Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Here present thee with a Piece of as great variety, as
can be easily comprehended in so narrow a compass;
the History of an Affair of such Weight, and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
as had a powerful Influence on the rest of
<hi>Christendome:</hi> It is an History of the <hi>Reformation</hi>
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from the first Agitations
in Religion under <hi>HENRY the Eight,</hi> untill the final settling, and
establishing of it (in Doctrine, Government, and Worship) under
the Fortunate, and most Glorious Reign of Queen <hi>ELIZABETH.</hi>
Nor hast thou here a bare Relation onely of such Passages, as those
Times afforded, but a discovery of those Counsels, by which the
Action was conducted; the Rules of Piety and Prudence, upon
which it was carryed; the several steps, by which it was promoted,
or retarded in the Change of Times; together with the Intercurrence
of such civil Concernments, both at home, and abroad, as either were
co-incident with it, or related to it. So that We may affirm of this
present History, as <hi>Florus</hi> doth of his <hi>Compendium</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<hi>Ut non tam populi unius, quam totius generis humani;</hi> that is to say,
That it contains not onely the Affairs of one State, or Nation, but, in
a manner, of the greatest part of all Civil Governments. The Work
first hinted by a Prince of an undanted Spirit, the Master of as great a
Courage, as the World had any; and, to say truth, the Work required
it: He durst not else have grapled with that mighty Adversary, who,
claiming to be Successour to St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Vicar-General</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:66032:48"/>
to <hi>Christ</hi> over all the Church, had gained unto himself an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Sovereignty over all Christian Kings and Princes in the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
Empire:</hi> But this King being violently hurried with the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport
of some private Affections, and finding that the <hi>Pope</hi> appeared
the greatest Obstacle to his desires, he first divested him by degrees of
that Supremacy, which had been challenged, and enjoyed by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours
for some Ages past; and finally, extinguished His Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> without noise, or trouble; to the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
and astonishment of the rest of the Christian World This
opened the first way to the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and gave encouragement to
those, who enclined unto it: To which the King afforded no small
Countenance, out of Politick Ends, by suffering them to have the
Bible in the <hi>English</hi>

<hi>Tractates,</hi> as openly discovered the Corruptions of the Church of
<hi>Rome.</hi> But, for his own part, he adhered to his old Religion, severely
persecuted those, who dissented from it, and dyed (though Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated)
in that Faith, and Doctrine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he had sucked in, as it were,

and Religious Men of the lower Clergy, out of Judgment &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;
who managed the Affair according to the Word of God, the
Practice of the Primitive Times, the general current and consent of
the old Catholick Doctours; but not without an Eye to such Foreign
Churches, as seemed to have most consonancy to the antient Forms:
Promoted with like Zeal, and Industry, but not with like Integrity,
and Christian Candour, by some great men about the Court; who,
under colour of removing such Corruptions, as remained in the
Church, had cast their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which, most sacrilegiously they divided amongst themselves, without
admitting the poor King to his share therein; though nothing but the
filling of his Coffers, by the spoil of the one, and the encrease of his

the Work was vigorously carryed on by the King, and his Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours;

by the <hi>Practical part</hi> of <hi>Christian P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and in that Act (and, which is more, by <hi>Fox</hi> himself) affirmed to have
<hi>been done by the especial aid of the Holy Ghost.</hi> And here the business might
have rested, if <hi>Catvin</hi>'s Pragmatical Spirit had not interposed: He first
began to quarrel at some passages in this <hi>Sacred Liturg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> and afterwards
never left solliciting the <hi>Lord Protectour,</hi> and practising by his <hi>Agents</hi>
on the Court, the Countrey, and the Universities, till he had laid the
first Foundation of the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Faction, who laboured nothing more,
then Innovation both in Doctrine, and Discipline. To which they
were encouraged by nothing more, then some improvident Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
granted unto <hi>John A-Lasco;</hi> Who bringing with him a mixt mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of <hi>Poles,</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> obtained the Privilege of a Church for
himself and his distinct in Government, and Forms of Worship, from
the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This gave a powerful animation to the <hi>Zuinglian Gospellers</hi> (as they
are called by Bishop <hi>Hooper,</hi> and some other Writers) to practise first
upon the Church; who being countenanced, if not headed by the Earl
of <hi>Warwick</hi> (who then began to undermine the <hi>Lord Protectour)</hi> first
quarrelled the Episcopal Habit, and afterwards inveighed against
Caps, and Surplices, against Gowns, and Tippets; but fell at last upon
the Altars, which were left standing in all Churches by the Rules of
the <hi>Liturgie.</hi> The touching on this String made excellent Musick to
most of the Grandees of the Court, who had before cast many an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious

that, might have served the turn. Besides, there was no small spoil
to be made of <hi>Copes,</hi> in which the Priest officiated at the <hi>Holy Sacrament;</hi>
some of them being made of Cloth of Tyssue, of Cloth of Gold and
Silver, or embroidered Velvet; the meanest being made of Silk, or Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,

much insisted on by one of that number, to justifie his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing

there must needs be a vast disproportion between such
<hi>Contracts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> as were founded upon <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> Legally

of the <hi>Three Estates,</hi> and those, which have no
other Ground, but the bare <hi>Votes,</hi> and <hi>Orders,</hi> of both <hi>Houses</hi>

may as well justifie the late horrid Murther committed
on the most incomparable Majesty of <hi>King CHARLES

and <hi>Sates,</hi> as were <hi>Contracted</hi> for, with some of those very

When I shall see him do the one, I must bethink my self
of some further <hi>Arguments</hi> to refute the other.</p>
                  <p>And so <hi>Queen MARY</hi> makes Her <hi>Exit,</hi> and leaves the

most passionately desired the Enjoyment of it under Her

the Piety of their Desire, as soon as She had Power,
and Opportunity, to go thorough with it. In Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
of which Work, She raised Her whole <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick</hi>
on the same <hi>Foundation,</hi> which had been lay'd

of it, by the Care of</hi> ALEXANDER. For,
in the first Year of Her <hi>Reign,</hi> the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> being first
<hi>Reviewed,</hi> and qualified in some Particulars, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by PARLIAMENT; in <hi>Her</hi> first Year,
the <hi>Articles of Religion</hi> were agreed upon the <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
and in the Eight, the <hi>Government of the Church,</hi>
by <hi>Arch-Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> received as strong a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,
as the <hi>Laws</hi> could give it. And, for this last,
We are beholden unto <hi>BONNER,</hi> the late Bishop
of <hi>LONDON,</hi> who being called upon, to take the
<hi>OATH of Supremacie,</hi> by <hi>HORN</hi> of <hi>Winton,</hi> refused to
take the <hi>OATH,</hi> upon this Account, because <hi>HORNs
<pb facs="tcp:66032:51"/>
Consecration</hi> was not good, and valid, by the <hi>Laws</hi> of the
Land: Which he insisted on, because the <hi>Ordinal,</hi>
Established in the Reign of King <hi>EDWARD,</hi> (by
which both <hi>HORN,</hi> and all the rest of Queen <hi>ELIZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BETH</hi>'s
Bishops received <hi>Consecration<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>)</hi> had been
discharged by Queen <hi>MARY;</hi> and not restored by any
<hi>Act of Parliament</hi> in the present Reign. Which being first
declared by <hi>PARLIAMENT,</hi> in the Eighth of this
Queen, to be <hi>Casus omissus,</hi> or rather, that the <hi>Ordinal</hi> was
looked upon, as a part of the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> which had been
solemnly confirmed in the first of this Queen's Reign,
they next <hi>Enacted,</hi> and <hi>Ordained,</hi> That <q>all such Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
as were Consecrated by that <hi>Ordinal,</hi> in the
Times precedent, or should be Consecrated by it, in
the time to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> should be reputed, to be lawfully
Ordained, and Consecrated, to all Intents, and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
in the Law, whatever.</q> Which added as much
Strength to the <hi>Episcopal Government,</hi> as the Authority of
Man, and an <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> could possibly Conferr
upon it. This made the <hi>Queen</hi> more constant to Her
former Principles, of keeping up the <hi>Church</hi> in its Power,
and Purity, without subjecting it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to any, but Her Self
alone: She looked upon Her Self, as the Sole Fountain
of both <hi>Jurisdictions,</hi> which She resolved to keep in their
proper Chanels; neither permitting them to mingle Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
upon any occasion, nor suffering either of them to
invade, and destroy the other. And to this <hi>Rule</hi> She was
so constant, that when one <hi>Morrice,</hi> being then <hi>Attorney</hi> of
the <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> had offered a <hi>Bill,</hi> ready drawn, to
the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> in the Thirty Fifth of Her <hi>Reign,</hi> for
the Retrenching of the <hi>Ecclesiastical Courts,</hi> in much
Narrower Bounds; She first commanded <hi>Coke,</hi> then <hi>Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi>
(and afterwards successively Chief Justice of either
Bench) not to admit of any such Seditious <hi>Bills,</hi> for the
time to come. And, that being done, She caused the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the said Attorney to be seized upon, deprived him
<pb facs="tcp:66032:52"/>
of his Place in the <hi>Dutchy-Court,</hi> disabled him from Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising
as a <hi>Common-Lawyer;</hi> and, finally, shut him up in
<hi>Tutbury</hi>-Castle, where he continued till his Death. By
which Severity, and keeping the like Constant Hand in
the Course of Her Government, She held so great a Curb
on the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction, that neither Her <hi>Parliaments,</hi> nor
Her Courts of Justice, were from thenceforth much
troubled with them, in the rest of Her Reign.</p>

consulted all such Acts of Parliament, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
my Purpose, advised with many Foreign Writers,
of great Name, and Credit, exemplified some Records,

I am to let thee know, that, in the whole Carriage of this
Work, I have assumed unto my Self the Freedom of a

I may, it is but in such Cases onely, and on such occasions,

of the good <hi>Samaritan,</hi> in using Wine, or Vineger, to cleanse
the Wound, as well as Oyl to qualifie the Grief of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation.
I know it is impossible (even in a Work of
this Nature) to please all Parties, though I have made it
my Endeavour to dissatisfie none, but those, that <hi>hate to be

wedded to their own Opinions, that neither

                  <p>THe Reader is to be informed of a mistake occuring in the first part of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
folio 126, where it is said that no care had been taken for translating
the English Liturgy into the Irish tongue for the use of that Church from that
day to this. Whereas it hath been since translated into that language, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to the people for Gods publique service, though not so generally made use
of as it ought to be; Neither the Bible, nor the book of Homilies being yet transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
which makes the Liturgy imperfect, and the whole service of the Church
defective in the maine parts of it. The Reader also is to know, that since these
sheets were upon the Presse the Lord Marquesse of <hi>Hartford</hi> mentioned part 1 fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio

Descended from his Father, by the united Families of

the Right of his Succession) of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Race; so that all Titles seemed to
be Concentred in the Person of this Infant Prince, which Might assure the
Subjects of a Peaceable, and un-troubled Reigne, so much the more, because
his Mothers Marriage was not subject unto any Dispute (as were those of the two

though of a Family truely Noble, and of great Antiquity. Concerning
which, it will be necessary to Premise somewhat in this place, not only for the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

began the rise of his following Fortunes, exceedingly improved by the

                     </gap>shined all the other Ladies, and in short time
had gained exceeding much on the King, a great admirer of Fresh Beauties,
and such as could pretend unto no command on his own affections. Some La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
who had seen the pictures of both Queenes at <hi>White Hall</hi> Gallery, have
entertained no small dispute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to which of the two they were to give Preheminence
in point of beauty; each of them having such a plentifull measure of Perfections,
as to Entitle either of them to a Superiority. If Queen <hi>Ann</hi> seemed to have the
more lively countenance, Queen <hi>Jane</hi> was thought to carry it in the exact symi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
which showed it selfe in all her features; and what she carried on that side,
by that advantage, was over-ballanced on the other by a pleasing sprightfulnesse,
which gained as much upon the hearts of all beholders. It was conceived by
those Great Critticks in the schooles of Beauty, that love which seemed to
threaten in the eyes of Queen <hi>Jane,</hi> did only seem to sport it selfe in the eyes of
Queen <hi>Ann,</hi> that there was more Majesty in the Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>b of Queen <hi>Jane Seimour,</hi>
and more lovelinesse in that of Queen <hi>Ann Bollen;</hi> yet so, that the Majesty
of the one did excell in Lovelyness, and that the Lovelinesse of the other did
exceed In majesty. Sir <hi>John Russell,</hi> afterwards Earle of <hi>Bedford,</hi> who had
beheld both Queens in their greatest Glories, did use to <hi>say that the richer Queen</hi>
Jane <hi>was in clothes, the fairer she appeared; but that the other, the richer she was
apparrelled, the worse she looked:</hi>

to the Beauties of Nature, and that Queen <hi>Jane</hi> did sometimes help her selfe by
externall Ornaments. In a word, she had in her all the Graces of Queen
<hi>Ann,</hi> but Governed (if my conjecture doth not faile me) with an evener, and
more constant temper, or if you will, she may be said to be equally made up of
the two last Queens,<note place="margin">1536.</note> as having in her all the Attractions of Queen <hi>Ann,</hi> but

from the eye of the King: or, that love should not worke in him it's accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed

to discovery, that the Queen cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>left at liberty,</hi> both before God and man, <hi>to follow his affection, already setled on
the Party, for whose sake</hi> she was reduced unto that condition; and <hi>whose name
she could some while since have pointed to, his Grace not being ignorant of her sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions.</hi>
And it appeared by the event, that she was not much mistaken in the
Mark she aimed at. For, scarce had her lementable death, which happened on

and openly showed her as his Queen in the <hi>Whitsontide</hi> following. A
Marriage, which made some alteration in the face of the Court, in the advancing
of her kindred, and discountenancing the Dependants of the former Queen; but
otherwise produced no change in Affaires of State. The King proceeded as

little truth,<note place="margin">Ann. <hi>Hen. 8. p.</hi> 117.</note> that on the 13th. day of <hi>October,</hi> then next following (that being but
the sixth day after his birth) he was created Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> Duke of <hi>Cornwall,</hi>
Earle of <hi>Chester,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Lord Herb. Hist. fol. 430.</note> In which, though I may easily excuse <hi>John Stow,</hi> and
Bishop <hi>Goodwine,</hi> who report the same; yet I shall never pardon the late Lord
<hi>Herbert</hi> for his incuriosity, as one that had fit opportunities to know the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
For first, Prince <hi>Edward</hi> was never created Duke of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and there
was no reason why he should; he being actually Duke of <hi>Cornwall</hi> at the houre
of his birth, according to the <hi>Entaile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> which was made of that Dukedome to the
Crown, by King <hi>Edward</hi> the third. And secondly, he was never created Prince
of <hi>Wales,</hi> nor then, nor any time then after following, his Father dying in the
midst of the preparations which were intended for the Pomp and Ceremony of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66032:57"/>
that Creation. This truth confessed by Sir <hi>John Haywood,</hi> in his History of the
Life and Reig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of this King; and generally avowed by all our Heralds, who
reckon none of the children of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, amongst the Princes of
<hi>Wales,</hi> although all of them successively by vulgar Appellation had been so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled.
Which appeares more plainly by a <hi>particular</hi> of the Robes and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which were preparing for the day of this Solemnity, as they are entred
on Record in the book called <hi>The Catalogue of Honour,</hi> published by <hi>Thomas
Mills</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> where it appeares also, that they were prepared only, but
never used, by reason of the Kings death, which prevented the Sollemnities of it.</p>
                  <p>The ground of this Error, I conceive first to be taken from <hi>John Stow,</hi> who finding
a creation of some Noble men, and the making of many Knights, to relate to the 18
day of <hi>October,</hi> supposed it to have been done with reference to the Creation of
a Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> whereas, if I might take the liberty of putting in my own
conjecture, I should conceive rather that it was done with Reference to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Christning, as in like manner we find a creation of three Earles, and five to
inferiour Titles, at the Christning of the Princesse <hi>Mary,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Stow Chron. fol. 863.</note> born to King <hi>James,</hi>
after his coming into <hi>England,</hi> and Christened upon Sunday, the fifth of
<hi>May.</hi> 1604. And I conceive withall, that Sir <hi>Edward Seimour,</hi> Vicount
<hi>Beauchamp,</hi> the Queenes elder brother, was then created Earle of <hi>Hartford,</hi> to
make him more capable of being one of the Godfathers; or a Deputy-Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at the least, to the Royall Infant, the Court not being then in a condition, by
reason of the mournfull accident of the late Queenes death, to show it selfe in
any extraordinary splendour, as the occasion had required at another time. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
which persons so advanced to the Dignity and degree of Knighthood, I
find Mr. <hi>Thomas Seimour,</hi> the Queenes youngest brother, to be one of the
number, of whom we shall have frequent occasion to speak more fully and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
in the course of this History. No other alteration made in the face of
the Court, but that Sir <hi>William Pawlet</hi> was made Treasurer, and Sir <hi>John Rus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell</hi>
Comptroller of his Majesties Houshold, on the said 18th. day of <hi>October</hi>
(which I conceive to be the day of the Princes Christning (both of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>But, in the face of the Church, there appeared some lines, which looked di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
towards a Reformation. For, besides the surrendring of divers Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and the executing of some Abbots, and other Religious Persons for their
stiffenesse (if I may not call it a perversenesse) in opposing the Kings desires;
there are two things of speciall note, which concurred this year, as the Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticks,

                     </gap>ore-runners of those great events, which after followed in his
Reign. For it appeares by a Memoriall of the Famous Library of Sir <hi>Robert Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cot. M. S. p. 325.</note> that <hi>Grafton</hi> now made known to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> the finishing of the <hi>English</hi>

                        <hi>Speed ex</hi> John Leshly. Fol. 1014.</note> To whom he sent a <hi>Breve</hi> to this effect: <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <q>That he would assist him against King <hi>Henry,</hi> whom in his Consistory,
he had pronounced to be an Heretick, a Scismatick, a manifest Adulterer, a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Murtherer, a committer of Sacriledge, a Rebell, and convict of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sae
Majestatis,</hi> for that he had risen against his Lord, and therefore that he
had justly deprived him of his Kingdom, and would dispose the same to him,
and other Princes, so as they would assist him in the recovery of it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This could not be so closely carried, but that the King had notice of it, who
from thenceforth began to have a watchfull eye upon the Actions of his Nephew;
sometimes alluring him unto his party, by offering him great hopes and favours,
and practising at other times to weaken, and distract him, by animating, and
maintaining his owne Subjects against him. At last, to set all right between
them, an enterview was appointed to be held at <hi>York,</hi> proposed by <hi>Henry,</hi> and
condescended to by <hi>James.</hi> But, when the day appointed came, the <hi>Scots</hi> King
failed, being deterred from making his appeareance there, by some Popish Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
who put into his head, a fear of being detained a Prisoner, as <hi>James</hi> the
first had been by King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth. Upon this breach the King makes ready
for a Warr, sets out a manifest of the Reasons which induced him to it, amongst
which he insists especially on the neglect of performing that Homage, which
anciently had been done (and still of Right ought to be done) to the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
In prosecuting of which Warr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> entred <hi>Scotland</hi> with an

on the third day after with the newes of the death of King <hi>James,</hi> and the
birth of the young Queen his daughter. This put King <hi>Henry</hi> on some thoughts
of uniting the two Crowns in a firme and everlasting League, by the Marriage
of this infant Queen, with his Son Prince <hi>Edward:</hi> In pursuance whereof he sent
for the inprisoned Lords, feasted them royally at <hi>White Hall,</hi> and dealt
so effectually with them by himselfe and his Ministers, that they all severally

                  <p>For a companion at his book, or rather for a Proxie to bear the punishment

as also amongst those Legatees which are therein mentioned, the King
bequeathing him the Legacy of one hundred markes. But, whether I hit right
or not, most probable it is, that he had a very easie substitution of it; the
harmlessenesse of the Princes nature, the ingenuity of his disposition, and his
assiduity at his book, freeing him for the most part from such corrections, to
which other children at the schoole are most commonly subject. Yet, if it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
happened, as it seldome did, that the servant suffered punishment for his
Masters errors. It is not easie to affirm, whether <hi>Fits Patrick</hi> smarted more for
the fault of the Prince, or the Prince conceived more griefe for the smart of <hi>Fits
Patrick.</hi> Once I am certain that the Prince entertained such a reall Estimation

turnes in the succession, as it after proved. And though a threefold cord be
not easily broken, yet he obtained further power for disposing the Crown, if
their issue failed; whereof, being now sick, and fearing his approaching end, he
resolved to make such use in laying down the State of the succession to the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66032:60"/>
Crown Imperiall, as was more agreeable to his private passions, then the Rules
of Justice; which appeared plainly by his excluding of the whole <hi>Scottish</hi> Line,
descended from the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> his eldest sister, from all hopes thereof; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
perhaps it may be said, that the <hi>Scottish</hi> Line might be sufficiently provided

was the <hi>Scot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This care being over, and the Succession setled by his Last Will and Testament,
bearing date, the 28th. of <hi>December,</hi> being a full moneth before his death, he
began to entertaine some feares and Jealousies, touching the safety of the Prince,
whom he should leave unto a factious and divided Court, who were more like
to serve their own turns by him, then advance his interest His brother-in-Law,
the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> (in whom he most confided) died not long before; the
kindred of Queen <hi>Jane</hi> were but new in Court, of no Authority in themselves,
and such as had subsisted chiefly by the countenance, which she had from
him. As they could contribute little to the defence of the Princes person, and
the preservation of his Right<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; So there were some who had the Power, (and
who could tell but that they also had the will?) to change the whole frame of
his design, and take the Government to themselves. Amongst which
there was none more feared then the Noble Lord <hi>Henry,</hi> Earle of <hi>Surrey,</hi> the
eldest son of <hi>Tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>as Howard,</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> strong in Alliance and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance,
of a Revenue not inferiour to some forreign Kings, and that did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
his Pedigree from King <hi>Edward</hi> the first. The Earle himselfe, beheld in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
by the <hi>English</hi> as the chiefe Ornament of the Nation; Highly esteemed
for his Chivalry, his Affability, his learning, and whatsoever other Graces might
either make him amiable in the eyes of the people, or formidable in the sight
of a jealous, impotent, and way-ward Prince. Against him therefore, and
his Father, there were Crimes devised, their persons put under an Arrest, their
Arraignment prosecuted at the Guild Hall in <hi>London,</hi> where they both received
the sentence of death; which the Earle suffered on the Tower Hill, on the 19.
of <hi>January,</hi> the old Duke being reserved by the Kings death, (which followed
within nine dayes after) for more happy times. Which brings into my minde a

twelve: Lords and Knights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eighteen; of Abbots and Priors thirteen; Monks, and
Religious Persons, about seventy seven; and many more of both Religions, to
a very great number. So as it cannot be denied, that he had too much (as all
great Monarchs must have somewhat) of the Tyrant in him. And yet I dare not
say with Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh, That if all the patterns of a mercilesse Prince had
been lost in the World, they might have been found in this one King;</hi> some of his
Executions being justifiable by the very nature of their Crimes, others
to be imputed to the infelicity of the times in which he lived, and may be ascribed
unto Reasons of State, the Exigences whereof are seldom squared by the Rule
of Justice.</p>
                  <p>His Infirmity, and the weaknesse which it brought upon him, having confined
him to his bed, he had a great desire to receive the Sacrament; and being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to receive it in the easiest posture, sitting, or raised up in his bed, he would
by no meanes yield unto it; but caused himselfe to be taken up, placed in his
chaire, in which he heard the greatest part of the Office, till the Consecration,
and then Received the Blessed Sacrament on his knees,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 211.</note> as at other times, saying
withall, as <hi>Sanders</hi> doth Relate the story, <hi>That if he did not only cast himselfe
upon the ground, but even under it also, he could not give unto the Sacrament the
Honour which was due unto it.</hi> The instant of his death approaching, none of
his Servants, though thereunto desired by his Physitians, durst acquaint him with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66032:61"/>
it. Till at last Sir <hi>Anthony Denny</hi> undertook that ungratefull office, which the
King entertaining with lesse impatience then was looked for from him, gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that Arch-Bishop <hi>Cramner</hi> should be presently sent for. But, the Arch-Bishop
being then at his house in <hi>Croyden,</hi> seven miles from <hi>Lambeth,</hi> it was
so long before he came, that he found him speechlesse. Howsoever, applying
himselfe to the Kings present condition, and discoursing to him on this Point,
that Salvation was to be obtained only by Faith in Christ, he desired the King,
that if he understood the effect of his words, and believed the same, he would
signifie as much by some signe or other, which the King did by ringing him gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the hand, and within short time after he gave up the Ghost, when he had
lived fifty five yeares, seven moneths, and six dayes over, of which he had
Reigned thirty seven yeares, nine moneths, and six dayes also.</p>
                  <p>Having brought King <hi>Henry</hi> to his death, we must next see in what estate he

exercised in <hi>England</hi> by his Predecessors; and all the Princes of his Party, in
<hi>Germany, Italy,</hi> and elsewhere, either in Action, or Design, concurring with
him. The Protestant Kings and Princes he had disobliged, by repudiating the

or nothing the richer for it. In so much, that in the yeare 1543. being
within lesse then seven yeares after the Generall suppression of Religious Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
he was faign to have recourse for moneyes to his Houses of Parliament, by
which he was supplied after an extraordinary manner; the Clergy at the same
time giving him a subsidy of 6. s. in the pound, to be paid out of all their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Promotions, poore stipendary Priests paying each 6. s. 8. d. to encrease the
summe. Which also was so soon consumed, that the next yeare he prest his
Subjects to a Benevolence, for carrying on his Warr with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi>
and in the next obtained the Grant for all Chanteries, Hospitalls, Colledges, and
Free-Chappells, within the Realm, though he lived not to enjoy the benefit of it,
as before was said.</p>
                  <p>Most true it is, that it was somewhat of the latest before he cast his eye on
the Lands of Bishoppricks, though there were some who thought the time long
till they fell upon them. Concerning which there goes a story, that after the
<hi>Court-Harpies</hi> had devoured the greatest part of the spoyle, which came by the
suppression of Abbyes, they began to seek some other way, to satiate that gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Appetite, which the division of the former booty had left unsatisfied; and
for the satisfying whereof, they found not any thing so necessary as the Bishops
Lands. This to effect, Sir <hi>Thomas Seimour</hi> is imployed as the fittest man, as
being in favour with the King, as brother to Queen <hi>Jane,</hi> his most, and best
beloved wife; and having the opportunity of accesse unto him, as being one of the
Gentlemen of his Privy Chamber. And he not having any good affection to
Arch-Bishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> desired that the experiment should be tryed on him, and
therefore took his time to informe the King, that my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> did
nothing but fell his woods, letting long leases for great fines, and making ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock
of the Royalties of his Arch-Bishopprick, to raise thereby a fortune to his
wife and children; withall, he did acquaint the King, that the Arch-Bishop
kept no hospitality, in respect of such a large Revenue; and that in the opinion
of many wise men it was more meet for the Bishops to have a sufficient yearely
Stipend out of the Exchequer, then to be so encumbred with temporall Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
being so great a hindrance to their Studies, and Pastorall Charge, and
that the said Lands and Royalists being taken to his Majesties use, would afford
him (besides the said Annuall Stipends) a great yearly Revenue. The King soon
smelt out the Device, and shortly after sent him on an Errand to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
dinner time, where he found all the tables in the great Hall to be very boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
furnished, the Arch-Bishop himselfe accompanied at dinner, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
persons of Quality, his Table exceeding plentifully served, and all things
answerable to the Port of so great a Prelate: Wherewith the King being made
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66032:62"/>
acquainted at his coming back, he gave him such a Ratle for his false informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the design which visibly depended on it, that neither he, nor any
other of the Courtiers, durst stir any further in the suite, whilest King <hi>Henry</hi>
lived.</p>
                  <p>But the King, considering further of it, could not think fit that such a plausible
Proposition, as taking to himselfe the Lands of the Bishops, should be made in
vaine. Only he was resolved to prey further off: and not to fall upon the
spoyle two neere the Court, for feare of having more partakers in the Booty,
then might stand with his profit. And to this end the deales with <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

away, without any derogation to the Church, in Power or Patrimony. But, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks
being more essentiall to the constitution of the same, he did not only
preserve, as before he found them, but increased their number. Such of the
old Cathedralls as were founded on a Prior and Covent, he changed into a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration

And that the Church might be continually furnished with sufficient Seminaries,
he sounded a Grammer Schoole in every one of his Cathedralls, either old or
new, with Annuall pensions to the Master<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and some allowance to be made to
the children yearely; and ordained also, that in each of the two Universities
there should be publick Readers, in the faculties of Divinity, Law and Physick,

                  <p>As for the Polity of the Church, he setled it in such a manner, that Arch-bishops
and Bishops might be chosen, confirmed, and consecrated, and all the
Subjects be relieved in their suits and Grievances, without having such Recourse

For<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having by his Proclamation, of the 19th. of <hi>September, Anno</hi> 1530.

which were annexed unto that Title.</hi> In the forme of consecrating Arch-Bishops,
and Bishops, and the rule by which they excercised their Jurisdiction, there was
no change made, but what the transposition of the Supreme Power, from the
Pope to the King, must of necessity infer. For, whereas the Bishops and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
in the Convocation <hi>An.</hi> 1532. had bound themselves neither to make, nor
execute any Canons, or Constitutions Ecclesiasticall, but as they were thereto en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
by the Kings Authority; it was by them desired, assented to by him, and
confirmed in Parliament, that all such Canons, and Constitutions, Synodall
and Provinciall, as were before in use, and neither Repugnant to the Word of
God, the kings Prerogative Royall, or the known Lawes of the Land, should
remaine in force, till a review thereof were made by thirty two Persons of the
Kings appointment. Which review, not having been made from that time to
this, all the said old Canons, and Constitutions so restrained and qualified, do
still remaine in force, as before they did. For this Consult the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                  <p>In Reference to the Regall State, he added to the Royal Stile, these three Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Attributes, that is to say. <hi>Defender of the Faith, The Supreme Head on Earth

the Title of <hi>Supreme Head,</hi> conferred upon him by the Convocation, in the year
1530. and confirmed by Act of Parliament, in the 26 yeare of his Reign, hath
been showne before. That of <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> was first bestowed upon

afterwards Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> hath been preserved ever since amongst
the choisest Rarities of the <hi>Vatican Library.</hi> Certain it is, that the Pope was
so well pleased with the present, as to receive the same in a Sollemn Assembly of
the Cardinalls, and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> expressing the contentment which he
took therein, by a fluent Oration, the Copy whereof we have in <hi>Speed,</hi> Fol.

Twenty three yeares the King enjoyed this Title, by no other Grant, then

Granted by that Pope, as a Personall favour, and not intended to descend upon
his Posterity, as also, that the Popes, by the reason of such differences as were
between them, might possibly take a time to deprive him of it, he resolved to
stand no longer on a ground of no greater certainty. And therefore, having
summoned his High Court of Parliament, to Assemble on the 29th. of <hi>March,

<hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> Defender of the Faith, and on Earth of the
Churches of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Supreme Head. By vertue of which
Act Queen <hi>Mary</hi> still retained this Title, though she disclaimed the other of
Supreme Head, by Act of Parliament, in the first yeare of her Reign, as being
incompetible with her submission, and Relations to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the Title of King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> it was first given unto this King, by a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
there holden in the Month of <hi>June,</hi> 1541. under Sir <hi>Anthony Saint-Leiger</hi>
being then Lord Deputy. The Acts whereof being transmitted to the King, and
by him confirmed, he caused himselfe to be first Proclaimed King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> on
the 23th. of <hi>January,</hi> then next following. Which, though it added some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to him in point of Title, yet it afforded him no advantage in point of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
but that the name of King was thought to carry more respect and awe with
it amongst the <hi>Irish,</hi> then the Title of <hi>Lord,</hi> which only till that time had been
assumed by the Kings of <hi>England.</hi> For, otherwise the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> from
the first Conq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>est of the Country by King <hi>Henry</hi> the second, enjoyed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
all manner of Royalties, and Preheminences, which do, or can belong
to the greatest Kings; Governing the same by their <hi>Vice-Ger<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nts,</hi> to whom
sometimes they gave the Title of <hi>Lord Lieutenants,</hi> sometimes <hi>Lord Deputies</hi> of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> then whom no <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> in the VVorld comes nearer to the Pomp and
splendor of a Soveraign Prince. And though they took no other Title to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
then <hi>Lords</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet they gave higher Titles to their Subjects there,
many of which they advanced to the Honour, and Degree of Earles. And at the
same time, when King <hi>Richard</hi> the second contented himselfe with no Higher Stile
then <hi>Lord of Ireland,</hi> he exalted his great Favourite <hi>Robert d' Vere,</hi> the tenth
Earle of <hi>Oxon,</hi> of that Family, first, to the Dignity and Stile of Marquesse of
<hi>Dublin,</hi> and after to the invidious Appellation of Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which he
enjoyed unto his death. The Countrey at the same time changed it's Title also,
being formerly no otherwise called in our Records, then <hi>Terra Hiberniea,</hi> or the
Land of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but, from henceforth to be called upon all occasions, in Acts
of Parliament, Proclamations, and Letters Patents, by the name of <hi>Regnum
Hiberniae,</hi> or the Realm of <hi>Ireland.</hi> At the assuming of which new Title, by
this King, the <hi>Scots</hi> were somewhat troubled, but the Pope much more; The
<hi>Scots</hi> had then some footing in the North parts of that Iland, and thought, the
taking of that Title by the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> to tend to the endangering of
their possession, or at least to bring them under a Subjection of a Foreign Prince.
And on the other side, it was complained of in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> as a great
and visible encroachment on the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pall Power, to which it only appertained,
to erect new Kingdomes; and that the injury was the greater in the present case,
because the King holding that Iland by no other Title, (as it was then, and
there pretended) then by the Donation of Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> to King <hi>Henry</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
was not with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ut the Popes consent to assume that Title. But, the King ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
as little for the Pope, as he did for the <hi>Scots,</hi> knowing how able he was to
make good all his Actings against them both; and not only for enjoying this
Title for the rest of his life, but for the leaving of it to his Heires and Successors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:66032:64"/>
though afterward Queen <hi>Mary</hi> accepted a new Grant of it from the Pope then
being.</p>
                  <p>Having thus setled and confirmed the Regall Style, his next care was for set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and preventing all disputes and quarrells, which might be raised about the
Succession of the Crown, if the Prince, his son, should chance to dye without
lawfull issue, as he after did. In which, as he discharged the trust reposed in him, so
he waved nothing of the Power which he had took unto himself by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
made in that behalfe, in the 35 year of his Reign, as before wasnoted. In
pursuance whereof, finding himself sensibly to decay, but having his wits and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
still about him, he framed his last Wil and Testament, which he caused
to be signed and attested on the 30 of <hi>December, Anno</hi> 1546, being a full Month
before his death. First published by Mr. <hi>Fuller,</hi> in his Church History of <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
Lib. 5. Fol.</hi> 243, 244. And out of him I shall crave leave to transcribe so
much thereof, as may suffice to show unto posterity the sence he had of his own
condition, the vile esteem he had of his sinfull body, what pious, but unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
care he took, for the Decent Interment of the same; in what it was wherein
he placed the hopes of Eternall life; and finally, what course he was pleased to
take in the intailing of the Crown after his decease, by passing over the line of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and setling the Reversion in the House of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> if his own children
should depart without lawfull Issue, as in fine they did. In which, and in some
other points, not here summed up, the Reader may best satisfie himselfe by the
words and tenour of the VVill, which are these that follow.</p>
                  <p>IN the name of God, and of the Glorious and blessed Virgin, our Lady <hi>St. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and of all the Holy Company of Heaven: We <hi>Henry,</hi> by the Grace of
God King of <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> Defender of the Faith, and in
Earth immediately under God, the Sùpreme Head of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> of that name the eighth; Calling to our remembrance the
great gifts and benefits of Almighty God, given unto us in this Transitory life,
give unto him our most lowly and humble thanks, acknowledging our selves
insufficient in any part to deserve, or recompence the same. But feare that
we have not worthily received the same; and considering further also, that
we be, (as all mankinde are) mortall, and borne in sin, believing never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse,
and hoping that every Christian creature living here in this Transito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
and Wretched World, under God, dying in stedfast and perfect Faith,
endeavouring, and exercising himselfe to execute in this life time, if he have
leisure, such good deeds, and charitable workes, as Scripture commandeth,
and as may be to the Honour and pleasure of God, is Ordained by Christ's Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to be sacred, and attain eternall Life; of which number we verily trust
by his Grace to be one.</p>
                  <p>And that every creature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the more high that he is in Estate, Honour, and
Authority in this World, the more he is bound to love, serve, and thank God,
and the more diligently to endeavour himselfe to do good and charitable works,
to the Laud, Honour, and Praise of Almighty God, and the Profit of his
soul; We also calling to remembrance the dignity, Estate. Honour, Rule
and Governance that Almighty God hath called us to in this World; and that
neither we, nor any other creature mortall knoweth, the place, time, when, nor
where it shall please Almighty God to call him out of this Transitory World;
Willing therefore, and minding with Gods grace, before our passage out of
the same, to dispose and order our latter Mind, Will, and T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66032:64"/>
of all Godly brethren in Earth, Have now, being of whole and perfect
mind, adhering wholly to the right Faith of Christ, and his Doctrine, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
also our old and detestable life, and being in perfect will and mind, by
his Grace, never to returne to the same, and such like. And minding, by Gods
Grace, never to vary therefrom as long as any remembrance, truth, or inward
knowledge doth, or may, remaine within this mortall body; most humbly and
heartily do commend, and bequeath our soul to Almighty God, who in person
of the Son redeemed the same, with his most pretious body and blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in time of
his Passion: And for our better remembrance thereof, hath left here with us
in his Church Militant, the Consecration and Administration of his most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Body and Blood, to our no little Consolation and Comfort, if we as
thankfully accept the same, as he lovingly and undeservedly on mans behalfe,
hath ordained it for our only benefit, and not his.</p>
                  <p>Also, we do instantly require, and desire the blessed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
with all the Holy Company of Heaven, continually to pray for us;
whilest we live in this World, and in the time of passing out of the same, that
we may the sooner attain everlasting life, after our departure out of this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory
life, which we do both hope and claime by Christs Passion; And for my
body, when the soul is departed, shall then remaine but as a <hi>Cadaver,</hi> and so
returne to the vile matter it was made of; were it not for the Crown and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
which God hath called us unto, and that we would not be counted an inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the people, to do injury to the Dignity, which we are unworthily called unto,
we are content, and also by these presents, Our Last Will and Testament is,
to will and order, that our body be buried and interred in the Quire of our Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

that onely this might stand in Force, and be effectual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to all Intents and
Purposes in the Law whatsoever. <hi>Dated 30. December, Signed</hi> with His own

                  <p>Such was the Last Will, and Testament, of this Puissant Prince. Of which
how little was performed, and how much less should have been performed, if
some Great Persons (whom He had nominated for His Executours) might have
had their Wills; we shall hereafter show, in fit time, and place. In the mean
season we will see Him laid into His Grave: which was done with as much conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
speed, as the necessary Preparations for a Royal Funeral could of right
admit. For, on the fourteenth day of <hi>February</hi> then next following, His
Body, being removed in a Solemn and Magnificent manner to <hi>Shene,</hi> near

otherways disposed of His own Interment, a Vault was opened for
Him in the middest of the Quire. Into which the Body of the King was
no sooner laid, but all His Officers brake their Staves, and threw them in
the Grave, (according to the usual Ceremonies on the like Occasions) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
new ones the next day at the hands of His Son. Nor were the
Funeral Rites performed by His own Subjects onely: but a Solemn Obsequie
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66032:67"/>
was kept for Him, in the Church of <hi>Nostre-Dame</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> by King <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
the First;</hi> notwithstanding, that He had been Excommunicated by the
<hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> So much that Generous Prince preferred His old affections
to this King for former Favours: not onely above the late displeasures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
against Him, for the taking of <hi>Bulloign;</hi> but even above the <hi>Pope</hi>'s
Curse, and all the Fulminations of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
on it. But long it will not be, before we shall discharg this debt, in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the like Duty to the Honour of <hi>Francis;</hi> who, dying on the two and

as the Times could give Him. Of which more hereafter.</p>

King at Arms.</hi> But this man, being planted in a warmer Sun, grew up so

Office of Lord <hi>Chancellour:</hi> And finally, by the said King, installed Knight of

                     <p>These men being thus advanced to the highest Titles; Sir <hi>Thomas Seimour,</hi>
the new Lord <hi>Admiral,</hi> is Honoured with the Stile of Lord <hi>Seimour</hi> of <hi>Sudeley,</hi>
and in the beginning of the next year made Knight of the Garter; prepared by
this accumulation of Honours for his following Marriage, which he had now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
and soon after compassed. With no less Ceremony, though not upon such
lofty Aims, Sir <hi>Richard Rich</hi> (another of the twelve, which were appointed for
Subsidiaries, to the great Council of Estate, by the King deceased, was prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto the Dignity of Lord <hi>Rich</hi> of <hi>Leez</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> the Grand-father of that
<hi>Robert</hi> Lord <hi>Rich,</hi> who by King <hi>James</hi> was dignified with the Title of <hi>Earl</hi> of
<hi>Warwick, Anno</hi> 1618. In the third place came Sir <hi>William Willoughby,</hi> discen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from a younger Branch of the House of <hi>Eresby,</hi> created Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> of
<hi>Parham</hi> in the County of <hi>Sussex.</hi> And in the Rear, Sir <hi>Edmond Sheffield,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
unto the Title of Lord <hi>Sheffield</hi> of <hi>Butterwick</hi> in the County of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln;</hi>
from whom the Earls of <hi>Moulgrave</hi> do derive themselves. All which
Creations were performed with the accustomed Solemnities on the seventeenth
of <hi>February:</hi> and all given out to be designed by King <hi>Henry</hi> before his death,
the better to take off the Envy from the Lord Protectour; whom otherwise all
understanding people must needs have thought to be too prodigal of those Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
of which the greatest Kings of <hi>England</hi> had been so sparing. For when
great Honours are conferred on persons of no great Estates, it raiseth common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a suspicion amongst the people: That, either some proportionable Revenue
must be given them also, to the impoverishing of the King; or else some way left
open for them, to enrich themselves out of the purses of the Subject.</p>
                     <p>These Preparations being dispatched, they next proceed unto the Coronation
of the King, performed with the accustomed Rites on the twentieth of the same
Moneth by Arch-Bishop <hi>Cranmer.</hi> The Form whereof we finde exemplified in a
Book, called <hi>The Catalogue of Honour,</hi> published by <hi>Thomas Mills of Canterbury,</hi>
in the year 1610. In which there is nothing more observable, then this following
Passage. <hi>The King,</hi> (saith he) <hi>being brought unto the Church of</hi> Saint Peter <hi>in</hi> West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,
<hi>was placed in the Chair of Saint</hi> Edward <hi>the</hi> Confessour, <hi>in the middest of a
Throne seven steps high. This Throne was erected near unto the Altar, upon a
Stage arising with steps on both sides, covered with Carpets and Hangings of</hi>
Arras. <hi>Where, after the King had rested a little, being by certain noble Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
carried in another Chair, unto the four sides of the Stage; He was by the
Arch-Bishop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>declared unto the People (standing round about) both
by God's and Man's Laws to be the Right and Lawfull King of</hi> England, France,
<hi>and</hi> Ireland; <hi>and Proclaimed that day to be Crowned, Consecrated, and Anointed</hi> Unto
whom <hi>He demanded</hi> whether they would obey and serve, <hi>or</hi> Not? <hi>By whom it was
again, with a loud cry, answered;</hi> God save the King: <hi>and,</hi> Ever live his Majesty.
Which Passage I the rather note; because it is observed, that, at the Coronation
of some former Kings, <hi>The Arch-Bishop went to the four squares of the Scaffold,
and with a loud voice asked the Consent of the People.</hi> But this was at such <hi>Times</hi>
and in such <hi>Cases</hi> only, when the Kings came unto the Crown by Disputed Titles;
for maintainance whereof the Favour and Consent of the people seemed a matter
necessary: (as at the Coronations of King <hi>Henry the Fourth,</hi> or King <hi>Richard
the Third</hi>) and not when it devolved upon them, as it did upon this King, by a
Right unquestioned.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:66032:69"/>
The Coronation was accompanied, as the Custome is, with a general Pardon.
But as there never was a Feast so great, from which some men departed not
with empty bellies; so, either out of Envy, or some former Grudge, or for
some other cause unknown, six Persons were excluded from the taste of this gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Banquet: that is to say, the Lord <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> Duke of <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by the same King also; Doctour <hi>Richard Pate,</hi> declared Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi>
in the place of <hi>Hierome de Nugaticis,</hi> in the year 1534. and by that Name sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
to some of the first Acts of the Councel of <hi>Trent:</hi> who, being sent
to <hi>Rome</hi> on some Publick Imployment, chose rather to remain there in perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Exile, then to take the <hi>Oath of Supremacy</hi> at his coming home; as by the
Laws he must have done, or otherwise have fared no better<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then the
Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> who lost his head on the refusal. Of the two others, <hi>Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escue</hi>
and <hi>Throgmorton,</hi> I have found nothing, but the Names: and therefore can
but name them onely. But they all lived to better times: the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>
being restored by Queen <hi>Mary</hi> to his Lands, Liberty, and Honours; as the Lord
<hi>Courtney</hi> was to the Earldom of <hi>Devonshire,</hi> enjoyed by many of his Noble
Progenitours; Cardinal <hi>Pole</hi> admitted first into the Kingdom, in the capacity of a
<hi>Legate</hi> from the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and after <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s death advanced to the See of
<hi>Canterbury;</hi> and Doctour <hi>Pate</hi> preferred unto the actual <hi>Possession</hi> of the See of
<hi>Worcester,</hi> of which he formerly had enjoyed no more but the empty <hi>Title.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These Great Solemnities being thus passed over, the <hi>Grandees</hi> of the Court be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to entertain some thoughts of a <hi>Reformation.</hi> In which they found Arch-Bishop
<hi>Cranmer,</hi> and some other Bishops, to be as foreward as themselves; but
on different ends: endeavoured by the Bishops, in a pious Zeal for rectifying
such thing; as were amiss in God's publick Worship; but by the Courtiers, on an
Hope to enrich themselves by the spoil of the Bishopricks. To the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of which work the Conjuncture seemed as proper, as they could desire.
For First the King, being of such tender age, and wholly Governed by the Will
of the Lord Protectour, who had declared himself a friend to the <hi>Lutheran</hi>
Party in the time of King <hi>Henry,</hi> was easie to be moulded into any form, which
the authority of Power and Reason could imprint upon Him. The Lord <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Howard</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and Doctour <hi>Stephen Gardiner</hi> Bishop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi>
(who formerly) had been the greatest Sticklers at the Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in Maintainance of the Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) were not long
able to support it: the one of them being a condemned Prisoner in the <hi>Tower,</hi>
as before was said; and the other, upon some just displeasure, not named by
King <hi>Henry</hi> amongst the Councellours of State, who were to have the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of Affairs in His Son's Mino<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ty. <hi>Bonner,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> was absent
at that time in the Court of the <hi>Emperour;</hi> to whom he had been sent Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
by the former King. And no professed Champion for the <hi>Papacy</hi> remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
amongst them, of whom they had cause to stand in doubt: but the new Earl
of <hi>South-hampton<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> Whom when they were not able to remove from his old Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
it was resolved to make him less both in Power and Credit; so, that he
should not be able to hinder the pursuit of those Counsels, which he was not
willing to promote. And therefore on the sixth of <hi>March,</hi> the <hi>Great Seal</hi>
was taken from him by the King's Command, and for a while committed to the
custody of Sir <hi>William Pawlet,</hi> Created Lord <hi>St<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> John</hi> of <hi>Basing,</hi> and made
Great Master of the Houshold by King <hi>Henry the Eighth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And on the other side it was thought expedient, for the better carrying on
of the Design, not onely to release all such as had been committed unto Prison;
but also to recall all such as had been forced to abandon the Kingdom, for not
submitting to the Superstitions and Corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Great
were the Numbers of the first, who had their Fetters strucken off by this merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

Prince, and were permitted to enjoy that Liberty of Conscience; for which
they had suffered all Extremities in His Father's time. Onely it is observed of
one <hi>Thomas Dobbs,</hi> once Fellow of Saint <hi>John's-College</hi> in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> condemned
for speaking against the Mass, and thereupon committed to the <hi>Counter</hi> in
<hi>Bread-street;</hi> that he alone did take a view of this Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> into which
he was not suffered to enter. It being so ordered by the Divine Providence, that
he died in Prison, before his Pardon could be signed by the Lord Protectour.
Amongst the rest, which were in number very many, those of chief note were,
Doctour <hi>Miles Coverdale,</hi> after Bishop of <hi>Exeter;</hi> Mr. <hi>John Hooper</hi> after
Bishop of <hi>Glocester;</hi> Mr. <hi>John Philpot,</hi> after Arch-Deacon of <hi>Winchester;</hi> Mr.

                     </p>

                        </gap>ss was of greater Moment, then to expect the coming back of
the Learned men: who though they came not time enough to begin the work;
yet did they prove exceeding serviceable in the furtherance of it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
neither to lose time, nor to press too much at once upon the People, it was
thought sit to smooth the way to the intended <hi>Reformation,</hi> by setting out some
Preparatory <hi>Injunctions;</hi> such as the King might publish by his own Authority,
according to the example of His Royal Father in the year 1536. and at some
times after. This to be done by sending out <hi>Commissioners</hi> into all parts
of the Kingdom, armed with <hi>Instructions</hi> to enquire into all Ecclesiastical
Concernments, in the manner of a <hi>Visitation;</hi> directed by the King, as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Head on earth of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Which <hi>Commissioners,</hi> being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed
into several Circuits, were accompanied with certain Learned, and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Preachers, appointed to instruct the People, and to facilitate the work of the
<hi>Commissioners,</hi> in all Towns, and Places, where they fate. And, that the People
might not cool, or fall off again, in, and from that, which had been taught
them by the Learned Preachers; they were to leave some <hi>Homilies</hi> to the same
effect with the <hi>Parish-Priest:</hi> which the Arch-Bishop had composed; not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the help of unpreaching Ministers, but for the regulating, and instructing
even of Learned Preachers. Which <hi>Injunctions</hi> being agreed upon by such of the
<hi>Great Council,</hi> as favoured the Design of the <hi>Reformation;</hi> and the <hi>Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
drawn in due form of Law by the <hi>Counsel learned:</hi> they were all tendered to
the Lord Chancellour <hi>Wriothsley;</hi> that the Authority of the <hi>Great Seal</hi> might
be added to them. Which he, who was not to be told what these matters aimed at,
refused to give consent unto: and so lost the <hi>Seal,</hi> committed (as before is said)
to the Custody of the <hi>Lord Great Master,</hi> by whom the said <hi>Commissions</hi> were
dispatched, and the <hi>Visitours</hi> thereby Authorised in due form of Law And here it
is to be observed, that, besides the Points contained in the said <hi>Injunctions,</hi> the
Preachers above-mentioned were more particularly instructed to perswade the
People from <hi>Praying to the Saints,</hi> from making <hi>Prayers for the dead,</hi> from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doring
of Images,</hi> from the use of <hi>Beads, Ashes,</hi> and <hi>Processions,</hi> from <hi>Mass, Diri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Praying in unknown Languages,</hi> and from some other such like things; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
long Custome had brought a Religious Observation. All which was done
to this intent; That the People in all places, being prepared by little and little,
might with more ease, and less opposition, admit the total Alteration in the face
of the <hi>Church,</hi> which was intended in due time to be introduced.</p>
                     <p>Now, as for the <hi>Injuctions</hi> above-mentioned, although I might exemplifie
them, as they stand at large in the <hi>First Edition</hi> of the <hi>Acts and Monuments,</hi> (fol.

Personally Preach within their Diocess, every Quarter of a year, once at the
least: that is to say, once in their Cathedral Churches, and thrice in other se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
places of their Diocesses, whereas they should see it most convenient and
necessary; except they had a reasonable excuse to the contrary. Likewise,
that they should not retain into their Service, or Houshold, any Chaplain, but
such as were Learned, and able to Preach the Word of God, and those they
should also cause to Exercise the same.</p>
                     <p>2. And Secondly, That they should not give Orders to any Person; but
such as were Learned in Holy Scripture: neither should deny them to such,
as were Learned in the same, being of honest conversation, or living. And
Lastly, That they should not at any time, or place, Preach, or set forth unto the

or set forth in the King's Highnesse's <hi>Homilies:</hi> neither yet should admit, or
give Licence to Preach to any, within their Diocess, but to such as they should
know (or at least assuredly trust<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) would do the same: And, if at any time, by
hearing, or by report proved, they should perceive the contrary; they should
then incontinent not only inhibit that Person so offending, but also punish
him, and revoke their Licence.</p>
                     <p>There was also a <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Bidding Prayer</hi> prescribed by the <hi>Visitours,</hi> to be
used by all Preachers in the Realm; ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

seemed best. Which <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Bidding Prayer</hi> (or <hi>Bidding of the Beads,</hi> as it
was then commonly called) was this, that followeth.</p>
                     <p>You shall Pray for the whole Congregation of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Church and specially
for this Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> wherein first I commend to your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
Prayers the King's most Excellent Majesty, Supreme Head immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
under God of the Spirituality and Temporality of the same Church:
And for Queen <hi>Katharine</hi> Dowager, and also for my Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> and my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the King's Sisters.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, You shall Pray for my Lord Protectour's Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with all the rest
of the King's Majesty His Council; for all the Lords of His Realm, and for
the Clergy, and the Commons of the same: beseeching God Almighty, to

                        </gap>very of them, in his degree, grace to use themselves in such wise, as
may be to God's Glory, the King's Honour, and the VVeal of this
Realm.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, You shall Pray for all them, that be departed out of this VVorld
in the Faith of Christ; that they with us, and we with them, at the day of
Judgement, may rest, both body and soul, with <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
in the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Such were the <hi>Orders,</hi> and <hi>Injunctions,</hi> wherewith the King's <hi>Commissioners</hi>
were furnished for their <hi>Visitation.</hi> Most of them such, as had been formerly
given out by <hi>Cromwell,</hi> or otherwise published and pursued (but not without
some intermissions) by the King deceased, and therefore to be put in Execution
with the greater safety. For though the young King, by Reason of his tender
Age, could not but want a great proportion of His Father's Spirit for carrying
on a work of such weight and moment; yet he wanted nothing of that power
in Church-concernment, which either Naturally was inherent in the Crown Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:66032:72"/>
or had been Legally vested in it by <hi>Acts of Parliament.</hi> Neither could
His Being in Minority, nor the Writings in His Name by the Lord Protectour,
and the Rest of the Council, make any such difference in the Case; as to invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
the Proceedings, or any of the Rest which followed in the <hi>Reformation.</hi>
For, if they did, the <hi>Objection</hi> would be altogether as strong against the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> made in the Minority of King <hi>Josias;</hi> as against this, in the Minority of the
present King. That of <hi>Josias</hi> being made (as <hi>Josephus</hi> (<note n="*" place="margin">

the <hi>Elders:</hi> as this of King EDVVARD <hi>the Sixth</hi> by the Advice of the Council.
And yet it cannot be denyed, but that the <hi>Reformation</hi> made under King <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Advice of His Council, was no less pleasing unto <hi>God,</hi> nor less valid in the Eys of
all His Subjects: then those of <hi>Jeboshaphat,</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> in their Riper years;
who perhaps acted singly on the strength of their Own Judgements onely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Advice. Now of <hi>Josias</hi> we are told by the said Historian; That<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>When
He grew to be twelve years old, He gave manifest Approbation of His Piety, and
Justice. For He drew the People to a conformable Course of Life, and to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
and Abolishing of Idols, that were no Gods, and to the Service of the Onely
True God of their Fore-Fathers. And, considering the Actions of His Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours,
He began to Rectifie them in that, wherein they were deficient, with no less
Circumspection, then if He had been an Old Man; And that, which He found to be
Correspondent, and Advisedly done by them, that did He both maintain and imitate.
All which things He did, both by Reason of His Innated Wisdom, as also by the

onely in matters of Religion, but of Civil Politie.</hi> Which puts the Parallel betwixt
the two young Kings, in the Case before us, above all Exception; and the Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of King <hi>Edward,</hi> or His Council rather, beyond all Dispute.</p>
                     <p>Now, whereas Question hath been made, whether the twenty fourth <hi>Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
for <hi>Labouring on the Holy Day in time of Harvest,</hi> extend as well to the
<hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Day,</hi> as the <hi>Annual Festivals:</hi> The matter seems, to any well-discerning
eye, to be out of Question. For in the third Chapter of the <hi>Statute</hi> made in the
fifth and sixth years of King <hi>Edward the Sixth,</hi> (when the <hi>Reformation</hi> was much
more advanced then it was at the present) the Names and Number of such <hi>Holy
Days,</hi> as were to be observed in this Church, are thus layed down; <hi>That is to
say, All Sundaies in the year, the Feasts of the Circumcision of our Lord Jesus
Christ, of the Epiphany,</hi> &amp;c. with all the Rest, still kept, and there named
particularly. And then it followeth in the Act, <hi>That it shall, and may, be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for every Husband-man, Labourer, Fisher-man, and to all, and every other
person or persons, of what Estate, Degree, or Condition, he, or they, be, upon
the</hi> Holy-Days <hi>afore-said, in Harvest, or at any other times in the year, when ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
shall so require, to Labour, Ride, Fish, or Work any kind of work, at their
free-will and Pleasure; any thing in this Act to the contrary notwithstanding.</hi>
The Law being such, there is no question to be made in point of practice, nor
consequently of the meaning of the King's <hi>Injunction.</hi> For further opening of
which Truth, we finde, that not the Country onely, but the Court were indulged
the Liberty of attending business on that day; it being Ordered by the King,
amongst other things, <hi>That the Lords of the Council should upon Sundays attend
the publique Affairs of this Realm, dispatch Answers to Letters for good order of
State, and make full dispatches of all things concluded the Week before: Provided
alwaies, That they be present at</hi> Common Prayer, <hi>and that on every Sunday-Night
the King's Secretary should deliver him a Memorial of such things, as are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
by the Privy Council in the week ensuing.</hi> Which Order, being compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the words of the <hi>Statute,</hi> may serve sufficiently to satisfie all doubts,
and scruples, touching the true intent and meaning of the said <hi>Injunction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, as this Question was not startled till the Later Times, when the <hi>Lord</hi>'s
<hi>Day</hi> began to be advanced into the Reputation of the <hi>Jewish Sabbath;</hi> so
was there nothing in the rest of the said <hi>Injunctions,</hi> which required a Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.

Circuits, with great Zeal and Chearfullness; and no less readily Obeyed
in most parts of the Realms, both by Priests and People: who observed nothing
in them, either new, or strange, to which they had not been prepared in the
Reign of the King deceased. None forwarder in this Compliance, then some
Learned men, in, and about the City of <hi>London;</hi> who not long since had

as to lagg behind. It was Ordered in the twenty first; <hi>That, at the time of High
Mass, the Epistle, and Gospel should be read in the English Tongue:</hi> and, <hi>That

<hi>Smith,</hi> Master of <hi>Whittington-College</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and Reader in Divinity at
the <hi>King's-College</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> (afterwards better known by the name of
<hi>Christ-Church</hi>) had before published two Books: One of them written, <hi>In De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Mass;</hi> The other endeavouring to prove, <hi>That unwritten Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
ought to be believed, under pain of Damnation.</hi> But, finding that these
Doctrines did not now beat according to the Pulse of the Times, he did volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
retract, the said Opinions; declaring in a Sermon at Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Cross,</hi> on
<hi>Sunday</hi> the fifteenth of <hi>May,</hi> that his said former Books, and Teachings, were
not only erroneous, but Heretical. The like was done in the Moneth next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by Doctour <hi>Pern,</hi> afterwards Master of <hi>Peter-House</hi> in <hi>Cambridge;</hi> who,
having on Saint <hi>George</hi>'s day delivered, in the Parish-Church of Saint <hi>Andrew
Vndershaft,</hi> for sound Catholick Doctrine, <hi>That the Pictures of Christ, and of
the Saints were to be adored;</hi> upon the seventeenth day of <hi>June,</hi> declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the said Church to have been deceived in that, what he before had taught
them, and to be sorry for delivering such Doctrine to them. But these men
might pretend some Warrant from the King's <hi>Injunctions,</hi> which they might
conceive it neither fit, nor safe to oppose: and therefore, that it was the wisest
way, to strike Sail betimes, upon the shooting of the first Warning-Piece to
bring them in. But no man was so much before hand with Authority, as one
Doctour <hi>Glasier;</hi> who, as soon as the Fast of <hi>Lent</hi> was over, (and it was well
he had the Pat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ence to stay so long) affirmed publickly in a Sermon at Saint
<hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Cross;</hi> That, <hi>The Lent was not ordained of God to be Fasted, neither the Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Flesh to be forborn; but that the same was a Politick Ordinance of men, and
might therefore be broken by men at their pleasures.</hi> For which Doctrine as the
Preacher was never questioned, the Temper of the Times giving Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
enough to such Extravagancies; so did it open such a Gap to Carnal
Liberty, that the King found it necessary to shut it up again by a Proclamation
on the sixteenth of <hi>January,</hi> commanding Abstinence from all Flesh, for the
<hi>Lent</hi> then following.</p>
                     <p>But there was something more, then the Authority of a Minour King, which
drew on such a General Conformity to these <hi>Injunctions:</hi> and thereby smoothed
the way to those Alterations, both in Doctrine and Worship; which the <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees</hi>
of the Court, and Church, had began to fashion. The Lord Protectour,
and his Party were more experienced in Affairs of State; then to be told, That,
<q>All great Counsels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tending to Innovation in the Publick Government, (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
where <hi>Religion</hi> is concerned therein) are either to be back'd by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Arms, or
otherwise prove destructive to the Undertakers.</q> For this cause, he resolves to
put himself into the Head of an Army: as well for the security of His Person,
and the Preservation of his Party; as for the carrying on of the Design against
all Opponents. And, for the Raising of an Army, there could not be a fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Colour, nor a more popular Pretence, then a War in <hi>Scotland:</hi> not to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:66032:73"/>
be made on any new emergent Quarrel, which might be apt to breed suspicion in
the Heads of the People; but in Pursuit of the great Project of the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased, for Uniting that Realm (by the Marriage of their young Queen to
His onely Son) to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> On this pretense Levies are made
in all parts of the Kingdom, great store of Arms and Ammunition drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to advance the service, considerable Numbers of Old Souldiers brought
over from <hi>Bulloign,</hi> and the Peeces which depended on it, and good Provision
made of Shipping, to attend the Motions of the Army upon all occasions. He
entertained also certain Regiments of <hi>Walloons,</hi> and <hi>Germanes:</hi> not out of any
great Opinion, which he had of their Valour; (though otherwise of good
Experience in the Wars) but because they were conceived more likely to enforce
Obedience, (if his Designs should meet with any Opposition) then the Natural
<hi>English.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But in the first place Care was taken, that none of the neighbouring Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
should either hinder his Proceedings, or assist the Enemy. To which end
Doctour <hi>Wotton,</hi> the first Dean of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> then Resident with the Queen
<hi>Dowager</hi> of <hi>Hungary,</hi> (who at that time was <hi>Regent</hi> of the Estates of <hi>Flanders</hi>
for <hi>Charls the Fifth</hi>) was dispatched unto the <hi>Emperour</hi>'s Court: there to succeed
in the place of Doctour <hi>Bonner,</hi> Bishop of <hi>London;</hi> who, together with Sir
<hi>Francis Bryan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> had formerly been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ther from King <hi>Henry
the Eighth.</hi> The Principal part of his Employment, besides such matters as are
incident to all Ambassadours, was to divert the <hi>Emperour</hi> from concluding any
League with <hi>France,</hi> contrary to the Capitulations made between the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi>
and the King deceased; but to deal with him, above all things, for decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
himself an Enemy to all of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation, but such as should be Friends
to the King of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And, because some Remainders of Hostility did still remain between the <hi>English</hi>
and the <hi>French,</hi> (notwithstanding the late peace made between the Crowns) it
was thought fit to sweeten, and oblige that People, by all the acts of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence,
and friendly Neighbourhood. In Order whereunto it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the King's Proclamation, That Restitution should be made of such
Ships and Goods, which had been taken from the <hi>French</hi> since the Death of
King <hi>Henry.</hi> Which being done also by the <hi>French,</hi> though far short in the
value of such Reprisals, as had been taken by the <hi>English:</hi> there was good hope
of coming to a better understanding of one another: and that, by this Cessation
of Arms, both Kings might come in short time to a further Agreement. But
that which seemed to give most satisfaction to the Court of <hi>France<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> was the
performance of a solemn Obsequie for King <hi>Francis the First;</hi> who left this Life
on the twenty second day of <hi>March,</hi> and was Magnificently Interred amongst
His Predecessours, in the Monastery of Saint <hi>Dennis,</hi> not far from <hi>Paris.</hi>
Whose Funerals were no sooner Solemnized in <hi>France:</hi> but Order was given for
a <hi>Dirige</hi> to be sung in all the Churches in <hi>London,</hi> on the nineteenth of <hi>June,</hi>
as also in the Cathedral Church of Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> in the Quire whereof, being
hung with black, a sumptuous Herse had been set up for the present Ceremony.
For the next day the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> assisted with Eight other of
the Bishops, all in their Rich Mitres, and other their Pontificals, did sing a
Mass of <hi>Requiem;</hi> the Funeral Sermon being preached by Doctour <hi>Ridley,</hi> Lord
Elect of <hi>Rochester:</hi> who, if he did his part therein, as no doubt he did, could
not but magnifie the Prince for His Love to Learning. Which was so great, and
eminent in Him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that He was called by the <hi>French, L' pere des Arts &amp; des Sciences,</hi>
and <hi>The Father of the Muses</hi> by some Writers of other Nations. Which Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
as He well deserved, so did He Sympathize in that Affection, (as he did in
many other things) with King <hi>Henry the Eighth:</hi> of whose Munificence for the
Encouragements of Learning we have spoke before.</p>
                     <p>This great Solemnity being thus Honourably performed, the <hi>Commissioners</hi> for
the <hi>Visitation</hi> were dispatched to their several <hi>Circuits;</hi> and the Army drawn
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:66032:73"/>
from all parts to their <hi>Rendez-vous,</hi> for the War with <hi>Scotland.</hi> Of which two
Actions, that of the <hi>Visitation,</hi> as the easiest, and meeting with a People,
which had been long trained up in the Schole of Obedience, was carried
on, without any shew of Opposition; submitted to upon a very small Dispute,
even by some of those Bishops, who were conceived most likely to have disturbed
the business. The first, who declared his aversness to the King's Proceedings,
was Dr. <hi>Stephen Gardiner,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester:</hi> who, stomaching his being
left out of the Lift of the Council, appeared more cross to all their doings, then
other of his Order. For which being brought before their Lordships, and not
giving them such satisfaction, as they looked for from him, they sent him Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
to the <hi>Fleet;</hi> where he remained from the twenty fifth of <hi>September,</hi> till
the seventh of <hi>January:</hi> the King's <hi>Commissioners</hi> proceeding in the mean time
without any disturbance.</p>
                     <p>With less aversness, but with success not much unlike, was the business en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
by Dr. <hi>Edmond Bonner,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>London:</hi> whom the <hi>Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners</hi>
found far more tractable, then could have been expected from a man
of so rough a Nature, and one so cordially affected to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The
<hi>Commissioners</hi> Authorised for this Imployment were, Sir <hi>Anthony Cook,</hi> and Sir
<hi>John Godsal,</hi> Knights; <hi>John Godsal,</hi> &amp; <hi>Christopher Nevinson,</hi> Doctours of the Laws;
and <hi>John Madew,</hi> Doctour in Divinity: who, sitting in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church on the
first day of <hi>September,</hi> called before them the said Bishop <hi>Bonner, John Royston,</hi> the
renowned <hi>Polydore Virgil,</hi> and many other of the Dignitaries of the said Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral:
to whom, the Sermon being done, and their Commission openly read, they
ministred the <hi>Oath of the King's Supremacy,</hi> according to the Statute of the
thirty first of King <hi>Henry the Eighth;</hi> requiring them withall to present such
things, as stood in need to be Reformed. Which done, they delivered to him a
Copy of the said <hi>Injunctions,</hi> together with the <hi>Homilies</hi> set forth by the King's
Authority; received by him with Protestation, that he would observe them, if
they were not contrary to the Law of God, and the Statutes and Ordinances of
the Church. Which Protestation he desired might be enrolled amongst the <hi>Acts</hi>
of the Court. But afterwards, considering better with himself, as well of his
own Danger, as of the Scandal and ill Consequents, which might thence arise, he
addressed himself unto the King; revoking his said Protestation, and humbly
submitting himself to His Majestie's Pleasure, in this manner following.</p>

to me neither Reasonable, nor such as might well stand with the Duty of a

was then by the Register of the <hi>Visitation</hi> Enacted, and put in Record: I have

upon better consideration of my Duty, renounce, and revoke my said Protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;

                     <p>This humble carriage of the Bishop so wrought upon the King, and the
Lords of the Council, that the edg of their displeasure was taken off; though,
for a terrour unto others, and for the preservation of their own Authority, he
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66032:74"/>
was by them committed Prisoner to the <hi>Fleet.</hi> During the short time of whose
Restraint, (that is to say, on the Eighteenth day of the same Moneth of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi>)
the <hi>Letany</hi> was sung in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, in Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church,
between the Quire and the High Altar; the Singers kneeling, half on the one
side, and half on the other. And the same day the <hi>Epistle</hi> and <hi>Gospel</hi> was also
read at the High Mass in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue. And, about two Moneths after,
(that is to say, on the seventeenth day of <hi>November,</hi> next following) Bishop
<hi>Bonner,</hi> being then restored to his former Liberty, the Image of <hi>Christ,</hi> best
known in those Times by the name of the <hi>Rood,</hi> together with the Images of
<hi>Mary,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and all other Images in that Church, as also in all the other
Churches of <hi>London</hi> were taken down; as was commanded by the said <hi>Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
Concerning which we are to note, That, though the Parliament was
then sitting, (whereof more anon) yet the <hi>Commissioners</hi> proceeded onely by
the King's Authority, without relating any thing to that High Court in this
weighty Business. And in the speeding of this Work, as Bishop <hi>Bonner,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Dean and Chapter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did perform their parts in the Cathedral of
Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> so <hi>Bellassere,</hi> Arch-Deacon of <hi>Colchester,</hi> and Doctour <hi>Gilbert
Bourn,</hi> (being at that time Arch-Deacon both of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Essex;</hi> but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
preferred by Queen <hi>Mary</hi> to the Bishoprick of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi>) were no
less Diligent and Officious in doing the like in all the Churches of their Respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Jurisdictions, according to the Charge imposed upon them by his Majestie's
<hi>Visitours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In the mean time, whilst matters were thus calmly Acted on the Stage of</hi>
England; <hi>all things went no less fortunately forward with the Lord Protectour
in his War with</hi> Scotland: <hi>in which he carried himself with no less Courage,
and Success, when it came to blows; then he had done with</hi> Christian <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
before he put himself on the Expedition. For, having taken Order for
his Forces to be drawn together, he thought it most expedient to his Affairs, to
gain the start in point of Reputation with his very Enemies, by not ingaging
in a War, untill they had refused all Terms of Peace. And to this end a</hi> Manifest
<hi>is dispatched unto them, declaring the</hi> Motives, <hi>which induced him to put
this Kingdom into a posture of Arms. In which he remembred them of the</hi>
Promises, Seals, and Oaths, which by publick Authority had passed for concluding
this Marriage; <hi>That,</hi> These, being Religious Bonds betwixt God and their Souls,
could not by any Politick Act of State be dissolved, untill their Queen should attain
unto years of Dissent: <hi>Adding that,</hi> The Providence of God did therein manifestly
declare it self, in that, the Male-Princes of <hi>Scotland</hi> failing, the Kingdom was left
unto a Daughter; and in that King <hi>Henry</hi> left onely one Son to succeed; <hi>That,</hi> These
two Princes were agreeable, both for Years, and Princely Qualities, to be joyned
in Marriage, and thereby to knit both Realms into One; <hi>That,</hi> This Vnion, as
it was like to be both easily done, and of firm continuance: so would it be both profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and Honourable to both the Realms; <hi>That,</hi> Both the Easiness and Firmness
might be conjectured: for that both People are of the same Language, of like Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
and Fashion, of like Quality and Condition of Life, of one Climate; not onely
annexed entirely together but severed from all the World besides; <hi>That,</hi> as these are
sure Arguments that both discended from one Original, so (by Reason, that Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is a great Cause of Liking and of Love) they would be most forcible Means,
both to joyn and hold them in one Body again; <hi>That,</hi> Profit would rise by extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
Wars between the two Nations: by Reason whereof, in former times,
Victories abroad have been impeached, Invasions and Seditions occasioned,
the Confines of both Realms lay'd wast, or else made a Nursery of Rapines,
Robberies, and Murthers; the Inner Parts often deeply pierced, and made a
wretched Spectacle to all Eys of Humanity and Pity; <hi>That,</hi> The Honour of both
Realms w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>uld Increase: as well in regard of the Countries, sufficient not onely
to furnish the Necessities, but the moderate Pleasures of this Life; as also of the
People, great in Multitude, in Body able, assured in Mind: not onely for the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:66032:74"/>
Safety, but the Glory of the Common State: <hi>That,</hi> Hereby would follow Assurance of
Defence, Strength to Enterprise, Ease in sustaining publick Burthens, and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
<hi>That,</hi> Herein the <hi>English</hi> d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>ge, and in capacity of Offices and Imployments; and,
to that end, the Name of <hi>Britain</hi> should be assumed, indifferent to both Nations:
<hi>That,</hi> This would be the Complishment of their common Felicity; in case, (by
their Evil, either Destiny, or Advice) they suffered not the Occasion to be
l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>st.</p>
                     <p>It was no hard matter to fore-see, that, either the <hi>Scots</hi> would return no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to this Declaration, or such an Answer at the best, as should signifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
So that the War began to open, and some Hostilities to be exercised on
either side; before the <hi>English</hi> Forces could be drawn together. For so it happened,
that a small Ship of the Kings, called <hi>The Pensie,</hi> hovering at Sea, was assailed
by <hi>The Lyon,</hi> a principal Ship of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The fight began a far off, and slow;
but when they approached, it grew very furious: wherein the <hi>Pensie</hi> so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
her Shot, that therewith the <hi>Lyon</hi>'s <hi>Ore-Loope</hi> was broken, her Sails,
and Tacklings torn, and lastly she was boarded, and taken. But, as she was
brought for <hi>England,</hi> she was cast away by Negligence, and Tempest, near
<hi>Hare-wich-Haven,</hi> and most of her men perished with her. Which small Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(as Sir <hi>John Hayward</hi> well observes) seemed to Prognosticate the Success
of the War: in which the <hi>English,</hi> with a small Army, gained a glorious Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
but were deprived of the Fruit, and Benefits of it, by the Storms at
home.</p>
                     <p>All thoughts of Peace being lay'd aside, the Army draws together at <hi>New-Castle,</hi>
about the middle of <hi>August,</hi> consisting of twelve or thirteen thousand
Foot, thirteen hundred Men at Arms, and two thousand Eight hundred light
Horse: Both Men and Horse so well appointed that a like Army never shewed
it self, before that time, on the Borders of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Over which Army, so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
the Lord Protectour held the Office of <hi>General;</hi> the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi>
that of <hi>Liev-tenant General;</hi> the Lord <hi>Gray, General</hi> of the <hi>Horse,</hi> and <hi>Marshal</hi>
also of the Field; Sir <hi>Ralph Vane,</hi> Liev-tenant of all the <hi>Men at Arms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and
<hi>Demi-lances;</hi> and Sir <hi>Ralph Sadlier, Treasurer General</hi> for the Wars: inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Offices being distributed amongst other Gentlemen of Name and Quality,
according to their well-deservings. At <hi>New<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>Castle</hi> they remained till the Fleet
arrived, consisting of sixty five Bottoms: whereof one Gally and thirty four
tall Ships were well-appointed for Fight; the Residue served for carriage of
Munition, and Victuals. The <hi>Admiral</hi> of this Fleet being <hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>Clyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
created afterwards Earl of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> on the fourth of <hi>May</hi> 1572. in the
fourteenth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Making some little stay at <hi>Berwick,</hi> they
entred not on <hi>Scotish</hi> Ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till the third of <hi>September;</hi> keeping their
March along the Shore within Sight of the Fleet, that they might be both Aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and Releived by it, as Occasion served: and making all along the Shore, they
fell, at the end of two days, into a Valley called <hi>The Peuthes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> containing six
Miles in length, in breadth about four hundred Pases toward the Sea, and but
one hundred toward the Land, where it was shut up by a River. The Issues out
of it made into several paths, which the <hi>Scots</hi> had caused to be cut in divers places
with Traverse Trenches: and thereby so incumbred the Army in their marching
forwards; (till the <hi>Pioneers</hi> had smoothed the way) that a small Power of the
Enemy (if their Fortune had been anwerable to the Opportunity) might have
given a very good Account of them to the rest of their Nation. Which D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
being over-come, and a Passage thereby given them unto places of more
Advantage, they made themselves Masters of the three next Castles, for making
good of their Retreat, if the worst should happen.</p>
                     <p>Upon the first News of these <hi>Approaches,</hi> enlarged (as the Custome is) by the
Voice of Fame, the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> being then Lord Governour of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
was not meanly startled; as being neither furnished with Foreign Aid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:66032:75"/>
much relying on the Forces, which He had at Home. Yet resuming his accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Courage, and well-acquainted with both Fortunes, He sent His <hi>Heralds</hi>
through all parts of the Realm, commanded the <hi>Fire-Cross</hi> (that is to say, two
Fire-brands, set in fashion of a Cross, and pitched upon the point of a Spear) to
be advanced in the Field, (according to the Ancient Custome of that Country
in Important Cases) and therewithall caused <hi>Proclamation</hi> to be made, That
<hi>All Persons, from sixteen years of Age to sixty, should repair to</hi> Muscle-borough,
<hi>and bring their Ordinary Provision of Victuals with them.</hi> Which <hi>Proclamation</hi>
being made, and the Danger in which the Kingdom stoodrepresented to

thought fit to make choice of such as were most serviceable, and dismiss the Rest.
Out of which they compounded an Army (the Nobility, and Gentry, with their
Followers being Reckoned in) consisting of thirty thousand Foot, and two
thousand Horse: but poorly Armed, fitter to make Excursions, or to execute
some suddain Inroad, then to entertain any strong Charge from so brave an
Army.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Armies drawing near together, the</hi> General, <hi>and the Earl of</hi> Warwick, <hi>rode
towards the place, where the</hi> Scotish <hi>Army lay, to view the manner of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping.
As they were returning, an</hi> Herald, <hi>and a</hi> Trumpeter, <hi>from the</hi>
Scots <hi>overtook them; and, having obtained Audience, thus the</hi> Herald <hi>began;
That,</hi> He was sent from the Lord Governour of <hi>Scotland,</hi> partly; to enquire of Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
but chiefly to make offer, that because he was desirous, not onely to avoid profusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but the least effusion of <hi>Christian</hi> blood; and for that the <hi>English</hi> had not done any
unmanlike Outrage, or Spoyle, he was content they might return, and should have his
Safe-conduct for their peaceable passage. <hi>Which said, the</hi> Trumpeter <hi>spake, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth;
That,</hi> The Lord <hi>Huntly,</hi> His Master, sent Message by him; that, as
well for brief Expedition, as to spare expence of <hi>Christian</hi> blood, He would fight
upon the whole Quarrel, either with twenty against twenty, or with ten against ten;
or, more particularly, by single Combate between the Lord <hi>General</hi> and himself.
Which, in regard the <hi>Scots</hi> had advantage, both for Number, and Freshness of men;
in regard also, that, for Supply, both for Provision, and Succours, they were at
home, be esteemed an Honourable and charitable Offer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To the</hi> Herald <hi>the Lord</hi> General <hi>returned this Answer; That,</hi> As his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was not with purpose, or desire to endamage their Realm: as he was there, he
would neither intreat, nor accept of him leave to depart; but would measure his
Marches in Advancing or Retiring, as his own Judgment, guided by Advice
of his Council, should deem expedient.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To the</hi> Trumpeter <hi>he returned this Answer; That,</hi> The Lord <hi>Huntly,</hi> His Master,
was a young Gentleman, full of Free Courage but more desirous of Glory, then Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
(as it seemed) how to win it; <hi>That,</hi> For number of Combatants, it
was not in his power to conclude a bargain; but he was to employ all the Forces,
put under his Charge, to the best advantage that he could; <hi>That,</hi> In case this were
a particular Quarrel between the <hi>Governour</hi> and <hi>Him,</hi> he would not refuse a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Combate; but, being a difference between the two Kingdoms, it was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fit, nor in his Power, either to undertake the Adventure upon his own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
or bearing a Publique Charge, to hazard himself against a man of Private
condition. <hi>Which said, and the Earl of</hi> Warwick <hi>offering to take upon himself
the Answer to</hi> Huntly's <hi>Challenge: the Lord Protectour interposed, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
again unto the</hi> Herald; Herald <hi>(saith he)</hi> tell the Lord <hi>Governour,</hi> and the
Lord <hi>Huntly,</hi> that we have entred your Country with a <hi>sober</hi> Company: <hi>(which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in the Language of the</hi> Scots, is poor <hi>and</hi> mean) your Army is both Great and
Fresh; but let them appear upon indifferent Ground, and assuredly they shall have
fighting enough. And bring me word, that they will so do, and I will reward thee
with a thousand Crowns.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>These Braveries thus passed over on either side, the Lord Protectour wisely
considering with himself the uncertain Issue of pitched Fields, and minding to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:66032:75"/>
preserve his Army for some other purposes, thought fit to tempt the</hi> Scots, <hi>by
another</hi> Missive, <hi>to yield unto his just Demands. In which, he wished them
to consider; That,</hi> This War was waged amongst <hi>Christians: And that,</hi> Our
Ends were no other, then a just Peace, whereto the endeavours of all Good men
should tend; <hi>That,</hi> An Occasion, not onely of a League, but of a Perpetual Peace
was now happily offered, if they would suffer the two differing, and Emulous
Nations, by uniting the Head, to grow together; <hi>That,</hi> As this had formerly
been sought by us, so had it been generally Assented to by the Estates of <hi>Scotland;
That,</hi> Therefore he could not but wonder, why they should rather Treacherously
recurr to Arms (The events of War being usually, even to the Victour, sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unfortunate) then to maintain, inviolate, their Troth plighted to the Good of
both Nations; <hi>That,</hi> They could not in reason expect, that their Queen should
perpetually live a Virgin-life; <hi>That,</hi> If she Married, where could She bestow her
self better, then on a Puissant <hi>Monarch,</hi> inhabiting the same Island, and speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the same Language? <hi>That,</hi> They could not choose, but see, what Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
were the consequents of Foreign Matches. Whereof they should rather
make Tryal by the Examples of Others, then at their Own Perill; <hi>That,</hi> Though
he demanded nothing but Equity, yet be so far abhorred the Effusion of <hi>Christian</hi>
blood, that, if he found the <hi>Scots</hi> not utterly averse from an accord, he would
endeavour, that some of the Contentions should be remitted; <hi>That,</hi> He would
also consent, that the Queen should abide, and be brought up amongst them, untill
Her Age made Her Marriageable: at what time She should, by the Consent of the
<hi>Estates,</hi> Her self make choice of an Husband; <hi>That,</hi> In the mean time, there
should be a Cessation of Arms: neither should the Queen be transported out of
Her Realm, nor entertain Treaty of Marriage with the <hi>French,</hi> or any other Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner;
<hi>That,</hi> if this they would Faithfully Promise, he would forthwith
peaceably depart out of <hi>Scotland; And that,</hi> Whatsoever Dammages the Country
had suffered by this Invasion, he would, according to the esteem of indifferent Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tratours,
make Ample Satisfaction.</p>
                     <p>What Effect this Letter might have produced, if the Contents thereof had been
communicated to the Generality of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Army, it is hard to say. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is, that those, who had the Conduct of the <hi>Scot's</hi> Affairs, (as if they had
been totally carried on to their own Destruction,) resolved not to put it to the
venture: but, on the contrary, caused it to be noised abroad; That, <hi>Nothing
would content the</hi> English, <hi>but to have the young Queen at their disposal: and,
under colour of a Marriage, to subdue the Kingdom; which was to be reduced
for ever to the form of a Province.</hi> This false Report did so exasperate all sorts
of people; that they were instant for the Fight. Which was as chearfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
by the Chief Commanders of the <hi>English</hi> Army; in regard of some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,
which was brought unto them, that the <hi>French</hi> were coming
with twelve Galleys, and fifty Ships, to fall upon them in the Rear. So as both
Parties being resolved to try their Fortune, they ranged their Armies in this
manner. The <hi>English,</hi> having gained an Hill, which was near their Shipping,
disposed their Army in this Order. The <hi>Avant-Guard,</hi> consisting of between
three and four thousand <hi>Foot,</hi> one hundred <hi>Men at Arms,</hi> and six hundred
light <hi>Horse-men,</hi> was Conducted by the Earl of <hi>Warwick.</hi> After which
followed the <hi>Main-Battail,</hi> consisting of about six thousand <hi>Foot,</hi> six
hundred <hi>Men at Arms,</hi> and about one thousand light <hi>Horse-men;</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Lord <hi>Protectour</hi> himself. And, finally, the <hi>Arrear,</hi> consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of between three and four thousand <hi>Foot,</hi> one hundred <hi>Men at Arms,</hi>
and six hundred <hi>Light-Horse,</hi> was led by the Lord <hi>Dacres;</hi> an <hi>Active,</hi>
though an <hi>Aged</hi> Gentleman. The rest of the <hi>Horses</hi> was either cast into

their Ground, to gain the Hill which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>y near their Shipping and which also
gave them the advantage both of Sun and Wind, wrought an opinion in the
<hi>Scots;</hi> that they dislodged to no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

might save themselves, though they lost their Carriages. In confidence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
they quitted a place of great strength, where they were incamped, and from
which the whole Army of <hi>England</hi> was not able to force them.</p>
                     <p>But the old <hi>English</hi> Proverb telleth us, that, <hi>They that reckon without their
Host, are to reckon twice;</hi> and so it fared with this infatuated People. For
on the tenth of <hi>September,</hi> the Battails being ready to joyn, a Peece of Ordnance,
discharged from the Galley of <hi>England,</hi> took off five and twenty of their men;
amongst whom the eldest Son of the Lord <hi>Graham</hi> was one. Whereupon four
thousand Archers, terrified with so unexpected a slaughter, made a stand, and
could never after be brought on: so, that they stood like men amaz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d; as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
having Hearts to Fight, nor Opportunity to Fly. Which consternation
notwithstanding, the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> being sent with a strong Party of Horse to
give the Onset, found the <hi>Main Body</hi> so well Embattailed, and such a Valiant
Opposition made by a stand of <hi>Pikes;</hi> that they were almost as impenetrable as
a Rock of Adamants: till being terrified by the <hi>English</hi> Ordnance, which
came thundering on them from the top of the Hill, and galled by the Great-Shot
from the Ships, they began to brangle. Which, being perceived by the <hi>English,</hi>
they gave a loud Shout, crying; <hi>They Fly, They Fly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and thereby so astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the affrighted Enemy; that they began to fly indeed, and presently throwing
down their Arms, betook themselves unto their Heels. Many were slain upon
the <hi>Place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> more executed in the <hi>Chase,</hi> and not a few in the <hi>Esk;</hi> which so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>providently
they had passed the day before: so, that the number of the slain
was thought to have amounted to fourteen thousand. About fifteen hundred
of both sorts were taken Prisoners, amongst which the daring Earl of <hi>Huntly</hi>
was one of the Chief; who, being after asked, How he liked the Marriage, is
said to have returned this Answer, That, <hi>He could well enough brook the Wedding,
but that he did not like that kind of Woing.</hi> Amongst the number of the slain
were found good store of <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Friers:</hi> some thousands of which had put
themselves into the Army; which had been raised especially by their Power and
Practices.</p>
                     <p>The Greatness of the Booty in Arms, and Baggage, was not the least cause,
that the <hi>English</hi> reaped no better Fruit from so great a Victory, and did not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66032:76"/>
prosecute the War to an absolute Conquest. For, being intent in pillaging the
dead, and gathering up the Spoils of the field, and solacing themselves in <hi>Leith,</hi>
for five dayes together; they gave the <hi>Scots</hi> time to make Head again, to fortifie
some Strong places on the other side of the <hi>Fryth,</hi> and to remove the Queen to
<hi>Dun-britton</hi>-Castle: from whence they conveyed her into <hi>France</hi> in the year
next following. And, though the loss, rather then neglect, of this opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is to be attributed in the first place to God's secret pleasure; who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the Union of the Kingdoms till an happier time: yet were there many
<hi>Second Causes</hi> and <hi>subordinate Motives,</hi> which might prevail upon the Lord
<hi>Protectour</hi> to return for <hi>England,</hi> without advancing any further. For either
he might be taken off by the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who then began to cast an Envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
eye on his Power and Greatness. Or, might be otherwise unwilling, of his
own accord, to tempt his Fortune any further; by hazarding that Honour in a
second Battail, which he had acquired in the first. Or, he might think it more
conducible to his Affairs, to be present at the following <hi>Parliament;</hi> in which he
had some work to do, which seemed more needfull to him, then the War with
<hi>Scotland.</hi> The good Success whereof would be ascribed to his Officers and
Commanders; but the Misfortunes wholly reckoned upon His account. Or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
(which I rather think) he might conceive it necessary to preserve his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and Quarter it in the most convenient places near the <hi>English</hi> Borders:
that it might be ready at Command upon all occasions; if his Designs should
meet with any opposition, as before was said. And this may be believed the
rather; because that, having fortified some Islands in the Mouth of the <hi>Fryth,</hi>
he Garisoned the greatest part of his Army in <hi>Roxborough, Haddington, Hume</hi>-Castle,
and other Peeces of importance; most of them lying near together,
and the furthest not above a days March from <hi>Berwick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now as concerning the Day, in which this Victory was obtained, I finde two
notable Mistakes. The one committed by the Right Reverend Bishop <hi>Godwin:</hi>
and the other by the no less Learned Sir <hi>John Hayward.</hi> By Bishop <hi>Godwin</hi> it is
placed, exceeding rightly, on the tenth of <hi>September;</hi> but then he doth observe
it, as a thing remarkable; That this memorable Victory was obtained on the
very same day, in which the <hi>Images,</hi> which had been taken out of the several
Churches, were burned in <hi>London.</hi> Whereas we are informed by <hi>John Stow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Observer of Days, and Times; That the <hi>Images</hi> in the Churches of <hi>London</hi>
were not taken down before the seventeenth of <hi>November.</hi> And we are told by
Sir <hi>John Hayward,</hi> that the day of this Fight was the tenth of <hi>December,</hi> which
must be either a mistake of the Press, or a slip of the Pen; it being noted in the
words next following, That on the same day, thirty four years afore, the <hi>Scots</hi> had
been defeated by the <hi>English</hi> at <hi>Flodden</hi>-field. Which though it pointeth us back
to the Moneth of <hi>September;</hi> yet the mistake remaineth as unto the Day: that
Battail being fought, not on the tenth, but the ninth of <hi>September;</hi> as all our
Writers do agree. But, leaving these Mistakes behind us, let us attend the Lord
<hi>Protectour</hi> to the Court of <hi>England.</hi> Towards which he hastened with such
speed; that he stayed but twenty five days upon <hi>Scotish</hi> Ground from his first
<hi>Entrance</hi> to his <hi>Exit.</hi> And being come unto the Court, he was not onely wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed
by the King for so great a Service, with a Present of 500l. <hi>per Ann.</hi> to him,
and to his Heirs for ever; but highly Honoured by all sorts of people: the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in regard, that he had bought so great a Victory at so cheap a Rate; as the
loss of sixty Horse onely, and but one of his Foot.</p>
                     <p>And now 'tis high time to attend the <hi>Parliament,</hi> which took beginning on
the fourth of <hi>November;</hi> and was Prorogued on the twenty fourth of <hi>December</hi>
following. In which the <hi>Cards</hi> were so well packed by Sir <hi>Ralph Sadlier;</hi> that
there was no need of any other shuffling till the end of the <hi>Game:</hi> this very <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
without any sensible alteration of the Members of it, being continued
by Protogation, from Session to Session; untill at last it ended by the Death of
the King. For a Preparatory whereunto, <hi>Richard</hi> Lord <hi>Rich</hi> was made Lord
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:66032:77"/>
                        <hi>Chancellour,</hi> on the twenty fourth of <hi>October;</hi> and Sir <hi>John Baker,</hi> Chancellour
of the Court of <hi>First-Fruits</hi> and <hi>Tenths,</hi> was nominated <hi>Speaker</hi> for the
<hi>House of Commons.</hi> And, that all things might be carried with as little opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and noise as might be, it was thought fit, that Bishop <hi>Gardiner</hi> should
be kept in Prison, till the end of the Session: and that Bishop <hi>Tonstal</hi> of <hi>Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
(a man of a most even, and moderate Spirit) should be made less in Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
by being deprived of his Place at the Council-Table. And though the
<hi>Parliament</hi> consisted of such Members, as disagreed amongst themselves, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of Religion: yet they agreed well enough together in one Common Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple;
which was, to serve the present Time, and preserve themselves. For,
though a great part of the Nobility, and not a few of the Chief Gentry in the
<hi>House of Commons,</hi> were cordially affected to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> yet were
they willing to give way to all such <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Statutes,</hi> as were made against it,
out of a fear of losing such Church-Lands, as they were possessed of, if that
Religion should prevail, and get up again. And for the rest, who either were
to make, or improve their Fortunes; there is no question to be made, but that
they came resolved to further such a <hi>Reformation,</hi> as should most visibly conduce
to the Advancement of their several Ends. Which appears plainly by the strange
mixture of the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Results</hi> thereof: some tending simply to God's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and the Good of the Church; some to the present Benefit, and enriching of
particular Persons; and some again being devised of purpose to prepare a way
for exposing the Revenues of the Church unto Spoil and Rapine. Not to say a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing of those <hi>Acts,</hi> which were merely Civil, and tended to the Profit
and Emolument of the Common-Wealth.</p>
                     <p>Of the first Sort was <hi>The Act for repealing several Statutes concerning Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
Under which head, besides those many bloody Laws, which concerned the
Life of the Subject in Civil Matters, and had been made in the distracted Times
of the late King <hi>Henry,</hi> there was a Repeal also of all such <hi>Statutes,</hi> as seemed
to touch the Subject in Life, or Liberty, for matter of Conscience: some
whereof had been made, in the Times of King <hi>Richard the Second,</hi> and <hi>Henry
the Fourth,</hi> against such, as, dissenting in Opinion from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
were then called <hi>Lollards.</hi> Of which Sort also was another, made in the twenty
fifth of the King Deceased, together with that terrible Statute of the <hi>Six Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
(commonly called <hi>The whip with six strings,</hi>) made in the thirty first year of
the said King <hi>Henry.</hi> Others were of a milder Nature, (but such as were thought
inconsistent with that Freedom of Conscience, which most men coveted to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy;)
that is to say, <hi>The Act for Qualification of the said Six Articles;</hi> 35. H.
8. cap 9. <hi>The Act inhibiting the Reading of the Old and New Testament in the</hi>
English <hi>Tongue, and the Printing, Selling, Giving, or Delivering of any such other
Books or Writings,</hi> as are there in mentioned, and condemned; 34. <hi>H. 3. cap.</hi> 1.
But these were also Abrogated as the others were, together with all, and every
<hi>Act,</hi> or <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> concerning <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Matters of Religion;</hi> and all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and every Article, Branch, Sentence, and Matter, Pains, and Forfeitures in the
same contained. By which Repeal all men may seem to have been put into a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Reading Scripture, and being in a manner their own Expositours; of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
what Opinions in Religion best pleased their Fancies; and promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
those Opinions, which they entertained. So that the <hi>English</hi> for a time enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that Liberty, which the <hi>Romanes</hi> are affirmed by <hi>Tacitus</hi> (<note n="*" place="margin">ubi &amp; sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire quae velis, &amp; quae velis loqui liceat. <hi>Tacit.</hi> Hist. <hi>lib.</hi> 1.</note>) to have enjoyed
without comptrol in the Times of <hi>Nerva;</hi> that is to say, <hi>A liberty of Opining
whatsoever they pleased, and speaking freely their Opinions wheresoever they listed.</hi>
Which whether it were such a great Felicity, as that Authour makes it, may be
more then questioned.</p>
                     <p>Of this Sort al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o was the <hi>Act.</hi> entituled <hi>An Act against such, as speak against

Imprisonment, and make Fine and Ransome, at the King's pleasure.</hi> And,
to say Truth, it was but time, that some provision should be made to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
that Irreverence and Profaness, with which this Blessed <hi>Sacrament</hi> was
at that time handled by too many of those, who seemed most ignorantly Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

such parts thereof, as were reserved from time to time, were hanged up over
the <hi>Altar</hi> in a <hi>Pix,</hi> or Box: those zealous ones, in hatred to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
reproached it by the odious Names of <hi>Jack-in-a-box, Round-Robin, Sacrament of
the Halter,</hi> and other Names, so unbecoming the Mouths of <hi>Christians;</hi> that they
were never taken up by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Infidels.</hi> And though Bishop <hi>Ridley,</hi>
a right Learned, and Religious Prelate, frequently in his Sermons had rebuked
the irreverent behaviour of such light and ill-disposed Persons; yet neither he,
nor any other of the Bishops were able to Reform the Abuse: (the Quality,
and Temper of the Times considered) which therefore was thought fit to be
committed to the power of the Civil Magistrate; the Bishop being called in, to
assist at the Sentence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In the last branch of the</hi> Act, <hi>it is First declared,</hi> According to the Truth of
Scripture, and the Tenour of approved Antiquity; That it is most agreeable both to
the Institution of the said Sacrament, and more conformable to the common Vse, and
Practice, both of the Apostles, and of the Primitive Church, by the space of five
hundred years after <hi>Christ's</hi> Ascension; that the said Blessed Sacrament should rather
be ministred unto all <hi>Christian</hi> people under both the Kinds of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine;</hi> then
under the form of <hi>Bread</hi> onely. <hi>And thereupon it was Enacted, That,</hi> The said
most Blessed Sacrament should be hereafter commonly delivered, and ministred unto
the People, within the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and other the King's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
under both the Kinds; that is to say, of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine. With these</hi>
Provisoes <hi>notwithstanding,</hi> If necessity did not otherwise require: <hi>as in the Case
of</hi> suddain Sickness; <hi>and other such like Extremities, in which it was not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that Wine could be provided for the Use of the Sacrament, nor the Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
depart this life in peace without it. And Secondly, That the permitting of
this Liberty to the People of</hi> England, <hi>and the Dominions of the same, should
not be construed to the</hi> condemning of any other Church, <hi>or</hi> Churches, or the Vsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of them, <hi>in which the contrary was observed. So far the Parliament Enacted,
in relation to the thing it self to the subject Matter; that the Communion should
be delivered in both Kinds to all the good People of the Kingdoms. But for the
Form, in which it was to be administred, that was left wholly to the King, and
by the King committed to the Care of the Bishops: (of which more hereafter)
the Parliament declaring onely,</hi> That a Godly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Consecrate without Wine. It were no Reason to binde the Church to the Necessity,

it should seem necessary by this Conclusion, that, in Consideration of them, the

His Heirs, and Successours, must needs have been a great Improvement to the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:66032:78"/>
Crown; if it had been carefully kept together, as it was first pretended: there
being accounted 90. Colleges within the Compass of that Grant, (those in the
Universities not being reckoned in that Number) and no fewer then 2374.
Free-Chapels and Chanteries: the Lands whereof were thus conferred upon the
King by Name, but not intended to be kept together for His Benefit onely. In
which Respect it was very stoutly insisted on by Arch-Bishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> that the
dissolving of these Colleges, Free-Chapels, and Chanteries, should be deferred
untill the King should be of Age; to the intent that they might serve the better
to furnish and maintain His Royal Estate, then that so great a Treasure should be
consumed in His Nonage, as it after was. Of this we shall speak more in the
following year, when the Grant of the said Chanteries, Free-Chapels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> came
to take Effect.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, It will not be amiss to shew, that these Chanteries consisted
of <hi>Salaries,</hi> allowed to one or more Priests to say daily Mass, for the Souls of their
deceased Founders, and their Friends. Which, not subsisting on themselves, were
generally Incorporated, and United to some Parochial, Collegiate, or Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral
Church. No fewer then 47. in Number, being found, and Founded, in Saint
<hi>Paul</hi>'s. Free-Chapels, though Ordained for the same Intent, were Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of themselves, of stronger Constitution, and Richer Endowment, then
the Chanteries severally were; though therein they fell also short of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,
which far exceeded them, both in the Beauty of their Building, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Priests<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> maintained in them and the Proportion of Revenue allotted to
them. All which Foundations, having in them an Admixture of Superstition,
(as Pre-supposing <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and Prayers to be made for Deliverance of the Soul
from thence) were therefore now suppressed upon that Account, and had been
granted to the late King upon other Pretences. At what time it was Preached at
<hi>Mercers-Chapel,</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> by one Doctour <hi>Cromer,</hi> (a Man that wished exceeding
well to the <hi>Reformation</hi>) That, <hi>If</hi> Trentals, <hi>and</hi> Chantery-Masses, <hi>could avail the
Souls in Purgatory, then did the Parliament not well, in giving away Colleges, and
Chanteries; which served principally for that purpose. But if the Parliament did well
in dissolving and bestowing them upon the King: (which he thought that no man could
deny) then was it a plain Case, that such Chanteries, and private Masses did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
no Relief on the Souls in Purgatory.</hi> Which <hi>Dilemma,</hi> though it were unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable:
yet was the matter so handled by the Bishops, seeing how much the
Doctrine of the Church was concerned therein, that they brought him to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation
at Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s Cross, in the <hi>June</hi> next following: (this Sermon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Preached in <hi>Lent</hi>) where he confessed himself to have been seduced by naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
books, contrary to the Doctrine then received in the Church. But the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of these Times went the other way, and <hi>Cromer</hi> might now have Preached
that safely, for which before he had been brought into so much trouble.</p>
                     <p>But that, which made the greatest Alteration, and threatened most danger to
the State Ecclesiastical, was the <hi>Act,</hi> entituled <hi>An Act for Election of Bishops, and
what Seals, and Styles, shall be used by Spiritual Persons.</hi> &amp;c. In which it was
Ordained, (for I shall onely repeat the Sum thereof) That, <hi>Bishops should
be made by the King's Letters Patents, and not by the Election of the Deans and
Chapters:</hi> That <hi>all their Processes, and Writings, should be made in the King's
Name onely, with the Bishop's</hi> Teste <hi>added to it: and sealed with no other Seal,
but the King's, or such, as should be Authorised and Appointed by Him.</hi> In
the Compounding of which Act there was more Danger couched, then at first
appeared. By the last Branch thereof it was plain and evident, that the Intent
of the Contrivers was, by degrees to weaken the Authority of the Episcopal
Order, by forcing them from their Strong-hold of Divine Institution, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them no other, then the King's Ministers onely, His Ecclesiastical <hi>Sheriffs</hi>
(as a man might say) to execute His Will, and disperse His Mandates. And of
this <hi>Act</hi> such use was made, (though possibly beyond the true intention of it)
that the Bishops of those Times were not in a Capacity of conferring Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:66032:79"/>
but as they were thereunto enpowered by especial Licence. The Tenour
whereof (if <hi>Sanders</hi> be to be believed) was in these words following: <hi>viz.
The King to</hi> such a Bishop <hi>Greeting. Whereas all, and all manner of Jurisdiction, as
well Ecclesiastical, as Civil, flows from the King, as from the Supreme Head of

continue during Our Good Pleasure, for holding Ordination within thy Diocess of</hi>

Which being looked on by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> not onely as a dangerous Diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Episcopal Power; but as an Odious Innovation in the Church of
<hi>Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </hi> She caused this <hi>Act</hi> to be repealed in the first Year of Her Reign; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Bishops to depend on their former claim, and to act all things, which
belonged to their Jurisdiction, in their own Names, and under their own Seals,
as in former Times. In which Estate they have continued, without any Legal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption,
from that time to this.</p>
                     <p>But in the first Branch there was somewhat more, then what appeared at the
first sigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. For, though it seemed to aim at nothing; but that the Bishops should
depend wholly on the King, for their preferment to those great and eminent
Places: yet the true Drift of the Design was to make Deans and Chapters useless,
for the time to come, and thereby to prepare them for a Dissolution. For, had
nothing else been intended in it, but that the King should have the sole Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of all the Bishops in His Kingdoms, it had been onely a Reviver of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Power: which had been formerly Invested in His Predecessour's, and in all
other <hi>Christian</hi> Princes. Consult the Stories, and Records, of the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>der Times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and it will readily appear, not onely that the <hi>Romane</hi> Emperours of the House
of <hi>France,</hi> did nominate the <hi>Popes</hi> themselves: but that, after they had lost that
Power, they retained the Nomination of the Bishops in their own Dominions.
The like done also by the <hi>German</hi> Emperours, by the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and
by the Antient Kings of <hi>Spain:</hi> the Investiture being then performed <hi>Per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulum
&amp; Baculum,</hi> as they used to Phrase it; that is to say, by delivering of a
<hi>Ring,</hi> together with a <hi>Crosier,</hi> or <hi>Pastoral Staff,</hi> to the Party nominated. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of which Practice are exceeding obvious in all the Stories of those
Times. But the Popes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> finding at the last, how necessary it was in order to that
absolute Power, which they ambitiously affected over all <hi>Christian</hi> Kings, and
Princes, that the Bishops should depend on none but them, challenged this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
unto themselves: declaring it in several Petit Councels for no less then <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi>
if any man should receive a Bishoprick from the Hands of his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Prince. From hence those long and deadly Quarrels begun between Pope
<hi>Hildebrand</hi> and the Emperour <hi>Henry the Fourth,</hi> and continued by their
Successours for many years after. From hence the like Disputes in <hi>England,</hi>
between Pope <hi>Vrban the Second</hi> and King <hi>William Rufus;</hi> between Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi>
and King <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>hn:</hi> till in the end the Popes prevailed both here and elsewhere,
and gained the point unto themselves. But so: that, to disguise the matter, the
Election of the future Bishop was committed to the Prior and Convent, or to
the Dean and Chapter of that Cathedral, wherein he was to be Installed. Which,
passing by the Name of Free Elections, were wholly, in a manner, at the Pope's
Disposing.</p>

Churches became void of a Bishop, they were filled again with fit Persons by
His said Progenitours, as in their own Natural and proper Right. The like done
by the <hi>French</hi> Kings to this very day, partly by virtue of the <hi>Pragmatical San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
established at the Councel of <hi>Basil,</hi> and partly by the <hi>Concordate</hi> between
King <hi>Francis the First,</hi> and Pope <hi>Leo the Tenth.</hi> And the like also challenged by
the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> within the Verge, and Territories of that Republick. For
which consult the <hi>English</hi> History of that State, <hi>Decad. 5. lib. 9. fol.</hi> 229. So
that, upon the whole matter, there was no Innovation made, as to this particular:
but a Restoring to the Crown an antient Power, which had been Naturally
and Originally in the Crown before. But howsoever, having the appearance of
an Alteration from the received manner of Electings in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>
and that, which was Established by the late King for the Realm of <hi>England:</hi> it was
repealed by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and put into the former Chanel by Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But from this Alteration, which was made in Parliament, in reference to the
manner of Making Bishops, and the way of Exercising their Authority, when
they were so made, let us proceed unto such Changes, as we finde made amongst
the Bishops themselves. The first whereof was the Election of Doctor <hi>Nicholas
Ridley</hi> to the See of <hi>Rochester:</hi> to which he had been nominated by King <hi>Henry
the Eighth,</hi> when <hi>Holbeck,</hi> who preceded him, was designed for <hi>Lincoln.</hi> But,
the King dying shortly after, the Translation of <hi>Holbeck</hi> was deferred till the
Time of King <hi>Edward:</hi> which was no sooner done, but <hi>Ridley</hi> was chosen to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
him; although not actually Consecrated till the fifth of <hi>September.</hi> A man
of great Learning, as the Times then were, and for his excellent way of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
highly esteemed by the late King; whose Chaplain he had been for many
years before His death: and upon that onely designed to this Preferment, as
the reward of his Service. Being well studyed in the Fathers, it was no hard
matter for him to observe; That, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had erred in the Point of
the Sacrament: so, as well the <hi>Lutheran,</hi> as the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Churches, had
run themselves into some errour, by opposing the <hi>Papists:</hi> the one being forced
upon the Figment of Consubstantiation; the other to fly to Signs and Figures,
as if there had been nothing else in the blessed <hi>Eucharist.</hi> Which being obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
he thought it most agreeable to the Rules of Piety, to frame his Judgement
to the Dictates of the Antient Fathers: and so to hold a <hi>Real Presence</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>'s
Body and Blood in the Holy Sacrament; as to exclude that Corporal Eating of the
same, which made the <hi>Christian Faith</hi> a scorn both to the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors.</hi>
Which Doctrine as he stoutly stood to in all his Examinations at <hi>Oxford,</hi> when he
was preparing for the Stake, so he maintained it constantly in his Sermons also:
in which it was affirmed; That, <hi>In the Sacrament were truly and verily the Body and
Blood of Christ, made forth effectually by Grace, and Spirit.</hi> And, being so perswaded
in his own Opinion he so prevailed by Discourse and Argument with Arch-Bishop
<hi>Cranmer,</hi> as to bring him also to the same; (for which consult the <hi>Acts and
M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>n.</hi> fol.) a man of a most even and constant spirit, as he declared in all
his Actions: but in none more, then in the opposition, which he made against Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>Hooper</hi> in Maintainance of the Rites, and Ceremonies, then by Law Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
of which we shall have opportunity to speak more hereafter.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, we are to look upon the Preferment of Doctor <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi>
to the Bishoprick of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells;</hi> succeeding in the place of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:66032:80"/>
                        <hi>Knight,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">An. 7/8</note> who dyed on the twenty ninth of the same <hi>September.</hi> He had been once
<hi>Prior</hi> of the Monastery of <hi>Bisham,</hi> in the County of <hi>Berks:</hi> from whence preferred
to the See of <hi>Asaph,</hi> in the end of <hi>February, An.</hi> 1535. And, in the <hi>April</hi> following,
Translated to the Church of St. <hi>David</hi>'s. During his sitting in which See, he fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an honest and convenient Project, for removing the Episcopal See from the
decayed City of St. <hi>David</hi>'s, most incommodiously Scituate in the remotest
Angle of all the Diocess, to the rich Borough of <hi>Caer-marthen,</hi> in the midst there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
in the Chief Church whereof, being a Monastery of <hi>Grey-Friars,</hi> the body
of <hi>Edmond</hi> Earl of <hi>Richmond,</hi> the Father of K. <hi>Henry the Seventh</hi> received Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Which Project he presented to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> being then Vicar General,
endearing it by these Motives and Propositions; that is to say, That, being scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
in the midst of the Diocess, it was very opportune for the profiting of
the King's Subjects, for the Preferment of God's Word, for abolishing all <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian</hi>
Superstition, and settling in the Diocess the King's Supremacy; That
it was furnished with all things necessary for the conveniency of the Canons, and
might be done without any prejudice to the <hi>Friars:</hi> for every one of which he
offered to provide a sufficient, Maintainance. And, to advance the work the
more, he offered to remove his Consistory thither, to found therein a <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi>-Schole,
and settle a daily Lecture in Divinity there, for the reducing of the
<hi>Welsh</hi> from their ancient Rudeness to the Civility of the Time. All which I finde
in the Memorials of Sir <hi>Robert Cotton.</hi> And unto these he might have added,
That he had a fair Episcopal House at <hi>Abberguilly,</hi> very near that Town: in which
the Bishops of that Diocess have for the most part made their Dwelling. So that
all Parties seemed to have been provided for in the Proposition: and therefore
the more to be admired; That, in a Time so much addicted unto Alterations, it
should speed no better. For, notwithstanding all these Motives, the See re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
where it was, and the Bishop continued in that See till this present year;
in which he was made use of, amongst many others, by the Lord Protectour, for
Preaching up the War against <hi>Scotland.</hi> For which and many other good Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
already passed, but more to be performed hereafter, he was Translated to this
See on the death of <hi>Knight:</hi> but the precise Day, and Time thereof, I have no
where found. But I have found, that, being Translated to this See, he gratified
the Lord Protectour with a Present of eighteen or nineteen Manours, which
antiently belonged unto it; and lying, all, or most part of them, in the County
of <hi>Sommerset,</hi> seemed very conveniently disposed of, for the better Maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the Dukedom, or rather of the Title of the Duke of <hi>Sommerset;</hi> which
he had took unto himself. More of which strange Donations we shall finde in
others: the more to be excused, because there was no other means (as the Times
then were) to preserve the whole; but by advancing some part thereof to the
Spoil of others.</p>

                     <p>Such was the Tenour of this Letter: the Date whereof doth very visibly declare,
that the Counsel was as suddain, as the Warning short. For, being Dated on the
28th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>January,</hi> it was not possible, that any Reformation should be made in
the first particular; but onely in the Cities of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> and the
parts adjoyning: the Feast of <hi>Purification</hi> following within five days after. But
yet the Lords drove on so fast; that, before this Order could be published, in the
remote parts of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> they followed it with another, (as little pleasing
to the main body of the People) concerning Images; which in some places of
the Realm were either not taken down at all, as was required the year before
by the King's <hi>Injunctions,</hi> or had been re-advanced again assoon as the first Heats
of the Visitation had began to cool. Which, because it cannot be expressed
more clearly, then in the Letters of the Council to the Lord Arch-Bishop, and
that the Reader be not troubled with any Repetitions; I shall commit the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
thereof to the Letters themselves: which are these that follow.</p>

now of late, in the King's Majestie's Visitations, amongst other Godly <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions,</hi>
Commanded generally to be observed through all parts of this His

that this said <hi>Injunction</hi> hath in many parts of the Realm been quietly obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

of the same. Some men being so Superstitious, or rather Willfull; as

been most manifestly abused.<note place="margin">An. Reg. 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1547/8.</note> And almost in every place is Contention for Images,

                     <p>Which great Commotions the Council could not but fore-see, as the most
probable Consequents of such Alterations: especially when they are suddain,
and pressed too fast. There being nothing, of which People commonly are so

all their antient Ceremonies; which either might consist with Piety, or the
Profit of the Common-Wealth. And, in particular, it was held expedient to give
the generality of the Subject some contentment, in a <hi>Proclamation</hi> for the

to the Libelling against that antient and Religious Fast, in most scandalous
Rhythms. Complaint whereof being made by Bishop <hi>Gardiner,</hi> in a Letter to
the Lord <hi>Protectour;</hi> a <hi>Proclamation</hi> was set out, bearing Date in <hi>January,</hi> by
which all People were Commanded to abstain from Flesh in the time of

                     <p>And now comes Bishop <hi>Latimer</hi> on the Stage again: being a man of Parts and

so much to mistrust Our Zeal; as though we either would not discern
what were to be done, or would not do all things in due time: God be praised,

                     <p>The next Care was, to see the said Order put in execution: of which the Lords

then the rest) so many Parish-Priests, not being willing to Advance so good a
Work, laboured to disaffect the People to the present Government. And to that
end it was endeavoured in their <hi>Sermons,</hi> to possess their Auditours with an ill
opinion of the King; as if he did intend to lay strange Exactions on the Subject,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:66032:83"/>
by forcing them to pay half a Crown a piece for every one, who should be Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,

bearing Date the twenty fourth of <hi>April;</hi> That none should be permitted

                     <p>In the next place we must attend the King's <hi>Commissioners,</hi> dispatched in the

of all Colleges, Free-Chapels, Chanteries, and Brother-Hoods, within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of the Statute, or Act of Parliament. According to the Return of whose
Commissions, it would be found no difficult matter to put a just estimate and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
on so great a Gift, or to know how to parcell out, proportion, and divide
the Spoil betwixt all such, who had before in hope devoured it. In the first place,
as lying nearest, came in the Free-Chapel of Saint <hi>Stephen,</hi> Originally Founded in
the Palace at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and reckoned for the Chapel-Royal of the Court of
<hi>England.</hi> The whole Foundation consisted of no fewer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then thirty eight Persons:
<hi>viz.</hi> one Dean, twelve Canons, thirteen Vicars, four Clerks, six Choristers;
besides a Verger, and one that had the Charge of the Chapel. In place of
whom a certain Number were appointed for Officiating the daily Service in the

                        </gap>aries, together with that of the Choristers, and other Servants of the same,
amounts to a round yearly Sum: and yet the King, if the Lands belonging to
that Chapel had been kept together, and honestly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>aid unto the Crown, had been
a very rich Gainer by it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the yearly Rents thereof being valued at 1085 l.
10 s. 5 d. As for the Chapel it self, together with a Clolyster of curious
Workmanship, built by <hi>John Chambers,</hi> one of the King's Physicians, and the
last Master of the same; they are still standing as they were: the Chapel having
been since fitted, and imployed for an House of Commons, in all times of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
                     <p>At the same time also fell the College of St. <hi>Martin's,</hi> commonly called <hi>St.
Martin's le Grand,</hi> scituate in the City of <hi>London,</hi> not far from <hi>Aldersgate:</hi>
first founded for a Dean, and Secular Canons, in the time of the <hi>Conquerour,</hi>
and afterwards, privileged for a Sanctuary; the Rights whereof it constantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
without interruption, till all privilege of Sanctuary was suppressed in this
Realm by King <hi>Henry the Eighth.</hi> But the Foundation it self being now found
to be Superstitious, it was surrrendred into the hands of King <hi>Edward the Sixth:</hi>
who after gave the same, together with the remaining Liberties, and Precincts
thereof, to the Church of <hi>Westminster:</hi> and they, to make the best of the King's
Donation, appointed, by a Chapter held the seventh of <hi>July,</hi> that the Body of
the Church, with the Quire and Iles, should be Leased out for fifty years, at the
Rent of five Marks <hi>per Annum</hi> to one <hi>H. Keeble</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> excepting out of the
said Grant, the Bells<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lead, Stone, Timber, Glass and Iron, to be sold and
disposed of, for the sole Use and Benefit of the said Dean and Chapter. Which
foul Transaction being made, the Church was totally pulled down; a Tavern
built in the East part of it: the rest of the site of the said Church and College,
together with the whole Precinct thereof, being built upon with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Tenements, and let out to Strangers; who very industriously affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to dwell therein (as the natural <hi>English</hi> since have done) in regard of the

and thinking, that the Church of <hi>Westminster,</hi> (as being of a late Foundation)

remained unto it. And being then unfurnished of an House, or Palace, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable

which they presented to the Lord <hi>Thomas Seimour,</hi> to serve as an Addition to his

                     <p>Thus leaving <hi>England</hi> for a while, we are to take a short Survey of Affairs
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> into which the <hi>French</hi> had put ten thousand Souldiers; three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
of them being <hi>Almains,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Mounsieur D' Essie;</hi>
who, joyning with the <hi>Scots<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> laid Siege before the Town of <hi>Haddington,</hi> on
<hi>St. Peter</hi>'s-Eve. For the Relief whereof a strength of one thousand three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:66032:84"/>
Horse was sent from <hi>Berwick,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">An. Reg. 2.<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1548.</note> under the Conduct of Sir <hi>Robert Bowes,</hi> and
Sir <hi>Thomas Palmer;</hi> who, falling very unfortunately into the Hands of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
were for the most part slain or taken. The <hi>English</hi> notwithstanding made
good the Town<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and held it out so long; that in the end the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
with a Power of sixteen thousand men, (of which there were four thousand
<hi>Lansquenets,</hi> or <hi>Germane</hi> Souldiers) appeared in fight. On whose approach,
the Enemy withdrew themselves, and raised their Siege on or about the twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
day of <hi>August;</hi> giving great commendation to the <hi>English</hi> Garison, for the
notable service they had done in defence of the Town. The Siege being raised,
the Earl of <hi>Shrewbury</hi> with his Forces returned for <hi>England;</hi> leaving the Town
well stored with Victuals, and plentifully furnished with all manner of Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which put the Souldiers of the Garison into so good heart; that they made
many Sallies out, and frequently Skirmished with the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> whom
they found Quartered in the Villages and Towns adjoyning. But, the matter being
taken into Debate by the Council of <hi>England,</hi> it was Resolved, especially by those,
who secretly envied at the Power and Greatness of the Lord <hi>Protectour;</hi> That
the keeping of the Town would not quit the Cost; as being farthest from the
Borders, and not to be Relieved, if it were distressed, without the raising and
imploying of a Royal Army. And thereupon the Earl of <hi>Rutland</hi> was sent thither
with three thousand of the <hi>Lansquenets,</hi> and as many Borderers: who, coming to
the Town on the twentieth of <hi>September,</hi> sleighted the Works; and, having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
the Houses, caused all the Ordnance, and Carriages, to be sent to <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi>
and returned without Battail. The voluntary quitting of which Town
drew after it the loss of all the Peeces, which we held in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>English</hi> Forces being removed from the Town of <hi>Haddington,</hi> the <hi>French</hi>
immediately prepared for their going home-wards: carrying a richer Lading
with them; then all the Arms, and Ammunition, which they brought at their
coming. For, while the Army lay at the Siege at <hi>Haddington,</hi> the Ministers of
the <hi>French</hi> King were busied in Treaty with the <hi>Scots,</hi> for putting the Young
Queen into their Power, transporting her into <hi>France,</hi> and Marrying her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Daulphin.</hi> But in this point they found the Council much divided. Some
thought, That the Conditions, offered by the Lord <hi>Protectour,</hi> (not till then gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
known) were to be embraced; in regard it gave them an assurance of ten
years Peace at the least; and that, if either of the <hi>Princes</hi> died within that time, they
should be left at Liberty, to Order the Affairs of that Kingdom to the most Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
But against this it was alledged by those of the opposite Party; (whom
the <hi>French</hi> King had bought with ready Money, and Anual Pensions.) That, as
long as the Queen remained amongst them, they should never be Free from the
Pretensions of the <hi>English.</hi> From which, there was no question, but they would
desist; when they saw the Ground thereof to be taken away by the Queens Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval.
Of which Party, (besides those, which were corrupted by the Gold
of <hi>France</hi>) were the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Clergy;</hi> who, being Zealous for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Old Religion, abominated nothing more, then the Alliance with <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
And so the matter being carried in behalf of the <hi>French,</hi> and there being
now no further need of them for defence of the Countrey, they gave Order to
make ready their Shipping, and nominated a set day for their Departure. Which
day being come, they Coasted about <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the Isles of <hi>Orkney,</hi> took in the
young Queen at <hi>Dun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

arrived in <hi>Bretaigne;</hi> whilest a strong Squadron of the <hi>English</hi> attended for their
coming in the <hi>Narrow-Seas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this Departure of the <hi>French,</hi> though it much weakened, did not disani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
the <hi>Scots,</hi> for making trial of their Fortune against the <hi>English. Hume</hi>-Castle,
and <hi>Fast</hi>-Castle, remained (amongst some others) as Thorns in their
Sides: but they regained them both this year. <hi>Hume</hi>-Castle they surprised by
means of some of their own Nation; who, being reputed Friends, and suffered
to have free and frequent Access unto it, had Opportunity, both to discover the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:66032:84"/>
Weaknesses of it, and by what Ways it might most easily be taken. And, being
more cordially affected to their Old Country-men, then their New Acquaintance,
they directed a select number of Souldiers to some secret Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

put the secure Garison to the Sword, and possessed the Place, leaving a fair
warning unto all others; <hi>Never to trust the Courtesies, or Services of those,
whom they have provoked to be their Enemies. Fast</hi>-Castle they surprised by a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Stratageme. For the Governour having Commanded the neighbouring
Villages, at a prefixed day, to bring in their Contribution of Corn, and other
necessary Provision; the Enemy makes Use of this Opportunity. Souldiers,
habited like <hi>Peasants,</hi> came at the day, fraught with their Burthens; whereof
having eased their Horses, they carry them on their shoulders over the Bridg,
(which joyned two Rocks together) and so gained Entrance: the Watch-word
being given, they cast down their Burthens, till the <hi>Sentinels</hi> open the Gates to
their Fellows; and become Masters of the Place. The News of which Surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals,
together with that of the <hi>Queens</hi> Removal, being brought into the Court
of <hi>England,</hi> which then began to be divided into Sides and Factions; there was

he was commanded to remain untill further Order. But there also he behaved
himself with much unquietness, medling in many matters, which concerned the
King; for which he had neither <hi>Warrant,</hi> nor <hi>Commission:</hi> whereof being once
again admonished by their <hi>Lordships,</hi> he did not onely promise to conform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
like a good Subject; but to declare his Conformity to the World, in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<hi>Sermon,</hi> in sundry <hi>Articles</hi> agreed upon; that such, as were offended, might

the <hi>Sacrament</hi> to be Administred in both Kinds, and shewed his Approbation of

and <hi>Administration of the Sacraments,</hi> and other <hi>Rites,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the

                        <q>That many at

that in many places it was irreverently used, and cast out of the

                        </gap>oughout his Realm, and
for putting an End to all Controversies in Religion, He had caused certain Godly Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
and other notable Learned men to be Congregated, or called together. <hi>And
thereupon doth inferr,</hi> That, notwithstanding many of the Preachers, formerly
Licenced, had behaved themselves very discreetly, and wisely; to the Honour of
God, and the Contentation of His Highness: yet till such time, as the said Order
should be generally set forth throughout the Realm, His Majesty did thereby inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
all manner of Persons, whatsoever they be, to Preach in open Audience, in the
Pulpit, or otherwise, by any sought colour, or fraud, to the disobeying of His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.

and would answer to the contrary at their Perils.</p>
                     <p>And here it is to be Observed; That those, who had the chief directing of
this weighty Business, were before-hand resolved, that none but <hi>English</hi> Heads,
or Hands, should be used therein: left otherwise it might be thought, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
Objected; that they rather followed the Example of some other Churches,
or were swayed by the Authority of those Foreign Assistants; then by the Word
of God, and the most uncorrupted Practice of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Times. Certain
it is, that, upon the very first Reports of a <hi>Reformation</hi> here intended, <hi>Calvin</hi>
had offered his Assistance to Arch-Bishop <hi>Craenmer;</hi> as himself confesseth. But
the Arch-Bishop knew the Man, and refused the Offer. And it appears in one
of Bishop <hi>Latimer</hi>'s <hi>Sermons,</hi> that there was report, about this time, of <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon</hi>'s
coming; but it proved onely a Report. And, though it was thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
for the better seasoning of the <hi>Vniversities</hi> in the <hi>Protestant Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Religion;</hi> that <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> and <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> two eminent <hi>Divines</hi>
of the Foreign Churches, should be invited to come over: yet the Arch-Bishop's
Letter of <hi>Invitation,</hi> sent to <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> was not written till the twelfth
day of <hi>October.</hi> At what time the <hi>Liturgie</hi> then in hand, being the chief Key to
the whole Work of <hi>Reformation,</hi> was in very good forwardness: and must needs be
compleatly finished, before he could so settle, and dispose his Affairs in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi>
as to come for <hi>England.</hi> And though <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> being either more at
Leasure, or less engaged, or otherwise more willing to accept of the Invitation,
came many Moneths before the other: yet neither do we finde him here, till the
end of <hi>November<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> when the <hi>Liturgie</hi> had been approved of by the King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
if it had not also passed the Approbation of both <hi>Houses</hi> of <hi>Parliament.</hi> Nor
was it likely, that they should make use of such a Man in composing a <hi>Liturgie;</hi>
wherein they were resolved to retain a great part of the Antient <hi>Ceremonies:</hi>
who, being made <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Christ-Church</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and frequently present
at <hi>Divine Service</hi> in that Church, could never be prevailed with, to put on the

they made suit unto the Pope, then being, to have their Publick Service in their

<hi>It were much to be desired, that Priests, and all others in Holy Orders, might ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain

it is considered, That as all men have not the Gift of Continence, so many great
Scandals, and other notable Inconveniencies, have been occasioned in the
Church by the enforced Necessity of a single Life, in those admitted unto Orders.
Which seeing it was no more imposed on them, then on any other, by the Word of
God, but onely such positive Laws and Constitutions, as had been made to that
Effect by the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> It was therefore Enacted by the Authority of the

it would by no means be admitted. The Reason was; Because that having
Houses, Wives and Children, they would depend no longer upon the Pope, but
onely on their several Princes: that the Love to their Children would make them
yield to many things, which were prejudicial to the Church, and in short time

with the Stories of the middle Times, when Priests were forced to put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

which they were possessed of; they would have found what horrible Confusions
did ensue upon it in all the Kingdoms of the <hi>West,</hi> what Tragical Exclamations
were made against the Popes, for so great a Tyranny. Or finally, If they had looked
upon the scandalous Effects, which this forced <hi>Coelibate</hi> produced, they could not
but have heard some News of <hi>Pope Gregory</hi>'s Fish Pond: and must have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in their own <hi>Panormitan,</hi> that the greatest part of the Clergy were given
over to prohibited Lusts; and by others of their Canonists, that Clerks were not
to be deprived for their Incontinency: considering, how few there were to be
found without it; so universal was the Mischief, that it was thought uncapable
of any Remedy.</p>
                     <p>If we desire to be further informed in it, as a matter Doctrinal, we shall finde
many eminent men in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to state the point in favour of a
married Clergy. By <hi>Gratian</hi> it is said, That the Marriage of Priests is neither
prohibited by the Law, or any precept in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> or any Canon of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.
By Cardinal <hi>Cajetan,</hi> That it can neither be proved by Reason, nor good

                        </gap>thority, that a Priest committeth any sin by being married. By the same <hi>Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>
That Orders neither in themselves, nor as they are accompanied by the
Title of <hi>Holy,</hi> are any Hinderances, or Obstructions in the Way of Marriage.
By <hi>Panormitan,</hi> The <hi>Coelibate,</hi> or the single Life of Priests, is neither of the
Essence of Holy Orders, nor required by the Law of God. By <hi>Antoninus,</hi> That
there is nothing in the Episcopal Function, which can disable the Bishop from
the married life. By the Authour of the <hi>Gloss</hi> upon the <hi>Decrees,</hi> That the
<hi>Greek</hi> Priests neither explicitely, nor implicitely, do bind themselves to Chastity
or a single life. By Pope <hi>Pius</hi> himself in the Councel of <hi>Basil,</hi> That many might be
saved in a married Priesthood, which are in danger to be damned by living un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married.
By <hi>Durand,</hi> That it would be profitable to the Church, if Marriage
were allowed to Priests, from whom it hath been found a very vain thing to
look for chastity. And finally by <hi>Martinus,</hi>

Passages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> together with the words of the several Authours in the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue,
I shall refer the Reader to the Learned and Laborious Works of Bishop <hi>Jewel,</hi> in
the Defence of his Challenge against Doctour <hi>Harding,</hi> cap. 8. 1. 3. And so I shut
up this Discourse, and therewith the Defence of this Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> with
the most memorable Apophthegm of the said Pope <hi>Pius,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Law had

                     </p>
                     <p>Two other Acts were passed in this present <hi>Parliament,</hi> exceeding necessary
for the Preservation of the Churches Patrimony, and the Retaining of good
Order. The fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>st was made for the Encouragement and Support of the Parochial
Clergy, in the true Payment of their Tithes, lately invaded by their Patrons, and
otherwise in danger to be lost for ever, by the avaritiousness of the Parishioners,
as before was said. For Remedy whereof, it was Enacted, <hi>That no Person, or
Persons, should from thenceforth take, or carry away, any Tithe, or Tithes, which
had been received, or paid, within the space of fourty years next before the Date
thereof, or of Right ought to have been paid, in the place, or places, tithable in the
same, before he hath justly divided, or set forth for the Tithe thereof, the tenth
part of the same, or otherwise agree, for the same Tithes, with the Parson, Vicar,
or other Owner, Proprietary, or Farmer of the same, under the Pain or Forfeiture of
the treble Value of the Tithes, so taken, or carried away.</hi> To which a Clause
was also added, enabling the said Parsons, Vicars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to enter upon any man's
Land, for the due setting out of his Tithes, and carrying away the same with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Molestation; with other Clauses no less beneficial to the injured Clergy.
And because the Revenue of the Clergy had been much diminished by the Loss
of such Offerings, and Oblations, as had been accustomably made at the Shrines
of Certain Images, now either defaced, or removed; it was thought meet, to
make them some amends in another way. And thereupon it was Enacted, <hi>That
every Person exercising Merchandises, Bargaining, and Selling, Cloathing, Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-Craft,
and other Art, and Faculty, being such kind of Persons, and in such
Places, as heretofore, within the space of fourty years then before passed, have accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomably
used to pay such Personal Tithes, or of right ought to pay, (other then such as
the Common Day-Labourers shall yearly, at, or before the Feast of</hi> Easter,) <hi>shall
pay for his Personal Tithes, the tenth part of his clear Gains; his Charges, and
Expences, according to his Estate, and Condition, or Degree, to be there a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and deducted;</hi> with a <hi>Proviso</hi> for some Remedy to be had therein before the

and other Ordinaries, growing less and less; and little, or no execution,
following in that behalf, this last Clause proved of little Benefit to those, whom
it most concerned: who, living for the most part in Market-Towns, and having
no Predial Tithes to trust to, are thereby in a far worse Condition, then the Rural
Clergy.</p>
                     <p>There also passed another Act, for Abstinence from Flesh upon all such Days, as

That for the better subduing of the Body to the Soul, and the Flesh to the Spirit,

or Ordinance, very seasonable, as the case then stood, the better to beat down
the Neglect of all Days and Times of publick Fastings: which Doctour <hi>Glasier</hi>
had cryed up, and his Followers had pursued in contempt of Law. And here
I should have closed this year, but that I am to remove some Errours about the
Time of Doctour <hi>Farra'r</hi>s Consecration to the See of Saint <hi>David</hi>'s; put off by

But by neither rightly. For first, I finde on good Record, that <hi>Knight</hi> depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not this life till <hi>Michaelmass</hi>-Day, <hi>An.</hi> 1547. At what time, and for some
time after, Doctour <hi>Barlow,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Knight,</hi> was actually Bishop of St.
<hi>Davia</hi>'s; and therefore <hi>Farrars</hi> could not be Consecrated to that See some weeks
before. I finde again in a very good Authour, that Doctour <hi>Farrar</hi> was the
first Bishop made by Letters Patents, without Capitular Election: which could
not be till after the end of the last years <hi>Parliament;</hi> because till then the King
pretended not to any such Power of making Bishops. And Thirdly, if Bishop
<hi>Barlow</hi> had not been Translated to the See of <hi>Wells,</hi> till the year 1549. as Bishop
<hi>Godwin</hi> saith he was not; it must be <hi>Barlow,</hi> and not <hi>Farrars,</hi> who first enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the benefit of such Letters Patents: because <hi>Barlow</hi> must first be removed
to <hi>Wells,</hi> before the Church of St. <hi>Davia</hi>'s was made void for <hi>Farrars.</hi> So
that the Consecration of <hi>Farrars,</hi> to the See of St. <hi>David</hi>'s, being placed by
the <hi>Canons</hi> of that Church, (in an Information made against him) on the fifth
of <hi>September;</hi> it must be on the fifth day of <hi>September,</hi> in this present year:
and neither in the year 1547. as the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Monuments</hi> make it; nor in the

of the two great Ladies in the <hi>Roman</hi> Story. Concerning whom it is related by
<hi>Herodian:</hi> that, when the Emperour <hi>Commodus</hi> was unmarried, he permitted his
Sister <hi>Lucilla,</hi> whom he had bestowed on <hi>Pompeianus,</hi> a Right Noble Senatour,
to have a Throne erected for Her on the Publick Theatre; Fire to be borne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Wife. But, when <hi>Commodus</hi> had Married <hi>Crispina,</hi> a Lady of as great a
Spirit, though of lower Birth; <hi>Lucilla</hi> was to lose her place, and to grow less
in Reputation, then before she was. This so tormented her proud heart, when
she perceived that nothing could be gained by disputing the Point: that she ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
lest practicing one mischief on the neck of another, till she had endangered
the young Emperour's life; but utterly destroyed her self, and all those friends,
whom she had raised to advance her Interess. VVhich Tragedy (the Names

<hi>Dowager</hi> in the eye of the Court, did not conceive, that any Lady could be so
forgetfull of her former Dignity, as to contend about the place. But therein she
found her self deceived: for the <hi>Protectour</hi>'s Wife, a Woman of most infinite
Pride, and of a Nature so imperious, as to know no rule but her own Will;
would needs conceive her self to be the better Woman of the two. For, if the

Brother's Purposes; which afterwards improved it self to an estranging of Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and at last into an open Breach. But before Matters could proceed to
the last Extremity, the Queen died in Child-birth, (which happened <hi>September</hi>

by the name of <hi>Mary.</hi> A Lady of a mild and obliging Nature, honoured
by all the Court for her even Behaviour, and one, who in this Quarrel had been
meerly passive; rather maintaining what she had, then seeking to invade the

the Crimes, which I finde charged upon him in the <hi>Bill of Attainder,</hi> he could
not, but deserve as great a Punishment, as was laid upon him. For, in that <hi>Act,</hi> he
stands condemned, for <hi>Attempting to get into his Custody the Person of the King,

Men into his Service, for making great Provision for Money, and Victuals: for

such a Cloud: that he may seem rather to have fallen a Sacrifice to the Private
Malice of a Woman; then the Publick Justice of the State. For, the <hi>Bill of Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
passing at the End of the Parliament, which was on the fourteenth day of

that, when he signed that unhappy Warrant, he had with his Right
Hand robbed himself of his greatest Strength. For as long as the two Brothers
stood together, they were good support unto one another: but now, the one
being taken away, the other proved not Sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but fell into his Enemies hands within few Moneths after. Comparing them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
we may finde the <hi>Admiral</hi> to be Fierce in Courage, Courtly in Fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in Personage Stately, in Voice Magnificent; the <hi>Duke</hi> to be Mild, Affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
Free, and Open, more easie to be wrought upon, and no way Malicious:
the <hi>Admiral</hi> generally more esteemed amongst the Nobles; the <hi>Duke</hi> Honoured
by the Common People: the Lord <hi>Protectour,</hi> to be more desired for a Friend;
the Lord <hi>Admiral,</hi> to be more feared for an Enemy. Betwixt them both, they
might have made one excellent man; if, the Defects of each being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
the Virtues onely had remained.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Protectour,</hi> having thus thrown away the chief Prop of his House, hopes
to repair that Ruin, by erecting a Magnificent Palace. He had been bought out of
his purpose for building on the <hi>Deanery</hi> and <hi>Close</hi> of <hi>Westminster,</hi> and casts his
Eye upon a piece of Ground in the <hi>Strand;</hi> on which stood three Episcopal Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and one Parish-Church: the Parish-Church Dedicated to the <hi>Virgin Mary;</hi>
the Houses belonging to the Bishops of <hi>Worcester, Lichfield,</hi> and <hi>Landaff.</hi> All these
he takes into his Hands; the Owners not daring to oppose, and therefore wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
consenting to it. Having cleared the place, and projected the intended
Fabrick, the Workmen found, that more Materials would be wanting to go
thorough with it, then the Demolished Church and Houses could afford unto
them. He thereupon resolves for taking down the Parish-Church of Saint

which should be marked out for that purpose. But the Workmen had

such offensive Weapons;<note place="margin">An. Reg. 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1549.</note> which so terrified the Workmen, that they ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

                     <p>In the next place, he is informed of some superfluous, or rather Superstitious
Buildings on the North-side of Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s, that is to say, a goodly <hi>Cloyster,</hi>
environing a goodly piece of Ground, called <hi>Pardon-Church-Yard,</hi> with a <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi>
in the midst thereof, and beautified with a piece of most curious Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
called the <hi>Dance of Death,</hi> together with a fair <hi>Charnel-House,</hi> on the
South-side of the Church, and a Chapel thereunto belonging. This was conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be the safer undertaking, the Bishop then standing on his good Behaviour,
and the Dean and Chapter of that Church, (as of all the rest) being no better in a
manner by reason of the late Act of Parliament) then <hi>Tenant at Will</hi> of their
great Landlords. And upon this he sets his Workmen, on the tenth of <hi>April:</hi>
takes it all down, converts the Stone, Timber, Lead, and Iron, to the use of his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Palace, and leaves the Bones of the dead Bodies to be buried in the Fields in
unhallowed Ground. But, all this not sufficing to compleat the Work, the Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and most parts of the Church of Saint <hi>John</hi>'s of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> not far from <hi>Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi>
most beautifully built not long before by <hi>Dockwray,</hi> a late <hi>Priour</hi> thereof,
was blown up with <hi>Gunpowder;</hi> and all the Stone thereof imployed, to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
also. Such was the Ground, and such were the Materials of the <hi>Duke</hi>'s
New Palace, called <hi>Sommerset-House:</hi> which either he lived not to finish, or else
it must be very strange; that having pulled down two Churches, two Chapels,
and three Episcopal Houses, (each of which may be probably supposed, to have
had their <hi>Oratories</hi>) to finde Materials for this Fabrick, there should be no room
purposely erected for Religious Offices.</p>
                     <p>According unto this Beginning, all the year proceeds; in which there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be found; but Troubles, and Commotions, and Disquiets, both in
Church and State. For about this Time there started up a sort of men, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
gave themselves, or had given by others, the Name of <hi>Gospellers:</hi> of whom
Bishop <hi>Hooper</hi> tells us, in the <hi>Preface</hi> to his Exposition on the <hi>Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi>
That, <hi>They be better Learned then the Holy Ghost: for they wickedly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
the Cause of Punishment, and Adversity to God's Providence, which is the
Cause of no Ill, as he himself can do no ill; and of every Mischief that is done, they
say it is God's Will.</hi> And at the same time, the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> who had kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unto themselves in the late King's Time, began to look abroad, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse
their Dotages. For the preventing of which Mischief, before it grew unto
a Head, some of the Chiefs of them were convented, on the second of <hi>April,</hi> in
the Church of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> before the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Bishop
of <hi>Westminster,</hi> Doctour <hi>Cox, Almoner</hi> to the King, Doctour <hi>May,</hi> Dean of
that Church, Doctour <hi>Cole,</hi> Dean of the <hi>Arches,</hi> and one Doctour <hi>Smith,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards

of their Errours, some of them were dismissed onely with an Admonition, some
sentenced to a Recantation, and others condemned to bear their Faggots at Saint

many Parts of the Kingdom on another occasion. Some Lords and Gentlemen,
who were possessed of Abbey-Lands, had caused many inclosures to be made
of the waste Grounds in their several Mannours; which they conceived to be
(as indeed it was) a great advantage to themselves, and no less profitable to
the Kingdom. Onely some poor and indigent people were offended at it, in being
thereby abridged of some liberty, which before they had in raising to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
some inconsiderable profit from the Grounds enclosed. The Lord <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour</hi>
had then lost himself in the love of the Vulgar, by his severe, if not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
proceedings against his Brother; and somewhat must be done for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
to their good opinions, though to the prejudice of the Publick. Upon
this ground he caused a Proclamation to be Published in the beginning of <hi>May;</hi>
Commanding, that they who had inclosed any Lands, accustomed to be common,
should upon a certain pain, before a day signed, lay them open again. Which so
encouraged the rude Commons, in many Parts of the Realm, that without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
the time limitted by the Proclamation, they gathered together in a rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
and tumultuous manner; pulled up the Pales, flung down the Banks,
and filled the Ditches, laying all open as before. For which, some of them had
been set upon, and sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>in in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> by Sir <hi>William Herbert;</hi> others suppressed
by force of Armes, conducted by the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Wilton,</hi> as were those in
<hi>Oxfordshire;</hi> and some again reduced to more moderate, and sober courses, by
the perswasion of the Lords and Gentlemen; as in <hi>Kent,</hi> and <hi>Sussex.</hi> But the
most dangerous commotions, which held so long, as to Entitle them to the name
of Rebellions, were those of <hi>Devonshire,</hi> and <hi>Norfolk;</hi> places remote from one
another, but such as seemed to have communicated Counsels, for carrying on
of the design.</p>
                     <p>The first of these in Course of time, was that of <hi>Devonshire,</hi> began (as those
in other places) under pretence of throwing open the enclosures, but shortly
found to have been chiefly raised, in maintainance of their old Religion. On
<hi>Whitson</hi>-Munday, <hi>June</hi> the tenth, being next day after the first exercising of the
Publick <hi>Liturgi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>.</hi> Some few of the Parishioners of <hi>Samford Courtney,</hi> compelled
their Parish-Priest, who is supposed to have invited them to that compassion, to
let them have the <hi>Latine Mass,</hi> as in former times. These being seconded by
some others, and finding that many of the better sort were more like to engage
in this quarrel, then in the other; prevailed with those which before had Declared
onely against Inclosures, to pretend Religion for the cause of their coming toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And that being done, they were first Headed by <hi>Humphry Arundel</hi> Esquire,
Commander of St. <hi>Michaels Mount,</hi> and some other Gentlemen, which so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
the Reputation of the Cause, that in short time they had made up a Body
of ten thousand men. Of this Commotion, there was but little notice taken at
the first beginning, when it might easily have been crushed; the Lord <hi>Protectour</hi>
not being very forward to suppress those Risings, which seemed to have been
made by some incouragement from his Proclamations. In which Respect, and
that his good fortune now began to fail him, when the mischief did appear with
a face danger, and could not otherwise be redressed but by force of Arms; in
stead of putting himself into the Head of an Army, the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> is sent
down with some slender Forces, to give a stop to their Proceedings. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were, that he had any secret instructions to drill on the time, or that he
had more of the States-Man, then the Souldier in him; or that he had not
strength enough to encounter the Enemy, he kept himself aloofe, as if
he had been sent to look on, at a distance, without approaching near the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>

                        <hi>The Rebels in the mean time increasing as much in confidence, as they did in
numbers; sent their Demands unto the King. Amongst which, one more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
concerned the</hi> Liturgie, <hi>which therefore I have singled out of all the rest,
with the King's Answer thereunto, in the words that follow. It was demanded

by the Rebels;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">An. Reg. 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1549.</note> That, for as much as we constantly believe, that after the <hi>Priest</hi>
hath spoken the words of Consecration, being at <hi>Mass</hi> there Celebrating, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrating
the same; there is very really the Body and Blood of our Saviour <hi>Jesus
Christ,</hi> God and Man; and that no substance of Bread and Wine remaineth after,
but the very self-same Body, that was born of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and was given up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Cross</hi> for our Redemption: therefore we will have <hi>Mass Celebrated as it was
in Times past,</hi> without any man communicating with the <hi>Priests;</hi> for as much as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
presuming unworthily to receive the same, put no difference between the <hi>Lord's
Body,</hi> and other kind of meat; some saying, that it is Bread both before and after;
some saying, that it is profitable to no man, except he receive it, with many other abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Terms.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To which Demand of theirs the King thus Answered;</hi> viz. That for the
<hi>Mass,</hi> I assure you, no small study, nor travail hath been spent, by all the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Clergy</hi> therein, and, to avoid all contention, <hi>it is brought even to the very use as</hi>
Christ <hi>left it, as the</hi> Apostles <hi>used it, as the holy</hi> Fathers <hi>delivered it;</hi> indeed
somewhat altered from that, to which the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> for their Lucre, had
brought it. And, although <hi>(saith He)</hi> ye may hear the contrary from some Popish
evil men, yet. Our Majesty, which for Our Honour may not be blemished and
stained, assureth you, that they deceive, abuse you, and blow these Opinions into your
heads, to finish their own purposes.</p>
                     <p>But this Answer giving no content, they Marched with all their Forces to the
Siege of <hi>Exeter;</hi> carrying before them in their March (as the <hi>Jews</hi> did the <hi>Ark</hi> of
God, in the Times of old) the <hi>Pix,</hi> or <hi>Consecrated Host,</hi> borne under a Canopie,
with <hi>Crosses, Banners, Candlesticks, Holy-Bread,</hi> and <hi>Holy-Water,</hi> &amp;c. But the Walls
of <hi>Exeter</hi> fell not down before this <hi>False Ark;</hi> as <hi>Dagon</hi> did before the
<hi>True.</hi> For the Citizens were no less gallantly resolved to make good the Town;
then the Rebels were desperately bent to force it. To which Resolution of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,
the natural Defences of the City, (being round in Form, scituate on a rising
Hill, and environed with a good Old Wall,) gave not more Encouragement:
then some insolent speeches of the Rebels; boasting, that they would shortly
measure the Silks, and Sattens therein, by the length of their Bows. For fourty
days the Siege continued, and was then seasonably raised; the Rebels not being
able to take it sooner, for want of Ordnance: and the Citizens not able to
have held it longer, for want of Victuals; if they had not been Succoured, when
they were. One fortunate Skirmish the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> had with the daring Rebels
about the passing of a Bridg, at which he slew six hundred of them: which
gave the Citizens the more Courage to hold it out. But the coming of the
Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> with some Companies of <hi>Almain</hi>-Horse, seconded by three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<hi>Italian</hi>-Shot under the Command of <hi>Baptista Spinoli,</hi> put an end to the
Business. For, joyning with the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Forces, they gave such a strong
Charge upon the Enemy: that they first beat them out of their Works; and then
compelled them, with great Slaughter, to raise their Siege. Blessed with the like
Success in some following Fights, the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> entereth the City on the sixth
of <hi>August;</hi> where he was joyfully received by the half-starved Citizens: whose
Loyalty the King rewarded with an encrease of their Privileges; and giving to
their Corporation the Manour of <hi>Eviland.</hi> The sixth of <hi>August,</hi> since that Time,
is observed amongst them for an Annual Feast, in perpetual Gratitude to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, for their Deliverance from the Rebels; with far more Reason,
then many such Annual Feasts have been lately Instituted in some Towns, and
Cities, for not being gained unto their King. But, though the Sword of <hi>War</hi>
was Sheathed, there remained work enough for the Sword of <hi>Justice;</hi> in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
many of the Rebels, for a Terrour to others. <hi>Arundel,</hi> and the rest of the
Chiefs, were sent to <hi>London,</hi> there to receive the recompense of their Deserts;

The <hi>Norfolk</hi> Rebels brake not out, till the twentieth of <hi>June;</hi> beginning first

Number, till the sixth of <hi>July;</hi> when mightily encreased by <hi>Ket, a Tanner</hi> of

But, when their Numbers were so vastly multiplyed, as to amount to twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

of the <hi>Old Religion.</hi> Concerning which they thus Remonstrate to the

oppressed by a small Number of Gentry: who glutted themselves with Pleasure;
whilest the poor Commons, wasted with dayly Labour, did, like Pack-Horses, live in
extreme Slavery.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That</hi> Holy Rites, <hi>Established by Antiquity, were
abolished, New ones Authorised, and a New Form of Religion obtruded; to the
subjecting of their Souls to those Horrid Pains, which no Death could terminate.
And therefore,</hi> Thirdly, <hi>That it was necessary for them, to go, in person, to the
King, to place New Councellours about him, during his Minority; removing those,
who, ruling as they list, confounded things Sacred and Profane, and regarded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the enriching of themselves with the Publick Treasure, that they might Riot

                     <p>Finding no satisfactory Answer to these proud Demands, they March direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
towards <hi>Norwich;</hi> and possess themselves of <hi>Moushold-Hill:</hi> which gave
them not onely a large Prospect over; but a full Command upon that City:
which they entered, and re-entered as they pleased. For what could a Weak City
do in Opposition to so Great a Multitude: being neither strong by Art, nor
Nature; and therefore not in a capacity to make any Resistance. Under a large
Oak, on the top of this Hill, (since called <hi>The Oak of Reformation) Ket</hi> keeps
his Courts, of <hi>Chancery, King's Bench,</hi> &amp;c. forcing the neighbouring Gentry to
submit to his lawless Ordinances; and committing many huge Enormities, under
pretense of rectifying some Abuses. The King sends out his Gracious Pardon;
which the proud Rebels entertain with Contempt, and Scorn. Whereupon
it was resolved; that the <hi>Marquess</hi> of <hi>North-hampton</hi> should be sent against
them, accompanied with the Lords <hi>Sheffield,</hi> and <hi>Wentworth,</hi> and divers Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of Note, assisted by a Band of <hi>Italians</hi> (under the Command of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la-testa,</hi>
an Experienced Souldier.) The <hi>Marquess</hi> was an excellent Courtier;
but one more skilled in Leading a <hi>Measure,</hi> then a <hi>March:</hi> so that being beaten
out of <hi>Norwich,</hi> (into which he had peaceably been admitted) with loss of some
Persons of Principal Quality, and the firing of a great part of the City, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
ingloriously to <hi>London.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet all this while, the Lord <hi>Protectour</hi> was so far from putting himself upon
the Action, that he suffered his most dangerous Enemy, the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi>
to go against them, with such Forces, as had been purposely provided for the
War of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Who, finding the City open for him, entertained the Rebels
with divers Skirmishes; in most of which he had the better: which put them to
a Resolution of forsaking the <hi>Hill,</hi> and trying their Fortune in a Battail, in a
place called <hi>Dussing-dale,</hi> where they maintained a bloody Fight. But, at the
last, were broken by the <hi>Earl</hi>'s good Conduct, and the valiant Loyalty of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Two thousand of the Rebels are reported to have been slain in the Fight and
Chase, the residue of them scattered over all the Country, the Principals of them
taken, and deservedly Executed: <hi>Robert Ket</hi> hanged on <hi>Norwich</hi>-Castle; <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi>
his Brother, on the top of <hi>Windham</hi>-Steeple; nine of his chief Followers on
as many Boughs of the Oak, where <hi>Ket</hi> held his Courts. Which great Deliverance
was celebrated in that City by a Publick Thanks giving on the twenty seventh of
<hi>August:</hi> and hath been since perpetuated Annually on that day, to these present
Times. The like Rising happened about this time in <hi>York-shire,</hi> began by <hi>Dale,</hi>
                        <pb n="78" facs="tcp:66032:92"/>
and <hi>Ombler</hi> two seditious persons, and with them it ended, for being taken in a
Skirmish, before their number had amounted to three thousand men, they were
brought to <hi>York,</hi> where they were executed, with some others, on the twenty
first of <hi>September<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> then next following.</p>
                     <p>The breaking out of these Rebellions, but most especially that of <hi>Devonshire,</hi>
quickned the Lords of the Council to a sharper course, against all those whom
they suspected not to favour the King's Proceedings, nor to advance the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the Publick <hi>Liturgie,</hi> amongst whom, none was more distrusted then
<hi>Bonner</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> concerning whom it was informed, that by his negligence,
not onely many People within his Diocess, were very forgetfull of their Duty
to God, in frequenting the Divine Service, then by Law established, but divers
others utterly despising the same, did in secret places often frequent the Popish
Mass. For this he is Commanded to attend the Lords of the Council on the
eleventh of <hi>August,</hi> by whom he was informed of such Complaints as were
made against him, and so dismissed with certain private Injunctions to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by him for the time to come. And for a further Trial to be made of his Zeal
and Loyalty (if it were not rather for a Snare to entrap him in) he was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to Preach against the Rebels, at Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s Cross, on the first of
<hi>September,</hi> and there to shew the unlawfullness of taking Arms on Pretence of
Religion. But on the contrary, he not onely touched<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> not upon any thing
which was enjoyned him by the Council, but spent the most part of his Sermon
in maintenance of the Gross, Carnal, and Papistical presence of Christs Body
and Blood, in the most Blessed Sacrament of the Altar. Complaints whereof,
being made by <hi>William Latimer,</hi> Parson of <hi>St. Laurence Poult<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Hooper,</hi> sometimes a <hi>Cister'ian</hi> Monk; a Commission is issued out to the
Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>Rochester</hi> and <hi>Peterborough,</hi> Sir
<hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> and Doctour <hi>May,</hi> before whom he was convented at <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
on the tenth of the Moneth, where after many Shifts on his part, and
much patience on theirs, he is taken <hi>pro confesso,</hi> on the twenty third, and in
the beginning of <hi>October</hi> deprived of his Bishoprick. To whom succeded Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour
<hi>Nicholas Ridley,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> a Learned, Stout, and Resolute
Prelate, as by the Sequel will appear: not actually translated till the twel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>April,</hi> in the year next following, and added not long after to the Lords of the
Council.</p>
                     <p>The necessary Execution of so many Rebels, and this seasonable Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
against Bishop <hi>Bonner,</hi> did much facilitate the King's Proceedings
in the Reformation. As certainly the Opposition to A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>thority when it is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
both makes the Subject, and the Prince more absolute. Howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
to make sure Work of it, there passed an act of Parliament in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Session, (which also took beginning on the fourth of <hi>November</hi>) for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
down such Images, as were still remaining in the Churches; as also for the
bringing in of all <hi>Antiphonaries, Missalls, Breviaries, Offices, Horaries, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
and Processionals,</hi> with other Books of False and Superstitious Worship.
The Tenour of which Act was signified to the Subject by the King's Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
and seconded by the Missives of Arch-Bishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> to the Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
Bishops, requiring them to see it put in execution with all Care and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
Which so secured the Church on that side, that there was no further
Opposition against the Liturgie by the <hi>Romish</hi> Party, during the rest of this
King's Reign. For what can any workman do when he wants his Tools, or
how could they Advance the Service of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when the Books
by which they should officiate it, were thus taken from them.</p>
                     <p>But then there started up another Faction, as dangerous to the Church, as
opposite to the Publick <hi>Liturgie,</hi> and as destructive of the Rules of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
then by Law established, as were those of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Arch-Bishop
and the rest of the Prelates, which co-operated with him in the Work, having
so far proceeded in abolishing many Superstitions, which before were used, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved

in the next place to go forwards with a Reformation in a Point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
In Order whereunto <hi>Melancthon</hi>'s coming was expected the year before,
but he came not then. And therefore Letters were directed by the Arch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>Bishop
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> and <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> two Great and Eminent
Divines, but more addicted to the <hi>Zuinglian,</hi> then the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Doctrines, in
the point of the Sacrament. <hi>Martyr</hi> accordingly came over in the end of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi>
and, having spent some timewith the Arch-Bishop in his House at <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
was dispatched to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he was made the King's Professour for
Divinity, and about two years after made Canon of <hi>Christ-Church.</hi> In his
first Lectures he is said by <hi>Sanders</hi> (if he may be credited) to have declared
himself so much a <hi>Zuinglian</hi> in that point, as to give great offence to <hi>Cranmer,</hi>
and the rest of the Bishops; but afterwards, upon notice of it, to have been
more moderate, and to conform his Judgment to the Sense of those Learned Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates:
Which whether it be true or not, certain it is, that his Readings were so much
disliked by some of that University; that a publick Disputation was shortly had,
betwixt him, and some of those who disliked his Doings: in which he publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
maintained these two Propositions: 1. <hi>That the Substance of the Bread and
Wine was not changed;</hi> and 2. <hi>That the Body and Blood of Christ was not Carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and Bodily in the Bread and Wine; but united to the same Sacramentally.</hi> And
for the better Governing of the Disputation, it was appointed by the King,
that Doctour <hi>Cox,</hi> Chancellour of that University, assisted by one Mr.
<hi>Morrison,</hi> a right Learned man, should preside as Judges, or Moderatours, as
we call them; by whom it was decl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the upper hand, and had sufficiently answered all Arguments, which were
brought against him. But <hi>Chadsey</hi> the chief of the Opponents, and the rest
of those who disputed with him, acknowledged no such Satisfaction to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
unto them; their party noising it abroad (according to the Fate of such

                     <p>But <hi>Bucer</hi> not coming over at the same time also, he was more earnestly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
by <hi>Pet. Alexander,</hi> the Arch-Bishop's Secretary. whose Letters bear Date
<hi>March</hi> 24. which so prevailed with him at the last, that in <hi>June</hi> we finde him
here at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> from whence he writes to <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> who was then at
<hi>Oxford.</hi> And being here, he receives Letters from <hi>Calvin,</hi> by which he was
advised to take heed of his old fault (for a fault he thought it) which was to
run a<note n="*" place="margin">Mediis consiliis vel Authorem esse, vel approbato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem. <hi>Calv.</hi> Epist. ad <hi>Bucer.</hi>
                        </note> moderate course in his Reformations. The first thing that he did at his
coming hither (as he saith himself) was to make himself acquainted with the
<hi>English Liturgie;</hi> translated for him into <hi>Latine,</hi> by <hi>Alexander Alesius,</hi> a
Learned <hi>Scot,</hi> and generally well approved of by him, as to the main Frame, and
Body of it, though not well satisfied perhaps in some of the particular Branches.
Of this he gives account to <hi>Calvin,</hi> and desires some Letters from him to the Lord
<hi>Protectour</hi> (with whom <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

the greater favour, when he came before him, which was not till the Tumults
of the time were composed and quieted. Having received a courteous enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
from the Lord <hi>Protectour,</hi> and being right heartily welcomed by Arch-Bishop
<hi>Cranmer,</hi> he is sent to take the Chair at <hi>Cambridg.</hi> Where his first Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
gave no such distast to the Learned Academicks, as to put him to the
necessity of challenging the Dissentients to a Disputation: though in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Form, a Disputation was there held at his first<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>coming thither, concerning
the Sufficiency of Holy Scripture, the Fallibility of the Church, and the true
Nature of Justification. But long he had not held the place, when he left this life,
deceasing on the nineteenth of <hi>January,</hi> 1550. according to the computation of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to the great loss and grief of that University. By
the chiefest Heads whereof, and most of the Members of that Body, he was
attended to his Grave with all due Solemnity: of which more hereafter.</p>
                     <p>But so it was, that the Account which he had given to <hi>Calvin</hi> of the <hi>English
Liturgie,</hi> and his desiring of a Letter from him to the Lord <hi>Protectour,</hi>
                        <pb n="80" facs="tcp:66032:93"/>
proved the occasions of much trouble to the Church, and the Orders of it. For
<hi>Calvin,</hi> not forgetting the Repulse he found at the hands of <hi>Cranmer,</hi> when he
first offered his Assistance, had screwed himself into the Favour of the Lord
<hi>Protectour.</hi> And thinking nothing to be well done, which either was not done
by him, or by his Direction (as appears by his Letters to all Princes, which did
but cast an eye towards a Reformation) must needs be meddling in such Matters,
as belonged not to him. He therefore writes a very long Letter to the Lord
<hi>Protectour;</hi> in which, approving well enough of set Forms of Prayer, he descends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
more particularly to the <hi>English Liturgy,</hi> in canvasing whereof, he there except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
against <hi>Commemoration of the Dead</hi> (which he acknowledgeth however to be
very Antient,) as also against <hi>Chrism,</hi> and <hi>Extreme Vnction;</hi> the last of which
being rather allowed of, then required by the Rules of that Book: which said,
he maketh it his Advice, that all these Ceremonies should be abrogated, and
that withall he should go forwards to Reform the Church without fear or wit,
without regard of Peace at home, or Correspondency abroad: such Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
being onely to be had in <hi>Civil Matters:</hi> but not in <hi>Matters of the Church;</hi>

backwards, but meerly as we are directed by his Will revealed.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, he gives a touch on the Book of <hi>Homilies,</hi> which <hi>Bucer,</hi> (as
it appears by his Epistle to the Church of <hi>England</hi>) had right-well approved of.
These very faintly he permits for a season onely; but by no means allows of them
for a long continuance, or to be looked on as a Rule of the Church, or constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to serve for the instruction of the People: and thereby gave the hint to the
<hi>Zuinglian Gospellers,</hi> who ever since almost have declaimed against them.</p>
                     <p>And whereas some Disputes had grown by his setting on, or the Pragmatick
Humour of some Agents, which he had amongst us, about the Ceremonies of the
Church, then by Law established, he must needs trouble the <hi>Protectour</hi> in that
business also. (<note n="*" place="margin">Nisi maturè compositum esset Dissidium de Ceremoniis. <hi>p.</hi> 98.</note>) To whom he writes to this effect, That the <hi>Papists</hi> would grow
insolenter every day then other, unless the differences were composed about the
Ceremonies. But how? not by reducing the Opponents to Conformity, but by
encouraging them rather in their Opposition: which cannot but appear most
plainly to be all he aimed at, by soliciting the Duke of <hi>Sommerset,</hi> in behalf
of <hi>Hooper,</hi> who was then fallen into some troubles upon that; of which more
hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Now in the Heat of these Imployments, both in Church and State, the <hi>French</hi>
and <hi>Scots</hi> lay hold on the Opportunity, for the Recovering of some Forts, and
Peeces of Consequence, which had been taken from them by the <hi>English</hi> in the
former War. The last year <hi>Bulloign</hi>-Siege was attempted by some of the <hi>French,</hi>
in hope to take it by Surprize, and were couragiously repulsed by the <hi>English</hi>
Garison. But now they are resolved to go more openly to work, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
send an <hi>Herald</hi> to defy the King, according to the Noble manner of those
Times, in proclaiming War, before they entred into Action against one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The <hi>Herald</hi> did his Office on the eighth of <hi>August,</hi> and pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with all the Ordnance, Ammunition, and Victuals in them. Few of the
Souldiers escaped with Life: but onely the Governour of <hi>New-Haven,</hi> (a Bastard
Son of the Lord <hi>Sturton</hi>'s,) who was believed to have betrayed that Fort unto
them, because he did put himself immediatly into the Service of the <hi>French.</hi> But
they sped worse in their Designs by Sea, then they did by Land: for giving

in the Beginning of this Summer, but most unhappily diverted: though very

the Souldiers to the Sword; except the Captain: and him they spared, not out of
any Pity, or Humane Compassion, but because they would not lose the Hope
of so great a Benefit, as they expected for his Ransom. Nothing now left unto
the <hi>English,</hi> of all their late Purchases, and Acquists in <hi>Scotland:</hi> but the strong
Fort of <hi>Aymouth,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Rox-borough.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The loss of so many Peeces in <hi>France,</hi> one after another, was very sad News to
all the Court; but the Earl of <hi>Warwick.</hi> Who purposely had delayed the sending
of such Forces, as were prepared against the <hi>French,</hi> that the Forts above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
might be lost: that, upon the loss thereof, he might project the Ruin of
the Lord <hi>Protectour.</hi> He had long cast an envious Eye at his Power and Greatness,
and looked upon himself, as a man of other parts, both for Camp and Counsel;
fitter in all Respects to Protect the Kingdom, then he that did enjoy the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
He looked upon him also, as a man exposed to the Blows of Fortune, in
being so fatally deprived of his greatest strength, by the Death of his Brother:
after which he had little left unto him, but the worst half of himself; feared by
the <hi>Lords,</hi> and not so well beloved by the Common People, as he had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.
There goes a Story, that Earl <hi>Godwine,</hi> having treacherously slain Prince
<hi>Alfred,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Edward the Confessour,</hi> was afterwards present with the
King, when his Cup-bearer, stumbling with one foot, recovered himself by the
Help of the other. <hi>One Brother helps another,</hi> said Earl <hi>Godwine</hi> merrily: <hi>And
so,</hi> replyed the King as tartly, <hi>My Brother might have been useful unto me; if you
had pleased to spare his Life, for my present Comfort.</hi> The like might have been said
to Earl <hi>Dudly of Warwick:</hi> That, if he had not lent an helping hand to the Death
of the <hi>Admiral,</hi> he could not so easily have tripp'd up the Heels of the Lord <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour.</hi>
Having before so luckily taken in the Out-Works, he now resolves to plant
his Battery for the Fort it self. To which end he begins to muster up his Strengths,
and make ready his Forces, knowing which way to work upon the <hi>Lords</hi> of the
Court: many of which began to stagger in their good Affections, and some
openly to declare themselves the <hi>Protectour</hi>'s Enemies. And he so well applyed
himself to their several Humours, that in short time his Return from <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
with Success and Honour, he had drawn unto his side the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour

which some shewed themselves against him upon former Grudges, as the Earl of

had ingrossed unto himself; many, because they loved to follow the strongest
side; few in regard of any Benefit, which was like to Redound by it to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth;
the greatest part complaining<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they had not their equal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidend,
when the Lands of <hi>Chanteries, Free-Chapels, &amp;c.</hi> were given up for a
Prey to the greater Courtiers; but all of them disguising their private Ends, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretense of doing service to the Publick.</p>
                     <p>The Combination being thus made, and the <hi>Lords</hi> of the Defection convent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together, at <hi>Ely-House</hi> in <hi>Holborn,</hi> where the <hi>Earl</hi> then dwelt: they sent for
the Lord Mayour, and Aldermen, to come before them. To whom it is declared by
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:66032:94"/>
the Lord Chancellour <hi>Rich</hi> (a man of <hi>Sommerset</hi>'s own preferring) in a long Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in what dangers the Kingdom was involved by the mis-Government, and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
of the Lord <hi>Protectour:</hi> against whom he objected also many Misdemean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours:
some frivolous, some false, and many of them of such a Nature, as either
were to be condemned in themselves, or forgiven in him. For in that Speech he
charged him, amongst other things, with the loss of the King's Peeces in <hi>France,</hi>
and <hi>Scotland,</hi> the sowing of Dissension betwixt the Nobility and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
Embezelling the Treasures of the King, and inverting the Publick stock
of the Kingdom to his private use. It was Objected also; That he was wholly
acted by the Will of his Wife, and therefore no fit man to command a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
That he had interrupted the ordinary Course of Justice, by keeping a
Court of <hi>Requests</hi> in his own House, in which he many times determined of
mens Free-holds: That he had demolished many Consecrated Places, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal
Houses, to Erect a Palace for himself, spending one hundred pounds <hi>per
diem,</hi> in superflous Buildings: That by taking to himself the Title of <hi>Duke of Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset,</hi>
he declared plainly his aspiring to the Crown of this Realm: and finally,
having so unnaturally laboured the Death of his Brother, he was no longer to
be trusted with the Life of the King. And thereupon he desires, or conjures
them rather, to joyn themselves unto the <hi>Lords,</hi> who aimed at nothing in their
Counsels; but the Safety of the King, the Honour of the Kingdom, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the People in Peace and Happiness. But these Designs could not so
closely be contrived, as not to come unto the Knowledg of the Lord <hi>Protectour,</hi>
who then remained at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> with the rest of the <hi>Lords,</hi> who seemed
to continue firm unto him. And, on the same day, on which this meeting was at
<hi>London,</hi> (being the sixth day of <hi>October</hi>) he causeth <hi>Proclamation</hi> to be made
at the Court-Gates, and afterwards in other places near adjoyning; requiring
all sorts of persons to come in, for the defence of the King's Person: whom he
conveyed the same night unto <hi>Windsore-Castle,</hi> with a strength of five hundred
men, or thereabouts; too many for a Guard, and too few for an Army. From
thence he writes his Letters to the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> to the rest of the <hi>Lords,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to the Lord Mayour, and City of <hi>London,</hi> of whom he demanded a supply of a
thousand men for the present service of the King. But that Proud City, seldom true
to the Royal Interess, and secretly obsequious to every popular Pretender, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more inclinable to gratifie the <hi>Lords</hi> in the like Demands, then to comply with
his Desires. The News hereof being brought unto him, and finding that Master
Secretary <hi>Peter,</hi> whom he had sent with a secret Message to the <hi>Lords</hi> in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
returned not back unto the Court, be presently flung up the <hi>Cards:</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for want of Courage to play out the <hi>Game;</hi> or rather choosing willingly to
lose the <hi>Set,</hi> then venture the whole <hi>Stock</hi> of the Kingdom on it. So that, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the first coming of some of the opposite <hi>Lords</hi> to <hi>Windsore,</hi> he puts himself
into their hands: by whom, on the fourteenth day of the same Moneth, he is
brought to <hi>London,</hi> and committed Prisoner to the <hi>Tower;</hi> pitied the less, even
by those that loved him, because he had so tamely betrayed himself.</p>

and superstitious Worship, before-remembred,) to the concernments of Religion.
The first declared to this Effect; That <hi>Such form, and manner of making, and
Consecrating Arch-Bishops, and Bishopt, Priests, Deacons, and other Ministers of the

devised for that purpose, and set forth under the Great Seal, before the First of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril
<hi>next coming, shall be lawfully exercised, and used, and no other.</hi> The number
of the Bishops, and the Learned Men, which are appointed by this <hi>Act,</hi> assure
me, that the King made choice of the very same; whom he had formerly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:66032:94"/>
in composing the <hi>Liturgie;</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Chichester</hi> being left out, by
reason of his Refractoriness in not subscribing to the same. And they accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
applyed themselves unto the <hi>Work,</hi> following therein the <hi>Rules</hi> of the
Primitive Church, as they are rather recapitulated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then ordained, in the fourth
Councel of <hi>Carthage, Anno</hi> 401. Which, though but National in it self, was
generally both approved, and received (as to the Form of Consecrating Bishops,
and inferiour Ministers) in all the Churches of the <hi>West.</hi> Which Book, being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
was made use of, without further Authority, till the year 1552. At what
time, being added to the second <hi>Liturgie,</hi> it was approved of, and confirmed,
as a part thereof, by <hi>Act of Parliament, An. 5. Edw. 6. cap.</hi> 1. And of this Book it is,
we finde mention in the 36th. <hi>Article</hi> of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time. In which it is
Declared; That, <hi>Whosoever w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>thereof, should be reputed, and adjudged to be lawfully Consecrated, and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> in the eighth year of that Queen: in which the said <hi>Ordinal,</hi>
of the third of King EDVVARD <hi>the Sixth,</hi> is confirmed, and ratified.</p>
                     <p>The other of the said two <hi>Acts</hi> was, <hi>For enabling the King to nominate Eight
(Bishops, as many Temporal Lords, and sixteen Members of the Lower House of
Parliament: for reviewing all such Canons, and Constitutions, as remained in force,
by Virtue of the</hi> Statute <hi>made in the 25th. year of the late King</hi> HENRY; <hi>and fitting
them for the Vse of the Church, in all Times succeeding.</hi> According to which <hi>Act,</hi>
the King directed a <hi>Commission</hi> to Arch-Bishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and the rest of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
whom he thought fit to nominate to that imployment. And afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

that they brought his Cause to be Finable. Which Fine, though it was to him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
unsupportable, yet he did never purpose to contend with them, nor once to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
himself in any Action. <hi>He confess'd,</hi> That, being none of the wisest, he might
easily err: that it was hardly possible for any man, in Eminent place, so to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
himself; that all his Actings should be blameless in the eye of Justice. <hi>He
therefore</hi> submitted himself wholly to the King's Mercy; and to their Discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
for some Moderation: desiring them, to conceive of what he did amiss; as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
done through Rudeness, and want of Judgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then through any malicious
Meaning: and, that he was ready both to do, and suffer, what they should appoint.
And finally, he did again, most humbly, upon his Knees, intreat Pardon, and Favour;
and they should ever finde him so lowly to their Honours, and Obedient to their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
as he would thereby make Amends for his former Follies.</p>
                     <p>By which Submission (it may be called an <hi>Abjectedness</hi> rather) as he gave
much secret Pleasure to the most of his Adversaries: so he gained so far upon
the King; that he was released of his Imprisonment on the fourth day after. And
by his Majestie's Grace, and Favour, he was discharged of his Fine: his Goods,
and Lands, being again restored unto him; except such, as had been given away:
either the malice of his Enemies being somewhat appeased, or wanting power,
and credit, to make Resistance.</p>
                     <p>This great Oak being thus shrewdly shaken, there is no doubt, but there
will be some gathering up of the Sticks, which were broken from him, and

that, after such time, as the <hi>French</hi> had bid Defiance to the King; and that the

they besought Him; that he would, at the least, be pleased to take into His

untill King EDVVARD could make an End of the Troubles of His Subjects at

just threescore and eight years. In which time onely, it was found, on a just ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that it had cost the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> at the least, six Millions of
Pounds, in the meer Quarrels of that House.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>French,</hi> being more assured, that the <hi>English</hi> held some secret Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
with the <hi>Emperour,</hi> then certain what the Issue thereof might be, resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon a Peace with EDVVARD: in hope of getting more by Treaty, then
he could by Force. To this end one <hi>Guidolti,</hi> a <hi>Florentine,</hi> is sent for <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland:</hi>
by whom many Overtures were made to the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;
not as from the <hi>King,</hi> but from the <hi>Constable</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> And spying
with a nimble Eye, that all Affairs were governed by the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi>
he resolved to buy him to the <hi>French,</hi> at what price soever: and so well did he ply
the Business; that, at the last, it was agreed, that four Ambassadours should be sent
to <hi>France</hi> from the King of <hi>England;</hi> to treat with so many others of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
about a Peace between the Crowns: but that the Treaty it self should be
held in <hi>Guisnes,</hi> a Town belonging to the <hi>English,</hi> in the <hi>Marches</hi> of <hi>Calice.</hi> In

of the <hi>French.</hi> In which, it was desired, that the <hi>English</hi> Ambassadours would
repair to the Town of <hi>Bulloign,</hi> without putting the <hi>French</hi> to the Charge, and
Trouble, of so long a Journey, as to come to <hi>Guisnes.</hi> Which being demurred
on by the <hi>English,</hi> and a Post sent unto the Court, to know the pleasure of the
Council in that particular: they received word, (for so the <hi>Oracle</hi> had dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted)
that they should not stand upon Punctilioes, so they gained the point;
nor hazard the Substance of the Work, to preserve the Circumstances. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whereunto, the Ambassadours removed to <hi>Bulloign,</hi> and pitch'd their
Tents without the Town, as had been desired, for the Reception of the <hi>French:</hi>
that so they might enter on the Treaty, for which they came. But then a new

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>fficulty appeared: for the <hi>French</hi> would not cross the Water, and put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
under the Command of <hi>Bulloign;</hi> but desired rather, that the <hi>English</hi>
would come over to them, and fall upon the Treaty in an House, which they
were then preparing for their Entertainment. Which being also yielded to, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
some Disputes: the <hi>French</hi> grew confident, that, after so many Condescensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on the part of the <hi>English,</hi> they might obtain from them what they li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ted,
in the main of the Business. For, though it cannot otherwise be, but that in all
Treaties of this Nature, there must be some Condescendings made by the one,
or the other: yet he, that yields the first inch of Ground, gives the other
Party a strong Hope of obtaining the rest.</p>
                     <p>These Preparations being made, the <hi>Commissioners,</hi> on both sides, begin the
Treaty: where, after some Expostulations, touching the <hi>Justice,</hi> or <hi>Injustice</hi> of
the War, on either side, they came to particular Demands. The <hi>English</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the payment of all Debts, and Pensions, concluded on between the two
Kings deceased: and, that the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> should either be delivered to their
Hands, or sent back to Her Kingdom. But unto this the <hi>French</hi> replyed; That
the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> was designed in Marriage to the <hi>Daulphin</hi> of <hi>France:</hi> and,
that She looked upon it, as an high Dishonour, that their King should be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Pensioner, or Tributary to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>French,</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side, propounded: That, all Arrears of Debts, and Pensions, being thrown
aside, as not likely to be ever paid, they should either put the higher Price on
the Town of <hi>Bulloign;</hi> or else prepare themselves to keep it, as well as they
could. From which Proposals when the <hi>French</hi> could not be removed, the
<hi>Oracle</hi> was again consulted: by whose Direction, it was ordered in the Council
of <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> That the <hi>Commissioners</hi> should conclude the Peace, upon such <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi>
                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:66032:97"/>
and <hi>Instructions,</hi> as were sent unto them: Most of them ordinary, and
accustomed, at the winding up of all such Treaties. But that of most Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was; <hi>That, all Titles, and Claims on the one side, and Defences on the other,
remaining to either Party, as they were before, the Town of</hi> Bulloign, <hi>with all
the Ordnance found there at the taking of it, should be delivered to the</hi> French, <hi>for the
Sum of four hundred thousand Crowns of the Sun.</hi> Of which four hundred thousand
Crowns, (each Crown being valued at the Price of six Shillings, and six Pence,)
one Moity was to be paid, within three days after the Town should be delivered,
and the other at the end of six Moneths after; Hostages to be given in the mean
time for the payment of it. It was agreed also, in relation to the Realm of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
That, <hi>if the</hi> Scots <hi>razed</hi> Lowder, <hi>and</hi> Dowglass, <hi>the</hi> English <hi>should raze</hi>
Rox-borough, <hi>and</hi> Aymouth; <hi>and no Fortification in any of those places to be
afterwards made.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which Agreement being signed by the <hi>Commissioners</hi> of each side, and Hosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
mutually delivered for performance of Covenants, Peace was Proclaimed
between the Kings on the last of <hi>March:</hi> and the Town of <hi>Bulloign,</hi> with all
the Forts depending on it, delivered into the power of the <hi>French,</hi> on the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
fifth day of <hi>April,</hi> then next following. But they must thank the Earl of
<hi>Warwick,</hi> for letting them go away with that commodity at so cheap a Rate:
for which the two last Kings had bargained for no less, then two Millions of the
same Crowns, to be paid unto the King of <hi>England,</hi> at the end of eight years;
the Towns, and Territory, in the mean time to remain with the <hi>English.</hi> Nor
was young <hi>Edward</hi> backward in rewarding his Care, and Diligence, in expenditing
the Affair. Which was so represented to him, and the extraordinary Merit of
the Service so highly magnified; that he was made <hi>General Warden</hi> of the
<hi>North,</hi> gratified with a thousand Marks of good Rent in Land, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of an hundred Hors-men at the King's Charge. Such is the Fortune of
some Princes, to be most Bountifull to those, who are falsest to them. <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolti</hi>
also was rewarded with Knighthood, a Present of a thousand Crowns, and
an Annual Pension of as much, to maintain his Honour; besides a Pension
of two hundred and fifty Crowns <hi>per annum,</hi> which was given to his Son.

Great Care was also taken, for the preventing of such Disorders, as the dissolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

carry with them. And to this end the Lord <hi>Clinton,</hi> Governour of the Town,

all Parties making use of the Publick Peace for the advancing of their Private, and

the Burning of <hi>John Butcher,</hi> (by others called <hi>John Knell,</hi> but generally best

Great Care was taken, and much Time spent, by the Arch-Bishop to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade

                     <p>But being convicted, and delivered over to the Secular <hi>Judges,</hi> she was by
them condemned to be burnt; but no Execution done upon it, till this present
year. The Interval was spent in using all Means for her Conversion, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment;
which as it onely seemed to confirm her in her former Obstinacy: so it
was found to have given no small encouragement to others, for entertaining the
like dangerous, and un-Christian Errours. His Majesty was therefore moved to
sign the Warrant for her Death. To which when the Lords of the Council
could by no means win Him: the Arch-Bishop is desired to per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>wade Him to it.
The King continued both in Reason, and Resolution, as before He did, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the Arch-Bishop's Arguments to perswade the contrary: the King
affirming, that He would not drive her headlong to the Devil, and thinking it
better to cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tise her with some corporal Punishment. But, when the Gravity,
and Importunity of the Man had prevailed at last, the King told him, as He
signed the Warrant, that upon him He would lay all the Charge thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God. Which Words of His declare sufficiently His Aversness from having
any hand in shedding of that Womans Blood, how justly soever she deserved it.
But that the Arch-Bishop's Earnestness, in bringing her to exemplary Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
should contract any such guilt in the sight of God, as to subject him to
the like cruel Death, within few years after (as some would bear the World in
hand) is a Surmise, not to be warranted by any Principle of Piety, or Rule of
Charity. The Warrant being signed, and the Writ for Execution Sealed; she
was kept a whole Week before her Death, at the Lord Chancellour's House, dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
resorted to, both by the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi>
who spared no pains to bring her to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ight belief in that Particular.
But the same Spirit of Obstinacy still continued with her, and held
her to the very last. For, being brought to the Stake in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> on the
second of <hi>May,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

desired to Preach unto the People; who insisting on the proof of that Point,
for denyal whereof the obstinate Wretch had been condemned, she interrupted
him, and told him with a very loud Voice; that, <hi>He lied like</hi> &amp;c. And so, the <hi>Sermon</hi>
being ended, the Executioner was commanded to do his Office, which he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.

Differences were thus compromised; that is to say, That <hi>Hooper</hi> should receive his

be bound to use it, when soever he Preached before the King, in his own Cathedral,

<hi>Rites,</hi> and <hi>Vsages</hi> of the <hi>Anglican</hi> Church.</p>
                     <p>Which Differences, being thus begun, were both fomented, and increased,
by the Pragmaticalness of <hi>John à Lasco,</hi> Opposite, both in Government, and
Forms of Worship, (if not perhaps in Doctrine also) to the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
For <hi>John à Lasco</hi> not content to enjoy those Privileges, which were

to wear them; but writing unto <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> to declare against them For
which severely reprehended by that Moderate and Learned Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
and Objections very solidly Answered; which being sent to him, in the way
of Letter, was afterwards Printed, and dispersed, for keeping down that Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
Humour, which began then to overswell the Banks, and threatned to bear
all before it. And by this Passage we may rectifie a Mistake, or a Calumny ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in the <hi>Altare Damascenum.</hi> The <hi>Authour</hi> whereof makes <hi>Martin Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi>
Peremptory, in refusing to wear the <hi>Square Cap,</hi> when he lived in <hi>Cambridg;</hi>
and to give this simple Reason for it; <hi>That he could not wear a Square Cap, since
his Head was Round.</hi> But I note this onely by the way, to shew the Honesty of
those men, which erected that <hi>Altar:</hi> and return again to <hi>John à Lasco;</hi> who,
being born in <hi>Poland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> where Sitting at the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper had
been used by the <hi>Arians;</hi> (who looking no otherwise on <hi>Christ,</hi> then their
Elder Brother, might think it was <hi>no Robbery</hi> at all <hi>to be equal with Him,</hi> and
sit down with Him at His Table) what he learned there, he desired might be
Practiced here, the better to conform this Church to the <hi>Polish</hi> Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
                     <p>As for the other Controversie about <hi>Caps,</hi> and <hi>Surplices;</hi> though it found
no Encouragement from <hi>Martin Bucer;</hi> yet it received no small countenance
from <hi>Peter Martyr.</hi> For in a Letter of his, of the first of <hi>July,</hi> inscribed <hi>Vnto
a nameless Friend, who had desired his Judgement in it,</hi> he first declares,
according to the very Truth; <hi>That, being indifferent in themselves, they could
make no man, of themselves, to be either Godly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Vngodly, by the use, or forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of them:</hi> but then he addeth, That, (<note n="*" place="margin">Magis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </note>) <hi>He thinks it most Expedient to
the Good of the Church; that they, and all others of that kind, should be taken away,
when the next convenient Opportunity should present it self.</hi> And then he gives this
Reason for it: That, <hi>Where such Ceremonies were so stifly contended for, which were
not warranted, and supported, by the Word of God; there commonly men were less
sollicitous of the Substance of Religion, then they were of the Circumstances of it.</hi>
But he might well have spared his Judgement, which had so visibly appeared in
his dayly Practice. For he hath told us of himself, (in one of his <hi>Epistles,</hi>
bearing Date at <hi>Zurick,</hi> the fourth of <hi>November,</hi> 1559. being more then five
years, after he had left this Kingdom;) That, (<note n="*" place="margin">Ego, com es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sem <hi>Oxonii,</hi> vestibus illis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis, in Choro, nunanam nil volti;quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

when he <hi>lived in</hi> Oxford, <hi>though he were then a Canon of</hi> Christ-Church, <hi>and

on the one side, and the Pragmaticalness of <hi>John à Lasco</hi> on the other, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
were drawn from their Obedience to the <hi>Rules</hi> of the Church, for the time
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:66032:99"/>
then present, and a ground laid for more Confusions, and Disturbances in the
time to come.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Regular</hi> Clergy, in those days, appeared not, commonly, out of their
own Houses; but in their Priests Coats, with the Square Cap upon their Heads;
and, if they were of Note, and Eminency, in their Gowns, and Tippets. This
Habit also is decryed for Superstitious; affirmed to be a <hi>Popish Attire,</hi> and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
as unfit for Ministers of the <hi>Holy Gospel,</hi> as the <hi>Chimere,</hi> and <hi>Rochet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> were
for those; who claimed to be the Successours of the Lord's Apostles, So <hi>Tyms</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
unto Bishop <hi>Gardiner,</hi> when, being asked, <hi>Whether a Coat, with Stockings of
divers Colours, the upper part White, and the nether-stock Russet,</hi> (in which Habit
he appeared before him) <hi>were a fit Apparel for a Deacon:</hi> (which Office he
had exercised in this Church) he sawcily made Answer, <hi>That his Vesture did
not so much vary from a Deacon's, as his Lordships did from that of an Apostle.</hi>
The less to be admired in <hi>Tyms,</hi> in that I finde the like aversness from that Grave,
and Decent Habit, in some other men: who were in Parts and Place above him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For, while this Controversie was on Foot, between the Bishops and Clergy,
about wearing <hi>Priests-Caps,</hi> and other <hi>Attire,</hi> belonging to their Holy <hi>Order,</hi> Mr.
<hi>John Rogers,</hi> one of the Prebends of Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s, and <hi>Divinity-Reader</hi> of that
Church, then newly returned from beyond the Seas, could never be perswaded
to wear any other, then the <hi>Round Cap,</hi> when he went abroad. And, being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pressed unto it, he declared himself thus, <hi>That he would never agree to the
point of Conformity: but on this Condition, that, if the Bishops did require the</hi>
Cap, <hi>and</hi> Tipper, <hi>&amp;c. then it should also be decreed, that all</hi> Popish <hi>Priests (for a
Distinction between them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and others) should be constrained to wear upon their Sleeves
a Chalice, with an Host upon it.</hi> The like aversness is by some ascribed also to
Mr. <hi>John Philpot,</hi> Arch-Deacon of <hi>Winchester,</hi> not long before returned from
beyond the Seas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the other was, and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ffering for <hi>Religion</hi> in Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>'s
Days, as the other did. Who, being by his place a Member of the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
in the first of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and required by the <hi>Prol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

apparelled, like the rest, in his <hi>Gown</hi> and <hi>Tippet,</hi> or otherwise to forbear the House,
chose rather to accept of the last Condition, then to submit unto the former.
But there was some thing else in the first Condition, which made him unwilling
to accept it, and that was, That <hi>He must not speak, but when he was commanded
by the</hi> Prolocutour. Which being so directly against the Customes of the
House, and the Privileges of each Member of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he had good reason, rather to forbear his Presence; then to submit himself, and consequently all the rest of
the Members, to so great a Servitude.</p>
                     <p>Such were the Effects of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Interposings in behalf of <hi>Hooper;</hi> and such
the Effects of his Exceptions against some Antient Usages in the Publick <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie;</hi>
and such the Consequents of the Indulgence granted to <hi>John a Lasco,</hi>
and his Church of Strangers, opposite, both in Practice, and point of Judgment,
to the established Rules, and Orders of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For what did
follow hereupon, but a continual multiplying of Disorders in all Parts of this
Church? What from the Sitting at the Sacrament, used, and maintained by <hi>John
a Lasco:</hi> but first Irreverence in receiving, and afterwards a Contempt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to be f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> for Our feeding on Him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who was once onely Crucified, and
Offered for us. Secondly, That, in the <hi>Book of Common-Prayer,</hi> the name of
<hi>Alta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>ibing
any thing in the Form thereof. For as it is called a <hi>Table,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Board,</hi>
in reference to the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> which is there Administred, so it is called an
<hi>Altar</hi> also, in reference to the Sacrifice of <hi>Praise</hi> and <hi>Thanks-giving,</hi> which is
there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t to be
any way repugnant to the <hi>Rules</hi> of the <hi>Liturgie.</hi> The third Reason seems to be
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:66032:101"/>
no other then an Illustration of the First, for taking away the superstitious Opinion
out of the Minds of the People, touching the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Mass,</hi> which was not
to be Celebrated, but upon an <hi>Altar.</hi> The Fourth, That the <hi>Altars</hi> were Erected
for the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of the <hi>Law;</hi> which being now ceased, the Form of the <hi>Altar</hi>
was to cease together with them. The Fifth, That, as <hi>Christ</hi> did Institute the
<hi>Sacrament</hi> of his Body and Blood, at a <hi>Table,</hi> and not at an <hi>Altar,</hi> (as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by the three <hi>Evangelists</hi>) so it is not to be found, that any of the Apostles
did ever use an <hi>Altar</hi> in the Ministration. And finally, That, it is declared in
the <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>Book of Common-Prayer,</hi> That, If any Doubt arise in the
Use, and Practising, of the said Book, that then, to appease all such Diversity,
the Matter shall be referred unto the Bishop of the Diocess; who, by his Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
shall take Order for the quieting of it.</p>
                     <p>The Letter with these Reasons being brought to <hi>Ridley,</hi> there was no time
for him to dispute the Commands of the one, or to examine the Validity, and
Strength of the other. And thereupon, proceeding shortly after to his first <hi>Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>
he gave out one Injunction, amongst others, to this Effect, That <hi>Those
Churches in his Diocess, where the</hi> Altars <hi>do remain, should conform themselves
unto those other Churches, which had taken them down; and that, instead of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of their</hi> Altars, <hi>they should set up one decent Table in every Church.</hi> But this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
done, a question afterwards did arise, about the Form of the <hi>Lords Board;</hi> some
using it in the Form of a <hi>Table,</hi> and others in the Form of an <hi>Altar.</hi> Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
referred unto the Determination of the Bishop, he declared himself in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of that <hi>Posture,</hi> or <hi>Position</hi> of it; which he conceived most likely to procure
an <hi>Vniformity</hi> in all his Diocess, and to be more agreeable to the King's Godly
Proceedings, in abolishing divers vain, and superstitious Opinions, about the
<hi>Mass,</hi> out of the Hearts of the People. Upon which Declaration, or Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
he appointed the Form of a Right Table, to be used in his Diocess;
and caused the Wall standing on the back side of the <hi>Altar,</hi> in the Church of
Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s, to be broken down, for an Example to the rest. And being thus
a leading Case to all the rest of the Kingdom, it was followed, either with a
swifter, or a slower Pase; according as the Bishops in their several Diocesses,
or the Clergie in their several Parishes, stood affected to it. No Universal
Change of <hi>Altars</hi> into <hi>Tables,</hi> in all parts of the Realm, till the Repealing of
the <hi>First Liturgie,</hi> in which the <hi>Priest</hi> is appointed, <hi>To stand before the middest
of the</hi> Altar, <hi>in the Celebration;</hi> and the establishing of the <hi>Second,</hi> in which it
is required, That <hi>The Priest shall stand on the</hi> North-<hi>side of the</hi> Table, had put
an end to the Dispute.</p>
                     <p>Nor, indeed, can it be supposed, that all, which is before affirmed of Bishop
<hi>Ridley,</hi> could be done at once, or acted in so short a Space, as the rest of this
year: which could not give him time enough, to Warn, Commence, and carry
on a <hi>Visitation;</hi> admitting, that the Inconveniency of the Season might have been
dispensed with. And therefore I should rather think, that the <hi>Bishop,</hi> having
received His Majestie's <hi>Order</hi> in the end of <hi>November,</hi> might cause it to be put
in Execution in the Churches of <hi>London,</hi> and Issue out his <hi>Mandates</hi> to the rest
of the Bishops, and the Arch-Deacons of his own Diocess, for doing the like
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> other Places within the compass of their several and Respective Jurisdictions.
Which being done, as in the way of Preparation, his <hi>Visitation</hi> might proceed
in the <hi>Spring</hi> next following; and the whole Business be transacted, in Form,
and M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nner, as before laid down. And this may be beleived the rather; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the changing of <hi>Altars</hi> into <hi>Tables</hi> is made by <hi>Holinshead,</hi> (<note n="*" place="margin">Fol. 1062.</note>) (a Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and Painfull Writer) to be the Work of the next year: as, questionless it
needs must be, in all Parts of the Realm; except <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> and
some of the Towns, and Villages, adjoyning to them. But, much less can I think,
that the <hi>Altar-wall,</hi> in Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church, was taken down by the Command
of Bishop <hi>Ridley,</hi> in the Evening of Saint <hi>Barnaby</hi>'s-<hi>Day</hi> this present year;
as is affirmed by (<note n="*" place="margin">Fol. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Ridley</hi> was the Master of too great a Judgment, to run before Authority, in a
Business of such Weight, and Moment. And he had also a more high Esteem of
the <hi>Blessed Sacrament;</hi> then, by any such unadvised, and precipitate Action, to
render it less Venerable in the Eyes of the Common People. Besides, whereas
the taking down of the said <hi>Altar Wall</hi> is said to have been done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Saint <hi>Barnaby</hi>'s-<hi>Day</hi> to be kept for an <hi>Holy-Day,</hi> was to be put in Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

must have been kept in that year also; and consequently the taking down o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be placed in the year 1549, the Issuing of the <hi>Order</hi> from the <hi>Lords</hi> of
the Council in the year 1550, and the taking down of the <hi>Altar-Wall,</hi> on the

                     <p>WE must begin this year with the <hi>Deprivation</hi> of Bishop <hi>Gardiner,</hi> whom
we left committed to the <hi>Tower</hi> the last of <hi>June</hi> in the year 1548. There
he remained almost two years, without being pressed to any particular Point: the
yielding unto which might procure his Liberty: or the Refusal justifie such a long
Imprisonment. On the tenth of <hi>June,</hi> this year the Publick <hi>Liturgie,</hi> now being
generally executed in all Parts of the Kingdom, was offered to his Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
that some Experiment might be made, whether he would put his Hand unto
it, and promise to advance the Service. Upon the fourth day after, the Duke of
<hi>Sommerset,</hi> with five other of the <hi>Lords</hi> of the Council, was sent unto the
<hi>Tower</hi> to receive his Answer. Which he returned to this effect; <hi>That he had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately
considered of all the</hi> Offices <hi>contained in the</hi> Common-Prayer-Book, <hi>and all
the several Branches of it:</hi> That, <hi>Though he could not have made it, in that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
had the Matter been referred unto him; yet, that he found such things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
as did very well satisfie his Conscience: and therefore that he would, not onely
execute it in his own Person; but cause the same to be Officiated by all those of his
Diocess.</hi> But this was not the Answer which the <hi>Courtiers</hi> looked for. It was
their Hope, they should have found him more averse from the King's <hi>Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;</hi>
that, making a Report of his Perversness, he might be lifted out of that
Wealthy Bishoprick: which, if it either were kept Vacant, or filled with a
more Tractable Person, might give them opportunity to enrich themselves by
the Spoil thereof. Therefore to put him further to it, the Lord Treasurer, the
Earl of <hi>Warwick;</hi> Sir <hi>William Herbert,</hi> Master of the Horse; and Mr. Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Petre,</hi> are sent upon the ninth of <hi>July,</hi> with certain <hi>Articles:</hi> which, for
that end, were Signed by the King, and the <hi>Lords</hi> of the Council. According
to the Tenour hereof, he was not onely to testifie his Consent to the Establishing
of the <hi>Holy-Days,</hi> and <hi>Fasting-Days,</hi> by the King's Authority, the Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the Publick <hi>Liturgie,</hi> and the Abrogating of the <hi>Statute</hi> for the <hi>Six
Articles,</hi> &amp;c. but to Subscribe to the <hi>Confession</hi> of his Fault in his former Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy,
after such Form and Manner, as was there required. To which <hi>Articles</hi>
he Subscribed without any great Hesitancy: but refused to put his Hand to the
said <hi>Confession; There being no reason,</hi> (as he thought; and so he answered those,
which came unto him from the <hi>Court</hi> on the Morrow after) <hi>that he should yield
to the Conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                     </p>
                     <p>He is now faln into the Toil, out of which he finds but Little Hope of being
set free. For presently, on the neck of this, a Book of <hi>Articles is</hi> drawn
up, containing all the Alteration made by the King, and His Father, as well by
<hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> as their own <hi>Injunctions,</hi> from the first Suppression of the
<hi>Monasteries,</hi> to the coming out of the late <hi>Form for the Consecration of Arch-Bishops,
Bishops<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> &amp;c. Of all which Doings he is required to signifie his Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to make Confession of his Fault, with an Acknowledgment, that he had
deserved the Punishment, which was aid upon him. Which <hi>Articles</hi> (being
tendered to him by the Bishop of <hi>London, the Master of the Horse,</hi> Mr. Secretary
<hi>Petre,</hi> and <hi>Goodrick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> a <hi>Counsellour at Law</hi>) appeared to him, to be of such an
hard Digestion: that he desir'd first to be set at Liberty, before he should be
pressed to make a particular Answer. This being taken for a Refusal, and that
Refusal taken for a Contempt: the Profits of his Bishoprick are Sequestered
from him, for three Moneths, by an <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Council-Table,</hi> bearing
date the nineteenth of the Moneth, the said Profits, in the mean time, to be collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or received, by such Person, or Persons, as the King should thereunto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point:
with this Intimation in the Close; that if he did not tender his Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
at the end of that Term, he should be taken <hi>for an Incorrigible Person, and
unmeet Minister of this Church, and, Finally to be procceeded against to a Deprivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>

The Term expired, and no such humble <hi>Submission,</hi> or <hi>Acknowledgment,</hi>
made, as had been required at his Hands; a <hi>Commission</hi> is directed to the Arch-Bishop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>London, Ely,</hi> and <hi>Lincoln,</hi> Sir <hi>William
Peter,</hi> &amp;c. authorised thereby to proceed against him, upon certain <hi>Articles</hi> in
the same contained. Convented before whom at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> on the fifteenth of
<hi>December,</hi> he received his Charge. Which being received, he used so many
Shifts, and found so many Evasions to elude the Business; that, having appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
six Days before them, without coming to a plain and Positive Answer, he
was, upon the fourteenth of <hi>February,</hi> Sentenced to a <hi>Deprivation,</hi> and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Tower. But <hi>Gardiner</hi> did not mean to die so tamely, and therefore
had no sooner heard the <hi>Definitive Sentence;</hi> but presently he <hi>Protesteth</hi> against
the same, makes his Appeal unto the King; and causeth both his said <hi>Appeal,</hi>
and <hi>Protestation,</hi> to be Registred in the <hi>Acts</hi> of that Court. Of all which
he will finde a time to serve himself, in the Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>It was presumed, that the Report of this Severity against a Man, so eminent for
his Parts and Place, would either bring such other Bishops, as had yet stood
out, to a fit Conformity; or otherwise expose both them, and their Estates, to
the like Condemnation. But some there were, so stiff in their old Opinions:
that neither Terrour, nor Perswasion, could prevail upon them; either to give
their Approbation of the King's <hi>Proceedings;</hi> or otherwise to advance the
Service. And some there were; who, though they outwardly complyed with
the King's Commands, yet was it done so coldly, and with such Reluctancy, as

                        </gap>'d them open to the Spoil, though not to the Loss, of their Bishopricks. Of
which last Sort were; <hi>Kitching</hi> Bishop of <hi>Landaff, Salcot</hi> (otherwise called <hi>Capon</hi>)
Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and <hi>Sampson</hi> of <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Lichfield.</hi> Of which,
the last, to keep his ground, was willing to fling up a great part of his <hi>Lands;</hi>
and, out of those, which either belonged unto his <hi>See,</hi> or the <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter,</hi>
to raise a <hi>Baron</hi>'s Estate (and the Title of the <hi>Baronie</hi> too) for Sir <hi>William Paget,</hi>
not born to any such fair Fortunes, as he thus acquired. <hi>Salcot</hi> of <hi>Salisbury,</hi>
knowing himself obnoxious to some Court-Displeasures, redeems his Peace,
and keeps himself out of such Danger, by making long Leases of the best of
his <hi>Farms</hi> and <hi>Manours;</hi> known afterwards most commonly by the Name of
<hi>Capons-Feathers.</hi> But none of them more miserably Dilapidated the Patr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>mony
of his <hi>See,</hi> then Bishop <hi>Kitching</hi> of <hi>Landaff.</hi> A Church so liberally endowed
by the Munificence, and Piety, of some Great Persons in those Times; that if it
were possessed but of a tenth Part of what once it had, it might be reckoned (as
is affirmed by Bishop <hi>Godwine,</hi> one of <hi>Kitching</hi>'s Successours) amongst the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Churches in these Parts of <hi>Christendom.</hi> But whatsoever <hi>Kitching</hi> found it,
it was made poor enough, before he left it: so poor, that it is hardly able to
keep the Pot boiling for a <hi>Parson</hi>'s Dinner.</p>
                     <p>Of the first Rank, I reckon <hi>Voysie</hi> of <hi>Exeter, Heath</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and <hi>Day</hi>
of <hi>Chichester;</hi> for the Province of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> together with Bishop <hi>Tonstal</hi>

                        <hi>Durham,</hi> in the Province of <hi>York.</hi> The first, once Governour to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
<hi>Mary,</hi> Preferred afterwards, by King <hi>Henry,</hi> to the <hi>Lord-President</hi>-ship
of <hi>Wales,</hi> and the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Exeter.</hi> Which <hi>See</hi> he found possessed, at his
coming to it, of twenty two goodly <hi>Manours,</hi> and fourteen <hi>Mansion-Houses,</hi>
Richly furnished. But the Man neither could approve the <hi>Proceedings</hi> of the
King in the <hi>Reformation;</hi> nor cared, in that respect, to Preserve the <hi>Patrimony</hi>
of the Church, for those, who might differ in Opinion from him. And being
set upon the Pin, he made such Havock of his <hi>Lands,</hi> before he was brought
under a <hi>Deprivation:</hi> that he left, but seven or eight of the worst <hi>Manours,</hi>
and those let out into long <hi>Leases,</hi> and charged with <hi>Pensions;</hi> and not above
two <hi>Houses,</hi> both bare and naked. Having lost so much Footing within his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocess,</hi>
it is no marvail, if he could no longer keep his Standing. For, being
found an open Hinderer of the Work in hand, and secretly to have fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
the <hi>Rebellion</hi> of the <hi>Devonshire</hi>-Men, in the year 1549<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he either was
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:66032:103"/>
deprived of, or (as some say) resigned his Bishoprick, within few Moneths after
the <hi>Sentence</hi> passed on <hi>Gardiner:</hi> but lived to be restored again, (as <hi>Gardiner</hi>
also was) in the Time of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> Of <hi>Day,</hi> and <hi>Heath,</hi> I have nothing to
remember more particularly; but, that they were both Deprived on the tenth of
<hi>October,</hi> and lived both to a Restitution in Queen <hi>Marie</hi>'s Reign: <hi>Heath,</hi>
in the mean time, being Liberally, and Lovingly entertained by the Bishop of
<hi>London,</hi> and afterwards Preferred to the Arch-Bishoprick of <hi>York,</hi> and made
Lord <hi>Chancellour</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Nor shall I now say more of <hi>Tonstal;</hi> but, that,
being cast into the <hi>Tower</hi> on the twentieth day of <hi>December,</hi> he was there kept,
untill the Dissolution of his Bishoprick by <hi>Act of Parliament:</hi> of which we
shall speak more at large, in its proper place.</p>
                     <p>We must not leave these <hi>Churches</hi> vacant; considering, that it was not long,
before they were supplyed with new <hi>Incumbents.</hi> To <hi>Gardiner,</hi> in the <hi>See</hi> of
<hi>Winton</hi> succeeded Doctour <hi>John Poynet,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rochester:</hi> a better <hi>Scholar</hi>
then a <hi>Bishop;</hi> and purposely Preferred to that Wealthy Bishoprick, to serve
other Mens Turns. For, before he was well warm in his <hi>See,</hi> he dismem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
from it the Goodly <hi>Palace</hi> of <hi>Marwel,</hi> with the <hi>Manours</hi> and <hi>Parks,</hi> of
<hi>Marwel</hi> and <hi>Twiford,</hi> which had before been seised upon by the Lord <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour,</hi>
to make a Knight's Estate for Sir <hi>Henry Seimour,</hi> as before was signified.
The <hi>Palace</hi> of <hi>Waltham,</hi> with the <hi>Park</hi> and <hi>Manour</hi> belonging to it, and some
good <hi>Farms</hi> depending on it, were seised into the hands of the Lord Treasurer
<hi>Pawlet,</hi> Earl of <hi>Wiltshire:</hi> who, having got into possession so much <hi>Lands</hi> of
the Bishoprick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conceived himself in a fit Capacity to affect (as shortly after
he obtained) the Title of <hi>Lord Marquess of Winchester.</hi> But this, with many of the
rest of <hi>Poynet</hi>'s Grants, Leases, and Alienations, were again recovered to the
Church, by the Power of <hi>Gardiner;</hi> when, being restored unto his <hi>See,</hi> he was

<hi>Latimer,</hi> and <hi>Heath</hi> being st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ll alive, and both reputed Bishops of it, by their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Parties. And here we have a strange Conversion of Affairs: for whereas
heretofore, the County of <hi>Glocester</hi> was a part of the Diocess of <hi>Worcester,</hi> out
of which it was taken by King <hi>Henry,</hi> when first made a Bishoprick; the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of <hi>Worcester</hi> was now lay'd to the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Glocester</hi> Not, that I think, that <hi>Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
was suffered to enjoy the Temporal Patrimony of that Wealthy Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick:
but that he was to exercise the Jurisdiction, and Episcopality, with some
short Allowance for his Pains. The <hi>Pyrates</hi> of the Court were too intent on all
Advantages, to let such a Vessel pass untouched; in which they might both
finde enough to enrich themselves, and yet leave that, which was sufficient to
content the <hi>Merchant.</hi> An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> this perhaps may be one Reason, why <hi>Latimer</hi>
was not restored unto his Bishoprick, upon this Avoydance: not in regard of
any sensible Dislike, which was taken at him by the Court, for his down-right
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:66032:104"/>
Preaching, or that the Bishops feared from him the like Disturbances, which they
had met withall in <hi>Hooper.</hi> But, I conceive, the Principal Reason of it might
proceed from his own Unwillingness, to cumber his old Age with the Trouble
of Business, and to take that Burthen on his Shoulders; which he had, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
thrown off, with such great Alacrity And possible enough it is: that, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Abilities more proper for the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> then they were for the <hi>Consistory;</hi>
he might desire to exercise himself in that Imployment, in which he might appear
most serviceable, both to God, and his Church. For, both before, and after
this, we finde him frequent in the <hi>Pulpit</hi> before the King, and have been told
of his Diligent and Constant Preaching in other places. His <hi>Sermons,</hi> for the
most part (as the use then was) upon the <hi>Gospels of the Day:</hi> by which he had
the Opportunity of Opening, and Expounding a greater Portion of the Word
of God; then if he had confined his Meditations to a single <hi>Text.</hi> His Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
generally with Arch-Bishop <hi>Cranmer;</hi> where he found all necessary
Accommodation: and so extreamly honoured by all sorts of People, that he
never lost the Name of <hi>Lord;</hi> and was still looked on, as a Bishop, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Bishoptick.</p>
                     <p>But, notwithstanding the Remove of so many Bishops, there still remained
one Rub in the Way; which did as much retard the Progress of the <hi>Reformation,</hi>
as any of the rest, if not altogether. The Princess <hi>Mary,</hi> having been bred
up, from Her Infancy, in the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could not be won, by any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and perswasions, to change Her Minde, or permit that any Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should be made in those Publick <hi>Offices;</hi> to which She had so long been u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
The King had writ many <hi>Letters</hi> to Her, in hope to take Her off from
those Affections, which She carried to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The like done
also by the <hi>Lords</hi> of the Council, and with like Success. For, besides that She
conceived Her Judgment built on so good a Foundation, as could not easily be
subverted; there were some Politick <hi>Considerations:</hi> which possibly might
prevail more with Her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then all other <hi>Arguments.</hi> She was not to be told, That,
by the Religion of the <hi>Protestants,</hi> Her Mother's Marriage was Condemned;
That by the same She was declared to be Illigitimate; and Consequently, made
uncapable to succeed in the Crown, in Case She should survive Her Brother. All
which She must acknowledge, to be legally and justly determined. Upon
these Grounds, She holds Her self to Her first Resolution, keeps up the <hi>Mass,</hi>
with all the <hi>Rites,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> belonging to it, and suffers divers Persons,
besides her own Domestick Servants, to be present at it. The <hi>Emperour</hi> had so
far mediated in Her behalf, that Her <hi>Chaplains</hi> were permitted to Celebrate the
<hi>Mass</hi> in Her Presence: but with this Cautio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and Restriction; That, they
should Celebrate the same in Her Presence onely. For the transgressing of which
Bounds, <hi>Mallet,</hi> and <hi>Barkley,</hi> Her two <hi>Chaplains</hi> were Committed Prisoners
in <hi>December</hi> last: of which She makes Complaint to the <hi>Lords</hi> of the Council;
but finds as cold Return from Them, as they did from Her.</p>
                     <p>A Plot is thereupon contrived: for conveying Her out of the Realm by Stealth,
to transport Her from <hi>Essex,</hi> where She then lay, to the <hi>Court</hi> of the Queen <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi>
in <hi>Flanders;</hi> some of Her Servants sent before, <hi>Flemish</hi> Ships ready to receive
Her, and a Commotion to be raised in that County; that in the Heat, and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
of it She might make Her Escape. The King is secretly advertised of this
Design, and presently dispatcheth certain Forces under Sir <hi>John Gates,</hi> then
newly made <hi>Lievtenant</hi> of the Band of <hi>Pensioners,</hi> to prevent the Practice, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
His Coasts, orders His Ships to be in Readiness, and speeds away the
Lord Chancellour <hi>Rich,</hi> with Sir <hi>William Peter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> to bring the <hi>Princess</hi> to the
<hi>Court.</hi> Which being effected at the last, though not without extream Unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness
on Her part to begin the Journey; <hi>Inglesfield, Walgrave,</hi> and <hi>Rochester,</hi>
being all of Principall place about Her, on the thirtieth of <hi>October<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

to Custody; which adds a new Affliction to Her, but there was no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.
The <hi>Lords</hi> of the Council being commanded by the King to attend upon
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:66032:104"/>
Her, declared in the name of His Highness, how long He had permitted Her the
Mass; that, finding how unmoveable She was from Her former Courses, He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
not to endure it longer, unless He might perceive some hope of Her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, within short time after. To which the <hi>Princess</hi> Answered; That <hi>Her
Soul was Goa's; and for Her Faith, that as She could not change, so She would
not d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

to Constrain Her Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to restrain Her in the outward Profession of it: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of those many dangers, and inconveniences, which might ensue on the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
Which enterchange of words being passed, She is appointed, for the
present, to remain with the King: but neither <hi>Mall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Chaplains, permitted to have speech with Her, or access unto Her.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Emperour,</hi> being certified how all things passed, sends an Ambassadour
to the King, with a Threatning Message: even to the Denouncing of a W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in case his Cousin, the Princess <hi>Mary,</hi> were not permitted to enjoy the exercise
of Her own Religion. To Gratifie whom in His desires, the <hi>Lords</hi> of the Council
generally seemed to be very inclinable; they well considered of the Prejudice, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi>
where they had a whole year's cloth, beside other Goods. And they knew
well, what inconvenience must befall the King, who had there 500. Quintals of
Powder, and good store of Armour; which would be seised into the <hi>Emperour</hi>'s
hands, and imployed against Him, if any Breach should grow between them.
The King is therefore moved, with the joynt Consent of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he whole Board, to
grant the <hi>Emperour</hi>'s Request: and to dispence with the utmost Rigour of the
Law, in that particular; for fear of drawing upon Himself a greater mischief.
But they found Him so well Studied in the Grounds and Principles of His Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
that no Consideration, drawn from any Reason of State, could induce
Him to it. It was thereupon thought fit, to send the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> being both Members of that Body, to try what
they could do upon Him, in the way of Argument. By them, the Point being
brought unto such an Issue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as might give them some hopes of being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it was Propounded to Him, as their Opinion, (after some Progress made
in the Disputation,) that, Though it were a sin, to give Licence to sin; yet
a connivance of it might be allowed: in case it neither were too long, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some probable hope of a <hi>Reformation.</hi> With which Nicety the young
King was so unsatisfied, that he declared a Resolution, rather to venture Life,
and all things else, which were dear unto Him: then to give way to any thing;
which He knew to be against the Truth. Upon which words, the King expressed His
inward Trouble by a flood of Tears; and the Bishops, on the sight thereof, wept as
fast as He: the King conceiving Himself wronged, in being so <hi>unreasonably</hi>
pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>'d; and the Bishops thinking themselves neglected, because <hi>unseasonably</hi>
denied. Thus stood they si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ent for a time: each Party looking sadly on the
apprehension of those Extremities, which this Dispute had brought upon them:
as certainly, the Picture of Unkindness is never represented in more lively Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours;
then when it breaks out betwixt those, who are most tenderly affected
unto one another. The Bishops thereupon withdrew, admiring at such great
Abilities in so young a King; and magnified the Name of God, for giving
them a <hi>Prince</hi> of such Eminent Piety.</p>
                     <p>This being made known unto the Council, it was thought necessary to dismiss
the <hi>Emperour</hi>'s Embassadour with such an Answer; as should both give the <hi>English</hi>
time to fetch off their Goods, and let his Master have the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

desire it of him.</hi> This was enough to let the <hi>Emperour</hi> see, how little his Threats
were feared, which made him the less forward in sending more. Which Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
relating to the Princess <hi>Mary,</hi> I have lai'd together, for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
how all matters stood about this time, betwixt Her, and the King;
though possibly the sending of <hi>Wotton</hi> to the <hi>Emperour</hi> might be the Work of
the next year, when the King's Affairs were better setled, then they were at the
present.</p>
                     <p>For the King, finding the extraordinary Coldness of the <hi>Emperour,</hi> when his
assistance was required, for Defence of <hi>Bulloign,</hi> and the hot Pursuit of his
Demands of a <hi>Toleration,</hi> for the Family of the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> conceived it most
expedient, for His Affairs, to unite Himself more strongly, and entirely, in a
League with <hi>France.</hi> For entrance whereunto, an Hint was taken from some
Words, which fell from <hi>Guidolti</hi> at the Treaty of <hi>Bulloign:</hi> when he propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
That, in stead of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> whom the <hi>English Commissioners</hi>
demanded for a Wife to their King, a Daughter of the <hi>French</hi> King might be
joyned in Mariage with Him: affirming merrily. That, <hi>If it were a</hi> dry <hi>Peace, it
would hardly be durable.</hi> These Words, which then were taken onely for a Slight,
or Diversion, are now more seriously considered: as <hi>Many times the smallest
Overtures produce Conclusions of the greatest Consequence.</hi> A Solemn <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassie</hi>
is thereupon directed to the Court of <hi>France:</hi> the Marquess of <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton</hi>
nominated for the Chief <hi>Embassadour,</hi> associated with the Bishop of
<hi>Ely;</hi> Sir <hi>Philip Hobby,</hi> Gentleman-Usher of the <hi>Order;</hi> Sir <hi>William Pickering;</hi>
Sir <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> Principal Secretary of State, and Sir <hi>John Mason,</hi> Clerk of the
<hi>Council;</hi> as Commissioners with him. And, that they might appear in the Court of
<hi>France</hi> with the greater Splendour, they were accompanied with the Earls of
<hi>Arundel, Rutland,</hi> and <hi>Ormond;</hi> and the Lords, <hi>L'isle, Fitz-water, Abergaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
Bray<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and <hi>Evers,</hi> with Knights, and Gentlemen of Note, to the number of
six and twenty, or thereabouts. Their Train so limited<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for avoiding of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
amongst themselves, that no Earl should have above four Attendants,
no Baron above three; nor any Knight, or Gentleman, above two a piece; the
Commissioners not being limited to any number, as the others were. Setting
forwards in the Moneth of <hi>June,</hi> they were met by the Lord Constable <hi>Chastition,</hi>
and by him Conducted to the Court, lying at <hi>Chasteau Bryan:</hi> the nearer to
which as they approached, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> greater was the concourse of the <hi>French</hi> Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
to attend upon them. Being brought unto the King, then being in his
Bed-chamber, the <hi>Marquess</hi> first presented him, in the name of his King, with the
Order of Saint <hi>George,</hi> called <hi>The Garter:</hi> wherewith he was presently Invested by
Sir <hi>Philip Hobby;</hi> who, being an Officer of the Order, was made Commissioner
(as it seemed) for that purpose chiefly; rewarded for it by that King with a
Chain of Gold, valued at two hundred pounds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a Gown, richly trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with <hi>Ayglets,</hi> which he had then upon his back.</p>
                     <p>This Ceremony being thus performed; the Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> in a short Speech
Declared, How desirous his Master was, not onely to continue, but to encrease
Amity with the <hi>French</hi> King; that for this end He had sent the Order of <hi>The
Garter,</hi> to be both a Testimony, and Tye of Love between them; to which
purpose principally, those Societies of Honour were first devised: Declaring,
that they had Commission to make Overtures of some other matters, which was
like to make the Concord betwixt the Kings, and their Realms, not onely more
durable, but in all expectation perpetual; and thereupon desired the King to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:66032:105"/>
some persons, enabled with Authourity, to Treat with them. To which it
was Answered, by the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> in the name of that King; That his
Master was ready to apprehend and embrace all Offers, tending to encrease
of Amity; and the rather, for that long Hostility had made their new Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
both more weak in it self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and more obnoxious unto Jealousies, and Distrusts:
and therefore promised on the King's behalf, that Commissioners should be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to Treat with them about any matters, which they had in Charge. In
pursuance whereof, the said Cardinal, the Constable <hi>Chastilion,</hi> the Duke of
<hi>Guise,</hi> and others of like Eminent note, being appointed for the Treaty; the
<hi>English</hi> Commissioners first prosecute their Old Demand for the Queen of <hi>Scots.</hi>
To which it was Answered by the <hi>French,</hi> That they had parted with too much
Treasure, and spent too many Lives, upon any Conditions, to let Her go: and
that Conclusion had been made, long before, for her Marriage with the <hi>Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi>
of <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>English,</hi> upon this, proposed a Marriage between their King,
and the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Eldest Daughter of <hi>France</hi> (who after was Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to <hi>Philip the Second)</hi> to which the <hi>French</hi> Commissioners seemed very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable;
with this Proviso notwithstanding, That neither Party should be
bound, either in Conscience, or Honour, untill the Lady should accomplish
twelve years of Age.</p>
                     <p>And so far Matters went on smoothly: but, when they came to talk of Portion,
there appeared a vast difference between them. The <hi>English</hi> Commissioners ask
no more, then fifteen hundred thousand Crowns; but fell, by one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
after another, till they sunk to eight. The <hi>French</hi> on the other side began
as low, at one hundred thousand; but would be drawn no higher, then to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
two: that being (as they affirmed) the greatest Portion, which ever any of
the <hi>French</hi> Kings had given with a Daughter. But, at the last, it was accorded,
that the Lady should be sent into <hi>England</hi> at the <hi>French</hi> King's Charges, when
She was come within three Moneths of the Age of Marriage; sufficiently appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Jewels, Apparel, and convenient Furniture for Her House; That, at the
same time, Bonds should be delivered for Performance of Covenants, at <hi>Paris</hi> by
the <hi>French,</hi> and at <hi>London</hi> by the King of <hi>England;</hi> and That, in case the Lady
should not consent, after She should be of Age for Marriage, the Penalty should be
one hundred and fifty thousand Crowns. The perfecting of the Negotiation, and
the settling of the Ladie's Joynture referred to such Ambassadours, as the <hi>French</hi>
King should send to the Court of <hi>England.</hi> Appointed whereunto were the
Lord <hi>Marshal</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> the President <hi>Mortuillier,</hi> the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Secretary of that King, and the Bishop of <hi>Perigeux;</hi> who, being attended
by a Train of 400. men, were conducted from <hi>Graves-end</hi> by the Lord Admiral
<hi>Clinton,</hi> welcomed with Great Shot from all the Ships, which lay on the
<hi>Thames,</hi> and a Vollie of Ordnance from the Tower, and lodged in <hi>Suffolk-Place</hi>
in <hi>South-wark.</hi> From whence attended the next day to the King's House at
<hi>Richmond:</hi> His Majesty then remaining at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> by reason of the
<hi>Sweating Sickness</hi> (of which more anon) which at that time was at the Highest.</p>
                     <p>Having refreshed themselves that night, they were brought the next day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the King, to whom the <hi>Marshal</hi> presented, in the name of his Master, the
Collar, and Habit of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> being at that time the Principal Order of
that Realm: in testimony of that dear Affection, which he did bear unto him;
greater then which (as he desired him to believe) a Father could not
bear unto his Natural son. And then, Addressing himself in a short Speech unto
His Highness, he desired him, amongst other things, not to give entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Vulgar Rumours, which might breed Jealousies, and Distrusts, between
the Crowns; and, that if any difference did arise between the Subjects of both
Kingdoms, they might be ended by Commissioners, without engaging either
Nation in the Acts of Hostility. To which the King returned a very favourable
Answer, and so dismissed them for the present. Two, or three days being spent
in Feasting, the Commissioners on both sides settled themselves upon the matter
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:66032:106"/>
of the Treaty; confirming what had passed before, and adding thereunto the
Proportioning of the Ladie's Jointure. Which was accorded at the last, to the
yearly value of ten thousand Marks <hi>English;</hi> with this Condition interposed,
that, if the King died before the Marriage, all her Pretensions to that Jointure
should be buried with him. All Matters being thus brought unto an happy
Conclusion, the <hi>French</hi> prepared for their Departure: at which Time the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal</hi>

presented Mr. <hi>Pickering,</hi> to be his Majestie's Resident in the Court of
<hi>France.</hi> And so the <hi>French</hi> take leave of <hi>England,</hi> rewarded by the King in such
a Royal and Munificent Manner, as shewed, he very well understood what belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a Royal Suitour: those, which the <hi>French</hi> King had designed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>or the <hi>English</hi>
Ambassadours, (not actually bestowed, till all things had been fully settled, and
dispatched in <hi>England)</hi> hardly amounting to a fourth part of that Munificence,
which the King had shewed unto the <hi>French.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Grown confident of his own Security, by this new Alliance, the King not
onely made less Reckoning of the Emperour's Interposings in the Case of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
but proceeded more vigorously, then before, in the Reformation: the
Building up of which upon a surer, and more durable Bottom, was contrived
this year, though not established till the next. Nothing as yet had been conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
positively, and Dogmatically, in Points of Doctrine, but as they were to be
collected from the <hi>Homilies,</hi> and the Publick <hi>Liturgie;</hi> and those but few, in Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the many Controversies, which were to be maintained against
the <hi>Papists, Anabaptists,</hi> and other Sectaries of that Age. Many Disorders
had grown up in this little time; in the Officiating the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> the Vestures of
the Church, and the Habit of Church-Men, began by <hi>Calvin,</hi> prosecuted by
<hi>Hooper,</hi> and countenanced by the large Immunities, which had been given to
<hi>John a Lasco,</hi> and his Church of Strangers. And unto these, the change of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars
into Tables gave no small Encrease: as well by reason of some Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which grew amongst the Ministers themselves upon that Occasion; as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of of that Irreverence, which it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>bred in the People, to whom it made the
Sacrament to appear less Venerable, then before it did. The People had been so
long accustomed to receive that Sacrament upon their Knees; that no Rule, or
Canon, was thought necessary to keep them to it: which thereupon was not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently
omitted in the Publick <hi>Rubricks.</hi> The Change of <hi>Altars</hi> into <hi>Tables,</hi>
the Practise of the Church of Strangers, and <hi>John a Lasco</hi>'s Book in Maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of sitting at the Holy Table, made ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y think that Posture best, which
was so much countenanced. And, what was like to follow upon such a Liberty,
the Proneness of those Times to <hi>Heterodoxies,</hi> and Prophaness, gave just cause to
fear. Somewhat was therefore to be done to prevent the Mischief: and nothing
could prevent it better, then to reduce the People to their Antient Custome
by some Rule, or <hi>Rubrick,</hi> by which they should be bound to receive it <hi>kneeling.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So for the Ministers themselves, they seemed to be as much at a Loss in their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating
at the Table, as the People were in their Irreverences to the Blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Which cannot better be expressed, then in the words of some <hi>Popish</hi> Prelats,
by whom it was objected unto some of our chief Reformers. Thus <hi>White</hi> of
<hi>Lincoln</hi> chargeth it upon Bishop <hi>Ridley</hi> (to omit his prophane calling of the
Lord's Table, in what Posture soever scituated, by the Name of an <hi>Oyster-Board</hi>)
<note n="*" place="margin">Acts and Mon.</note> 
                        <hi>That, when their Table was Constituted, they could never be content i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>placing the
same; now East, now North, now one way, now another: untill it pleased God,
of his Goodness, to place it quite out of the Church.</hi> The like did <hi>Weston</hi> (the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutour</hi>
of the Convocation, in the first of Queen <hi>Mary)</hi> in a Disputation held
with <hi>Latimer;</hi> telling him with Reproach, and Contempt enough, that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,

                        </gap>ed their Table, <hi>were like a Company of Apes, that knew not
which way to turn their Tails<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> looking one day East, and another West; one this
way, and another that way, as their Fancies lead them.</hi> Thus finally, one <hi>Miles
Hubbard,</hi> in a Book, called <hi>The Display of Protestants</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Printed 1556. <hi>pag.</hi> 81.</note> doth report the Business,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:66032:106"/>
                        <hi>How long</hi> (say they) <hi>were they learning to set their Tables to minister the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
upon? First they placed it aloft, where the High Altar stood, then must it be
removed from the Wall, that one might go between: the Ministers being in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
on whether part to turn their faces, either toward the West, the North, or
South; some would stand Westward, some Northward, some Southward.</hi> It was
not to be thought, but that the <hi>Papists</hi> would much please themselves in these
Disorders; and that this Difference, and Diversity, though in Circumstance
onely, might draw contempt upon the Sacrament it self, and give great Scandal
unto many Moderate, and well meaning Men. A <hi>Rubrick</hi> therefore is resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on, by which the Minister, which officiates, should be pointed to a certain
Place; and, by the <hi>Rubrick</hi> then devised, the North-side was thought fitter, then
any other.</p>
                     <p>But the main Matters, which were now brought under Consideration, were
the reviewing of the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> and the Composing of a Book of <hi>Articles:</hi> this
last <hi>for the avoiding diversities of Opinions, and for the stablishing of Consent touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
true Religion;</hi> the other for removing of such Offences, as had been taken
by <hi>Calvin,</hi> and his Followers, at some parts thereof. For <hi>Calvin,</hi> having broke
the Ice, resolved to make his way through it to the Mark he aimed at, which
was to have this Church depend upon his Direction, and not to be less estimable
here, then in other places. To which end, as he formerly had applyed himself
to the Lord <hi>Protectour,</hi> as appears by his Letter of the year <hi>An.</hi> 1549. So now
he sets upon the King, the Council, and the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in hope
to bring them to his Bent. In his Letters to the King, and Council, (as himself
signified to <hi>Bullinger,</hi> on the 29th. of <hi>August)</hi> he exciteth them to proceed to a
Reformation; that is to say, to such a Reformation<note n="*" place="margin">Vt eos inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taremus ad per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendum. <hi>&amp;c. pag.</hi> 98.</note> as he had projected,
and without which his Followers would not be contented. In his Letters to the
King alone, he lets him know<note n="*" place="margin">In statu Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gni multa adhuc desiderantur. <hi>pag.</hi> 384.</note> that many things were still amiss in the State of
the Kingdom, which stood in need of Reformation. And finally in those to
<hi>Cranmer,</hi> he certifies him, that in the Service of this Church, as then it stood,
there remained a whole Mass of <hi>Popery,</hi> which did not onely<note n="*" place="margin">Quae non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuret modo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        </gap>p. But fearing he might not edifie with so wise a
Prince, assisted by such a Prudent Council, and such Learned Prelats, he hath
his Agents in the Court, the Country, and the Universities, by whom he
drives on his Design, in all parts at once. And so far he prevailed in the first
two years, that in the Convocation, which began in the former year, <hi>An.</hi> 1550,
the first Debate amongst the Prelats was of such Doubts, as had arisen about
some things contained in the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book</hi> and more particularly touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such Feasts, as were retained, and such, as had been abrogated by the Rules
thereof; the Form of Words used at the giving of the Bread, and the different
Manner of Administring the Holy Sacrament. Which being signified unto the
<hi>Prolocutour,</hi> and the rest of the Clergy, who had received somewhat in Charge
about it the day before; Answer was made, that they had not yet sufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
of the Points proposed, but that they would give their Lordships some
account thereof in the following Session. But what account was given, appears
not in the Acts of that Convocation; of which there is nothing left upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
but this very Passage.</p>
                     <p>For the avoiding of these Doubts, the satisfying of the Importunities of some,
and rectifying the Disorders of Others, rather then in regard of any Impiety,
or Impertinency in the Book it self, it was brought under a <hi>Review;</hi> and being
so reviewed was ratified, and confirmed by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> in the following
year. By the Tenour of which Act it may appear, First, That there was nothing
contained in the said First Book, but <hi>what was agreeable to the Word of God, and the
Primitive Church, very comfortable to all good People, desiring to live in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Conversation, and most profitable to the Estate of this Realm.</hi> Secondly, That
<hi>such Doubts, as had been raised in the use and exercise thereof, proceeded rather
from the Curiosity of the Minister, and Mistakers, then of any other Worthy
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:66032:107"/>
Cause.</hi> And therefore Thirdly, <hi>That<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

should be faithfully perused, explained, and made fully perfect in all such pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
in which it was necessary to be made more earnest, and fit for the stirring
up of all Christian people, to the true honouring of Almighty God.</hi> So far we are
directed by the Light of this <hi>Act of Parliament, 5. 6. Edw. 6. cap.</hi> 1. But, if we
would desire to know the Names of those good and Godly Men, by whom it was
so explained, and altered, in that it leaves us in the dark: none of them being
named, nor any way la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

can be done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is to go by Conjecture, and to ascribe it to those Men; who had
first composed it, and who were afterwards Authorised, for drawing up <hi>the
Form of Consecration,</hi> &amp;c. annexed to this new Book, as a part thereof, and so
adjudged to be by two <hi>Acts of Parliament.</hi>

true Religion,</hi> it was thought necessary to compose a Book of <hi>Articles:</hi> in
which should be contained the <hi>Common Principles</hi> of the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> in which
all Parties did agree; together with the most material Points, in which they
differed. For the better performing of which Work, <hi>Melancthon</hi>'s Company, and
Assistance, had been long desired. That he held Correspondence once with the
King, and Arch-Bishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> appears by his Epistles of the year 1549, 1550,
and 1551. but that he came not over, as had been expected, must be imputed,
either to our home-bred <hi>Troubles,</hi> or the great <hi>Sickness</hi> of this year, or the
deplorable <hi>Death</hi> of the Duke of <hi>Sommerset,</hi> on whose Integrity, and Candour,
he did most rely. Yet the best was, that, though <hi>Erasmus</hi> was dead, and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi>
absent, yet were they to be found both alive, and present in their learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Writing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of those <hi>Articles</hi> were much directed; not, that they looked upon them
as the <hi>Rule,</hi> or <hi>Canon,</hi> but onely as subservient helps to promote the <hi>Service.</hi> But,
who they were, that laboured in this weighty Work, and made it ready for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
and Conference, in the next <hi>Convocation;</hi> as I have no where found, so I
cannot conjecture: unless perhaps, we may attribute the Honour of it to those
Bishops, and the other Learned Men; before remembred, whose Hands and Heads
had before been exercised in the publick <hi>Formulas.</hi> That <hi>Cranmer</hi> had a great
hand in them, is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the honour of which Works was severally arrogated by them; because per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by their Encouragement, and at their Appointment. But whosoever
laboured in the Preparation of these <hi>Articles,</hi> certain it is, that they were onely

                     <p>In Reference to the Polity, and good Order of the Common-Wealth, there were
two things done of great Importance: the one redounding to the <hi>Present,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the <hi>Future Benefit</hi> of the <hi>English</hi> Nation. Of which last sort, was the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Corporation of <hi>Merchant-Strangers,</hi> the <hi>Merchants</hi> of the <hi>Steel-Yard,</hi>
as they commonly called them. Concerning which we are to know, that the
<hi>English,</hi> in the Times foregoing, being neither strong in Shipping, nor much
accustomed to the Seas, received all such Commodities, as were not of the growth
of their own Country, from the hands of Strangers, resorting hither, from all
Parts, to upbraid our Laziness. Amongst which, the Merchants of the <hi>East</hi>-Land

Wheat, Rye, and other Grain, as also Cables, Ropes, Masts, Pitch, Tar,

                        </gap>coats, Wax, Steel, and other profitable
Merchandises, for the use of this Kingdom. For their Encouragement wherein
they were amply Privileged, exempt from many Impositions, which <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-Strangers</hi>
use to pay in all other Countries, erected into a <hi>Corporation</hi> by
King <hi>Henry the Third,</hi> commonly called <hi>Guilda Aula Theutonicorum;</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
first to carry out <hi>Wools</hi> unwrought, and afterwards a certain number of
Cloaths, when the <hi>English</hi> were grown skilfull in that Manufacture. Their
Court kept in a fair large House built near the <hi>Thames,</hi> which from an open place,
wherein <hi>Steel</hi> had formerly been sold, took the Name of the <hi>Steel-Yard.</hi> Grown
Rich, and driving a great Trade, they drew upon themselves the Envy (as all
other <hi>Merchant-Strangers</hi> did) of the <hi>Londoners</hi> chiefly, but generally of all
the Port Towns of <hi>England,</hi> who began now to think the Seas as open to them,
as to any others. It was considered also, by the <hi>Lords</hi> of the Council, that by
suffering all Commodities of a Foreign growth, and a great part of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
of the growth of <hi>England,</hi> to be imported, and exported in <hi>Out-lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish</hi>
Bottoms, the <hi>English</hi> Merchants were discouraged from Navigation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Shipping of the Realm was kept low, and despicable. It was therefore
thought expedient, in Reason of State, to make void their Privileges, and put
the Trade into the hands of the <hi>English</hi> Merchant. For the doing whereof, the
<hi>Easterlings,</hi> or <hi>Merchants</hi> of the <hi>Steel-Yard,</hi> had given cause enough. For,
whereas they had antiently been permitted to ship away but eighty Cloaths, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
one hundred, and at last one thousand; it was found, that, at this
time, they had transported, in their own Bottoms, 44000 <hi>English</hi> Cloat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

being but 1100 ship'd away, by all Strangers else. It was also found, that, besides
the Native Commodities of their own growth, they had brought in much Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
goods, of other Count<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

imperfect, their Numbers, Names, and Nations not sufficiently known. This gave
the Council ground enough for seising all their Liberties into the hands of the
King, and never after to restore them; notwithstanding the great Embassies
and Solicitations of the Cities of <hi>Hamborough,</hi> and <hi>Lubeck,</hi> and many other of
the <hi>Hans</hi>-Towns in <hi>Germany,</hi> who had seen their Factories, and Factours. And
hereunto the seasonable coming of <hi>Sebastian Cabot</hi> (of which more anon)
gave no small Advantage: by whose Encouragement, and Example, the <hi>English</hi>
Nation began to fall in Love with the Seas, to try their Fortunes in the Discovery
of unknown Regions, and consequently to encrease their Shipping; till by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
they came to drive a wealthy Trade in most parts of the World, and to be
more considerable for their Naval Power, then all their Neighbours.</p>
                     <p>But because all things could not be so well settled at the first, as not to need

                     <p>

which proved more to the Advantage of the King, then the present profit of
the Subject. For, hereupon, on the ninth of <hi>July,</hi> the base Money, Coyned

future benefit, which was to be expected from it; there being then some Coyns

in good hope, that he should drive as rich a Trade under this young King,
as in the happiest dayes of his Predecessours, before the Mony was deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
                     <p>And now we come to the great Troubles in the Court, began in the Destruction
of the Duke of <hi>Sommerset:</hi> but ending in the untimely death of this Hopeful King;
so signified (as it was thought, upon the Post-Fact) by two strange Presages within
the compass of this year, and one, which followed in the next. The first, of this
year, was a great and terrible <hi>Earthquake,</hi> which happened on the twenty fifth
of <hi>May,</hi> at <hi>Croydon,</hi> and some other Villages thereabouts, in the County of
<hi>Surrey.</hi> This was conceived to have Prognosticated those <hi>Concussions,</hi> which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
happened <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n the Court, to the fall of the Great Duke of <hi>Sommerset,</hi>
and divers Gentlemen of Note, and Quality, who perished in the same ruin
with him.
The last was of six <hi>Dolphins,</hi> taken up in the <hi>Thames,</hi> three of
them at <hi>Queen Borough,</hi> and three near <hi>Grenwich;</hi> the least as big as any Horse.
The Rarity whereof occasioned some Grave men to dispence with their Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and some Great Persons also to put off their State, that they might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
a Spectacle, so unusual to them. Their coming up so far, beheld by
Mariners, as a Presage of foul weather at Sea; but afterwards by States-Men, of
those Storms, and Tempests, which afterwards befell this Nation, in the Death
of King <hi>Edward,</hi> and the Tempestuous Times of Queen <hi>Marie</hi>'s Reign.</p>
                     <p>But the most sad Presage of all was the Breaking out of a Disease, called
the <hi>Sweating Sickness;</hi> appearing first at <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> on the fifteenth of <hi>April,</hi>
and after spreading by degrees over all the Kingdom; ending its Progress in the
<hi>North,</hi> about the beginning of <hi>October.</hi> Described by a very Learned Man, to be a
new, strange, and violent Disease: wherewith if any man were attached, he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or escaped within nine hours, of ten at most; if he slept, (as most men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to do) he dyed within six hours, if he took cold, he dyed in three. It
was observed to Rage chiefly amongst men of strongest Constitution, and years:
few aged Men, or Women, or young Children, being either subject to it, or dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it. Of which last sort, those of most Eminent Rank, were two of the
Sons of <hi>Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ls Brandon:</hi> both dying at <hi>Cambridg,</hi> both Dukes of <hi>Suffolk</hi> (as
their Father had been before;) but the youngest following his dead Brother so
close at the Heels, that he onely out-lived him long enough to enjoy that Title.
And, that, which was yet most strange of all, no Foreigner, which was then in
<hi>England</hi> (four hundred <hi>French</hi> attending here, in the Hottest of it, on that
King's Ambassadours) did perish by it. The <hi>English</hi> being singled out, taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and dying of it in all other Countries, without any danger to the Natives;
called therefore, in most <hi>Latine</hi> Writers, by the name of <hi>Sudor Anglicus,</hi> or
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:66032:108"/>
                        <hi>The English Sweat.</hi> First known amongst us, in the beginning of the Reign of
King <hi>Henry the Seventh;</hi> and then beheld, as a Presage of that troublesom, and
Laborious Reign, which after followed: the King being for the most part in
continual Action; and the Subjects, either sweating out their Blood, or Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
Not then so violent, and extreme, as it was at the present; such infinite
Multitudes being at this time swept away by it, that there died eight hundred in
one week in <hi>London</hi> onely.</p>
                     <p>These being looked on as Presages, we will next take a view of those sad Events,
which were supposed to be prognosticated by them; beginning first with the
<hi>Concussions</hi> of the Court by open Factions, and ending in a <hi>Sweating Sickness;</hi>
which drew out some of the best Blood, and most Vital Spirits of the Kingdom.
The Factions Headed by the Duke of <hi>Sommerset,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Warwick:</hi>
whose reconciliation, on the Earl's part, was but feigned, and counterfeit; though
he had both given, and taken Pledges for a faster Friendship. The good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
he found in his first attempt against the Duke, when he degraded him from
the Office of Lord <hi>Protectour,</hi> emboldened him to make some further trial of
his Fortune; to which there could not be a stronger Temptation, then the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
of some Great Men about the Court, in prostituting their affection to his
Pride, and Tyranny. Grown absolute in the Court (but more by the weakness
of others, then any virtue of his own he thought it no impossible matter, to
make that Weakness an improvement of his strength, and Power. And, passing
from one Imagination to another, he fixed at last upon a Fancy of transferring
the Imperial Crown of this Realm, from the Royal Family of the <hi>Tudors,</hi> unto
that of the <hi>Dudlies.</hi> This to be done, by Marrying one of his Sons to the Lady
<hi>Jane,</hi> the eldest Daughter of <hi>Henry,</hi> Lord Marquess <hi>Dorset,</hi> and of the Lady
<hi>Francis</hi> his Wife, one of the Daughters, and co-Heirs of <hi>Charls Brandon,</hi> the
late Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> by <hi>Mary, Dowager</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and the be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t-beloved Sister
of King <hi>Henry the Eighth.</hi> In order whereunto, he must first oblige the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess</hi>
by some signal favour; advance himself to such a Greatness, as might
render any of his Sons an agreeable match for either of the <hi>Marquess's</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
and finally devise some means, by which the Duke of <hi>Sommerset</hi> might
be took out of the way: whose life he looked on, as the principal Obstacle to his
great Aspirings. By this Design, he should not onely satisfie his Ambition, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
sacrifice to Revenge. The Execution of his Father, in the first year of the
Reign of the late King <hi>Henry,</hi> would not out of his mind; and by this means
he might have opportunity to execute his just vengeance on the King's Posterity,
for the unjust Murther (as he esteem'd it) of his innocent Father. Confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in these Resolves by Sir <hi>John Gates, Lieutenant of the Band of Pensioners;</hi>
who was reported afterwards to have put this Plot into his Head at the first, as
he stood to him in the prosecution of it to the very last.</p>
                     <p>The Privy Council of his own thoughts having thus advised, the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of the King was in the next place to be made sure to him; either obliged by
Favours, or gained by Flatteries: those of most Power to be most Courted,
through a smooth Countenance, fair Language, and other thriving Acts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuation,
to be made to all. Of the Lord Treasurer <hi>Paulet</hi> he was sure enough:
whom he had found to have so much of the <hi>Willow</hi> in him, that he could bend
him how he pleased. And being sure of him, he thought himself as sure of
the Publick Treasure, as if it were in his own Pockets. The <hi>Marquess</hi> of
<hi>North-hampton</hi> was Captain of the Band of Pensioners, encreased in Power,
though not in Place; by ranging under his Command, as well the Light-Horse,
as the Men at Arms, which had served at <hi>Bulloign.</hi> With him the Earl had
peeced before, drew him into his first Design, for bringing down the Lord <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour</hi>
to a lower Level: but made him faster then before, by doing so many
good Offices to Sir <hi>William Herbert,</hi> who had Married his Sister. Which <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>

to His Majestie's Person.</p>
                     <p>The Triumphs of this Day, being the eleventh day of <hi>October,</hi> were but a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
to the Tragedy, which began on the fifth day after. At what time the
Duke of <hi>Sommerset,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Palmer,</hi> Sir <hi>Ralph Vane,</hi> Sir
<hi>Thomas Arundel,</hi> together with <hi>Hammond, Newdigate,</hi> and two of the <hi>Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi>
were seised on, and committed to Custody; all of them, except <hi>Palmer,
Vane,</hi> and <hi>Arundel,</hi> being sent to the <hi>Tower.</hi> And these three kept in several
Chambers, to attend the pleasure of the Council, for their Examinations. The
Duchess of <hi>Sommerset, Crane,</hi> and his Wife, above-mentioned, and one of the
Gentlewomen of her Chamber, were sent unto the <hi>Tower</hi> on the morrow next;
followed not long after by Sir <hi>Thomas Holdcroft,</hi> Sir <hi>Miles Partridg,</hi> Sir <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael
Stanhop, Wingfield, Banister,</hi> and <hi>Vaughan,</hi> with certain others: for
whose Commitment there was neither cause known, nor afterwards discovered.
Onely the greater Number raised the greater Noise, increas'd the Apprehension of
the present Danger, and served to make the Duke more Criminal in the Eyes of
the People, for drawing so many of all sorts into the Conspiracy. Much time
was spent in the Examination of such of the Prisoners, as either had before disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the Practice (if any such Practice were intended) or were now fitted, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
to betray the Duke into the Power, and Malice of his Enemies. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
which seemed of most importance, were those of <hi>Palmer, Crane,</hi> and <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond;</hi>
though the Truth, and Reality, of the Depositions may be justly question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
For, neither were they brought, face to face, before the Duke, at the time
of his Trial; as in ordinary course they should have been: nor suffered loss of
Life, or Goods, as some others did, who were no more guilty then themselves. And
yet the Business stai<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d not here; the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Paget,</hi>
and two of the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi>'s Servants, being sent Prisoners after the rest,
upon <hi>Crane</hi>'s detection. It was further added by <hi>Palmer,</hi> that, on the last St.
<hi>George</hi>'s-Day, the Duke of <hi>Sommerset,</hi> being upon a journey into the <hi>North,</hi>
would have raised the People; if he had not been assured by Sir <hi>William Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
that no Danger was intended to him.</p>
                     <p>Six Weeks there passed between the Commitment of the Prisoners, and the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:66032:110"/>
Duke's Arraignment: which might have given the King more, then leisure enough
to finde the depth of the Design; if either he had not been directed by such, as
the new Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi> had placed about him, or taken by a Sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnity,
which served fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ly for it. For so it happened, that the <hi>Queen</hi> Regent of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> having been in <hi>France</hi> to see Her Daughter, and being unwilling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
by Sea, in that cold time of the year, obtained leave of the King (by
the mediation of the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadour) to take Her journey through <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
Which leave being granted, She put Her self into the Bay of <hi>Ports<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
where She was Honourably received, and conveyed towards <hi>London.</hi>
From <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> She passed by Water, on the second day of <hi>November,</hi> to
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s-<hi>Wharf.</hi> From whence She rode, accompanied with divers Noble Men,
and Ladies of <hi>England,</hi> besides Her own Train of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to the Bishop's-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.
Presented at Her first coming thither, in the name of the City, with Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,
Beefs, Veals, Poultry, Wine, and all other sorts of Provisions, necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for Her Entertainment, even to Bread, and Fewel. Having reposed Her self
two days, She was conveyed in a Chariot to the Court at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with the Lady <hi>Margaret Douglass,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Margaret,</hi> Queen of
<hi>Scots,</hi> by Her second Husband; together with the Duchesses of <hi>Richmond,
Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Northumberland;</hi> besides many other Ladies of both Kingdoms,
which followed after in the Train. At the Court-Gate She was received by the
Dukes of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and the <hi>Lord High-Treasurer,</hi> the
Guard standing on both sides, as She went along; and being brought unto the
King, whom She found standing at the end of the Great Hall, She cast Her
self upon Her knees, but was presently taken up, and Saluted by Him, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Free Custom of the <hi>English</hi> Nation. Leading Her by the Hand to
the Queen's Chamber of Presence: He Saluted in like manner all the Ladies of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and so departed for a while. Dinner being ready, the King conducted
Her to the Table prepared for them, where they dined together, but had their
Services apart. The Ladies of both Kingdomes were fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Great Chamber, where they were most Sumptuously Served. Dinner being
done, that Her Attendants might have time to partake of the Entertainment,
the King shewed Her His Gardens, Galleries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and, about four of the
clock, He brought Her down by the Hand into the Hall, where He Saluted Her,
and so She departed to the Bishop's-Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>Departing towards <hi>Scotland,</hi> on the sixth of that Moneth, She rode through
all the Principal Streets of <hi>London;</hi> betwixt the Bishop's House, and the
Church in <hi>Shore-ditch,</hi> attended by divers Noble Men, and Women, all the
way She went. But more particularly the Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself with one hundred Horse, each having his Javelin in his hand;
and fourty of them apparelled in Black Velvet, Guarded with White and Velvet
Caps, and White Feathers, and Chains of Gold about their Necks. Next to
these stood one hundred and twenty Horsemen, of the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi>'s, with
black Javelins, Hats, and Feathers. Next to them one hundred of the <hi>Lord
Treasurer</hi>'s
Gentlemen, and Yeomen, with Javelins. These ranks of Horsemen
reaching, from the <hi>Cross</hi> in <hi>Cheap-side,</hi> to the end of <hi>Birching</hi>-Lane in <hi>Cornhill.</hi>
Brought as far as <hi>Shoreditch</hi>-Church, She was committed to the care of the Sheriffs
of <hi>London,</hi> by whom She was attended as far as <hi>Wal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ham.</hi> Conducted in like
manner by the Sheriffs of all the Counties, through which She passed, till She
came unto the Borders of <hi>Scotland:</hi> Her Entertainment being provided by the
King's appointment, at the Charge of the Counties. Which Passages, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
otherwise Material in the Course of this History, I have adventured to lay
down; the better to express the Gallantry, and Glory of the <hi>English</hi> Nation,
before <hi>Puritanism,</hi> and the Humour of Parity, occasioned the neglect of all
the laudable Solemnities, which antiently had been observed, both in Church,
and State.</p>
                     <p>The Discourse, raised on this Magnificent Reception of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Queen, so
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:66032:110"/>
filled all Mouths, and entertained so many Pens, that the Danger of the Duke
of <hi>Sommerset</hi> seemed for a time to be forgotten; but it was onely for a time.
For, on the first of <hi>December,</hi> the Duke being brought by water to <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi>
found all things there prepared for his Arraignment. The <hi>Lord High-Steward,</hi>
for the time, was the <hi>Marquess</hi> of <hi>Winchester,</hi> who took his place
under a Cloath of Estate, raised three steps higher, then the rest of the Scaffold.
The <hi>Peers,</hi> to the number of twenty seven, sitting one step lower. Amongst
these were the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> the <hi>Marquess</hi> of <hi>North-hampton,</hi> and the
Earl of <hi>Pembroke:</hi> who, being Parties to the Charge, ought, in all Honesty, and
Honour, to have excused themselves, from sitting in Judgment on him, at the
time of his Trial. But no Challenge, or Objection, being made, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
against them, they took place with the rest. The Court being sate, and
the Prisoner brought unto the Bar, the Charge against him was divided into five
Particulars: <hi>viz.</hi> Fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>, His design of Raising men in the <hi>North-</hi> Parts of the
Realm, and of assembling men at his House, to kill the Duke of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
2. A resolution to assist his Attachment. 3. The Plot for killing the
<hi>Gens d' Arms.</hi> 4. His intent for raising <hi>London.</hi> 5. His purpose of assaulting
the <hi>Lords,</hi> and devising their Deaths. The whole Impeachment managed in the
name of Treason, and Felony: because in all Treasons the intent, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
is as Capital, as the Act it self, if once discovered, either by word, or deed,
or any other material Circumstance, though it go no further. But, though
Treason made the loudest noise, it was the Felony, which was especially relied up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for his Condemnation. Two <hi>Statutes</hi> were pretended for the Ground of the
whole Proceedings. The first made in the time of King <hi>Henry the Seventh,</hi> by
which it was Enacted, to be Felony, for any inferiour Person, to contrive the
death of a Lord of the Council. The second, that of the last Session of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
By which it was Declared, to be Treason, for any Twelve Persons, or
more, to Assemble together, with an intent to murther any of the Lords of
the Council: if, after Proclamation made, they dissolved not themselves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the space of an hour.</p>
                     <p>The Indictment being Read, and the Confessions of <hi>Palmer,</hi> and the rest,
being produced, and urged by the King's Council, (who spared not to press them,
as is accustomed in such Cases) to the best advantage. The Duke, though much
dismayed, returned this Answer to the Branches of his Accusation: <hi>viz.</hi> That
<hi>He never intended to raise the</hi> North-<hi>Parts of this Realm; but that, upon some
bruits, he apprehended a Fear, which made him send to Sir</hi> William Herbert, <hi>to
remain his Friend;</hi> That <hi>He determined not to kill the</hi> Duke <hi>of</hi> Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>nor any other Lord: but spake of it onely, and determined the contrary;</hi>
That <hi>It had been a mad enterprise, with his hundred men, to assail the</hi> Gens d'
Arms, <hi>consisting of nine hundred: which, in case he had prevailed, would nothing
have advanced the pretended purpose;</hi> That <hi>Therefore this b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ing senseless, and
absurd, must needs discredit other matters: which otherwise might have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved;</hi>
That <hi>At</hi> London <hi>he never projected any stir: but ever held it a good
place for his security;</hi> That, <hi>For having men in his Chamber at</hi> Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,
<hi>it was manifest, that he meant no harm: because, when he might have done
it, he did not.</hi> And further, against the persons of them, whose <hi>Examinations</hi>
had been read, he objected many things; desiring, that <hi>They might be brought to
his face: which, in regard of his Dignity, and Estate, he conceived to be reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
And so it happened unto him, as with many others; that, hoping to make
his fault seem less, by a fair <hi>Confession,</hi> he made it great enough to serve for
his <hi>Condemnation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For, presently upon these words, the Council, thinking they had matter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
from his own <hi>Confession,</hi> to convict him of <hi>Felony,</hi> insisted chiefly on that
Point, and flourished out their Proofs upon it, to their best Advantage. But
so, that they neglected not to aggravate his <hi>Offence</hi> in the Treason also: that
his <hi>Peers</hi> might be under some necessity of finding him guilty in the one; if
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:66032:111"/>
they should finde themselves unsatisfied, for passing their <hi>Verdict</hi> in the other.
And though neither the one, nor the other, were so clear in Law, as to make
him liable to a <hi>Sentence</hi> of <hi>Condemnation:</hi> if either the Statute in the Contents
had been rightly opened, or the <hi>Opinion</hi> of the <hi>Judges</hi> demanded in them; yet
what cannot the Great Wit of some <hi>Advocates</hi> do, when they have a mind to
serve their Turn upon a <hi>Stat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>te,</hi> contrary to the Mind and Meaning of
them that made it. The Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> thereupon, with
a Counterfeit Modesty (conceiving that he had him fast enough, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the <hi>Felony)</hi> desired their Lordships, that no Act against his life
might be brought within the Compass of <hi>Treason;</hi> and they who understood his
meaning at half a Word, after a full hearing of the Evidence, withdrew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into a Room appointed for them: and after some Conference amongst
themselves, acquitting him of <hi>Tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>son,</hi> they pronounced him guilty of the
<hi>Felony</hi> onely; which being returned for their Verdict, by all the Lords one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another, in their Rank and Order, and nothing objected by the Duke, that
Judgement should not pass upon him, the Lord <hi>High Steward,</hi> with a seeming
Sorrow, gave Sentence, <hi>That he should be had to the Place from whence he came,
from thence to the Place of Execution, and there to hang while he was dead;</hi>
which is the Ordinary Form of condemning <hi>Felons.</hi> A Matter not sufficiently
to be admired, that the Duke should either be so ignorant, or ill advised, so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of present Courage, or so defective in the Use of his Wit, and Judgment,
as not to crave the common Benefit of his <hi>Clergy;</hi> which had he done, it must
have been allowed him by the Rules of the Court: whether it were, that of his
own Misfortunes might render him uncapable of laying hold on such Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
as the Laws admitted; or that he thought it better to die once for all, then
living in a perpetual Fear of dying daily by the malicious Practises and Devises
of his powerfull Adversaries; or that he might presume of a Pardon of Course,
in regard of the nature of the Offence, in which neither the King, nor the
Safety of the Kingdom was concerned, and that the Law, by which it was found
guilty of Felony, had never been put in Execution upon a man of his Quality,
if perhaps at all; or finally, whether it were some secret Judgment on him from
above (as some men conceived) that he who had destroyed so many Churches,
invaded the Estate of so many Cathedrals, deprived so many Learned Men of
their Means, and Livelyhood, should want, (or rather not desire) <hi>the Benefit
of the Clergy,</hi> in his greatest extremity. In stead whereof he suffered Judgment
of death to pass upon him, gave thanks unto the Lords for his gentle Tryall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
craved Pardon of the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> the Marquess of <hi>North-hampton,</hi>
and the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> for his ill Meaning towards them; conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with an humble Suit for his Life, and Pity to be shewed to his Wife and
Children.</p>
                     <p>It is an antient Custome in the Triall of all great Persons accused of Treason,
that the Ax of the <hi>Tower</hi> is carried before them to the Bar, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d afterwards at
their Return from thence, on the Pronouncing of the Sentence of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Which Ceremony not being performed at his going thence, in regard he
was condemned of the Felony onely, gave an occasion unto such as had throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the Hall, and knew not otherwise how things passed, to conceive that he
had been acquitted absolutely of the whole Indictment. And thereupon so loud a
Shout was made in the lower end of the Hall, that the noise thereof was heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<hi>Charing-Cross,</hi> to the great Terrour and Amazement of his guilty Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries.
But little pleasure found the Prisoner in these Acclamations, and less, the
People, when they understood of his Condemnation: so that departing thence
with grief, they left the way open for the Prisoner to be carried by water, to the
<hi>Cranes</hi> in the <hi>Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>etry,</hi> and from thence peaceably conveyed to the Tower a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
Not long after followed the Arraignment of Sir <hi>Michael Stanhop,</hi> Sir
<hi>Thomas Arundel,</hi> Sir <hi>Ralph Vane,</hi> and Sir <hi>Miles Partridge,</hi> on whom also pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Sentence of Death; but the certain Day and Time of their Triall. I
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:66032:111"/>
have no where found. Most probable it is, that they were not brought to their
Triall, till after the Ax had done its part on the Duke of <hi>Sommerset,</hi> which was
on the twenty third of <hi>January,</hi> because I finde they were not brought to their
Execution till the twenty sixth of <hi>February</hi> then next following, the two first
being then beheaded, and the two last hanged, at what time they severally Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested,
(taking God to witness) that they never practised Treason against the
King, or against the Lives of any of the Lords of his Council; <hi>Vane</hi> adding
after all the rest, <hi>that his Blood would make</hi> Northumberland's <hi>Pillow uneasie to
him.</hi> None of them less lamented by the Common People, then Sir <hi>Miles
Partridge,</hi> against whom they had an old Grudge, for depriving them of the
best Ring of Bells, which they had at that time, called <hi>Jesus-Bells;</hi> which
winning of King <hi>Henry</hi> at a Cast of Dice, he caused to be taken down, and sold,
or melted for his own Advantage. If any Bell tolled for him when he went to
his Death, or that the sight of an Halter made him think of a Bell-Rope, it
could not but remember him of his Fault in that Particular, and mind him of
calling upon <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> for his Grace and Mercy.</p>
                     <p>But in the mean time, Care is taken, that the King should not be too appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
of these Misfortunes into which his Uncle had been cast; or enter into
any Enquiries, whether he had been cast into them by his own Fault, or the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
of others. It was therefore thought fit to Entertain him frequently with
Masks, and Dancings, brave Challenges at Tilts, and Barriers, and whatsoever
Sports and Exercises, which they conceived most pleasing to him. But nothing
seemed more delightfull to him, then the appearing of His Lords, and others
in a General Muster, performed on the twenty third of <hi>December,</hi> in Saint
<hi>James</hi> his Fields. At what time sitting on Horse-back with the Lords of His
Council, the Band of Pensioners in compleat Arms, with four Trumpeters, and
the King's Standard going before them, first appeared in sight: each Pensio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
having two Servants waiting on him with their several Spears. Next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
in distinct Companies of one hundred apiece, the Troops of the Lord
Treasurer <hi>Paulet,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> the Lord Privy Seal, the
Marquess of <hi>North-hampton,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> and the Lord Warden of
the Cinque-Ports: a Trumpet and a Standard carried before each Troop; four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Duke of <hi>Northumbeland</hi>'s Men, and as many of the Earl of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke</hi>'s, having Velvet Goats upon their Harness; with these were mingled
in like Equipage, (as to the Trumpets, and the Standards) the distinct Troops
of the Earls of <hi>Rutland,</hi> and <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

each of fifty Horse, and Rancked according to the Order, and Precedency of
their several Lords. All which rode twice before the King, by five in a Ranck,
all excellently well Armed, and bravely Mounted, to the great Contentment of
the King, the Delight of the People, and as much to the Honour of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in the Eye of all such Strangers, as were present at it. But then the Lords
of <hi>England,</hi> were <hi>Lords</hi> indeed, and thought it not consistent with a Title of
Honour, to walk the Streets, attended by a Lacquie onely, and perhaps not that,
The Particulars of which Glorious Muster had not been specified, but for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
the Place of Musick, (as the Solemn Reception of the Queen Regent did
before) betwixt the two last <hi>Acts</hi> of this <hi>Tragedy,</hi> to the last whereof we shall

                     <p>Two Moneths had passed since the Pronouncing of the Fatal Sentence of
Condemnation, before the Prisoner was brought out to his Execution. In all
which time it may be thought, that he might easily have obtained his Pardon of
the King, who had passed the first years of His Reign under his Protection, and
could not but behold him with the Eye of Respect, as his<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Mother, But first his Adversaries, had so possessed the King with an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of his Crimes, and Misdemeanours, that he believed him to be guilty of
them: as appears by his Letter to <hi>Fitz-Patrick,</hi> (for which Consult the Church
<hi>Historian.</hi> Lib. 7. fol. 409, 410.) wherein he Summarily repeateth the Substance
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:66032:112"/>
of the Charge, the Proofs against him, the Proceedings of the Lords in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment,
and his Submiss Carriage, both before, and after the Sentence. They
also filled his Ears with the Continual Noise of the Unnatural Prosecuting of
the late Lord Admiral; inculcating, how unsafe it was to trust to the Fidelity of such
a Man, who had so lately washed his Hands in the Blood of his Brother. And,
that the King might rest himself upon these Perswasions, all ways were stopped,
and all the <hi>Avenues</hi> blocked up, by which it might be possible for any of the
Duke's Friends to finde access, either for rectifying the King's Opinion, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
his Pardon. So that at last, upon the twenty second of <hi>January</hi> before-remembred
(the King not being sufficiently possessed before of his Crimes,
and Cruelties) he was brought to the Scaffold on <hi>Tower-Hill.</hi> Where he avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the People: That, <hi>His In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

particular Persons, but driving to the Common Benefit, both of the King, and of
the Realm.</hi> Interrupted in the rest of his <hi>Speech,</hi> upon the suddain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d the Hopes of a
Pardon, which the People conceived to have been brought him by Sir <hi>Anthony
Brown,</hi> who came speedily galloping on the other, he composed himself at last to
make a Confession of his Faith, heartily praying for the King, exhorting the
People to Obedience, and humbly craving Pardon both of God, and Man.
Which said, he chearfully submitted his Head to the stroke of the Ax, by which
it was taken off at a Blow; putting an end thereby to his Cares and Sorrows.</p>
                     <p>Such was the End of this Great Person, whose Power and Greatness may be
best discerned by this following Style, used by him in the Height of his former
Glories: that is to say, <q>
                           <hi>Edward,</hi> by the Grace of God, Duke of <hi>Sommerset,</hi>
Earl of <hi>Hertford,</hi> Viscount <hi>Beauchamp,</hi> Baron <hi>Seimour,</hi> Uncle to the King's
Highness of <hi>England,</hi> Governour to the King's Highness Person, Protectour
of all his Realms, Dominions, and Subjects, Lieutenant General of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie's
Armies, both by Sea, and Land, Lord <hi>High Treasurer,</hi> and Earl <hi>Marshal</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> Captain of Isles the of <hi>Garnsey,</hi> and <hi>Jarsey,</hi> and Knight of the most
Honourable Order of the Garter.</q> As to his Parts, Person, and Abilitie, there
needs no other Character of him, then what was given in the beginning, and
may be gathered from the Course of this present History. More Moderate in
carrying on the Work of <hi>Reformation,</hi> then those, who after had the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Conduct of it, as one, that, in himself, was more inclinable to the <hi>Lutheran</hi>

                        <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glian</hi>
Doctrines: so well beloved in general by the Common People, that divers
dipt their Handkerchiefs in his Blood, to keep them in perpetual Remembrance
of him. One of which, being a sprightly Dame, about two years after, when the
Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi> was led through the City, for his opposing the Title
of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> ran to him in the Streets, and, shaking out her bloody Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief
before him, <hi>Behold</hi> (said she) <hi>the Blood of that worthy man, that good
Vncle of that Excellent King, which shed by thy malicious Practice, doth now begin
apparently to revenge it self on thee.</hi> The like Opinion also was conceived of the
business by the most understanding men in the Court, and Kingdom; though the
King seemed for the present to be satisfied in it. In which opinion they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
confirmed by the Enlargment of the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and restoring
of <hi>Crane,</hi> and his Wife, to their former Liberty; but most especially by the great
Endearments, which afterwards appeared between the Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi>
and Sir <hi>Thomas Palmer,</hi> and the great confidence, which the Duke placed in
him for the Advancement of his Projects, in behalf of the Duke of <hi>Suffolk:</hi> of
which more hereafter.</p>
                     <p>But the Malice of his Enemies stayed not here, extending also to his Friends,
and Children, after his Decease: but chiefly to the eldest Son by the second
Wife; in favour of whom, an Act of Parliament had been passed in the thirty
second year of the late King <hi>Henry,</hi> for the entailing on his Person all such
Lands, Estates, and Honours, as had been, or should be purchas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from the twenty fifth day of <hi>May,</hi> then next foregoing. Which Act
they caused to be repealed, at the end of the next Session of <hi>Parliament</hi> (which
began on the morrow after the Death of the Duke) whereby they strip'd the
young Gentleman, being then about thirteen years of Age, of his Lands, and
Titles; to which he was in part restored by Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> who, in pity of
his Father's Suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>arl of <hi>Hertford,</hi>
Viscount <hi>Beauchamp,</hi> &amp;c. Nor did the Duke's Fall end it self in no other ruin,
then that of his own house, and the Death of the four Knights, which suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the same account; but drew along with it the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>emoval of the Lord <hi>Rich,</hi>
from the Place, and Office, of <hi>Lord Chancellour.</hi> For so it happened, that the
Lord Chancellour, commiserating the Condition of the Duke of <hi>Sommerset,</hi>
though formerly he had shewed himself against him, dispatched a Letter to him,
concerning some Proceedings of the <hi>Lords</hi> of the Council, which he thought
fit for him to know. Which Letter being hastily superscribed, <hi>To the Duke,</hi>
with no other Title, he gave to one of his Servants, to be carried to him. By
whom, for want of a more particular direction, it was delivered to the hands
of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk.</hi> But, the Mistake being presently found, the Lord
Chancellour knowing into what hands he was like to fall, makes his Address un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the King, the next morning betimes; and humbly prays, that, in regard of
his great Age, he might be discharged of the Great Seal, and Office of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour.
Which being granted by the King, though with no small difficulty;
the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> (forward enough to
go upon such an Errand) are sent, on the twenty first of <hi>December,</hi> to receive
the Seal; committed on the morrow after to Doctour <hi>Thomas Goodwin,</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Ely,</hi> and one of the <hi>Lords</hi> of the Privy Council. Who afterwards, that is
to say, on the two and twentieth of <hi>January,</hi> was sworn Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour;
the Lord Treasurer <hi>Paulet</hi> giving him the Oath, in the Court of
Chancery.</p>
                     <p>Next followed the Losses, and Disgraces, suffered by the Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> on
the Duke's account. To whom he had continued faithfull in all his Troubles; when
Sir <hi>William Cecil,</hi> who had received greater Benefits from him, and most of the
Dependants on him, had either deserted, or betrayed him. His House designed
to be the place, in which the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Lords</hi>
were to be murthered at a Banquet: if any credit may be given to the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
for which Committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> as before is said. But having no
sufficient Proof, to warrant any further Proceeding to his Condemnation, an
Enquiry is made not long after into all his Actions. In the return whereof, it was
suggested; That he had sold the King's Lands, and Woods, without Commission;
That he had taken great Fines for the King's Lands, and applyed them to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
use; and That he had made Leases in Reversion, for more then one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years. Which Spoyl is to be understood of the Lands and Woods of the
<hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> of the which he was Chancellour; and for committing
whereof, he was not onely forced to resign that Office, but condemned
in a fine of six thousand pounds; not otherwise to be excused, but by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of four thousand pounds within the year. This Punishment, was accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a Disgrace, no less grievous to him, then the loss both of his Place,
and Money. He had been chosen into the Society of the <hi>Garter, An.</hi> 1548.
when the Duke of <hi>Sommerset</hi> was in Power, and so continued, till the fifteenth
of <hi>April,</hi> in the year next following, <hi>Anno</hi> 1552. At what time <hi>Garter,</hi> King
of A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and the <hi>George,</hi> belonging to him, as a Knight of that most Noble Order. Which
he suffered willingly to be done, because it was His Majestie's Pleasure, that it
should so be. More sensible of the Affront, without all question, then otherwise
he would have been, because the said <hi>George,</hi> and <hi>Garter,</hi> were presently af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by the King to <hi>John,</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi>'s eldest Son,
Admitted thereupon into that Society. So prevalent are the Passions of some
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:66032:113"/>
Great Persons; that they can neither put a measure upon their Hatred, nor an
end to their Malice. Which two last Passages, though more properly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the following year, I have thought fit to place in this; because of that
dependance, which they have on the Fall of <hi>Sommerset.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The like Ill-Fortune happened, at the same time also<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to Doctour <hi>Robert Farrar,</hi>
Bishop of St. <hi>David</hi>'s; who, as he had his Preferments by him, so he suffered
also in his Fall: not because Guilty of the Practice, or Conspiracy with him, as
the Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> and the rest, were given out to be; but because he wanted his
Support, and Countenance, against his Adversaries. A Man he was of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociable
disposition, rigidly self-willed: and one, who looked for more Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
then his place required; which drew him into a great disl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ke with most
of his Clergy, with none more, then the Canons of his own Cathedral.
The Faction headed, amongst others, by Doctour <hi>Thomas Young,</hi> then being
the Chantour of that Church, and afterwards advanced by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to
the See of <hi>York;</hi> as also Doctour <hi>Rowland Merick,</hi> preferred by the same Queen
to the See of <hi>Bangor:</hi> though they appeared not visibly in the Information,
which was made against him. In which I finde him charged amongst other things,
for Celebrating a Marriage, without requiring the Married Persons to receive
the Communion, contrary to the Rubrick in the Common-Prayer-Book; for
going ordinarily abroad in a Gown, and Hat, and not in a Square Cap, as did
the rest of the Clergy; for causing a Communion-Table, which had been
placed, by the Official of <hi>Caer-marthen,</hi> in the middle of the Church, (the High
Alltar being then demolished) to be carried back into the Chancel, and there to
be disposed of, in, or near the place, where the Altar stood; for suffering ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

Laws in that behalf: But chiefly for exercising some Acts of <hi>Episcopal</hi> Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in his own name, in derogation of the King's Supremacy; and grounding his
Commissions, for the exercise thereof, upon foreign, and usurped Authority.
The <hi>Articles,</hi> fifty six in number; but this last, as the first in Rank, so of
more Danger to him, then all the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as long as his great Patron, the Duke of <hi>Sommerset,</hi> was in place, and Power.
But, he being on the sinking hand, and the Bishop too stiff to come to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with those, whom he esteemed beneath him; the Suit is followed with
more noise, and violence, then was consistent with the credit of either Party.
The Duke being dead, the four Knights Executed, and all his Party in Disgrace,
a Commission is Issued, bearing Date the ninth of <hi>March,</hi> to enquire into the
Merit of the Articles, which were charged against him. On the return where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,

it sooner, and found it very unsafe to defer it longer, for fear of being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled
in a <hi>Parliamentary</hi> way, by the Lords, and Commons. There was Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:66032:113"/>
also a Convocation of the Bishops, and Clergy of the Province of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
to begin upon the next day after the <hi>Parliament.</hi> Much business done in each,
as may appear by the Table of the Statutes made in the one, and the passing of
the Book of Articles as the Work of the other. But the Acts of this Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were so ill kept, that there remains nothing on Record, touching their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
except it be the names of such of the Bishops, as came thither to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ
the House. Onely I finde a <hi>Memorandum,</hi> that, on the twenty ninth of this
present <hi>January,</hi> the Bishoprick of <hi>Westminster</hi> was dissolved, by the King's Letters
Patents; by which the County of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> which had before been laid unto
it, was restored unto the See of <hi>London:</hi> made greater then in former times,
by the Addition of the Arch-Deaconry of St. <hi>Alban</hi>'s; which, at the dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that Monastery, had been laid to <hi>Lincoln.</hi> The Lands of <hi>Westminster</hi>
so dilapidated by Bishop <hi>Thirlby,</hi> that there was almost nothing left to support
the Dignity; for which good service, he had been preferred to the See of <hi>Nor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the year foregoing. Most of the Lands invaded by the Great men of the
Court, the rest laid out for Reparation to the Church of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> pared al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
to the very quick, in those days of Rapine. From hence first came that
significant By-word (as is said by some) of <hi>Robbing Peter, to pay Paul.</hi> But
this was no Business of that Convocation, though remembred in it.</p>
                     <p>That which most specially doth concern us in this Convocation, is the settling,
and confirming of the Book of Articles, prepared by Arch-Bishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi>
with the assistance of such Learned men, as he thought fit to call unto him, in
the year last past; and now presented to the consideration of the rest of the
Clergy. For, that they were debated, and agreed upon in that Convocation,
appears by the Title of the Book, where they are called, <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

in the Synod of London, An.</hi> 1552. And it may be concluded from that Title al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
that the Convocation had devolved their Power on some Grand Committee,
sufficiently Authourised to Debate, Conclude, and Publish what they had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the name of the rest. For there it is not said, as in the Articles Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, <hi>An. 1562. That they were agreed upon by the
Arch-Bishops, and Bishops of both Provinces, and the whole-Clergy, in the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

as the <hi>Latin</hi> hath it. Which seems to make it plain enough, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating,

purpose, the Articles, by them concluded, and agreed upon, may warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be affirmed, to be the Acts, and Products of that Convocation; Confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

the Approbation of the said Bishops, and Learned men. Against which, when
it was objected by Doctour <hi>Weston,</hi> Prolocutour of the Convocation, in the first
of Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> that the said Catechism <hi>was not set forth by the Agreement
of that House;</hi> it was Answered by that Reverend, and Learned man; That <hi>The

                     <p>And this may also be the Case of the Book of Articles, which may be truly,
and justly said to be the Work of that Convocation: though many Members of
it never saw the same, till the Book was published; in regard (I still use <hi>Philpot</hi>'s
words in the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Mon. Fol. 1282.) that they had a Synodal Authority

or convenient for the use of the Church.</hi> Had it been otherwise, King <hi>Edward,</hi>
a most Pious, and Religious Prince must needs be looked on, as a Wicked
and most Lewd Impostour, in putting such an horrible Cheat upon all His
Subjects, by Fathering these Articles on the <hi>Convocation,</hi> which begat them
not, nor ever gave consent unto them. And yet it is not altogether improbable, but
that these <hi>Articles</hi> being debated, and agreed upon, by the said <hi>Commitee,</hi> might
also pass the <hi>Vote</hi> of the whole <hi>Convocation,</hi> though we finde nothing to that
purpose in the <hi>Acts</hi> thereof, which either have been lost, or were never Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred.
Besides, it is to be observed that the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for the first five years
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> retained these <hi>Articles,</hi> and no other, as the publick Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents
of the <hi>Church</hi> in point of <hi>Doctrine;</hi> which certainly She had not done, had
they been commended to Her by a less Authority, then a <hi>Convocation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such hand the Convocation had in canvasing the Articles, prepared for them,
and in concluding, and agreeing to so much, or so many of them, as afterwards
were published by the King's Authority in the name thereof. But whether they had
any such hand in Reviewing the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> and passing their Consent to such Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
as were made therein, is another Question. That some necessity appeared
both for the <hi>Reveiwing</hi> of the whole, and the altering of some Parts thereof hath
been shew'd before: And it was shewed before by whose Procurement, and Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
the Church was brought to that necessity of doing somewhat to that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
But being not sufficiently Authorised to proceed upon it, because the King's
sole Authority did not seem sufficient, they were to stay the Leasure, and Consent of
the present Parliament. For being the <hi>Liturgie</hi> then in force had been confirmed
and imposed by the King in Parliament, with the Consent, and Assent of the
Lords and Commons, it stood with Reason, that they should not venture actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
on the Alteration, but by their permission first declared. And therefore it
is said expresly in the Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> made this present year, That <hi>The said
Order of Common Service, Entituled The Book of Common-Prayer, had been Perused,
Explained, and made fully perfect:</hi> not single by the King's Authority, but by
the King, with the <hi>Assent</hi> of the Lords and Commons. More then the giving of
their <hi>Assent,</hi> was neither required by the King, nor desired by the Prelats; and less
then this could not be fought, as the Case then stood. The signifying of which
<hi>Assent</hi> enabled the Bishops, and the rest of the Clergy, whom they had taken
for their <hi>Assistants,</hi> to proceed to the Digesting of such Alterations, as were
before considered, and resolved on, amongst themselves; and possibly might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the like Authority from the Convocation, as the Articles had, though no
such thing remaining upon Record in the Registers of it. But whether it were
so, or not, certain it is, that it received as much Authority, and Countenance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as could be given unto it by an Act of <hi>Parliament;</hi> by which imposed upon the
Subject under certain Penalties (Imprisonments, Pecuniarie Mulcts, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi>
which could not be inflicted on them by Synodical Acts.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Liturgie</hi> being thus Settled, and Confirmed in <hi>Parliament,</hi> was by the
King's Command translated into <hi>French,</hi> for the Use of the Isles of <hi>Guernsey,</hi>
and <hi>Jersey,</hi> and such as lived within the Marches, and Command of <hi>Calais.</hi>
But no such Care was taken for <hi>Wales,</hi> till the fifth year of the Reign of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth:</hi> nor of the Realm of <hi>Ireland,</hi> from that time to this. King <hi>Henry</hi>
had so far prepared the Way to a Reformation, as His own Power, and Profit
was concerned in it; to which Ends he excluded the Pope's Authority, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Himself to be declared Supreme Head on Earth of the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
by Act of <hi>Parliament.</hi> And by like Acts he had annexed to the Crown the
Lands of all Monasteries, and Religious Orders: together with thetwentieth
Part of all the Ecclesiastical Promotions within that Kingdom; and caused the
like Course to be settled for the Electing, and Consecrating of Arch-Bishops,
and Bishops, as had been done before in <hi>England.</hi> Beyond which, as he did not
go; so, as it seems, King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Council thought not fit to adventure fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
They held it not agreeable to the Rules of Prudence, to have too many
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:66032:114"/>
Irons in the Fire at once: nor safe, in Point of Policy, to try Conclusions on a
People in the King's Minority, which were so far tenacionsly addicted to the
Superstitions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of a Nature not so tractable, as the
<hi>English</hi> were. And yet that Realm was quiet, even to Admiration, notwithstanding
the frequent Embroilments, and Commotions, which so miserably disturbed
the Peace of <hi>England:</hi> which may be reckoned for one of the greatest Felicities
of this King's Reign, and a strong Argument of the Care, and Vigilancy of
such of His Ministers, as had the chief Direction of the <hi>Irish</hi> Affairs. At the first
Payment of the Money for the Sale (rather then the Surrendry) of <hi>Bulloign:</hi>
eight thousand pounds was set apart for the Service of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
out of the Profits, which were raised from the Mint, four hundred men
were Levied, and sent over thither also; with a Charge given to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
that the Laws of <hi>England</hi> should be Carefully, and Duly administred,
and all such as did oppose, suppressed: by Means whereof great Countenance
was given to those, who embraced the Reformed Religion there: especially
within those Counties, which are called commonly by the name of the <hi>English
Pale.</hi> The Common-Prayer-Book of <hi>England,</hi> being brought over thither,
and used in most of the Churches of the <hi>English</hi> Plantation, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Law in their own Parliaments to impose it on them. But nothing more
conduced to the Peace of that Kingdom, then that the Governours for the most
part were men of such Choice; that neither the Nobility disdained to endure
their Commands, nor the inferiour sort were oppressed, to supply their Wants.
Besides which, as the King drew many men from thence to serve him in his Wars
against <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> which otherwise might have disturbed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Peace; so, upon notice of some great Preparations, which were made in
<hi>France</hi> for the Assistance of the <hi>Scots,</hi> he sent over to guard the Coast of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> four Ships, four Barks, four Pinnaces, and twelve Victuallers. By
the Advantage of which Strength, He made good three Havens, two on the
South-side toward <hi>France,</hi> and one toward <hi>Scotland;</hi> which afterwards made
themselves good Booties out of such of the <hi>French,</hi> as were either cast away
on the Coast of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or forced to save themselves in the Havens of it. For
the <hi>French</hi> making choice rather of their Passage by Saint <hi>George</hi>'s Chanel,
then by the ordinary Course of Navigation, from <hi>France,</hi> to <hi>Edenborough,</hi>
fell from one Danger to another; and, for fear of being intercepted, or mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
by the Ships of <hi>England,</hi> were Shipwracked, as before was said, on the
Coast of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Nothing else Memorable in this King's Reign, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
that Kingdom; and therefore I have lai'd it altogether in this Place, and
on this Occasion.</p>
                     <p>But we return again to <hi>England,</hi> where we have seen a Reformation made in
Point of Doctrine, and settled in the Forms of Worship; the Superstitions and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> entirely abrogated, and all things rectified, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Word of God, and the Primitive Practice: nothing defective in the
Managing of so great a Work, which could have been required by equal, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Men, but that it was not done, as they conceived it ought to have been
done, in a <hi>General Council.</hi> But first we finde not any such Necessity of a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Council,</hi> but that many Heresies had been suppressed, and many Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
removed out of the Church, without any such Trouble. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>

very plainly to this Purpose, and yet the Learned Cardinal, though a great
Stickler in behalf of <hi>General Councils,</hi> speaks more plain then he. By whom it is
affirrmed, that for seven Heresies condemned in seven <hi>General Councils</hi> (though
by his leave the seventh did not so much suppress, as advance an Heresie) an huu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
had been quashed in National and Provincial Councils. The Practice of
the Church in the several Councils of <hi>Aquilia, Carthage, Gangra, Milevis,</hi>
&amp;c. make this plain enough; all of them being <hi>Provincial,</hi> or at least but Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
and doing their own Work without Help from others. The Church had
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:66032:115"/>
been in an ill Condition, had it been otherwise; especially under the Power of the
Heathen Emperours; when such a Confluence of the Prelats, from all Parts of the
World, would have been construed a Conspiracy against the State, and drawn
Destruction on the Church, and the Persons both. Or granting, that they
might assemble without any such Danger, yet being great Bodies, moving
slowly, and not without long time, and many Difficulties, and Disputes to be
rightly Constituted: the Church would suffer more under such Delay, by the
spreading of Heresie, then receive Benefit by this Care to suppress the same.
So that there neither is, or can be, any such Necessity, either in Order to the
Reformation of a National Church, or the Suppressing of particular Heresies,
as by the Objectours is supposed.</p>
                     <p>Howsoever taking it for granted, that a <hi>General Council</hi> is the best and safest
Physick, that the Church can take, on all Occasions of Epidemical Distempers;
yet must it be granted at such times, and in such Cases onely, when it may
conveniently be had. For where it is not to be had, or not had conveniently,
it will either prove to be no Physick, or not worth the taking. But so it was,
at the time of the Reformation, that a <hi>General Council</hi> could not conveniently
be assembled, and more then so, it was impossible, that any such <hi>Council</hi> should
assemble: I mean, a <hi>General Council</hi> rightly called, and constituted, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Rules lai'd down by our Controversers.</p>
                     <p>For first they say, It must be called by such as have Power to do it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That it must be intimated to all <hi>Christian Churches,</hi> that so no
Church, nor People may plead Ignorance of it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the four chief <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> must be present at it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in person, or by <hi>Proxie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And lastly, That no Bishop be excluded, if he be known to be a Bishop,

                     <p>According to which Rules, it was impossible, I say, that any <hi>General Council</hi>
should be assembled at the time of the <hi>Reformation</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the Church of <hi>England.</hi> It
was not then, as when the chief four <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> together with their <hi>Metropolitan</hi>
and <hi>Suffragan</hi> Bishops, were under the Protection of the <hi>Christian</hi> Emperours, and
might without Danger to themselves, or to their Churches, obey the Intimation,
and attend the Service, the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> with their <hi>Metropolitans</hi> and <hi>Suffragans,</hi>
both then and now languishing under the Power and Tyranny of the <hi>Turk:</hi> to
whom so general a Confluence of <hi>Christian</hi> Bishops must needs give matter of
Suspicion of just Fears and Jealousies, and therefore not to be permitted (as far
as he can possibly hinder it) on good Reason of <hi>State.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And then besides, it would be known by whom such a <hi>General Council</hi> was to
be assembled: if by the <hi>Pope,</hi> as generally the <hi>Papists</hi> say, He, and his Court were
looked on, as the greatest Grievance of the <hi>Christian</hi> Church, and it was not
probable, that he should call a Council against himself, unless he might have leave
to pack it, to govern it by His own Legats, fill it with Titular Bishops of His
own creating, or send the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> to them in <hi>Cloak-Bag,</hi> as he did to <hi>Trent.</hi>
If joyntly, by all <hi>Christian</hi> Princes which is the Common <hi>Tenent</hi> of the <hi>Protestant;</hi>
Scholes: what Hopes could any man conceive (as the Times then were) that they
should lay aside their particular Interesses, to enter all together upon one design?
Or, if they had agreed about it, what Power had they to call the Prelats of the
<hi>East,</hi> to attend the Business, and to protect them for so doing at their going
home? So that I look upon the hopes of a <hi>General Council.</hi> I mean a <hi>General
Council</hi> rightly called, and constituted, as an empty Dream. The most, that was
to be expected, was but a meeting of some Bishops of the <hi>West</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi>
and those but of one Party onely: as such were excommunicated, (and that might
be as many as the <hi>Pope</hi> should please) being to be excluded by the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s
Rule. Which how it may be called an <hi>Oecumenical,</hi> or <hi>General Council,</hi> unless it be

but it was, either the Church must have contin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or else it must be lawfull for National particular Churches to Reform themselves.
And in that case the Church may be Reformed <hi>per partes,</hi> part after part; Province
after Province, as is said by <hi>Gerson.</hi> Further then which, I shall not enter into
this Dispute, this being enough to Justifie the Church of <hi>England</hi> from doing
any thing Unadvisedly, Unwarrantably, or without Example.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That which remains, in Reference to the Progress of the Reformation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns

                           </gap>, as were thought
fit to be retained, Determined and Concluded on, by an Act of</hi> Parliament; <hi>to
which the Bishops gave their Vote: but whether Predetermined in the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
must be left as doubtfull. In the Preamble to which Act, it is Declared;
That,</hi> At all times men are not so mindfull of performing those Publick Christian
Duties, which the true Religion doth require, as they ought to be; and therefore it hath
been wholesomly provided, that, for calling them to their Duties and for helping their
Infirmities, that some certain Times, and Days should be appointed, wherein Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
should cease from all other kinde of Labours, and apply themselves onely, and
wholely unto such Holy Works, as properly pertain to True Religion; that the said
Holy Works, to be performed upon those Days, are more particularly to hear, to
learn, and to remember Almighty God's great Benefits, his manifold Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, his inestimable Gracious Goodness, so plentifully poured upon all his
Creatures; rendring unto him for the same our most hearty thanks; That the
said Days, and Times, are neither to be called, or accounted <hi>Holy:</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Nature of the time, or day, nor for any of the Saints sakes, whose
Memories are preserved by them; but for the Nature, and Condition, of those God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and Holy Works, with which onely God is to be Honoured, and the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be Edified; That the Sanctifying of the said Days consisteth in separating
them apart from all prophane uses, and Dedicated not to any Saint, or Creature,
but onely to the Worship of God; That there is no certain time, nor definite number
of days appointed by Holy Scripture: but, that the appointment of the time, as
also of the days, is left to the Liberty of Christ His Church by the Word of God;
That the days, which from thenceforth were to be kept as Holy days in the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> should be all Sundays in the Year; the <hi>Feast</hi> of the <hi>Circumcision,</hi> the
<hi>Epiphany,</hi> the <hi>Purification</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> &amp;c. with all the rest, recited
at the end of the <hi>Calender,</hi> in the publick Liturgy; That the Arch-Bishops, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall have Authority to punish the Offenders, in all, or any of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses,
by the usual censures of the Church, and to impose such penance on them,
as to them, or any of them shall seem expedient; and finally, that, notwithstanding
any thing before declared, it shall, and may be lawfull, for any Husbandman, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer,
Fisherman, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to labour, ride, fish, or work any kind of work, on the foresaid
<hi>Holy days,</hi> not onely in the time of Harvest, but at any other time of the year, when
need shall require; with a <hi>Proviso</hi> for the Celebrating of St. <hi>Georg</hi>'s Feast, on the
two and twenty, three and twenty, and four and twentieth Days of <hi>April</hi> yearly, by
the Knights of the Right Honourable Order of the Garter, or by any of them.
<hi>Which Declaration, as it is agreeable in all points to the Tenour of approved
Antiquity; so can there nothing be more contrary to the Doctrine of the</hi> Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians,
<hi>Which of late time hath been Obtruded on the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Then for the number of the Fasts,</hi> It is Declared, that from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
every Even, or Day, going before any of the aforesaid Days of the Feasts
of the <hi>Nativity</hi> of Our Lord, of <hi>Easter,</hi> of the <hi>Ascension</hi> of our Lord, <hi>Pentecost.</hi>
of the <hi>Purification,</hi> and the <hi>Annunciation</hi> of the aforesaid Blessed <hi>Virgin;</hi> of <hi>All-Saints,</hi>
of all the said <hi>Feasts</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> (other then of St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist,</hi>
and of St. <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Jacob)</hi> shall be fasted, and Commanded to be kept,
and observed, and that none other Even, or Day, shall be Commanded to
be Fasted. For Explication of which last Clause, it is after added, that the said
Act, or any thing therein contained, shall not extend to abrogate, or take away the
Abstinence from Flesh in <hi>Lent,</hi> or on Fridays, and Saturdays: or any other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:66032:116"/>
pointed to be kept for a Fasting-Day, but onely on the Evens of such other
Days, as formerly had been kept, and observed for Holy, and were now abrogated
by this Act. And for the better suppressing, or preventing of any such Fasts,
as might be kept upon the Sunday, it was Enacted in the same (according to the
Practice of the Elder Times) that, when it shall chance any the said Feasts, (the
Eves whereof are by this Statute to be kept for Fasting-Days) to fall upon the
Munday; that then the Saturday next before shall be Fasted, as the Eve thereof,
and not the Sunday. <hi>Which Statute, though repealed in the first of Queen</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>and not revived till the first year of the Reign of King</hi> James: <hi>yet in Effect
it stood in Force, and was more punctually observed in the whole time of Queen</hi>
Elizabeth<hi>'s Reign, then after the Reviver of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such course being taken for the due observing of Days, and Times; the next
care was, that Consecrated Places should not be Prophaned by Fighting, and
Quarrelling, as they had been lately, since the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Jurisdiction, and
the Ancient Censures of the Church were lessened in Authority, and Reputation.
<hi>And to that end it was Enacted in this present</hi> Parliament, <hi>that if any Persons
whatsoever, after the first day of</hi> May <hi>then next following, should quarrel, chide,
or brawl, in any Church, or Church-yard, he should be suspended</hi> ab ingressu
Ecclesiae, <hi>if he were a</hi> Lay-man; <hi>and from his Ministration, if he were a Priest;
that if any Person after the said time should smite, or lay violent hands upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
he should be deemed to be</hi> Excommunicate, ipso facto, <hi>and be excluded
from the Fellowship, and Company of Christ's Congregation; and finally, that if any
Person should strike another with any weapon, in the Church, or Church-yard, or
draw his sword, with an intent to strike another with the same, and thereof be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
convicted, he should be punished with the loss of one of his Ears,</hi> &amp;c. A sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
severity, and much conducing to the Honour both of Church, and State.
There were some Statutes also made for taking away the benefit of Clergy in
some certain Cases; for making such, as formerly had been of any Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
to be Heritable to the Lands of their Ancestours, or next of Kindred, to
whom they were to have been Heirs by the Common Law; for Confirming the
Marriages of Priests, and giving them, their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ives, and Children, the like Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities,
as other Subjects did enjoy, whereof we have already spoke in another
place. There also passed another Act, <hi>that no Person, by any means, should
lend, or forbear any Sum of Mony, for any manner of Vsury, or encrease to be
received, or hoped for, above the sum lent, upon pain to for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and the encrease, and to suffer imprisonment, and make fine at the King's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</hi>
But this Act being found to be prejudicial to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

first discontinued of it self, and was afterwards repealed in the thirteenth year of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Parliament</hi> ending on the fifteenth of <hi>April</hi> gave time enough for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and Publishing the Book of Common-Prayer, which had been therein Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorised;
the time for the Officiating of it, being fixed on the Feast of <hi>All-Saints,</hi>
then next ensuing. Which time being come, there appeared no small Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the outward Solemnities of Divine Service, to which the people had been
formerly so long accustomed. For, by the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>brick of that Book, no Copes, or
other Vestures were required, but the Surplice onely; whereby the Bishops
were necessitated to forbear their Crosses, and the Prebends of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, and
other Churches, occasioned to leave off their Hoods. To give a beginning here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
Bishop <hi>Ridley,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>London</hi> (obediently conforming unto that,
which he could not hinder) did the same day Officiate the Divine Service of the
Morning in his Rochet onely, without Cope, or Vestment; he Preached also at
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Cross in the afternoon, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
in their best Liveries, being present at it; the Sermon tending for the most
part to the setting forth of the said Book of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> and to acquaint
them with the Reason of such Alterations, as were made therein. On the same
day the New Liturgie was executed also in all the Churches of <hi>London.</hi> And

                        </gap>e, where the Priest sang the Dayly Service. What
hereupon ensued of the Rich Ornaments, and Plate, wherewith every Church
was furnished after its proportion; we shall see shortly, when the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
shall be sent abroad to seise upon them in His Name, for their own
Commodity.</p>
                     <p>About this time the <hi>Psalms</hi> of <hi>David</hi> did first begin to be Composed in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Meeter,</hi> by one <hi>Thomas Sternhold,</hi> one of the Grooms of the Privy-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
who, Translating no more then thirty seven, left both Example, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to <hi>John Hopkins,</hi> and others, to dispatch the rest. A Device first
taken up in <hi>France,</hi> by one <hi>Clement Marot,</hi> one of the Grooms of the Bed-Chamber
to King <hi>Francis the First:</hi> who, being much addicted to Poetry, and
having some acquaintance with those, which were thought to have enclined to the
Reformation, was perswaded by the Learned <hi>Vatablus</hi> (Professour of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
Tongue in the University of <hi>Paris)</hi> to exercise his Poetical Fancies, in
Translating some of <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Psalms.</hi> For whose satisfaction, and his own, he
Translated the first fifty of them: and after, flying to <hi>Geneva,</hi> grew acquainted
with <hi>Beza</hi> who, in some tract of time, Translated the other hundred also; and
caused them to be fitted unto several Tunes; which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> hereupon began to be Sung
in private houses, and by degrees to be taken up in all the Churches of the
<hi>French,</hi> and other Nations, which followed the <hi>Genevian</hi> Plat-form. <hi>Marot</hi>'s
Translation said by <hi>Strada,</hi> to have been ignorantly, and perversely done: as
being but the Work of a man, altogether unlearned; but not to be compared
with that Barbarity, and Botching, which every where occurreth in the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Sternhold,</hi> and <hi>Hopkins.</hi> Which notwithstanding being first allowed
for private Devotion, they were by little, and little, brought into the use of the
Church: Permitted rather, then Allowed to be Sung before, and after Sermons;
afterwards Printed, and bound up with the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book,</hi> and at last ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Stationers at the end of the Bible. For, though it be expressed in the
Title of those Singing <hi>Psalms,</hi> that they were <hi>set forth, and allowed to be Sung
in all Churches; before, and after Morning, and Evening Prayer: and also before,
and after Sermons;</hi> yet, this Allowance seems rather to have been a Connivance,
then an Approbation: No such <hi>Allowance</hi> being any where found, by such as
have been most Industrious, and concerned in the search thereof. At first it
was, pretended onely that the said <hi>Psalms</hi> should be Sung <hi>before, and after Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Evening Prayer, and also before, and after Sermons:</hi> which shews,
they were not to be intermingled in the Publick Liturgie. But, in some tract of
time, as the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction grew in strength, and confidence, they prevailed
so far in most places, to thrust the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> the <hi>Benedictus,</hi> the <hi>Magnificat,</hi> and
the <hi>Nunc Dimittis,</hi> quite out of the Church. But of this more perhaps here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
when we shall come to the Discovery of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Practices, in the Times
succeeding.</p>
                     <p>Next to the business of Religion, that which took up a great part of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
Care, was the Founding, and Establishing of the new Hospital in the late dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
House of <hi>Grey-Friers,</hi> near <hi>New-gate,</hi> in the City of <hi>London;</hi> and that
of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in the Borough of <hi>So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

that the Church, belonging to the said House, together with the Cloysters, and
almost all the Publick Building, which stood within the Liberties, and Precincts
thereof, had the good Fortune to escape that Ruin, which Generally befell all
other Houses of that Nature. And standing undemolished, till the last Times
of King <hi>Henry,</hi> it was given by him, not many days before His Death, to the
City of <hi>London:</hi> together with the late dissolved Priory, called Little St. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew</hi>'s;
which, at the Suppression thereof, was valued at 305. pounds,
6. s. 7. d. In which Donation, there was Reference had to a Double End. The
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:66032:117"/>
one for the Relieving of the Poor, out of the Rents of such Messuages, and Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as in the Grant thereof are contained, and specified. The other for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting
a Parish-Church, in the Church of the said dissolved <hi>Grey-Friers:</hi> not
onely for the use of such, as lived within the Precincts of the said two Houses; but
for the Inhabitants of the Parishes of Saint <hi>Nicholas in the Shambles,</hi> and of Saint
<hi>Ewines,</hi> scituate in <hi>Warwick-Lane-end,</hi> near <hi>New-gate Market.</hi> Which Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
with all the Rents, and Profits, belonging to them, were given to the City at
the same time also, and for advancing the same ends, together with five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Marks by the year for ever; the Church of the <hi>Grey-Friers</hi> to be from
thenceforth called <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> Founded by King <hi>Henry the Eighth.</hi> All which
was signified to the City in a Sermon Preached at Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s-<hi>Cross,</hi> by the
Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> on the thirteenth of <hi>January;</hi> being no more then a
Fortnight before the death of the King: so that He wanted not the Prayers of
the Poor, at the Time of His Death, to serve as a Counter-Ballance for those
many Curses, which the poor Monks, and Friers had bestowed upon Him in the
Time of His Life.</p>
                     <p>In pursuance of this double Design, the Church of the said <hi>Friers</hi> (which
had before served as a Magazine, or Store-house for such <hi>French-Wines,</hi> as had
been taken by Reprise) was cleansed, and made fit for Holy uses, and <hi>Mass</hi> again
sang in it on the thirteenth day of <hi>January</hi> before remembred, resorted to by such
Parishioners as were appointed to it by the King's Donation. After which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
(in the first years of King <hi>Edward the Sixth)</hi> the taking down of the said
two Churches, and building several Tenements, on the Ground of the Churches,
and Church-Yards, the Rents thereof to be imployed for the further maintenance,
and Relief of the poor, living and loytering in, and about the City, to the great
Dishonour of the same. But neither the first Grant of the King, nor these new
Additions, being able to carry on the work to the end desired, it happened, that
Bishop <hi>Ridley,</hi> preaching before the King, did much insist upon the settling of
of some constant course for Relief of the Poor. Which Sermon wrought so
far upon Him, that He caused the Bishop to be sent for, gave him great Thanks
for his good Exhortation; and thereupon entred into Communication with him,
about the devising of some Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rse, by which so great, and good a Work
should be brought to pass. His Advice was, That Letters should be written to
the Lord Mayour, and Aldermen, for taking the Business into Consideration, in
Reference to such Poor, as swarmed in great numbers about the City. To which
the King so readily hearkened, that the Letters were dispatched, and Signed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
He would permit the Bishop to go out of His Presence. Furnished with
these Letters, and Instructions, the Bishop calls before him Sir <hi>Richard Dobbs,</hi>
then Lord Mayour of <hi>London,</hi> with so many Aldermen, as were thought fit to be
advised with in the present Business. By whom it was agreed upon, That a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Contribution should be made by all wealthy, and well-affected Citizens, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Advancement of a work so necessary for the publick good. For the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
whereof, they were all called to their Parish-Churches, where by the said
Lord Mayour, their several Aldermen, and other grave Citizens, they were by
Eloquent Orations, perswaded, how great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and how many Commodities, would
ensue unto them, and their City; if the Poor of divers sorts were taken from
out their Streets, Lanes, and Allyes, and were bestowed, and provided for in
several Hospitals. It was therefore moved, that every man would signifie what
they would grant, towards the preparing, and furnishing of such Hospitals, as
also, what they would contribute weekly towards their Maintenance untill they
were furnished with a more Liberal Endowment. Which Course prevailed so far
upon them, that every man subscribed, according to his Ability, and Books were
drawn in every Ward of the City, containing the Sum of that Relief: which
they had contributed. Which being delivered unto the Mayour, were by Him
humbly tendred to the King's Commissioners on the seventeenth of <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="129" facs="tcp:66032:117"/>
This good Foundation being lai'd, a Beginning was put to the Reparation of
the decayed Buildings, in the <hi>Gray-Friers,</hi> on the twenty sixth of <hi>July,</hi> for
the Reception of such poor, fatherless Children, as were then to be provided for
at the publick Charge. The like Reparation also made of the Ruinous Buildings
belonging to the late dissolved <hi>Priory</hi> of Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> in the Burough of <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark;</hi>
which the Citizens had then newly bought of the King, to serve for an
Hospital of such Wounded, Sick, and Impotent Persons, as were not fit to
be intermingled with the Sound. The Work so diligently followed in both
places at once, that on the twenty third of <hi>November,</hi> the sick and
maimed People were taken into the Hospital of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> and into <hi>Christ-Hospital</hi>
to the number of four hundred Children; all of them to have Meat,
Drink, Lodging, and Cloths, at the Charge of the City, till other means could
be provided for their future Maintainance.</p>
                     <p>And long it was not, before such further Means was provided for them, by
the Bounty, and Piety of the King; then drawing as near unto his End, as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was, when he lai'd the first Foundation of that Pious Work. For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>earing with
what chearfulness the Lord Major, and Aldermen, had conformed themselves to
the effect of His former Letters, and what a great advance they had made in the
Work, commanded them to attend Him on the tenth of <hi>April,</hi> gave them great
thanks for their Zeal, and forwardness, and gave for ever to the City his Palace
of <hi>Bridewel</hi> (erected by King <hi>Henry the Eight)</hi> to be employed as a relieving house
for such Vagabounds, and thriftless Poor, as should be sent thither to receive Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement,
and be forced to labour. For the better maintainance whereof, and the
more liberal Endowment of the other Hospitals before remembred, it was sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
to him; that the Hospital founded in the <hi>Savoy</hi> by King <hi>Henry the seventh,</hi>
for the Relief of Pilgrims, and Travellers, was lately made the Harbour, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Place for Loytere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s, Vagabonds, and Strumpets, who sunned themselves
in the Fields all Day, and at Night found entertainment there. The Master and
Brethren of the House are thereupon sent for to the King, who dealt so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and effectually with them, that they resigned the same into His Hands, with
all the Lands, and Goods thereunto belonging. Out of which He presently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
the Yearly Rent of Seven Hundred Marks, with all the Beds, Bedding, and
other Furniture, which he found therein, towards the maintainance of the said
Work-House, and the Hospital of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in <hi>Southwark.</hi> The Grant where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
He confirmed by His Letters Patents, bearing Date the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>June;</hi> adding
thereunto a <hi>Mort-Main</hi> for enabling the City to purchase Lands, to the value
of four thousand Marks <hi>per annum,</hi> for the better maintainance of those, and
the other Hospitals. So that by the Donation of <hi>Bridewel,</hi> which He never
built, and the suppression of the Hospital in the <hi>Savoy,</hi> which He never endowed,
He was entituled to the Foundation of <hi>Bridewel,</hi> St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s, and St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
without any charge unto himself.</p>
                     <p>But these last Passages concerning the Donation of <hi>Bridewel,</hi> the suppression
of the Hospital in the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Endowment of the said three Houses with
the Lands thereof, hapned not till the year ensuing, <hi>Anno</hi> 1553. though lai'd unto
the rest in the present Narrative, in regard of the Dependence, which it hath on
the former Story. Nothing else memorable in the course of this present Year,
but the coming of <hi>Cardanus,</hi> the death of <hi>Leland,</hi> and the preferment of Doctor
<hi>John Taylor</hi> to the See of <hi>Lincoln.</hi> The See made void by the death of Doctor
<hi>Henry Holbeach,</hi> about the beginning of <hi>August,</hi> in the former year, and kept
void, by some powerful men about the King, till the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> in the year now
present. At what time, the said Doctour <hi>Taylor,</hi> who before had been Dean of
that Church, was Consecrated Bishop of it. During which interval, the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of that great and wealthy Bishoprick (one of the richest in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom)
was so dismembred in it self, so parcelled, and marked out for a Prey to
others, that when the New Bishop was to be restored unto his Temporals, under
the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> (as the Custom is) there was none of all his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:66032:118"/>

so, that nothing was to be abated in his Tenths, and first-fruits, which were

Education in <hi>Christ</hi>'s Colledg in <hi>Cambridg.</hi> Being a man of great parts, and

time, as they lay under the fear of suppression. Which work as he performed

                     <p>But the main Engine at this time for advancing Money, was the speeding of a

upon all Hangings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Altar-Cloths, Fronts, Parafronts, Copes of all sorts, with all

To which Rapacity the demolishing of the fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

private men, contrary to his Majestie's express Commandment in that behalf, the

thereof: by whose default the same is, or hath been, or in whose hands any part of the
same is come. And in that point, the said Commissioners shall have good regard that
they attain to certain Names, and dwelling Places of every person, or persons, that
hath sold, alienated, embezelled, taken, or carryed away; or of such also, as have coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selled,

these things they shall as certainly, and duly, as they can, cause to be searched, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.</p>

three of them, shall cause to be called before them all such persons, by whom any of
the said Goods, Plate Jewels, Bells, Ornaments, or any other the Premises, have been
alienated, embezelled, and taken away; or by whose means, and procurement, the
same, or any part thereof hath been attempted, or to whose hands, or use, any of the
same, or any profit for the same hath grown. And by such means, as to their discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
shall seem best, cause them to bring into these the said Commissioners hands, to
Our use, the said Plate, Jewels, Bells, and other the Premises so alienated, for the
true and full value thereof: certifying unto Our Privy Council the Names of all
such as refuse to stand to, or obey their Order touching their delivery, or restitution
of the same, or the just value thereof. To the intent, that, as cause and reason shall
require, every man may answer to his doings in this behalf.</p>

to use in their Proceedings; to the end, that the effect of their Commission might go

as might be; using therein such wise perswasions, as in respect of the place,
and disposition of the People, may seem to their Wisdoms most expedient: yet so, that
they take care for giving good and substantial Order to stay the inordinate and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Covetousness of such disordered People, as should go about to alienate any of the
Premises; or otherwise to let them know, that according to Reason, and Order, such
as have, or should contemptuously offend in that behalf, should receive such punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as to the quality of their doing should be thought most requisite.</p>
                     <p>Such were the Faculties, and Instructions, wherewith the Kings Commissioners
were impowered and furnished. And doubt we not, but that they were as pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
and exact in the execution: which cannot better be discerned, then by that,
which is reported of their doings generally in all parts of the Realm, and more
particularly in the Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Westminster,</hi> more richly furnished, by
reason of the Pomps of Coronations, Funerals, and such like Solemnities, then
any other in the Kingdome. Concerning which I find, in an old Chapter-Book
belonging to it, that on <hi>May</hi> the 9. 1553. Sir <hi>Roger Cholmley</hi> Knight, Lord
Chief Justice, and Sir <hi>Robert Bowes</hi> Knight, Master of the Rolls, the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,
for gathering Ecclesiastical Goods, held their Session at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
and called before them the Dean of that Cathedral, and certain others of the
same House, and commanded them, by virtue of their Commission, to bring
to them a true Inventory of all the Plate, Cups, Vestiments, and other Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

                        </gap>, which belonged to their Church. Which done, the Twelfth Day of
the same Moneth, they sent <hi>John Hodges, Robert Smalwood,</hi> and <hi>Edmund Best,</hi> of
the City of <hi>Westminster,</hi> (whom the said Commissioners had made their
Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours)
with a Commandment to the Dean and Chapter, for the delivery of the
said Goods; which were by <hi>Robert Crome</hi> Clerk, Sexton of the said Church, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to the said Collectors, who left no more unto the Church, then two Cups,

with the Covers all gilt; One white Silver Pot, Three Herse-Cloths, Twelve
Cushions, One Carpet for the Table, Eight Stall-Cloths for the Quite, Three
Pulpit-Cloths, Nine little Carpets for the Dean's Stall, Two Table-Cloths: the
rest of all the rich Furniture, massie Plate, and whatsoever else was of any value,
(which questionless must needs amount to a very great Sum) was seized on
by the said Collect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>urs, and clearly carryed away by Order, from the said Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners.
The l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Commissioners began their Circuits in the Moneth of <hi>April,</hi> as soon as the
ways were open, and fit for Travail. Their business was to seize upon all the
Goods remaining in any Cathedral, or Parish-Churches, all Jewels of Gold, and
Silver, Crosses, Candlesticks, Censers, Chalices, and such like; with their ready
Money: As also, all Copes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Vestments of Cloth of Gold, Tyssue, and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
together with all other Copes, Vestments, and Ornaments, to the same be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing.
Which general seizure being made, they were to leave one Chalice,

Commissioners should think fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But notwithstanding this great Care of the King on the one side, and the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-diligence
of his Commissioners on the other, the Booty did not prove so
great, as the Expectation. In all great Fairs, and Markets, there are some <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stallers,</hi>

and most gainful Commodities to be openly sold. And so it fared also in the
present Business, there being some, who were as much before-hand with the
King's Commissioners in embezelling the said Plate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Jewels, and other Furnitures,
as the Commissioners did intend to be with the King, in keeping always most
part unto themselves. For when the Commissioners came to execute their
Powers in their several Circuits, they neither could discover all, or recover
much of that, which had been pur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who had so cunningly carryed the stealth, that there was no tracing of their

raised to the King's Exchequer; yet the far greatest part of the Prey came to
other hands: Insomuch, that many private men's Parlours were hung with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar-Cloths,

But as the King was plunged in Debt, without being put to any extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Charges in it, so was He decayed in his Revenue, without selling any part of
His Crown Lands towards the payment of His Debts. By the suppressing of
some, and the surrendring of other Religious Houses, the Royal <hi>Intrado</hi> was so
much increased in the late King's time; that, for the better managing of it, the
King erected first the Court of <hi>Augmentation,</hi> and afterwards the Court of
<hi>Surveyours.</hi> But in short time, by His own Profuseness, and the Avaritious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this King's Ministers, it was so retrenched, that it was scarce able to
finde Work enough for the Court of <hi>Exchequer.</hi> Hereupon followed the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
of the said two Courts in the last Parliament of this King, beginning on
the first, and ending on the last day of <hi>March.</hi> Which, as it made a loud noise
in the Ears of the People, so did it put this Jealousie into their Minds. That, if
the King's Lands should be thus daily wasted without any recruit, He must at
last prove burthensom to the common Subject. Some course is therefore to
be thought on, which might pretend to an increase of the King's Revenue, and
none more easie to be compassed, then to begin with the suppression of such Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks,
and Collegiate Churches, as either lay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

spared. In reference whereunto, it was concluded, in a Chapter held at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
by the Knights of the Garter, That from thenceforth the said most noble
Order of the <hi>Garter</hi> should be no longer ent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tuled by the Name of St. <hi>George,</hi>
but that it should be called the <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>der of the Garter</hi> onely; and that the Feast of
the said Order should be celebrated upon <hi>Whitson-Eve, Whitson-day,</hi> and <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son-Monday,</hi>
and not on St. <hi>George</hi>'s day, as before it was. And to what end
was this concluded; and what else was to follow upon this Conclusion, but the
dissolving of the Free-Chapel of St. <hi>George</hi> in the Castle of <hi>Windsor,</hi> and the
transferring of the Order to the Chapel of King <hi>HENRY</hi> the Seventh, in
the Abbey of <hi>Westminster?</hi> Which had undoubtedly been done, and all the Lands
thereof converted to some powerful Courtiers, under pretence of laying them
to the Crown, if the King's Death, which happened within four Moneths after,
had not prevented the Design, and thereby respited that Ruin, which was then
intended.</p>
                     <p>The like preservation happened, at the same time also, in the Church of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
as liberally endowed as the most, and more amply priviledged, then the
best in the King's Dominions. The Bishops hereof by Charter, and long Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
enjoyed and exercised all the Rights of a <hi>County Palatine</hi> in that
large Tract of Ground, which lyes between the <hi>Tees,</hi> and the <hi>Tine,</hi> best known
in those Parts by the Name of the <hi>Bishoprick;</hi> the Diocess containing also all
<hi>Northumberland,</hi> of which the Bishops, and the <hi>Percies,</hi> had the greatest
shares. No sooner was Bishop <hi>Tonstal</hi> committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> which was
on the Twentieth of <hi>December,</hi> 1551. but presently an Eye was cast upon his
Possessions. Which, questionless, had followed the same fortune with the rest of
the Bishopricks, if one, more powerful then the rest, had not preserved it from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
parcelled out as the others were, on a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>rong Confidence of getting it all unto
himself. The Family of the <hi>Percies</hi> was then reduced to such a point, that it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have been quite expired; a Family which first came in with the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Conquerour, by whom enriched with most of the forfeited Estates of
<hi>Morchar, Gospatrick,</hi> and <hi>Waltheof,</hi> the three last Earls of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Race. But, this Line ending in the latter times of King
<hi>HENRY</hi> the First, <hi>Josseline</hi> of <hi>Lorain,</hi> descended from the Emperour
<hi>CHARLES</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> and one of the younger Brothers of <hi>Adeliza,</hi> the
last Wife of the King, enrich'd himself by Marriage with the Heir-General of this
House, upon condition, that keeping to himself the <hi>Arms</hi> of his own <hi>Family,</hi> he
should assume the Name of <hi>Percy,</hi> to remain always afterward unto his Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Advanced in that respect, by the Power and Favour of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:66032:121"/>
the Rank and Title of the Earls of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> at the Coronation of
King <hi>Richard the Second.</hi> They held the same with great Power, and Honour,
(the short interposing of the Marquess <hi>Mountacute</hi> excepted onely) till toward
the latter end of King <hi>Henry the Eighth.</hi> At what time it happened<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
Lord <hi>Peircy,</hi> the sixth Earl of this House, had incurred the heavy displeasure
of that King: First, for an old affection to the Lady <hi>Ann Bollein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> when the
King began first to be enamoured of her excellent Beauties; and afterwards for
denying to confess a Precontract to have been formerly made between them;
when the King (now as weary of her, as before he was fond) was
seeking some fair Pretences to divorce himself from her, before she was to lose
her Head. He had no Children of his own; and <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>mas</hi> his Brother, and next
Heir, was, to his greater grief, attainted of Treason, for being thought to have a
chief hand i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the <hi>Northern</hi> Rebellion, <hi>Anno</hi> 1536. In both respects, he found
himself at such a loss, and the whole Family without hope of a Restitution to its
antient splendour; that, to preserve himself from running into further danger, he
gave unto the King the greatest part of that fair Inheritance; and, dying not
long after, left his Titles also to the King's disposing.</p>
                     <p>The Lands, and Titles, being thus fallen into the Crown, continued undisposed
of, till the falling of the Duke of <hi>Somerset;</hi> when <hi>Dudley,</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
some projections in his Head beyond the greatness of a Subject<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> advanced
himself unto the Title of Duke of <hi>Northumberland;</hi> not doubting, but he should
be able to possess himself in short time also of all the Land<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of that Family, which
were then remaining in the Crown. To which Estate, the Bishoprick of <hi>Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ham,</hi>
and all the Lands belonging to it, could not but be beheld as a fair Addition,
if at the least it might be called an addition, which was of more value, then the
Patrimony, to which it was to have been added.</p>
                     <p>He had long Reigned without a Crown, suffering the King for some years
to enjoy that Title, which was to be transferred (if all Contrivances had held
good) upon one of his Sons, whom He designed in Marriage to the eldest Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the House of <hi>Suffolk.</hi> And then how easie was it for him, having a King
of his own begetting, a Queen of his own making, the Lords of the Council at
his beck, and a Parliament to serve his turn for all occasions, to incorporate both
the Lands of the <hi>Peircies,</hi> and the <hi>Patrimony</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi> into one Estate,
with all the Rights, and Privileges of a <hi>County Palatine. Count Palatine</hi> of
<hi>Durham,</hi> Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> or what else he pleased, must be
the least he could have aimed at, in that happy Conjuncture; happy to him, had
the Even been answerable unto his Projections; but miserable enough to all
the rest of the Kingdom, who should not servilely submit to this Glorious Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>start.
Upon which Grounds, as the Bishoprick of <hi>Durham</hi> was dissolved by
<hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> under pretence of patching up the King's Revenue; so the
greatest part of the Lands thereof had been kept together, that they might serve
for a Revenue to the future <hi>Palatine.</hi> But all these Projects failing in the death of
the King, and his own Attaindure, not long after the <hi>Peircies</hi> were restored by
Queen <hi>Mary</hi> to their Lands, and Honours, as the Bishop was unto his Liberty,
and to most of his Lands; it being almost impossible, that such a fair Estate should
fall into the hands of the Courtiers, and no part of it be left sticking in those
Glutinous Fingers.</p>
                     <p>For to begin the Year withall, the King was taken with a very strong Cough
in the Moneth of <hi>January,</hi> which at last ended in a Consumption of the Lungs;
the Seeds of which Malignity were generally supposed to have been sown in the
last Summer's Progress, by some over-heatings of himself in his Sports, and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises.
But they, that looked more narrowly into the matter, observed some kind
of decayings in him from the time that Sir <hi>Robert Dudley<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> the third Son of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi>
was admitted into a place of ordinary attendance about his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
which was on the same Day, when his Father was created <hi>Duke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:66032:121"/>
most men gave themselves no improbable hopes, that betwixt the Spring
time of his life, the Growing season of the year, and such Medicinal applications
as were made unto him, the disease would wear it self away, by little and little,
yet they found the contrary. It rather grew so fast upon him, that when
the Parliament was to begin on the first of <hi>March,</hi> the Lords Spiritual and
Temporal, were Commanded to attend him at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> instead of waiting
on him from thence to <hi>Westminster,</hi> in the usual manner. Where being come,
they found a Sermon ready for them <hi>(the Preacher being the Bishop of London)</hi>
which otherwise was to have been Preached in the <hi>Abby-Church;</hi> and the
Great Chamber of the Court accomodated for an House of <hi>Peers</hi> to begin the
Session. For the opening whereof, the King then sitting under the Cloth of
State, and all the Lords, according to their Ranks, and Orders, he declared by
the Lord Chancellor <hi>Goodrick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> the causes of his calling them to the present Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and so dismist them for that time. A Parliament which began, and ended
in the Month of <hi>March,</hi> that the Commissions might the sooner be dispatched
to their several Circuits, for the speedier gathering up of such of the Plate, Copes,
Vestments, and other Furnitures, of which the Church was to be spoyled, in
the time of his sickness,</p>
                     <p>Yet in the midst of these disorders there was some care taken for advancing
both the honour and the interest of the <hi>English</hi>-Nation, by furnishing <hi>Sebastian
Cabol</hi> for some new discoveries. Which <hi>Sebastian,</hi> the Son of <hi>John Cabol</hi> a <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
born, attended on his first imployment under <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, <hi>Anno</hi>
1497. At what time they discovered the <hi>Barralaos,</hi> and the Coasts of <hi>Caena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da:</hi>
now called <hi>New-France,</hi> even to the 67½. degree of <hi>Northern</hi> Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
Bending his Course more toward the <hi>South,</hi> and discovering a great
part of the shoars of <hi>Florida,</hi> he returned for <hi>England;</hi> bringing with him
three of the <hi>Natives</hi> of that Country, to which the name of <hi>New-Found-Land</hi>
hath been since appropriated. But finding the <hi>KING</hi> unhappily Embroyled in a
War with <hi>Scotland,</hi> and no present Encouragements to be given for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Voiage, he betook himself into the service of the <hi>KING</hi> of <hi>SPAIN,</hi>
and after fourty years and more, upon some distast, abandoned <hi>SPAIN,</hi> and
offered his service to this <hi>KING.</hi> By whom, being made <hi>Grand Pilot of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
in the year 1549. he animated the <hi>English-Merchants,</hi> to the finding
out of a passage by the <hi>North-East Seas</hi> to <hi>Cathay,</hi> and <hi>China;</hi> first enterprised
under the Conduct of Sr. <hi>Hugh Willoughby,</hi> who unfortunately Perished in the
Action; himself, and all his Company, being Frozen to Death (all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
of his Voiage being since committed to Writing) as was certified by the
Adventures in the year next following. It was upon the twentith of <hi>May</hi> in this
present year that this Voiage was first undertaken, three great Ships being well
manned, and fitted for the Expedition; which afterwards was followed by <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celour,
Burrought, Jackman, Jenkinson,</hi> and other noble Adventurers, in the times
Succeding. Who though they failed of their Attempt in finding out a shorter
way to <hi>Cathay,</hi> and <hi>China;</hi> yet did they open a fair Passage to the <hi>Bay</hi> of S.
<hi>Nicholas,</hi> and thereby layd the first foundation of a Wealthy Trade betwixt
us, and the <hi>Muscovites.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the <hi>KING'S</hi> Sickness still encreasing, who was to live no longer then
might well stand with the designs of the <hi>DVKE of Northumber-land;</hi> some
Marriages are resolved on, for the Daughters of the <hi>DVKE of Suffolk,</hi> in
which the <hi>KING</hi> appeared as forward, as if he had been one of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palls
in the Plot against him. And so the matter was Contrived, that the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
IANE</hi> the eldest Daughter to that <hi>DVKE,</hi> should be Married to the
Lord <hi>Guilford Dudly,</hi> the fourth Son (then living) of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> all the
three Elder Sons having Wives before, that <hi>Katherine</hi> the second Daughter of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:66032:122"/>
                        <hi>Suffolk,</hi> should be Married to the Lord <hi>Henry Herbert,</hi> the Eldest Son of the
Earl of <hi>Pembrock,</hi> whom <hi>Dudly</hi> had made privy to all his Counsels; and the
third Daughter, named <hi>Mary,</hi> being Crook-Backed, and otherwise not very
taking, affianced to <hi>Martin Keys,</hi> the <hi>KING'S</hi> Gentleman-Porter. Which
Marriages together with that of the Lady <hi>Katherine,</hi> one of the Daughters
of Duke <hi>Dudly,</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Hastings,</hi> Eldest Son of the Earl of <hi>Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
were celebrated in the end of <hi>May,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>June</hi> (for I finde
our Writers differing in the time thereof) with as much Splendour and solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
as the <hi>KING'S</hi> weak Estate, and the sad Condition of the <hi>Court</hi> could
be thought to bear. These Marriages all solemnized at <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Strand,</hi> of which <hi>Northumberland</hi> had then took possession in the name of the
Rest, upon a Confidence of being Master very shortly of the whole Estate. The
noise of these Marriages bred such Amazement in the Hearts of the common
People, apt enough in themselves to speak the worst of <hi>Northumberland</hi>'s A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
That there was nothing left unsaid, which might serve to shew their
hatred against him, or express their Pity toward the <hi>KING.</hi> But the <hi>DVKE</hi>
was so little troubled at it, that on the contrary he resolved to Dissemble no
longer, but openly to play his Game, according to the Plot and Project; which
he had been Hammering ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ince the Fall of the <hi>DVKE of Somerset,</hi> whose
Death he had Contrived on no other Ground, but for laying the way more
plain, and open to these vast ambitions.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>KING</hi> was now grown weak in Body, and his Spirits much decaied by
a languishing Sickness; which Rendred him more apprehensive of such fears
and Dangers, as were to be presented to him, then otherwise he could have been
in a time of strength.</p>
                     <p>In which Estate, Duke <hi>Dudly</hi> so prevailed upon him, that he con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ented at
the last to a transposition of the Crown from his natural sisters, to the Children
of the Dutchess of <hi>Suffolk;</hi> Confirming it by Letters Patents, to the Heirs
Males of the Body of the said Dutchess. And for want of such Heirs Males to
be Born in the lifetime of the <hi>KING,</hi> the Crown immediately to descend
on the Lady <hi>IANE</hi> (the eldest Daughter of that House) and the Heirs of her
Body, and so with several Remainders, to the rest of that Family. The carriage
of which Business, and the Rubs it met with in the way, shall be reserved to
the particular story of the Lady <hi>IANE</hi> when she is brought unwilling upon
the Stage, there on to Act the part of a Queen of <hi>England.</hi> It sufficeth
in this place to note, that the <hi>KING</hi> had no sooner caused these Leters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
to passe the Seal, but his Weakeness more visibly encreased, then it did
before. And as the <hi>KING'S</hi> Weakeness did encrease, so did the <hi>DVKE of
Northumberland</hi>'s Diligence about him; for he was little absent from him,
and had alwaies some well-assured, to Epy how the State of his Health
changed every Hour; And the more joyful he was at the Heart, the more
Sorrowful appearance did he outwardly Make. Whither any tokens of
Poyson did Appear, reports are various. Certainly his Physicians discerned
an invincible Malignity, in his disease; and the Suspicion did the more
encrease, for that the Complaint proceded chiefly from the Lights; a part, as of
no quickness, so no seat for any sharp Disease. The Bruit whereof being
got amongst the People, they break out into immoderate Passions; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
that, for this cause, his two Uncles had been taken away; that
for this cause the most Faithful of his Nobility, and of his Council
were disgraced, and removed from Court; that this was the reason why
such were placed next his Person, who were most assuredly disposed, either
to commit,. or permit, any Mischeif; that now it did appear, that it was
not vainly conjectured some years before, by Men of Judgment and Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:66032:122"/>
that after <hi>Sommerset's</hi> Death the King should not long Enjoy his Life.
But the <hi>DVKE</hi> regarded not much the muttering Multitude, knowing full
well, that Rumours grow Stale, and Vanish with Time; and yet, somewhat
to abate, or Delay them for the present, He caused speeches <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o be spread abroad
that the <hi>KING</hi> began to be in a Recovery of his Health, which was the
more readily Beleived, because most desired it to be true. To which Report
the General Jugdment of his Physicians gave no little Countenance, by whom
it was affirmed, that they saw some hopes of his Recovery, if he might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
to a Better, and more Healthful Air. But this, <hi>DVKE Dudly</hi> did not
like of, and therefore he so dealt with the <hi>LORDS</hi> of the Council, that they
would by no means yield unto it, upon pretense of his Inability to endure any
such Remove.</p>
                     <p>And now, the time being near at hand, for the last Act of this Tragedy,
a certain Gentlewoman, accounted a fit Instrument for the purpose, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her Service for the Cure; giving no small assurance of it, if He might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
wholy to her disposing. But from this Proposition the <hi>KING'S</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
shewed themselves to be very averse, in regard, that as she could give
no reason, either of the nature of the Disease, or of the part afflicted; so
she would not declare the means, whereby she intended to work the Cure.
Whose Opposition notwithstanding, it was in time resolved by the Lords of the
Council, that the Physicians should be discharged, and the Ordering of
the King's Person committed unto her alone. But she had not kept Him long
in hand, when He was found to have fallen into such Desperate Extremity,
as manifestly might Declare, that His Death was hastened, under pretense of
finding out a more quick way for restoring of His Health. For now it vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
appeared, that His Vital Parts were mortally stuffed. Which brought
Him to a difficulty of speech, and breathing; that His Legs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> swelled, his Pulse
failed, and his Skin changed colour; with many other horrid Symptoms of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
Death. Which being observed, the Physicians were again sent for,
when it was too late; and sent for (as they gave it out) but for Fashion
onely; because it was not thought fit in Reason of State, that a King
should by, without having some Physicians in attendance of him, by some
of which it was secretly whispered. That neither their Advice nor Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
had been at all regarded in the course of his Sickness, That the King
had been ill dealt with, more then once, or twice; and that, when by the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
both of his Youth, and of careful Means, there were some fair hopes of
his Recovery, He was again more strongly Over-laied then ever. And
for a farther proof, that some undue Practises had been used upon him, it is
Affirmed by a Writer of the <hi>Popish</hi> Party, who could have no great cause
to pity such a Calamitous End, not onely that the Apothecary, who poysoned
him, as well for the Horrour of the Offence, as the Disquietness of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
did not long after drown himself; but that the Landress, who
washed his Shirts, lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the suspicion had been raised upon any good Grounds, For it may easily

the Death of her Brother.</p>

King's forwardness in the Cause of the Lady <hi>Jane;</hi> His rendring Her uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:66032:123"/>
as much as in Him was, to succeed in the Crown; and leaving Her in the
Estate of <hi>Illegitimation,</hi> were thought to have enough in them of a <hi>Supersedeas</hi>
unto all Good Nature. So that the King might dye by such sinister Practises,
without putting Queen <hi>MARY</hi> to the trouble of enquiring after them; who
thought Her Self to have no Reason of being too sollicitous in searching out
the secret Causes of His Death, who had been so injurious to Her in the time of
His Life. A Life, which lasted little, and was full of trouble; so that Death could
not be unwelcome to Him, when the hopes of His Recovery began to fail Him.
Of which if He desired a Restitution, it was rather for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Church's sake, then
for His own. His dying Prayers not so much aiming at the prolonging of His
Life, as the Continuance of Religion: Not so much at the freeing of Himself
from His Disease, as the preserving of the Church from the danger of <hi>Popery.</hi>
Which dying Prayer, as it was taken from His Mouth, was in these words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:</p>
                     <p>Lord God, deliver me out of this miserable, and wretched life, and take me among
thy Chosen. Howbeit, not my Will, but Thine be done. Lord, I commit my Spirit
to Thee. O Lord, Thou knowest, how happy it were for Me, to be with Thee:
Yet, for thy Chosen's sake, send me Life, and Health, that I may truly se ve Thee.
Oh my Lord God! bless my People, and save Thine Inheritance. O Lord God, save
thy Chosen People of <hi>England.</hi> Oh Lord God! defend this Realm from <hi>Papistry,</hi>
and maintain thy true Religion, that I, and my People, may praise thy Holy Name,
for Jesus Christ his sake.</p>
                     <p>With this Prayer, and other Holy Meditations, He prepared that Pious Soul
for God; which He surrendred into the Hands of His Creatout, on the sixth of
<hi>July,</hi> toward Night, when He had lived fifteen Years, eight Moneths, and four
and twenty Days: Of which, He had Reigned six Years, five Moneths, and eight
Days over. His Body, kept a while at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> was, on the eight of <hi>August,</hi>

in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, according to the <hi>Reformation,</hi> which was made in
the time of His Life; so the whole Service of the Day, together with the Form

Tongue, (according to the same Model) on the Day of his Obsequies. But whilest
these things were Acting on the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

where She caused a Solemn <hi>Dirige,</hi> in the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue, to be Chanted in
the Afternoon; and, the next Day, a Mass of <hi>Requiem,</hi> to be sung for the good
of His Sonl: At which, both She, and many of Her Ladies, made their accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
Offerings, according to the Form, and Manner of the Church of

                     <p>Such was the Life, and such the Death of this Excellent Prince, whose Character
I shall not borrow from any of our own <hi>English</hi> Writers, who may be thought
to have been byassed by their own Affections, in speaking more, or less, of Him,
then He had deserved. But I shall speak Him in the words of that Great Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
<hi>Hierome Cardanus,</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> born; and, who professing the Religion
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> cannot be rationally accused of Partiality in his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter

There was in Him <hi>(saith he)</hi> a towardly Disposition, and pregnancie, apt to
all Humane Literature: as who, being yet a Childe, had the knowledg of divers
Tongues: First, of the <hi>English,</hi> His own Natural Tongue; of the <hi>Latine</hi> also,
and of the <hi>French:</hi> Neither was He ignorant (as I hear) of the <hi>Greek, Italian,</hi>

in the <hi>French,</hi> and in the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue, singularly perfect; and, with the like fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility,
apt to receive all other. Neither was He ignorant in <hi>Logick,</hi> in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples

                     </p>
                     <p>As for the manner of His Death, the same Philosopher leaves it under a
suspicion, of being like to fall upon Him, by some dangerous Practise. For, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
He divined it by his ART in <hi>Astrologie</hi> (having Calculated the
Scheme of His Nativity) or apprehended it by the Course, and Carriage of
Business, he made a dangerous Prediction; when he fore-saw, that the
KING should shortly dye a violent Death; and (as he reporteth) fled
out of the Kingdom, for fear of further danger, which might follow on
it.</p>
                     <p>Of any Publick Works of Piety, in the Reign of this KING, more
then the Founding and Endowing of the Hospitals before-remembred, I finde
no mention in our Authours; which cannot be affirmed of the Reign of any
of His Predecessours, since their first receiving of the Gospel. But their
Times were for building up, and His unfortunate Reign was for pulling down.
Howsoever, I finde His Name remembred amongst the Benefactours to the
University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and, by that Name, required to be commemorated in
all the Prayers before such Sermons; as were Preached ordinarily by
any of that Body, in Saint <hi>Marie</hi>'s Church, or at Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Cross,</hi> or
finally in the <hi>Spittle</hi> without <hi>Bishops-Gate,</hi> on some solemn Festivals. But,
possibly it is, that his Beneficence did extend no further, then either to
the Confirmation of such Endowments, as had been made unto that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
by King <hi>Henry the Eight,</hi> or, to the excepting of all Colleges
in that, and the other University, out of the <hi>Statute,</hi> or <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
by which all Chantries, Colleges, and Free-Chapels, were confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

Chantries, Colleges, Free-Chapels to King <hi>Henry the Eight,</hi> strook
such a Terrour unto the Students of both Universities, that they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
think themselves secure, till the Expiring of that Statute by the
Death of the King; notwithstanding a very Pious and Judicious Letter,
which had been written to the King in that behalf, by Doctour <hi>Richard

                     <p>But, not to leave this Reign, without the Testimony of some Work
of Piety, I cannot but remember the Foundation of the Hospital of <hi>Christ</hi>
in <hi>Abindon,</hi> as a Work, not onely of this Time, but the King's own
<hi>Act.</hi> A <hi>Guild,</hi> or <hi>Brother-hood,</hi> had been there founded in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish-Church
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:66032:124"/>
of Saint <hi>Hellens,</hi> during the Reign of King <hi>Henry the Sixth,</hi>
by the procurement of one Sir <hi>John Gollafrie</hi> (a near Neighbouring Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman)
for Building, and Repairing certain Bridges, and High-waies, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Town; as also, for the Sustenance, and Relief of thirteen poor
People, with two, or more Priests, for performing all Divine Offices,
unto those of the <hi>Brother-hood.</hi> Which being brought within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of the <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament, by which all Chantries, Colleges, and
Free-Chappels, were conferred on the Crown: the Lands hereof were
seized on, to the use of the King; the Repairing of the Waies, and
Bridges, turned upon the Town, and the Poor left Destitute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
of all Relief. In which Condition it remained, till the last Year of the
King, when it was moved by Sir <hi>John Mason,</hi> one of the <hi>Masters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests</hi>
(a Town-born Childe, and one of the poorest mens Children in it)
to erect an Hospital in the same, and to Endow it with such of the
Lands, belonging to the former <hi>Brother-hood,</hi> as remained in the <hi>Crown,</hi>
and to charge it with the Services, and Pious Uses, which were before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
on the old Fraternity. The Suitour was too powerfull to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed,
and the Work too Charitable in it self to be long demurr'd on, so that
he was easily made <hi>Master</hi> also of this <hi>Request.</hi> Having obtained the King's
Consent, he caused a handsome Pile of Building to be Erected near the
Church, distributed into several Lodgings, for the Use of the Poor, and
one convenient Common-Hall, for dispatch of Business: to which he lai'd
such Farms, and Tenements in the Town, and elsewhere, as had been

Declared for His next Successour, was Eldest Daughter
of <hi>HENRY</hi> Lord <hi>GRAY,</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess
<hi>Dorset,</hi> descended from <hi>THOMAS</hi> Lord <hi>GRAY,</hi>
Marquess <hi>Dorset,</hi> the Eldest Son of Queen <hi>ELIZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BETH,</hi>
the onely Wife of <hi>EDWARD the Fourth,</hi> by
Sir <hi>IOHN GRAY,</hi> Her former Husband. Her Mother
was the Lady <hi>Frances</hi>'s Daughter; and in fine, one of the
Co-Heirs of <hi>Charls Brandon,</hi> the late Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi>
by <hi>Mary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> His Wife, Queen <hi>Dowager</hi> to <hi>Lewis the Twelfth</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and
youngest Daughter of King <hi>HENRY the Seventh,</hi> Grandfather to King <hi>ED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WARD</hi>
now Deceased. Her High Descent, and the great Care of King <hi>HEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY
the Eighth,</hi> to see Her happily, and well bestowed in Marriage, Commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Her unto the Bed of <hi>Henry,</hi> Lord Marquess <hi>Dorset,</hi> before-remembred; A
man of known Nobility, and of Large Revenues; possess'd not onely of the
Patrimony of the <hi>Grays</hi> of <hi>Groby,</hi> but of the whole Estate of the Lord <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington,</hi>
                        <pb n="148" facs="tcp:66032:127"/>
and <hi>Bonvile:</hi> which descended on him in the Right of his Grand-Mother,
the Wife of the first Marquess of <hi>Dorset,</hi> of this Name, and Family. And it is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to be doubted, but that the Fortunes of the House had been much increased,
by the especial Providence, and Bounty of the said Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be supposed to have neglected any Advantage, in the Times of Her Glory,
and Prosperity, for the Advancement of Her Children by Her former Husband.
In these Respects, more then for any Personal Abilities, which he had in himself,
he held a very fair Esteem amongst the Peers of the Realm: rather Beloved, then
Reverenced by the Common People. For, as he had few Commendable Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which might produce any High Opinion of his Parts, and Merit: so was
he guilty of no Vices, which might blunt the Edg of that Affection in the
Vulgar sort; which commonly is born to Persons of that Eminent Rank. His
W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>fe, as of an Higher Birth, was of greater Spirit: but one, that could accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
it to the will of Her Husband. Pretermitted in the Succession to
the Crown, by the last Will, and Testament of King <hi>Henry the Eighth:</hi>
not out of any Disrespect, which that King had of Her; but, because he was
not willing to think it probable, that either She, or the Lady <hi>Ellanor,</hi> Her
younger Sister, (whom he had pretermitted also in that Designation) could
live so long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to Survive His own three Children, and such, as, in the course of
Nature, should be issued from them.</p>
                     <p>Of this Marriage there were born three Daughters, that is to say, <hi>Jane, Katha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi>
and <hi>Mary.</hi> Of which, the Eldest, being but some Moneths older then the late
King <hi>Edward,</hi> may be presumed to have took the name of <hi>Jane,</hi> from the Queen
<hi>Jane Seimour;</hi> as <hi>Katharine,</hi> from Queen <hi>Katharine Howard,</hi> or Queen <hi>Katharine
Parr;</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> from the Princess <hi>Mary,</hi> the eldest Daughter of King <hi>Henry,</hi> or
in Relation to Her Grand-Mother, His youngest Sister. But the great Glory of
this Family was the Lady <hi>Jane,</hi> who seemed to have been born with those At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions,
which seat a Sovereignty in the face of most beautifull Persons; yet
was Her mind endued with more Excellent Charms, then the Attractions of
Her face: Modest, and Mild of Disposition, Courteous of Carriage, and of such
Affable Deportment, as might Entitle Her to the Name of <hi>Queen of Hearts,</hi>
before She was Designed for Queen over any Subjects. Which Native, and
Obliging Graces, were accompanied with some more profitable ones, of Her
own Acquiring; which set an higher Valew on them, and much encreased the
same, both in Worth, and Lustre. Having attained unto that Age, in which
other young Ladies used to apply themselves, to the Sports, and Exercises of
their Sex: She wholly gave Her mind to good Arts, and Sciences; much further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in that pursuit, by the care, and diligence of one Mr. <hi>Elmer,</hi> who was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for Her Tutour; the same (if my Conjecture deceive me not) who
afterwards was deservedly Advanced, by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to the See of <hi>London.</hi>
Under his charge She came to such a large Proficiency, that She spake the <hi>Latine,</hi>
and <hi>Greek</hi> Tongues, with as sweet a fluency, as if they had been Natural, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to Her; Exactly skilled in the Liberal Sciences, and perfectly well Studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in both kinds of Philosophy.</p>
                     <p>For Proof whereof, there goes a Story, that Mr. <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> once at <hi>Broadgates,</hi> a
House of Her Father's, neighbouring to the Town of <hi>Leicester:</hi> where he found
Her in Her Chamber, reading <hi>Phaedon Platonis</hi> in <hi>Greek,</hi> with as much delight, as
some Gentlemen would have read a Merry Tale in <hi>Geoffery Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Her Father, the Duchess, and all the rest of the Houshould, were at that time
hunting in the Park: which moved him to put this Question to Her, <q>How She
could find in Her Heart to loose such Excellent Pastimes?</q> To which She very
chearfully returned this Answer, <q>That all the Pastimes in the Park were a
Shadow onely of the Pleasure, and Contentment, which She found in that Book;
adding moreover, That one of the greatest blessings God ever gave Her, was in
sending Her sharp Parents, and a gentle Schole-Master, which made Her take
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:66032:127"/>
delight in nothing so much, as in Her Study.</q> By which agreeableness of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition,
and eminent Proficiency in all parts of Learning, she became very dear
to the young King <hi>Edward;</hi> to whom <hi>Fox</hi> not onely makes Her equal, but
doth acknowledge her also to be His Superiour in those Noble Studies. And for
an Ornament superadded to Her other Perfections, she was most zealously af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to the true Protestant Religion, then by Law established; which She embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
not out of any outward compliance with the present current of the Times;
but because Her own most Excellent Judgment had been fully satisfied in the
Truth, and Purity thereof. All which together did so endear her to the King, that
he took great Delight in Her Conversation, and made it the first step to that Royal
Throne, to which He afterwards designed Her in the Time of His Sickness.</p>
                     <p>Thus lived she in these sweet Contentments, till she came unto the years of
Marriage, when she, that never found in Her self the least Spark of Ambition,
was made the most unhappy Instrument of another man's. <hi>Dudly</hi> of <hi>Warwick,</hi> a
Person of a proud, deceitfull, and aspiring Nature, began to entertain some
Ambitious thoughts, when <hi>Edward</hi> first began to Reign: but kept them down,
as long as his two Uncles lived together, in Peace, and Concord. But, having
found a means to dissolve that knot, occasioned by the Pride, and Insolency of
the Duchess of <hi>Sommerset,</hi> one as ill-Natured as himself, he first made use of
the Protectour to destroy the Admiral, and after served himself by some Lords
of the Court, for humbling the Lord Protectour to an equal Level with the rest
of the Council. Finding by this Experiment, how easie a thing it was to serve
his Turn by them on all other Occasions, he drew unto himself the managing of
all Affairs; none being so hardy, as to question any of his Actions, and much
less to cross them. But not content with being looked on as the Chief in Power, he is resolved to make himself the first in Place; thinking no private Greatness
to be answerable to so great a Merit, as he had fancied in himself. Thus busy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his unquiet thoughts upon new Designs, and passing from one imagination
to another, he fixed at last upon a purpose of Husbanding the Opportunities to
his best Advantage; in transferring the Crown into his own Family, which he
thought Capable enough of the highest Honours.</p>
                     <p>For why (said he) within himself, should not the Son of a <hi>Dudly,</hi> being the
more Noble House of the two, be thought as Capable of the Imperial Crown
of this Realm, as the Son, or Grand-Childe of a <hi>Seimour.</hi> Though I pretend
not to be born of the Race of Kings; yet I may give a King to <hi>England</hi> of my
Race and Progeny, on as good ground, as any, which derive themselves from
<hi>Owen Tudor,</hi> the Ancestour of the Boy now reigning. That Family pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
onely from a Daughter to the House of <hi>Sommerset,</hi> and there are now some
Daughters of the House of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> which may pretend as much as she. If by
a Match into that House, I can finde a way to bring the Crown into mine own;
I shall want no Presidents at home, and finde many abroad. Some Dangers may
present themselves in the Pursuit of this Enterprise: but Dangers are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised,
as in all great Actions; so chiefly, when a Crown is aimed at. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
that I will try my Fortune in it: which if it prosper to my wish, I shall
live Triumphantly; if I sink under the Attempt, I shall perish Nobly. Which
being concluded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and resolved on, he first insinuates himself into the good affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the Marquess of <hi>Dorset;</hi> whom he assisteth in his Suit for the Title of
<hi>Suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>lk,</hi> which without him was not to be gained: exalts himself to the like
Glorious Title of Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> that he might stand on equal

                        </gap>round with the proudest of them: and in a word so cunningly prepareth his
<hi>Toils</hi> for the Duke of <hi>Sommerset,</hi> that at the last he fell into them, never to be set
free again, untill Death released him; all which Particulars have been at large
laid down in the former History. And this being done, he suffered the young
King to wear out all the following year, the better to avoid all Popular suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that His Uncle's Death was onely hastened to make way for His. And possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it is, that he might have tired it out a little longer; but for a smart Jest, which
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:66032:128"/>
He put upon this Ambi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ious Minister. The King took great delight in his Bow,
and, Arrows: and shooting one day at the Butt (as He used to do) hit the very
White. <hi>Well aimed, my Liege,</hi> said Merrily the Mighty Duke: <hi>But you aimed
better,</hi> said the King, <hi>when you shot off the head of My Vncle</hi> Sommerset:
which words so stang the Conscience of the guilty man, that he could not think
himself secure, but by accelerating his Design, for settling the Crown upon the
Head of one of his Children, according to the Plot, which he had hammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Forge of his Wretched Brain.</p>
                     <p>For now, the King beginning sensibly to decay, he takes his time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to enter into
Communication with the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> about a Marriage to be made betwixt
the Lord <hi>Guilford Dudly,</hi> his fourth Son, and the Lady <hi>Jane Gray,</hi> the Duke's eldest
Daughter: which, with the rest of the Marriages before-mentioned, being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
and concluded, (for he was grown too great, and known to be too dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to be denied in any reasonable Suit) a day was set, in which this Excellent
Lady was to be transplanted into the Family of the <hi>Dudlies.</hi> A day, which she ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
with a Virgin Modesty, and, after the Solemnity of the Nuptial Rites, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Her pure Body to the chast Embraces of a Vertuous Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ort; who, of all
<hi>Dudlie</hi>'s Brood, had nothing of the Father in him. All which succeeding to
his wish, he sets himself to the accomplishing of that Project, which he had
long before designed. The King was now grown weak in Body, and decayed
in Spirits, and in that weak Estate he takes his Opportunities to inculcate to
Him, what infinite Blessings had been derived from Him on this Church, and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by the Blessed Reformation of Religion, so happily began, and brought to
such Perfection by Him: That it must therefore be His Care so to provide for the
Continuance of those infinite Blessings, that Posterity might enjoy the Benefit,
and Comfort of it, which would gain Him a more pretious Memory amongst
His Subjects, then all His other Princely Virtues; That nothing was more fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by all Sorts of People, then that the Crown Imperial (if it should please
Almighty God to call Him to a Crown of Gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ry) would fall upon the Head of
the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> a Princess passionately affected to the Interess of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and one, who by Her Marriage with some Potent Prince of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
might Captivate the Free-Born <hi>English</hi> Nation to a Foreign Servitude;
That both His Sisters, being born of disputed Marriages, and howsoever being
but his half Sisters onely, and by several Ventures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could neither be Heirs to Him,
nor to one another, by the known Laws of the Land: which neither Acts of
Parliament, nor the last Will, and Testament of the King Deceased, were of
power to alter; That the young Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> was an <hi>Alien</hi> born, by Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
uncapable of any Inheritance in the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and had besides
preferred the Alliance of the <hi>French</hi> before that of His Majesty, which render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Her as unworthy, as she was uncapable; That, for the better carrying on of
that Blessed Work of Reformation, the Peace, and Happiness of His People,
the preventing of all Emergent Mischiefs, and His own everlasting Fame, it was
not possible to make a more happy Provision, then by transferring the Crown
to the Lady <hi>Jane,</hi> a Lady of such Excellent Virtues, as were sufficient to adorn
the Richest Diadem; That there was no Question to be made, but that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
knew, as well as any, the admirable qualities of that Matchless Lady, Her
Zeal to the Religion, here by Him established, the agreeableness of Her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
with His own Affections, and could not but conceive that Nation to
be infinitely happier then all others, which might fall under the Command of so
mild a Government; And finally, That he was bound by His Duty to God, the
Light of His own Conscience, and the Love He had to all His Subjects, to lay aside
all Natural Affections to His Father's House, in respect of that great Obligation,
which He had to God's Glory and the true Religion; following therein the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of our Lord, and Saviour, who looked both for his Brothers, and Sisters,
amongst his Disciples, without relating to his nearest Kindred by <hi>Joseph,</hi> or
<hi>Mary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="151" facs="tcp:66032:128"/>
By these Suggestions, and Inducements, he much enclined the King to hearken
to his Propositions. For furtherance whereof he caused such, as were about Him,
to entertain Him with continual Discourses of the Divine Perfections, and most
Heavenly Graces of the Lady <hi>Jane;</hi> the high Esteem, in which She was with
all the Subjects, for Her Zeal, and Piety; the everlasting Fame, which would wait
upon Him, by providing such a Successour to enjoy the Crown, in whom Virtues
would survive to succeeding Ages. Then which, no Musick could sound sweeter in
the Ears of the King, whom he knew to have an affectionate Sympathy with that
Excellent Lady; as being much of the same Age, brought up in the same Studies; as
near to Him in the sweetness of Her Disposition, as She was in Blood; and of a
Conversation so agreeable to Him, as if They had been but the same Person in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Habits. And they all plied their Game so cunningly, that the weak King,
not being able to withstand so many Assaults, did at last condescend to that,
which he found not onely most conformable to their Importunities, but to
His own Affections also. Order was taken thereupon, that an Instrument
should be drawn in due Form of Law, for the transposing of the Crown to the
Children of the Lady <hi>Frances,</hi> Duchess of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and Daughter to <hi>Mary,</hi>
the <hi>French</hi> Queen, one of the Sisters of King <hi>Henry,</hi> His Maje<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
In which Instrument, nothing was to be defective, which either could
be drawn from the Grounds of Law, or the Rules of Polity, to justifie, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear
the Action. In drawing up whereof, there was none thought fitter to be
used, then Sir <hi>William Cecil,</hi> one of the Chief Secretaries of Estate, who having
before served <hi>Dudlie</hi>'s Turn against his old Master, the Duke of <hi>Sommerset,</hi>
was looked on, as the Readiest Man for the present Service.</p>
                     <p>The Pretensions, taken from the Law, for excluding the King's two Sisters
from the Right of Succession, were grounded; First, Upon the Invalidity of
their Mother's Marriage: both being made void by Legal Sentences of Divorce,
and those Divorces ratified by Acts of Parliament. In which the said two
Sisters were declared to be illegitimate, and consequently uncapable of any
of those Favours, which were intended to them by the Act of Succession, made
in the thirty fifth year of the late King <hi>Henry,</hi> or by the last Will, and Testament,
of that King, which was built upon it. In the next Place it was pretended, that
the said two Sisters, <hi>Mary,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> being but of half Blood to the King
now Reigning (admitting them to have been born in lawfull Wedlock) were not
in any Capacity by the Common-Law, (the old good Law of <hi>England)</hi> to be
Heirs unto Him, or to Succeed in any Part of that Inheritance, which came
unto Him by His Father. It was considered also, that by the known Rules, and
Principles of the Common-Law, no manner of Person was Inheritable to any
Estate of Lands, or Tenements, in the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> who was not born
under the King's Allegiance, as King of <hi>England,</hi> but in the case of Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lization
by Act of Parliament. Which seemed to be a sufficient Bar against
all Titles, and Demands, for the Line of <hi>Scotland,</hi> although derived from <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet,</hi>
the Eldest Daughter of King <hi>Henry the Seventh.</hi> And whereas the Lady
<hi>Frances,</hi> Duchess of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> might seem both by the Law of Nature, and the
Right of Succession, to have precedency in Title before her Daughter; yet was
no Injury offered to her: in regard, that she was willing to pass by all her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Claims, for the Preferment of her Children. Which Pretermissions of
the Mother were neither new, nor strange in the Succession to the Crown of
this Kingdom. Not new; because the like was done by <hi>Maud</hi> the Emperess, for
the Advancement of her Son King <hi>Henry the Second:</hi> nor strange; because it h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d
been lately practised in the Person of the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> Countess of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
in giving Way to the Preferment of King <hi>Henry the Seventh,</hi> the first
King of the House now Regnant.</p>
                     <p>The Reasons, or Pretexts, which seemed to be built on Polity, and Point of State,
were: first, the unavoydable Danger of Reducing this Free, and Noble Realm,
under the Vassalage, and Servitude, of the Bishop of <hi>Rome;</hi> if either of the King's
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:66032:129"/>
two Sisters, in their several Turns, should marry with a Foreign Prince of
that Religion; or otherwise, by the Transport of their own Affections, submit
their Scepters to the <hi>Pope.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was considered also, That, by such Marriages, not onely many Foreign
Customs, and Laws, would be introduced: but that there might follow an Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishment
of those Antient Laws, upon which the Native Rights, of all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
seemed to have dependance. Besides, that possibly the Realm might here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
be annexed to some greater Kingdom: of which, in time, it would be reckoned
for a Member, and consequently be reduced unto the Form of a <hi>Province,</hi> to
the utter Subversion of the Antient Dignity, and Estate thereof. Which whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it should happen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was neither impossible, nor improbable, that the People,
upon a just Sence of the Indignities, &amp; Pressures might elect some popular and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
man to be their King, who, to countenance his own unworthiness, &amp; obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
would little regard, what Contumelie he cast upon the falling Family of the
Kings before him. To which, perchance some further Countenance might be
added from the <hi>Holy Scripture:</hi> where <hi>Solomon</hi> is found to be preferred unto the
Throne by <hi>David,</hi> before <hi>Adonijah;</hi> the youngest Son, before the eldest; a Childe,
before a Man experienced, and well grown in years. And some Examples also
might be had of the like Transpositions, in the Realm of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in <hi>Hungary,
Naples,</hi> and else where: enough to shew, that nothing had been done in this
great Transaction, which was not to be presidented in other Places. Upon all
which Considerations, it was thought most agreeable to the Rules of Polity, that
the King by Letters Patents, under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> should so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of the Possession of the <hi>Crown,</hi> (with such Remainders, and Reversions,
as to him seemed best) as might prevent such Inconveniencies, and Emergent Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs,
as might otherwise happen: which could not better be effected, then by
setting the Crown on the Head of the Lady <hi>Jane;</hi> a Lady of a Royal Blood, born
in the Realm, brought up in the Religion now by Law established; Married al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
to a Person of Desert, and Honour; and such an one, in whom all those Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were concentred, which were sufficient to adorn all the rest of Her Sex.</p>
                     <p>Thus Reason being thus prepared, the next Care was, to have the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
so contrived in due form of Law, that nothing might be wanting in the
Stile and Legalities of it, which might make it any way obnoxious to Disputes,
and Questions. For the doing whereof, it was thought necessary to call in the
Assistance of some of the Judges, and others of His Majesties Council learned
in the Laws of this Realm; by whose Authority it might be thought more passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
amongst the People. Of all which Rank, none was thought fitter to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
into the Consultation, then Sir <hi>Edward Montague;</hi> not onely as Chief
Justice of the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> and very well experienced in His own Profession:
But because, he being one of the Executours of the King deceased, his concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with the rest of the Council, seemed the more considerable. A Letter is
therefore sent unto him on the eleventh of <hi>June,</hi> subscribed by the Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer,
the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Shrewsbury, Bedford,</hi>
and <hi>Pembroke,</hi> the Lord Admiral <hi>Clinton,</hi> the Lord <hi>Darcie,</hi> Sir <hi>John Gale,</hi>
Sir <hi>William Peter,</hi> Sir <hi>William Cecil,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Cheek.</hi> By the Tenour where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
he was commanded to attend upon their Lordships the next day, in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
and to bring with him, Sir <hi>John Baker, Chancellour</hi> of the <hi>first-Fruits</hi> and
<hi>Tenths,</hi> Master Justice <hi>Bromeley,</hi> together with the <hi>Attorney,</hi> and <hi>Sollicitour
General.</hi> Being brought into the King's Presence, at the time appointed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
whom they found attended by the Lord Treasurer, and some others of
those, who had subscribed the former Letter: the King declared Himself with
a weak Voice to this Effect; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>He had considered, in His Sickness, of the
Estate of His Realm; which, if it should descend on the Lady</hi> Mary, <hi>who was then
unmarried, it might so happen, that She might marry a Stranger born, whereby
not onely the Laws of the Realm might be changed and altered; but all His own
Proceedings in Religion, might be also reversed; That it was His Pleasure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

that the Crown should Descend, after His Decease, unto such Persons, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>These Articles, when they had Perused, and Considered of, they signified
unto the King, that they conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which, being made in <hi>Parliament,</hi> could not be Frustrated, or made Ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

further time, or deliberation, commanded them to take the Articles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with them, and give the Business a Dispatch, with all speed as might be. But
finding greater Difficulties in it, then had appeared unto their Lordships, they
made a Report unto them at their next Attendance, that they had Considered of
the King's Articles, and the Act of Succession; whereby it appeared man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

though absent, was not out of Call) he came in great Rage, and Fury, to the
Council-Chamber, called the <hi>Chief Justice</hi> Traitour; affirmed, that he would
fight in his Shirt, in that Quarrel, against any man living; and behaved himself in
such an outragious manner, as put both <hi>Mountague,</hi> and Justice <hi>Bromely,</hi> in a
very great fear, that he would have struck them. Cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Letter of the fourteenth of the same Moneth, they found the King more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
in it, then He was before; requiring them, with a sharp Voice, and a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
Countenance, to dispatch the Book, according to the Articles delivered
to them; and telling them, that He would have a <hi>Parliament</hi> shortly to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm

That His C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be Commissionated so to do by His Majestie's Warrant, under the Great Seal of
<hi>England,</hi> and have a General Pardon for it, when the Deed was done.</p>
                     <p>Not daring longer to resist, and having made as good Provision, as they could,

in form o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for the Seal, to the Lord Chancellour <hi>Goodrick,</hi> sufficiently prepared before-hand
not to stick upon it. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t then appeared another Difficulty amongst the Lords of
the Council: some of wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ch not well satisfied with these Proceedings, appeared
as backward in Subscribing to the Instrument, before it went unto the Seal; as
the Great Lawyers had done at the first, in being brought to the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But such was the Authority, which <hi>Dudley,</hi> and his Party, had gained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, that some for fear, and some for favour, did Subscribe at last:
a Zeal to the Reformed Religion prevailing in it upon some; a doubt of loosing
their Church-Lands more powerfully over-swaying others; and all in fear of
getting the displeasure of that Mighty Tyrant, who, by his Power, and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
carried all before him. The last, that stood it out, was Arch-Bishop <hi>Cranmer.</hi>
Who, being sent for to the Court, when all the Lords of the Council, and most
of the Judges of the Realm had subscribed the Instrument, refused to put his
hand unto it, or to consent to the Disherison of the late King's Daughters. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
much Reasoning of the Case, he requires a longer time of deliberation; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults
about it with some of the most Learned Lawyers, and is finally sent for by
the King: who, having fully set his heart upon the Business, did use so many
Reasons to him, in behalf of Religion, and plyed him with such strong Perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in pursuance of them; that at the last he suffered himself to be overcome by
His Importunities, and so Subscribed it with the rest. Onely Sir <hi>James Hales,</hi>
one of the <hi>Justices</hi> of the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> carried the Honour of a Resolute, and
Constant Man: not onely from those of his own Rank, but even from all the
Lords of the Council, and almost all the Peers of the Realm to boot; who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a man observed to be both Religious, and upright, did very worthily refuse
to Subscribe, and was afterwards as unworthily requited by Queen <hi>Mary</hi> for it.</p>

most feared, as the most likely Person to destroy his whole Contrivance. For

on <hi>Saturday,</hi> the eighth of <hi>July,</hi> to Sir <hi>George Barns,</hi> the Lord Mayour of
<hi>London;</hi> requiring him, in the Name of the Lords of the Council, to give his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
at the Court, and bring with him six of the Principal Aldermen, six Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
of the Staple, and as many of the Company of Merchant-Adventurers. No
haste was wanting on their parts. And coming at the time appointed, they were
privily informed by some of the Council (but in the Name of all the rest) that
the King was dead, and that He had Declared by His Letters Patents, under the
Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> subscribed by all the Lords of the Council, and almost
all the Peers of the Realm, that His Cousin, the Lady <hi>Jane Gray,</hi> was to Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
Him in the Crowns of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> as the most True, Certain,
and Undoubted Heir of all His Dominions. Which being signified unto them,
it was no hard matter to obtain their Consent to that, which they were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to deny. And so, upon a Promise of their best Assistance to Promote the
Cause, and to keep secret the King's Death, untill further Order, they were
dismissed unto their Houses.</p>
                     <p>It is an Antient Custom of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> immediately on the Death
of their Predecessours, to provide their Lodgings in the <hi>Tower.</hi> Taking pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
as it were, by that Royal Fortress, of the rest of the Kingdom; and
from thence passing, in a Solemn, and Magnificent manner, through the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal

the tenth of the same Moneth. A Letter had been brought the night before
from the Princess <hi>Mary,</hi> who had received Advertisement of Her Brother's
Death: notwithstanding all their Care, and Diligence, in labouring to conceal
it from His nearest Servants; which made them meet the earlier, and in greater
numbers, to return an Answer thereunto. The Princess knew Her own Right,
and the Wrong, which was intended to Her: both which She signified unto Them,
in these following words.</p>

Her Claim; and they conceived that She was not in a condition for doing more.

                     <p>These Letters being thus dispatched, and no further danger seeming to be
feared on that side, all things are put in Readiness against the coming of the
Queen; who the same day, about three of the Clock in the Afternoon, was
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:66032:131"/>
brought by water to the Tower; attended by a Noble Train, of both
Sexes, from <hi>Durham</hi> House in the <hi>Strand,</hi> where She had been entertained, as
a part of <hi>Dudley</hi>'s Family, ever since Her Marriage. She could not be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnorant
of that, which had been done in Order unto Her Advancement to the
Royal Throne; and could not but conceive, that Her being Conducted to the
Tower, in that Solemn manner, did portend somewhat, which looked toward a
Coronation. But still She hoped, that either She should hear some Good News
of the King's Recovery, or of the Altering of His Purpose; and that She
might be suffered to enjoy those Divine Contentments, which she had found in
the Repose of a Studious Life. But when She came into the presence of the two
Dukes, Her Father, and Her Father-in-Law: She observed their Behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Her, to be very different from that, which they had used before. To
put Her out of which Amazement, it was signified to Her by the Duke of
<hi>Northumberland;</hi> That <hi>The King was Dead,</hi> and <hi>that He had Declared Her for His
next Successour in the Crown Imperial;</hi> That <hi>This Declaration was Approved by
all the Lords of the Council, most of the Peers, and all the Judges of the Land,
which they had Testified by the Subscription of their Names, and all this Ratified, and
Confirmed by Letters Patents, under the Great Seal of</hi> England; That <hi>The Lord
Mayour, the Aldermen, and some of the Principal Citizens had been spoke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
by whom they were assured of the Fidelity of the rest of the City;</hi> That <hi>There
was nothing wanting, but Her Gratefull Acceptance of the High Estate, which
God Almighty, the Sovereign Disposer of all Crowns, and Scepters, (never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
to be thanked by Her, for so great a Mercy) had advanced Her to;</hi> That
<hi>Therefore She should chearfully take upon Her, the Name, Title, and Estate of
Queen of</hi> England, France, and Ireland, <hi>with all the Royalties, and Preheminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
to the same belonging; Receiving at their hands the First-Fruits of the
Humble Duty (now tendred by them on their Knees) which shortly was to be payed
to Her, by the rest of the Kingdom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Speech being ended, the poor Lady found Her Self in a great Perplexity,
not knowing whether she Should more lament the Death of the King, or Her
Adoption to the Kingdom: the first Loss not to be repaired, the next Care pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to be avoided. She looked upon the Crown, as a great Temptation; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
which, She stood in need of all the Helps, which both Philosophy, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
could suggest unto Her. And She knew also, that such Fortunes, sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
knocked twice for entrance at the same Man's Gate: but that, if once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
they are gone for ever. Taking some time therefore of Deliberation,
She summoned a Council of Her purest Thoughts; by whose Advice, half drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in Tears, (either as sorrowing for the King's Death, or fore-seeing Her own)
She returned an Answer in these Words, or to this Effect; That <hi>The Laws of
the Kingdom, and Natural Right, standing for the King's Sister, She would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of burthening Her weak Conscience with a Yoke, which did belong to them;</hi>
That <hi>She understood the Infamy of those, who had permitted the violation of Right
to gain a Scepter;</hi> That <hi>it were to mock God, and deride Justice, to scruple at
the stealing of a Shilling, and not at the Vsurpation of a Crown.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Besides <hi>(said She)</hi> I am not so young, nor so little read in the Guils of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
to suffer my self to be taken by them. If she inrich any, it is but to make them
the Subject of her Spoil; If she raise others, it is but to pleasure her Self with
their Ruins. What sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> adored but yesterday, is to day her Pastime. And, if I now
permit her to adorn, and Crown me, I must to Morrow suffer her to crush, and
tear me in pieces. Nay with what Crown doth she Present me. A Crown, which
hath been Violently and Shamefully wrested from <hi>Katharine</hi> of <hi>Arragon;</hi> made
more unfortunate by the Punishment of <hi>Ann Bulloign,</hi> and others, that wore it after
Her. And why then would you have me add my Blood to theirs, and to be the third Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctime,
from whom this Fatal Crown may be ravished with the Head that wears it?
But in Case it should not prove Fatal unto me, and that all its Venom were consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
if Fortune should give me Warranties of her Constancy; Should I be well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:66032:132"/>
to take upon me these Thorns, which would dilacerate, though not kill me
outright; to burthen my self with a Yoke, which would not fail to torment me, though
I were assured not to be strangled with it? My Liberty is better, then the Chain
you proffer me, with what pretious stones soever it be adorned, or of what Gold soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
framed. I will not exchange my Peace for Honourable and pretious Jealousies, for
Magnificent, and Glorious Letters. And, if you love me sincerely, and in good earnest,
you will rather wish me a secure, and quiet Fortune, though mean, then an exalted
Condition exposed to the Wind, and followed by some dismal Fall.</p>
                     <p>It had been happy for Her self, Her Fathers, and their several Families, if
they had suffered themselves to be overcome by such powerfull Arguments:
which were not onely persuasive, but might seem convincing; had they not all
been fatally hurried unto their own Destruction. But the Ambition of the two
Dukes was too Strong, and Violent, to be kept down by any such prudent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations.
So that being wearied at the last with their Importunities, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
by the entreaties of Her Husband, whom She dearly loved, She submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto that necessity, which She could not vanquish; yielding her Head with
more unwillingness to the Ravishing Glories of a Crown, then afterwards She
did to the Stroak of the Ax. The Point being thus concluded on, the two
Dukes, with all the rest of the Lords of the Council, swore Allegeance to her.
And on the same day, about five of the Clock in the afternoon, they caused Her
Solemnly to be Proclaimed Queen of <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland, &amp;c.</hi> in
many of the principal Streets in <hi>London;</hi> and after by Degrees, in most of the
Chief Cities, Towns, and Places of greatest Concourse, and Resort of People.
In which Proclamation it was signified, That, by the Letters Patents of the late
King <hi>Edward,</hi> bearing Date the twenty first of <hi>June</hi> last past, the Lady <hi>Jane
Gray,</hi> Eldest Daughter to the Duchess of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> had been declared His true and
lawfull Successour to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> the same to be enjoyed after Her
Decease, the Heirs of Her Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in the said Letters Patents, more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
did at large appear. Which Proclamation, though it was published in the
City with all due Solemnities, and that the Concourse of People was exceeding
great, yet their Acclamations were but few; which served as a sufficient Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Friends and Followers of the Princess <hi>Mary,</hi> that they were rather
drawn together out of Curiosity to behold some unusual Spectacle; then out
of any purpose to congratulate at the Queen's Advancement. And so far some of
of them declared their dislike thereof; that, the next Day, one <hi>Gilbert Pot</hi>

for certain words, which he had spoken at the Publishing of the Proclamation;
a Trumpet sounding at the Time of the Execution, and an Herald in his Coat of
Arms publickly noting his Offence in a Form prescribed. A Severity neither safe,
nor necessary (the party being of no better Condition, then a Vintner's Boy) as
the Case then stood.</p>
                     <p>For the next day the Lords received Advertisement from divers hands, that
many persons of Quality were drawn together at <hi>Kenning-Hall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>Castle</hi> in
<hi>Norfolk</hi> to offer their Service and assistance, to the Princess <hi>Mary;</hi> who finding,
by the Answer which She had received from the Lords of the Council, that no
good was otherwise to be be done, resolved not to be wanting to Her own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions,
and to that end gave chearfull Entertainment to all comers, which
either favoured Her Title, or embraced Her Religion. Amongst such Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
as were certified to the Lords of the Council; I finde the names of the Earl
of <hi>Bath</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Wharton,</hi> son to the Lord <hi>Wharton,</hi> Sir <hi>John Mordant,</hi>
Son to the Lord <hi>Mordant,</hi> Sir <hi>William Drury,</hi> Sir <hi>John Shelton,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingfield,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Henry Jenningham,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Sulierd,</hi> Mr. <hi>Richard Higham</hi> of
<hi>Lincoln's-Inn.</hi> It was advertised also, that the Earl of <hi>Sussex,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Henry
Ratcliff</hi> his Son, were coming towards Her with their Forces: which last
Advertisement gave the Business some appearance of Danger; for what
else was to be expected, but that the Countenance and Encouragement of so
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:66032:132"/>
great a Person might draw many more unto the side; who otherwise would have
been content to be lookers on, in case they had not moved against Her. Preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in such Cases, was the wholesomest Physick: which therefore was to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred,
with all speed that might be, before those Companies encreased, and
were united under some Commander, which might gain them the Reputation
of a little Army little at first, but like enough to become so midable to their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
if not broken in time. Some Forces therefore to be sent under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
and Command, of some Person who was well affected to the Cause, to scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
those small Companies, before they grew unto an Head, to seise upon the
Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> and bring Her with him to the Court, where they knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
how to make sure of her. For which Employment none more fit, then
the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> who had the greatest Stock going in the present Adventure,
and whose affection to the <hi>Queen,</hi> being raised out of the Bowels of Nature,
would prompt him to dispatch the Service, with his utmost Diligence. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
possibly the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> hearing of these Preparations, might fly for safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and create more Trouble to them there, then She could at
home; it was thought necessary, that such Ships, as lay upon the <hi>Downs,</hi> should
be Commanded to attend on the Coast of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> to intercept Her on the
Way; if peradventure she should think of flying to the <hi>Emperour</hi>'s Court.</p>
                     <p>So was it Counselled, and Concluded. But the matter could not be carried so
close, as not to come to the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Knowledg; to whom the least Drop of
Her Father's Blood was far more pretious, then all the Kingdoms in the World:
so that, with Tears in Her Eys, and Voice as mournfull as Her Face, She besought
such of the Lords, as She conceived to be most tenderly affected towards Her,
to be Her Mediatours to the rest of the Council, that Her Father might be
suffered to remain with Her; and that some other Man, more exercised in Deeds
of Arms, might be sent out on that Employment. Nor was the Motion made in
vain. For some there were, who secretly had as great a Mind to put <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
upon the Service; as She could be to have Her Father excused from it. They
saw how things were like to go, and how generally the People were enclined to
King <hi>Henrie</hi>'s Children, and could not promise to themselves any long Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

quick return, he went to take his Leave of the Queen, where he found his
Commission ready Sealed, together with certain Instructions, subscribed by all
the Lords of the Council, in which his Marches were lai'd out, and Limited
from one day to another. Conditions not to be imposed on any, who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
in Chief; nor to have been accepted by him: but that it was a matter of
his own desiring. And he desired it for these Reasons, (so strongly was he
caught in a Snare of his own devising) partly because he would be thought to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:66032:133"/>
have Acted nothing, but by Authority of the Council, which he supposed
might serve for his Indemnity, if the Tide should turn; and partly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the

But so instructed, he takes Leave, embraced by all the Lords, with great
demonstrations of Affection, according to the wonted dissimulation in Princes
Courts; by none more passionately<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then by those, who most abhorred his pride,
and falshood. Amongst which it is said of the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> (upon whom he

much sorrow at the Duke's departure; in regard he was not Ordered to be
one of his Company, in whose presence he could finde in his heart to spend his

he found the Streets to be thronged with People, but could hear nothing of their
Prayers for his Prosperous Journey. Insomuch, that, turning to the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> he
could not choose, but say unto him; <hi>The People press to see us: but not one bids, God
speed us.</hi> On <hi>Saturday</hi>-night he comes to <hi>Cambridg,</hi> where he assured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

that there was no hope to be conceived, but that She would disturb,
and destroy all that, which with such great Labour had been settled in the
Reign of Her Brother. For which Sermon he incurred so much displeasure,
that it could never be forgiven him, when the rest were Pardoned: by whose
Encouragement, and Command, he had undertook it. But this Sermon
did not work so much on the People, as the ill News, which came continually
to the <hi>Tower,</hi> had prevailed on many of the Lords. For presently, upon that
of the six Ships, which were Revolted from the Queen, Advertisement is given,

that the Gates of the <hi>Tower</hi> were locked about seven of the Clock, and the
Keys carried to the Queen. And though the Lord Treasurer was brought back
about twelve at night, yet now the knot of the Confederacy began apparently
to break. For, finding by intelligence from so many Parts of the Realm, but
chiefly by the Lord Treasurer's return, that generally the People were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to the Title of the Princess <hi>Mary,</hi> they thought it most expedient for
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:66032:134"/>
them, to Declare themselves in Her Favour also, and not to run themselves, their
Friends, and Families, on a certain Ruin. But all the Difficulty was, in finding
out a way, to get out of the <hi>Tower:</hi> the <hi>Gates</hi> whereof were so narrowly watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
that no man could be suffered to go in, and out; but by the Knowledg, and
Permission of the Duke of <hi>Suffolk.</hi> But that, which their own Wisdom could
not, the Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi>'s Importunity effected for them; who, fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Supplies, which the <hi>Lords</hi> had promised to send after him, as before
is said, had pressed them earnestly, by his Letters, not to be wanting to their
own Honour, and the Publick Service. This gave them a fair Colour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
their Liberty from that Restraint, by representing to the <hi>Queen,</hi> and the <hi>Duke</hi>
Her Father, that the Supplies expected, and all things necessary to the same,
could not be raised, unless they were permitted personally to attend the Business;
both for the Pressing of the Men, providing them of all things needfull, and
choosing fit Commanders, to Conduct them in good Order to the Duke of <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humberland.</hi>
Which seemed so reasonable to the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> a Man of
no great Depth himself, and so not like to penetrate into the bottom of a deep
Design; that he gave way to their Departure for the present: little conceiving,
that they never meant to come back again, till the State was altered.</p>
                     <p>Being thus at their desired Liberty, the Earls of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and <hi>Pembroke,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

To which Place they were followed, not long after, by almost all the rest of

that the Meeting might be held with the less Suspicion, it was given out to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Conference with <hi>Laval,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadour, about Affairs of great
Importance for the Weal of both Kingdoms. No sooner had they took their
Places: but the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> who had held Intelligence with the <hi>Princess,</hi>
ever since the first Extremities of Her Brother's Sickness, inveighed most bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against the Duke of <hi>Northumberland.</hi> 
                        <q>And, after he had ripped up the

cruelly, or amiss, in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Time; he at last descends to the
Treacherous Act of the Disherison of the Children of the late King <hi>Henry;</hi>
professing, that he wondred, how he had so enthralled such persons, as the Lords
there present, as to make them Instruments of his Wickedness.</q> 
                        <hi>For was it not,</hi> saith
he, <hi>by Our Consent, and Suffrages; that the Duke of</hi> Suffolk<hi>'s Daughter, the same</hi>

Answer. And what a mad Blindness is it, for the avoidance of an uncertain

to wipe off that Stain, by declaring his Zeal, and Resolution in the Cause of the
Princess. And, therefore, assoon as the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> had concluded his
Speech, he very chearfully professed, that he approved, and would subscribe the
Proposition, and therewithall laying his Hand upon his Sword, he signifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The rest of the Lords, encouraged by these good Examples, and seeing
nothing, but apparent Danger on all sides, if they did the contrary, came to a
speedy Conclusion with them, and bound themselves to stand together, in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the late King's Sisters, against all their Enemies. Which being thus so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerously

it: and so desired their Company to <hi>Cheap-side</hi>-Cross to Proclaim Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
Which said, without any further Dispute about the Title, they rode all
together in good order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through Saint <hi>Paul's-Church-Yard;</hi> till they came
to the <hi>Gate,</hi> which openeth into the Street: where they found such Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
and Throngs of People; whom the Noise of such a Confluence at <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>'s-Castle,
and the going down of the Lord Mayour, and Aldermen, had
drawn together; that they could hardly force a Way through them to come to

having always feared, that there stood a Scaffold secretly behind the Throne,
She was as readily prepared to act her Part upon the one, as upon the other.
If Sorrow, and Affliction did at any time invade Her Thoughts, it was rather in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to Her Friends, but most of all unto Her Husband, who were to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
in the Calamity of Her Misfortunes; then upon any Apprehensions, which
She had for Her Self. And hereunto the bringing in of so many Prisoners, one day
after another, gave no small Encrease: brought hither for no other Reason, but
because they had seemed forward in contributing towards Her Advancement.
In the middest of which Disconsolations, the restoring of the <hi>Duke,</hi> Her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to his former Liberty gave some Repose unto Her Mind; whose Sufferings
were more grievous to Her, then Her own Imprisonment. And then to what a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
Extremity must his Death have brought Her? And though the Attainder,
and Death, of the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi>

after, might tell Her in Effect, what She was to trust to; yet She was willing

might possibly be extended unto others, and amongst others to Her Husband,
as innocent as Her self, from any open Practice against the <hi>Queen.</hi> And who
could tell, but that it might descend on Her self at last? whom no Ambition of
Her own had tempted to the acceptation of that Dangerous Offer, which She
beheld as the greatest Errour of Her Life, and the onely Stain of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>er Actions.</p>
                     <p>But neither the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Fears, nor the publick Justice of the Land, could so be
satisfied. It was held Treason to accept of a Kingdom offered: to which She
could pretend no Right; whilest the <hi>Queen</hi> was living. And, if Examples of
that Nature should pass unpunished, no Prince could possibly be safe, nor Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

valid, as long, as any Popular Spirit could pretend a Colour to advance some
other to the Throne. Upon which Reason of <hi>State</hi> She was brought to Her Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
at the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> on the third of <hi>November,</hi> accompanied with
Her Husband, the Lord <hi>Guilford Dudly</hi> (his Company never, till that Hour,
unwelcome to Her) together with Arch-Bishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ambrose
Dudly,</hi> the second Son, then living, to the Duke of <hi>Northumberland.</hi> Sentence of
Death passed upon them all: though at that time not executed upon any of them.
The Lord <hi>Ambrose</hi> was reserved unto better Fortunes: as the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi>
was to a more miserable, but more Glorious Death. And for Her self, and
Her dear Husband, it was conceived; that, now the Law had done its part in
their Condemnation, the <hi>Queen</hi> in pitty of their Youth, and Innocence, would
have gone no further. But, as they were first brought under this Affliction, by the
inordinate Ambition of the Duke of <hi>Northumberland;</hi> so shall they shortly
finde an end of all their Troubles, by the rash and unadvised Attempts of the Duke
of <hi>Suffolk.</hi> For upon <hi>Wya<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ear in the Action. To which he unadvisedly yielded, caused <hi>Proclamation</hi> to be
made in some Towns of <hi>Leicester-Shire,</hi> against the <hi>Queen</hi>'s intended Marriage
with the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and drew together many of his Friends, and followers,
to oppose that Match. And though he was discomfited, within few days after:
yet the <hi>Queen</hi> saw, that she could promise Her self neither Peace, nor Safety;
as long as the <hi>Lady Jane</hi> was preserved alive. Whose Restitution to the Throne
must be the matter chieflly aimed at, in these Insurrections; though other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
were devised, to disguise the Business.</p>
                     <p>Her Death is now resolved upon; but first She must be practised with to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:66032:136"/>
change Her Religion; as the Great Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi> had done before.
To which end <hi>Fecknam</hi> is employed: not long before made <hi>Dean</hi> of Saint
<hi>Paul</hi>'s, and not long after <hi>Abbot</hi> of <hi>Westminster;</hi> a Man, whose great Parts
promised him an easie Victory over a poor Lady of a broken, and dejected Spirit:
but it proved the contrary. For so well had She studied the Concernments of Her
own Religion, and managed the Conference with him, with such a readiness of
Wit, such constancy of Resolution, and a Judgment so well-grounded in all helps
of Learning: that She was able to make Answer to his strongest Arguments;
as well to Her great Honour, as his Admiration. (The Substance of which <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi>
he, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>sts to see, may finde it in the <hi>Acts, and Monuments,</hi> fol. 1290.)
So that, not able to prevail with Her in the Change of Religion, he made offer
of his Service to prepare Her for Death: which though She thankfully accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of, as finding it to proceed from a good Affection; yet soon he found, that
She was also before hand with him in those Preparations, which are fit, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
for a dying <hi>Christian. Friday,</hi> the ninth of <hi>February</hi> was first designed for the
Day of Her <hi>Execution;</hi> but the Desire of gaining Her to the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> procured Her the short <hi>Respite</hi> of three Days more. On <hi>Sunday</hi>

                     <p>The Fatal Morning being come, the <hi>Lord Guilford</hi> earnestly desired the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
that He might take His Farewell of Her. Which though they willingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
yet, upon notice of it, She Advised the contrary; assuring Him, <q>That
such a meeting would rather add to His Afflictions, then encrease that Quiet,
wherewith they had possessed their souls for the stroke of Death, that He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
a Lenitive, which would put fire into the Wound; and that it was to be
feared Her Presence would rather weaken, then strengthen Him that He ought
to take courage from his Reason, and derive constancy from his own heart; that
if his soul were not firm, and setled, She could not settle it by Her eyes, nor confirm
it by Her words; that He should do well to remit this Interview to the other
World, that there indeed Friendships were happy, and Unions undesolvable;
and that theirs would be Eternal, if their souls carried nothing with them of
Terrestrial, which might hinder them from rejoycing.</q> All She could do was to
give Him a Farewell out of a Window, as He passed toward the place of His disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution:
which He suffered on the <hi>Scaffold</hi> on <hi>Tower-Hill</hi> with much <hi>Christian</hi>
meekness. His Dead body being lai'd in a <hi>Car,</hi> and His Head wrapped up in a
Linen-cloth, were carried to the <hi>Chapel</hi> within the <hi>Tower;</hi> in the way to which,
they were to pass under the Window of the Lady <hi>Jane,</hi> where She had given Him
His <hi>Fare-well.</hi> A Spectacle sufficient to disanimate a couragious Heart, not arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Constancy, and Resolution of so brave a Vertue. The Spectacle
endured by Her with the less Astonishment, because She knew, She was upon
the point of meeting with Him in a better Conjuncture; where they should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
finde the like Intermission of their Joys, and Happinesses.</p>
                     <p>It was once resolved on by the <hi>Court,</hi> that She should dy on the same <hi>Scaffold</hi>
with Her Husband: but it was feared, that, being both pittied, and beloved by
the common People, some suddain Commotion might be raised; if She were
publickly brought forth to Her Execution. It was therefore held the safer course,
that a <hi>Scaffold</hi> should be erected for Her within the Verge of the <hi>Tower:</hi> on
which She might satisfie the greatest severity of the Law without any danger to
the State. Towards which being to be led by Sir <hi>John Gage</hi> (who was then <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable</hi>
of the <hi>Tower)</hi> he desired Her to bestow some small Gift upon him, to be
kept as a <hi>Memorial</hi> of Her. To gratifie which desire She gave him Her <hi>Table-Book:</hi>
in which She had written three <hi>Sentences</hi> in <hi>Greek, Latine,</hi> and <hi>English,</hi>
as She saw Her Husband's Body brought unto the <hi>Chapel;</hi> which She besought
him to accept as Her last Bequest. The <hi>Greek</hi> to this effect: That, <hi>If His Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
Body should give Testimony against Her before men; His most blessed Soul
should give an eternal Proof of Her Innocence in the presence of God:</hi> the <hi>Latine</hi>
added; that <hi>Humane Justice was against His Body; but the Divine Mercy would
be for His Soul:</hi> and then concluded thus in <hi>English,</hi> that, <hi>If Her fault deserved
Punishment, Her Youth, at least, and Her Imprudence, were worthy of Excuse; and
that God, and Posterity, would shew Her Favour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Conducted by <hi>Feckman</hi> to the <hi>Scaffold,</hi> She gave not much heed unto his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses;
but kept Her Eyes upon a <hi>Prayer-Book</hi> of Her own. And, being mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the <hi>Throne,</hi> from which She was to receive a more excellent <hi>Crown,</hi> then
any, which this vile Earth could give Her, She addressed Her self in some few
words to the standers by; letting them know, that <hi>Her Offence was not for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
lay'd Her Hand upon the Crown; but for not rejecting it with sufficient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy;</hi>
That <hi>She had less erred through Ambition, then out of Respect, and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to Her Parents;</hi> acknowledging nevertheless, that <hi>Her Respect was to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
as a Crime, and such Reverence, to deserve a Punishment;</hi> That <hi>She would
willingly admit of Death; so to give satisfaction to the injured State; that, by Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Laws, She might voluntarily take off the Scandal, which She had
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:66032:137"/>
given by Her constrained Obedience to Her Friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Kindred;</hi> concluding fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,

wife, the youngest daughter, and one of the Coheirs of the said <hi>Thomas Bollen,</hi>
Viscount <hi>Rochfort,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Wiltshire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such being the estate of that Family, which became afterwards so fortunate
in the production of this Princess to the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> we must in the
next place enquire more particularly into the life and story of Queen <hi>Anne</hi> her
Mother. Who in her tender years attending on <hi>Mary</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Queen
to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> was by her Father, after the return of the said Queen, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the retinue of the Dutchess of <hi>Alanzone,</hi> the beloved sister of King <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi>
where she not only learnt the language, but made her self an exact Mistriss
both of the Gaities and Garb of the great <hi>French</hi> Ladies. She carried such a
<hi>stock</hi> of natural graces, as render'd her superlatively the most admired beauty in
the Court of <hi>France;</hi> and returned thence with all those advantages which the
civilities of <hi>France</hi> could add to an <hi>English</hi> beauty. For so it hapned, that her
Father being sent with Sir <hi>Anthony Brown, Anno</hi> 1527. to take the oath of the
<hi>French</hi> King to a solemn league not long before concluded betwixt the Crowns,
resolved to bring back his daughter with him, to see what fortunes God
would send her in the Court of <hi>England.</hi> Where being Treasurer of the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold,
it was no hard matter for him to prefer her to Queen <hi>Katherines</hi> service,
on whom she waited in the nature of a Maid of Honour; which gave the King
the opportunity of taking more than ordinary notice of her parts and person.
Nor was it long before the excellency of her beauty, adorned with such a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of behaviour, appeared before his eyes with so many charms, that not
able to resist the assaults of Love, he gave himself over to be governed by those
affections which he found himself unable to Master. But he found no such
easie task of it as he had done before in bringing Mrs <hi>Elizabeth Blunt,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to be the subjects of his lusts; all his temptations being repelled by this
vertuous Lady, like arrows shot in vain at a rock of Adamants. She was not to
be told of the Kings loose love to several Ladies, and knew that nothing could
be gained by yielding unto such desires but contempt and infamy, though
for a while disguised and palliated by the plausible name and Courtly Title of a
Princes Mistriss. The humble and modest opposition of the Lady <hi>Gray,</hi> to the
inordinate affections of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 4th. advanced her to his bed as a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
wife, which otherwise she had been possessed of by no better title than that
of <hi>Jane Shore,</hi> and his other Concubines. By whose example Mistriss <hi>Boll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n</hi> is
resolved to steer her courses, and not to yield him any further favours, than
what the honour of a Lady, and the modesty of a virgin, might inoffensively
permit to so great a King.</p>
                  <p>But so it chanced, that before her coming back from the Court of <hi>France,</hi>
the King began to be touched in conscience about his marriage with the
Queen, upon occasion of some doubts which had been cast in the way both by
the Ministers of the Emperour, and the <hi>French</hi> King, as touching the legitima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his daughter <hi>Mary.</hi> Which doubts being started at a time when he
stood on no good terms with the Emperour, and was upon the point of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with him, was secretly fomented by such of the Court as had advanced the
party of <hi>Francis,</hi> and sought alwaies to alienate him from the friendship of
<hi>Charles.</hi> Amongst which none more forward than Cardinal <hi>Wolsie,</hi> who for
almost twenty years together, had governed his affairs with such power and
prudence. The Emperor had disgusted the ambitious Prelate, not only by cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
him in his sute for the Popedome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by denying him the Archbishoprick
of <hi>Toledo,</hi> of which he had once given him no small hopes. And now the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
is resolved to cry quits for both, thinking himself as much affronted in the
sailer of his expectations, as if he had been disgracefully deprived of some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:66032:184"/>
possession. No way more open to his ends, than by working on that
scruple of Conscience which had been raised unto his hand; to the advance
whereof, the reservedness of the Queens behaviour, and the inequality of her
years, which render'd her the less agreeable to his conversation, gave no small
advantage. In which conjuncture it was no hard matter to perswade him unto
any way which might give satisfaction to his conscience, or content to his
fancy, especially i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it came accompanied with such a change as promised him
the hopes of a son and heir, or at the least of a more lawful and unquestioned
issue. And then what fitter wife could be found out for him than Madam
<hi>Rheene,</hi> one of the daughters of King <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12th. and sister to the wife of
the King then Reigning. By which alliance he might be able to justifie his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
from the bed of <hi>Katherine,</hi> not only against <hi>Charls</hi> her Nephew, but
against all Kings and Emperors in the Christian world, taking the Pope into the
reckoning. A proposition so agreeable to the Kings own thoughts (who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to grow weary of his Queen) that he resolved to buy the amity of <hi>Francis</hi>
at any rate; to which end he not only made a league with him against the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
when the condition of the <hi>French</hi> was almost desperate, but remitted
unto <hi>Francis</hi> a very vast debt, to the value of 500000 Crowns, partly accruing
unto him by some former contracts, and par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly for the payment of forfeiture
incurred by <hi>Charles,</hi> with which the <hi>French</hi> had charged himself by the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulations.</p>
                  <p>And so far matters went on smoothly to the Cardinals wish, and possibly
might have succeeded in all particulars, had not the plot miscaried by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of Viscount <hi>Rochfort,</hi> and the planting of <hi>Anne Bollen</hi> in the Court.
The admirable attractions of which young Lady, had drawn the King so fast unto
her, that in short time he gave her an absolute soverainty over all his thoughts.
But so long he concealed his affections from her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that a great league and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse
was contracted betwixt her and the young Lord <hi>Percy,</hi> the eldest
son of <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Percy,</hi> the 5th. Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> of that Name and Family;
who being brought up in the Cardinals service, had many opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of confirming an acquaintance with her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when either his own pleasure
or his Lords affairs, occasioned his waiting at the Court. But these complian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
on both sides, neither were, nor probably could be so closely caried as not
to come unto the knowledge of the jealous King, impatient of a Rival in his
new affections, and yet resolved to carry the business in such a manner, as to
give no distaste to her whom he so much loved. The Cardinal is therefore
dealt with to remove that obstacle, to which he readily condescended, not look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
further at the present into the design, but that the King intended to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
the young Lady to his private pleasures, as he had done many others
in the times foregoing. A messenger is thereupon dispatched to the Earl of
<hi>Northumberland,</hi> who at his coming to the Court, is informed by the Cardinal,
how unadvisedly the Lord <hi>Percy</hi> had entred himself into the affections of Mrs
<hi>Bollen,</hi> one of the daughters of Viscount <hi>Rochfort,</hi> not only without his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
privity, but against the express will of the King, who was resolved to
dispose otherwise of her. And this he urged upon the strength of an old pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
both then and after exercised by the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> in not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
any of the Nobility to contract mariages, and make alliances with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but by their consents.</p>
                  <p>The old Earl startled at the newes, and fearing nothing more than the Kings
displeasure, calls for his son, and presen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly schools him in this manner. <q>Son,
(quoth he) even as thou art, and ever haste been, a proud, disdainful, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unthtifty Master, so haste thou now declared thy self: Wherefore what joy,
what pleasure, what comfort, or what solace can I conceive in thee?
that thus without discretion hast abused thy self, having neither regard to
me thy natural father, nor to thy natural Soverain Lord the King, to whom
all honest and loyal subjects bear faithful obedience, nor yet to the prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of thy own estate, but hast so unadvisedly ens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ared thy self to her, for
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:66032:185"/>
whom thou hast purchased the Kings high displeasure, intolerable for any
subject to sustain. And but that the King doth consider the lightness of thy
head, and wilful quality of thy person, his displeasure and indignation
were sufficient to cast me and all my posterity into utter ruine and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
But he being my singular good Lord, and favourable Prince, and my
Lord Cardinal my very good friend, hath and doth clearly excuse me in thy
lewdness, and doth rather lament thy folly than malign thee, and hath advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
an order to be taken for thee, to whom both I and you are more bound
than we conceive of. I pray to God that this may be sufficient admonition
to thee, to use thy self more wisely hereafter. For assure thy self, if thou
dost not amend thy prodigality, thou wilt be the last Earl of our house.
For thy natural inclination, thou art masterful and prodigal to consume all
that thy progenitors have with so great travail gathered and kept together
with honour. But having the Kings Majesty my singular good Lord, I trust
(I assure thee) so to order my succession, that thou shalt consume thereof but
a little. For I do not intend (I tell thee truly) to make thee heir, for (thanks
be to God) I have more boys that I trust will use themselves much better,
and prove more like to be wise and honest men, of whom I will chuse the
most likely to succeed me.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So said the much offended father, and yet not thinking he had done enough
for his own security, a marriage is presently concluded for him to the Kings
good liking, with the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> one of the daughters of <hi>George</hi> Lord <hi>

Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury.</hi> Mrs <hi>Anne Bollen</hi> in the mean time is removed by her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the Court, to her no small trouble; who knowing nothing of the
Kings, had willingly admitted the Lord <hi>Percy</hi> into her affections. And under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
by him what had past betwixt him and his father, she conceived such a
mortal grudge against the Cardinal, (whom she looked on as the only cause of
this separation) that she contributed her best assistance to his final ruine. It
was about the time when the Kings cause was to be agitated in the <hi>Legan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Court, that he caused her to be sent for out of the Country, to give her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
on the Queen as in former times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> impatient of a longer absence,
and fearful of a second Rival, if he should any longer conceal his purpose.
Which having taken some fit time to disclose unto her, he found in her a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of such strength against all temptations, that he resolves upon the senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of the divorce, which he little doubted, to take her to him as the last sole
object of his wandring loves. A matter not to be concealed from so many
espials as <hi>Wolsie</hi> had about the King. Who thereupon slackneth his former
pace in the Kings affairs, and secretly practiseth with the Pope to recall the
Commission, whereby he was impowred together with <hi>Campegius,</hi> to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Anne Bollen</hi> formerly offended at his two great haste in breaking

for his being too slow in sentencing the Kings Divorse. On which as she had
built the hopes of her future greatness, so she wanted neither will nor oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to do him ill offices with the King, whom she exasperates against him
upon all occasions. The King growes every day more open in his cariage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her, takes her along with him in his progress, di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in her chamber, and causeth almost all adresses to be made by her in matters of
the greatest moment.</p>
                  <p>Resolved to break through all impediments which stood betwixt him and
the accomplishment of his desires, he first sends back <hi>Campegius</hi> an alien
born, presently caused <hi>Wolsie</hi> to be indicted and attainted in a <hi>premunire,</hi>
and not long after by the counsel of <hi>Thomas Cromwel</hi> (who formerly had been the
Cardinals Solicitor in his <hi>Legantine</hi> Court) involves the whole body of the
Clergy in the same crime with him. By the perswasions of this man, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
the Clergy to acknowledge him for <hi>supreme head on earth</hi> of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> to make no new Canons and Constitutions, nor to execute any such
when made, but by his consent. And having thus brought his own Clergy
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:66032:185"/>
under his command, he was the less solicitous how his matters went in the
Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> to which the Pope recalled his cause, which he either quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
or retarded, as rather stood with his own interess,<note place="margin">1532.</note> than the Kings concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
The King being grown more confident in the equity and justice of
his cause, by the determinations of many of the Universities in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi>
better assured than formerly of his own Clergy at home, and wanting no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
from the <hi>French</hi> King to speed the business, advanced the Lady

him and the <hi>French</hi> King drawing on a pace, he takes her along with him
unto <hi>Calais,</hi> where she entertained both Kings at a curious Mask. At what
time having some communication about the Kings intended mariage, the
<hi>French</hi> encouraged him to proceed, assuring him that if the matter should be
questioned by the Pope or Emperour, (against whom this must make him sure
to the party of <hi>France</hi>) to assist him with his utmost power, what fortune soever
should be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

privately made up on the 14th. of <hi>November</hi> then next following, the sacred
Rites performed by Dr <hi>Rowland Lee,</hi> whom afterwards he preferred to the See
of <hi>Lichfield,</hi> and made Lord President of <hi>Wales.</hi> None present at the Nuptials
but Archbishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> the Father, Mother, and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the new Queen, and possibly some other of the Confidents of either
side, whom it concerned to keep it secret at their utmost peril.</p>
                  <p>But long it could not be concealed. For finding her self to be with child,
she acquaints the King with it, who presently dispatcheth <hi>George</hi> Lord <hi>Roch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi>
her only brother, to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> as well to give the King adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement
of his secret mariage, as to desire him not to fail of performing his
promises if occasion were, and therewithall to crave his counsel and advice
how it was to be published, since it could not long be kept unknown. It is
not to be doubted, but that the <hi>French</hi> King was well pleased with the news
of a mariage, which must needs fasten <hi>England</hi> to the party of <hi>France,</hi> and that
he would be forward enough to perform those promises which seemed so visible
to conduce to his own preservation. And as for matter of advice, it appeared
unnecessary, because the mariage would discover it self by the Queens being
with child, which could no longer be concealed. And being to be concealed
no longer, on <hi>Easter</hi> Eve the twelfth of <hi>April,</hi> she shewed her self openly as
Queen, all necessary officers and attendants are appointed for her; an Order
issueth from the Parliament at that time sitting, that <hi>Katherine</hi> should no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
be called Queen, but <hi>Princesse Dowager. Cranmer</hi> the new Archbishop re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs
to <hi>Dunstable,</hi> erects his Consistory in the Priory there, cites <hi>Katherine</hi> fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
dayes together to appear before him, and in default of her appearance
proceedeth judicially to the sentence, which he reduceth into writing in due
form of Law, and caused it to be openly publish'd (with the consent of his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues)
on <hi>Friday</hi> the 23d. of <hi>May.</hi> And on the Sunday sevennight being

in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> not like to be determined for him, and yet the Pope not
willing to declare against him, till by the solicitation of the Emperour,

their several houses, shutting up such from going out, as were not willing to
accept the benefit of that permission; all such religious persons as departed
thence, to be gratified by the Abbot or Prior with a Priests Gown, and forty
shillings in mony; and all Nuns to be put into a secular habit, and suffered to
go where they would. They took order also, that no men should go into the
houses of women, nor women into the houses of men, but only for the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Divine Service; making thereby that course of life less pleasing unto
either Sex, than it had been formerly. They also inventaried, or else directly

Religious houses, pretending that they took them for the Kings use, but possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
keeping them for their own. And having made a strict and odious inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
into the lives of all the Votaries of both Sexes, they return'd many of
them guilty of exorbitant lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ts, and much carnal uncleanness; representing
their offences in such multiplying glasses, as made them seem both greater in
number, and more horrid in nature, than indeed they were. And in the <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi>
following was held a Parliament, in which all Monasteries, Priories, and
other Religious houses under the yearly value of 200l. were granted unto
the King and his heirs for ever.</p>
                  <p>The number of the Houses then suppressed were said to be 376, their yearly
Rents then valued at the sum of thirty two thousand pounds and upwards,
their movable goods, as they were sold at <hi>Robin Hood</hi>'s penny-worths, amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to one hundred thousand pounds and more. The Religious persons thus
despoiled of their Estates, either betook themselves to some of the greater
Houses of their several Orders, or went again into the world, and followed
such secular businesses as were offered to them towards the getting of their
livings. Much lamentation made in all parts of the Country, for want of that
relief and sustenance which the poor of all sorts received daily from their
hospitality, and for the want of that employment which they found continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in and about those Houses, in their several Trades; insomuch that it was
commonly thought, that more than ten thousand persons, as well Masters as
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:66032:186"/>
Servants, had lost their livelyhoods by that act of suppression. To the passing
whereof, the Bishops and the Mitred Abots, which made the prevalent part of
the House of Peers, contributed their Votes and Suffrages as the other did;
whether it were out of pusillanimity, as not daring to appear in behalf of their
brethren, or out of a weak hope, that the Rapacity of the Queen and her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
would proceed no farther, it is hard to say. Certain it is, that by their
improvident assenting to the present Grant, they made a rod for their own
backs, (as the saying is) with which they were sufficiently scourged within
few years after, till they were all finally whipt out of the Kingdom, though
the new Queen, for whose sake <hi>Cromwel</hi> had contrived the plot, did not live
to see it.</p>
                  <p>For such is the uncertainty of human affairs, that when she thought her self
most safe and free from danger, she became most obnoxious to the ruine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for her. It had pleased God on the eighth of <hi>January</hi> to put an end unto
the calamities of the vertuous but unfortunate Queen, into whose Bed she
had succeeded; the news whereof she entertained with such contentment,
that she caused her self to be apparalled in lighter colours than was agreeable
to the season, or the sad occasion; Whereas if she had rightly understood her
own condition, she could not but have known, that the long life of <hi>Katherine</hi>
was to be her best preservative against all changes, which the Kings loose af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
or any other alterations in affairs of State, were otherwise like to
draw upon her. But this contentment held not long, for within three weeks
after she fell in travail, in which she miscarried of a Son, to the extream grief
of the Mother, and discontent of the Father, who looked upon it as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Gods displeasure, as being as much offended at this second Marriage
as he was at the first. He then began to think of his ill for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>une with both his
Wives, both Mariages subject to dispute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Legitimation of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> as likely to be called in question in the time succeeding, as that
of <hi>Mary</hi> in the former. He much therefore cast about for another wife, of
whose marriage and his issue by her there could arise no con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>roversie, or else
must die without an heir of his own body, or leave the Crown to be contended
for by those, who though they were of his own body, could not be his heirs.
His eye had carried him to a Gentlewoman in the Queens attendance, of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
beauty, and superlative modesty; on the enjoying of whom he so
fixed his thoughts, that he had quite obliterated all remembrance of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
loves. As resolute, but more private in this pursute than he was in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
yet not so private, but that the Queen (so piercing are the eyes of Love
and Jealousie) had took notice of it, and signified her suspitions to him, of
which, more anon.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time she was not wanting in all those honest arts of Love, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequiousness,
and Entertainment, which might endear her to the King, who
now began to be as weary of her gaities and jocular humor, as formerly of the
gravity and reservedness of <hi>Katherine.</hi> And causing many eyes to observe her
actions, they brought him a return of some particulars, which he conceived
might give him a sufficient ground to proceed upon. The Lord <hi>Rochfort,</hi> her
own brother, having some sute to obtain by her of the King, was found whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering
to her on her bed when she was in it; which was interpreted for an act
of some great dishonor done or intended to the King, as if she had permitted
him some farther liberties than were consistent with the innocent familiarity
between brothers and sisters: In the aggravating whereof with all odious cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
none was more forward than the Lady <hi>Rochfort</hi> her self, whether
out of any jealousie which she had of her husband, or whether out of some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate
hatred which she had to the Queen, (according to the peccant humor
of most sisters in law) is not clearly known. It was observed also, that Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Norris,</hi> Groom of the Stool unto the King, had entertained a very dear af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
for her, not without giving himself some hopes of succeeding in the
King's bed, (as Sir <hi>Thomas Seimer</hi> after did) if she chanced to survive him. And
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:66032:187"/>
it appears that she had given him opportunity to make known his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and to acquaint her with his hopes, which she expressed, by twitting
him in a frolick humor with <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

both Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber, were observed also to be very diligent
in their services and addresses to her, which were construed rather to proceed
from love than duty, though no reciprocation could be found to proceed from
her, but what was agreeable to that affability and general debonairness which
she shewed to all men.</p>
                  <p>Out of these premises, weak and imperfect though they were, the King
resolves to come to a conclusion of his aims and wishes. A solemn Tilting was
maintained at <hi>Greenwich</hi> on the first of <hi>May,</hi> at which the King and Queen
were present, the Lord <hi>Rochfort</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Norris</hi> being principal Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengers.
The Queen by chance let fall her handkerchief, which was taken up
by one of her supposed favourits who stood under the window, whom the
King perceived to wipe his face with it. This taken by the King to be done of
purpose, and thereupon he leaves the Queen and all the rest to behold the
Sports, and goe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

place the Queen her self, on the same day, was conducted by Sir <hi>Thomas Aude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
Lord Chancellor, the Duke of <hi>Norfolk, Cromwel</hi> then Master of the Rolls
and principal Secretary, and <hi>Kingston</hi> Lieutenant of the Tower. Informed by
them upon the way of the Kings suspitions, she is said to have fallen upon her
knees, and with dire imprecations to have disavowed the crime (whatsoever it
were) wherewith she was charged; beseeching God so to regard her as the
justness of her cause required. After which, <hi>William Breerton</hi> Esquire, and Sir
<hi>Francis West<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>These persons being thus committed, and the cause made known, the next

                  </floatingText>
                  <p>In appears also by a Letter of Sir <hi>William Kingstons,</hi> that he had much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
with her when she was his prisoner, in which her language seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be broken and distressed betwixt tears and laughter, out of which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could be gathered, but that she exclaimed against <hi>Norris,</hi> as if he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
her. It was further signified in that Letter, that she named some others,
who had obsequiously applied themselves to her love and service, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
such passages, though not sufficient to condemn her, as shewed, she
had made use of the utmost liberty which could be honestly allowed her.
Most true it is, (as far as any truth can be collected from common and credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
reports) that <hi>Norris</hi> being much favoured by the King, was offered pardon
for his life, if he would confess the crimes which he was accused of. To which
he made this generous answer, <hi>That in his conscience he thought her guiltlesse
of the crimes objected, but whether she were or no, he could not accuse her of any thing;
and that he had rather undergo a thousand deaths than betray the innocent.</hi> So that
upon the point there was no evidence against her, but the confession of <hi>Sme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
and the calumnies of the Lady <hi>Rochfort,</hi> of which, the one was fooled into
that confession by the hope of life, which notwithstanding was not pardoned;
and the other most deservedly lost her head within few years after, for being
accessary to the Adulteries of Queen <hi>Katherine Howard.</hi> And yet upon this
Evidence she was arraigned in the great Hall of the Tower of <hi>London</hi> on the
15th. of <hi>May,</hi> and pronounced guilty by her Peers, of which her own father
(which I cannot but behold as an act of the highest tyranny) was compelled
to be one. The Lord <hi>Rochfort</hi> and the rest of the prisoners were found guilty
also, and suffered death on the 17th. day of the same month, all of them stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
stoutly to the Queens and their own integrity; as it was thought that
<hi>Smeton</hi> also would have done, but that he still flattered himself with the hopes
of life, till the loss of his head disabled him from making the retractation. The
like death suffered by the Queen on the second day after, some few permitted
to be present, rather as witnesses than spectators of her final end. And it was so
ordered by the advice of Sir <hi>William Kingston,</hi> who signified in his Letters to
one of the Council, that he conceived it best, that a reasonable number onely
should be present at the Execution, because he found by some discourse
which he had had with her, that she would declare her self to be a good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
for all men, but for the King, at the hour of death. Which declaration
she made good, going with great cheerfulness to the Scaffold, praying most
heartily for the King, and standing constantly on her innocence to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
last.</p>
                  <p>So dyed this great and gallant Lady, one of the most remarkable mockeries
and disports of fortune which these last ages have produced, raised from the
quality of a privat Lady to the bed of a King, crowned on the Throne, and
executed on the Scaffold; the fabrick of her power and glories being six years
at the least in building, but cast down in an instant; the splendor and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
of her Coronation seeming to have no other end, but to make her the
more glorious Sacrifice at the next alteration of the Kings affections. But her
death was not the onely mark which the King did aim at; If she had onely lost
her head, though with the loss of her honor, it would have been no bar to
her daughter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> from succeeding her father in the Throne, and he must
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:66032:188"/>
have his bed left free from all such pretensions, the better to draw on the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
mariage. It was thought necessary therefore, that she should be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from his bed by some other means than the Axe or Sword, and to be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
divorced from her in a Court of Judicature, when the sentence of death
might seem to have deprived her of all means, as well as of all manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to dispute the point. Upon which ground <hi>Norris</hi> is practised with to
confess the Adultery, and the Lord <hi>Percy</hi> (now Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi>) who
was known to have made love unto her in her former times, to acknowledge a
Contract. But as <hi>Norris</hi> gallantly denyed the one, so the Lord <hi>Percy</hi> could
not be induced (though much laboured to it) to confess the other. For proof
whereof we have this Letter of his own hand writing, directed to Secretary
<hi>Cromwel</hi> in these following words.</p>

not the Contract proved, some other ground was found out to dissolve
the mariage; though what it was doth not appear upon Record. All which

the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (the only issue of this mariage) to be illegitimate. What
else concerns this unfortunate Lady, together with some proof of divers
things before delivered, cannot be more pathetically expressed, than by her
self, bemoaning her misfortunes to the King, in this following Letter.</p>

                  <p>I had not dwelt so long upon the story of this Queen, but that there is so
much which depends upon it in reference to the Honour, Birth and Title of
the Princess <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> whose Reign of 44 years, accompanied with so many
signal blessings both at home and abroad, is used by some for a strong Argument
of her mothers innocence. For further proof whereof, they behold the Kings
precipitate and hasty mariage, casting himself into the bed of a third, before the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:66032:189"/>
sword was dried from the blood of his second wife. But of these miseries and
calamit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es which befel her mother, the Princess was too young (as not being
fully three years old) to take any notice. And when she came unto the years
of understanding, she had been much sweetned and repaired by her fathers
goodness, By whose last will she was assured of her turn in the succession to
the Crown, if her brother and sister died without lawful issue; allowed the
same yearly maintenance, and allotted the same portion in mariage, with the
Princess <hi>Mary.</hi> But nothing more declares his good affection to her, than
the great care he took of her education; committed to the government and
tuition of <hi>Roger Ascam,</hi> a right learned man, she attained unto the knowledge
of the Greek and Latine; and by the help of other School-masters, of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Languages. Insomuch that she very well understood the Greek, and was
able readily to express her self in the Latine tongue; as appears by an Oration
which she made at her entertainment in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and the smart answer which
she gave <hi>ex tempore</hi> to a Polish Ambassador, of which we may hear more in
their proper place. And as for the <hi>Italian</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> she spake them with
as much facility and elegance, as if they had been natural to her. And if some
times she made use of Interpreters when she conversed with the Ambassadors
of forein Princes, it rather was to keep her State, than that she could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
discourse with them in their proper languages. Her person may be
best known by her pictures, and the perfections of her mind by her following
government. Suffice it in this place to know, that she seemed to be made up
of Modesty and Majesty in an equal mixture; and was so moderate in the course
and ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iage of her desires, that King <hi>Edward</hi> (who took much delight in her
conversation) used commonly to call her his <hi>Sister Temperance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet notwithstanding all these personal Graces, I do not find that she was
sought in mariage in the time of King <hi>Henry;</hi> the blots of infamy which had
been laid upon her Mother,<note place="margin">1550.</note> serving as a bar to her preferment amongst forein
Princes. In the beginning of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s, she was aimed at by Sr <hi>Thomas
Seymour,</hi> a brother of the Lord Protector <hi>Sommersets,</hi> for the advancing of
his lofty and ambitious projects.<note place="margin">1552.</note> And in the latter end thereof, propounded
to the eldest son of the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi> But it was propounded only and
not persued, whether neglected by that King for the former reason, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by her own aversness from mariage, we are yet to seek. But in the first
year of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> she was desired by <hi>Edward Courtney</hi> Earl of <hi>Devonshire,</hi>
the eldest son of <hi>Henry</hi> Marquiss of <hi>Exeter,</hi> descended from a daughter of King
<hi>Edward</hi> the 4th. which proved so much to the displeasure of the Queen, that it
became dangerous to both of them, as was shewed before. For notice of the
Queens displeasure having been took by some of great place about her, they
were both d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>awn into suspicion of being privy at the least unto <hi>Wiat's</hi> rebellion,
(raised on the noise of the Queens mariage with the Prince of <hi>Spain</hi>) both of
them clapt in prison upon that account, and so detained for a long time, though
both acquitted publickly by <hi>Wiat</hi> at the time of his death.</p>
                  <p>But nothing so much alienated the Queens affection from her, as the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
which was between them in the cause of Religion, occasioned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
by their several interests. For it concerned Queen <hi>Mary</hi> to maintain
the Pope and his Religion, her mothers marriage not being otherwise to be
defended as good and lawful but by his authority, which marriage, if by his
authority made good and lawfull, then must the marriage of <hi>Anne Bollen</hi> be
made unlawful, and consequently the Princess <hi>Elizabeth</hi> must actually be made
illegitimate by the same authority. Upon which point, as the Queen laboured
nothing more than the restoring of the Pope to that Supremacy of which he
had been deprived by the two last Kings; so kept she a hard hand upon her sister,
as of a different Religion from her, the visible Head of the Protestant party
in the Kingdom, and one whom she suspected to have more hearts amongst the
Subjects than she had her self. Upon the first surmise of her being privy to
<hi>Wyat</hi>'s conspiracy, Sir <hi>Edward Hastings</hi> and some others were sent to bring her
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:66032:189"/>to the Court from her house at <hi>Ashrsdge,</hi> where though they found her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
sick, and unfit for travel, yet they compelled her to go with them on
the morrow after. Being come unto the Court, she was first kept prisoner in
her chamber for the space of a fortnight, neither permitted to come to the
Queens presence, nor suffered without much difficulty to write unto her.
Charged by the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> and some other Lords with <hi>Wyat</hi>'s pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
she stoutly stood on the denyall, professing her fidelity and loyalty to
the Queen her sister. Which notwithstanding she was conveied by water, on the
<hi>Sunday</hi> commonly called <hi>Palm-Sunday,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">March 18. 1553.</note> to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> the people
being commanded to keep their Churches, for fear she might be rescued and
took from them who were to have the conduct of her; by whom compelled to
land at the private Stairs, generally called <hi>The Traitors Stairs,</hi> she openly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<hi>That there landed as true a Subject, being a Prisoner, as ever landed in that
place;</hi> and so was brought unto the Lodgings appointed for her, all doors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
locked and bolted on her, to her great amazement. <hi>Gage</hi> Constable of the
Tower, and at that time Lord Chamberlain also, was her bitter enemy, but
more for love to the Pope than for hate to her person, and did not on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ly place
a strong Guard about her, but suffered none but those of that ragged Regiment
to carry up her dyet to her. Of which, complaint being made to him by some
of her servants, he threatned to lay them in such a place where they should nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
see the Sun nor Moon, if they troubled him any more about it; though
afterwards it was otherwise ordered by the Lords of the Council.</p>
                  <p>Wearied with the closeness of her imprisonment, she moved the Lord
<hi>Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>dois</hi> and the Lord Chamberlain, the one of which was Constable, and the
other Lieutenant of the Tower, that she might have the liberty of walking in
the private Garden, or at the least in the Queens Lodgings, for her better health.
In which, not able to gratifie her by their own authority, the Lord <hi>Chandois</hi>
obtained leave of the Lords of the Council that she might walk in the Queens
Lodgings, himself, the Lord Chamberlain, and three of the Queens Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women
being still in her company; permitted afterwards to enjoy the benefit
of the private Garden, the doors were always shut upon her, and order given,
that no Prisoners should be suffered by their Keepers to look out of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
so long as she was walking in it. Such care there was to hinder all access
unto her, and opportunity of conference with her, that a little Boy of four
years old was threatned to be whipt for presenting her with flowers and nose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gays,
and a command given by <hi>Gage</hi> that the Boy's father should keep him at
home, and not suffer him to come thither any more. But the Tower being
thought to be no safe prison for a person of such eminent quality, by reason of
its nearness to the capital City, and the great number of prisoners which
were kept therein, she was committed to the custody of Sir <hi>Henry Bedingfield,</hi>
a man of an untractable and rugged nature,<note place="margin">1554.</note> by whom she was conducted with
a guard of soldiers to the Mannor of <hi>Woodstock,</hi> which journey she began on the
19th. of <hi>May</hi> being <hi>Trinity</hi> Sunday, and ended by short and easie stages on the
Thursday after; her own servants sometimes sequestred from her by command
of her Jaylor, (as she commonly called him) the people sometimes rated and
reviled by him for flocking to see her as she passed, and the Lord <hi>Williams,</hi>
though associated in Commission with him, openly quarrelled and reproached
for giving her a noble Entertainment at his house of <hi>Ricolt.</hi> Being brought to
<hi>Woodstock,</hi> she was kept under many locks and bolts, a guard of Russians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
attending before her dores, and the keys every night brought up to
<hi>Reding field,</hi> who suffered no access unto her upon any occasion; Which being
made known to the Lord <hi>Williams,</hi> he sollicited the Queen that she might be
prisoner in his house, and offered to be surety for her, and was in such a fair
way of obtaining his sute, that he caused preparations to be made for her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception;
but either by the interposition of the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> her most
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:66032:190"/>
mortal enemy, or the sollicitation of <hi>Bedingfield,</hi> who possibly might have some
other end to work upon her, no effect followed answerably to that expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>About this time she was advised by some of her friends to submit her self
unto the Queen, which they conceived would be very well taken, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound

That she would never make any submission to them against whom she never

Certain it is, that she resorted to the <hi>Mass</hi> both before and after, and seemed
not a little discontented that she could not gain so much upon the Queen by
her outward conformity, as to believe that she was catholickly affected. But
the Queen was not the onely one who believed so of her, though she behaved
her self so warily as not to come within the danger of the Laws, for acting
any thing in opposition unto that Religion which was then established. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which there goes a story, that when a Popish Priest had urged her very
earnestly to declare her judgment touching the Presence of Christ in the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Sacrament; she very cautelously resolved the point in these following
Verses:
<q>
                        <l>'Twas God the word that spake it,</l>
                        <l>He took the bread and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <l>And what the Word did make it,</l>
                        <l>That I believe and take it.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But all this caution notwithstanding, her aversness from the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> was known sufficiently, not to be altered while she lived, and therefore
she to live no longer to be the occasion of continual fears and jealousies to the
Catholick party. The times were then both sharp and bloody, and a great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
was designed against the Protestants in all parts of the Kingdom; At

be like to bring him any children to succeed in the Crown, and hoped by such
a signall favour to oblige the Princess to accept him for her husband, on the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:66032:190"/>Queens decease, by means whereof, he might still continue Master of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and strength of <hi>England,</hi> in all his wars against the <hi>French,</hi> or any other
Nation which maligned the greatness of the <hi>Austrian</hi> Family. Upon which
grounds he dealt so effectually with the Queen, that order was given about a
fortnight after <hi>Easter</hi> to the Lord <hi>Williams</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Bedingfield</hi> to bring
their prisoner to the Court; which command was not more cheerfully exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
by the one,<note place="margin">1555.</note> than stomach'd and repin'd at by the other. Being brought
to <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, where the Queen then lay, she was conducted by a back
way to the Prince's Lodgings, where she continued a fortnight and more
without being seen or sent to by any body, <hi>Bedingfield</hi> and his guards being
still about her; so that she seemed to have changed the place, but not the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and to be so much nearer danger, by how much she was nearer unto
those who had power to work it. At last, a visit was bestowed upon her, but
not without her earnest sute in that behalf, by the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> Lord
Chancellor, the Earls of <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Shrewsbery,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Peter,</hi>
whom she right joyfully received, desiring them to be a means unto the Queen that
she might be freed from that restraint, under which she had been kept so long together.</p>
                  <p>Which being said, the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> kneeling down, besought her to
submit her self to the Queen, that being, as he said, the onely probable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to effect her liberty. To whom she answered as before, that rather than
she would betray her innocence by such submission, she would be content to
lie in prison all the days of her life. For by so doing, (said she) I must confess
my self to be an offender, which I never was against her Majesty, in thought,
word, or deed; and where no just offence is given, there needs no submission.
Some other Overtures being made to the same effect, but all unto as little
purpose, she is at last brought before the Queen (whom she had not seen in
more than one year before) about ten of the clock at night; before whom
falling on her knees, she desired God to preserve her Malesty, not doubting,
as she said, but that she should prove her self to be as good a Subject to her
Majesty, as any other whosoever. Being first dealt with by the Queen to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
some offence against her self, and afterwards to acknowledge her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment
not to be unjust, she absolutely refused the one, and very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely
declined the other. So that no good being to be gotten on her on
either hand, she was dismissed with some uncomfortable words from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Enterview, and about a week after was discharged of <hi>Bedingfield</hi> and his
guard of soldiers. It was reported, that King <hi>Philip</hi> stood behind the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and hearkned unto every word which passed between them, to the end,
that if the Queen should grow into any extremity, he might come in to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
her displeasures, and calm her passions. He knew full well, how passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
this Princess was beloved by the English Nation, and that he could
not at the present more endear himself to the whole body of the people, than
by effecting her enlargment; which shortly after being obtained, she was
permitted to retire to her own houses in the Country, remaining sometimes
in one, and sometimes in another, but never without fear of being remand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto prison, till the death of <hi>Gardiner,</hi> which hapned on the 12th.
of <hi>November</hi> then next following. Some speech there was, and it was earnestly
endeavoured by the Popish Party, of marrying her to <hi>Emanuel Philebert</hi>
Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> as being a Prince that lived far off, and where she could give no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to any male-contented party in the Realm of <hi>England;</hi> Against
which, none so much opposed as the King, who had a designe on her for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as before is said; and rather for himself than for <hi>Charls</hi> his son (though it
be so affirmed by <hi>Cambden</hi>) the Princess being then in the twenty second
year of her age, whereas the young Prince was not above seven or eight. So that
a resolution being finally fixed of keeping her within the Kingdom, she lived
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:66032:191"/>afterwards for the most part with less vexations, but not without many watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
eyes upon all her actions, till it pleased God to call her to the Crown
of <hi>England.</hi> She had much profited by the Pedagogie of <hi>Ascham,</hi> and the
rest of her Schoolmasters, but never improved her self so much as in the School of
Affliction, by which she learned the miseries incident to Subjects, when
they groan under the displeasure of offended Princes; that the displeasures of
some Princes are both made and cherished by the art of their Ministers, to the
undoing of too many innocent persons who do less deserve it; that it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
necessary, that the ears of Princes should be open unto all complaints,
and their hands ready to receive Petitions from all sorts of people, to the end
that knowing their grievances and distresses, they may commiserate them in
the one, and afford them remedy in the other; that a good Prince must have
somewhat in him of the Priest, who if he be not sensible of the infirmities of
his brethren, cannot be thought to intercede so powerfully in their behalf,
as when he hath been touched with the true sense and feeling of their extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities;
and finally, that the School is never better governed, than by one who
hath past through all the forms and degrees thereof, and having been perfectly
trained up in the ways of obedience, must know the better how to use both
the <hi>Rod</hi> and <hi>Ferula</hi> when he comes to be Master of the rest.</p>

was brought unto the Lords in the House of Peers. The
newes by reason of the Queens long sickness, not so strange
unto them, as to take them either unresolved or unprovided for the declaring
of their duty to the next successor; though some of them perhaps had some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
wishes that the Crown might have fallen rather upon any o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>her, than upon
her to whom it did of right belong; so that upon a short debate amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
a message is sent to the Speaker of the House of Commons, desiring
him, and all the Members of that House, to come presently to them, upon a
business of no small importance, to the good of the Kingdom. Who being
come, the Lord Chancellor <hi>Heath,</hi> with a composed and setled countenance,
not without sorrow enough for the death of the one, or any discontent for
the succession of the other, declared unto them in the name of the rest of the
Lords, that God had taken to his mercy the late Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and that the
succession to the Crown did belong of right to the Princess <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whose
Title they conceived to be free from all legal questions; that in such cases no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was more necessary than expedition, for the preventing of all such
plots and practices of any discontented or ambitious persons, as might be set
on foot to the disturbance of the common quiet; and therefore that there
concurrence was desired in proclaiming the new Queen with all speed that
might be, they being then so opportunely convened together as the Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees
of the whole body of the Commons of the Realm of <hi>England;</hi> Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
said, the Knights and Burgestes gave a ready consent to that which they had
no reason to deny; and they which gave themselves some thoughts of incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
otherwise, conceived their opposition to the general Vote, neither safe
nor seasonable. So that immediately the Princess <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was proclaimed
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:66032:192"/>by the King at Arms, first before <hi>Westminster</hi> Hall door in
the Palace Yard, in the presence of the Lords and Commons, and not long after at the Cross in
<hi>Cheapside,</hi> and other places in the City, in the presence of the Lord Mayor, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen,
and principal Citizens, to the great joy of all peaceable and well-affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
people.</p>
                     <p>It was not long before the Princess had advertisement of the death of her
sister, together with the general acknowledgement of her just and lawful. Title
to the Crown Imperial. The newes whereof being brought unto her by some
of the Lords, she prepared for her removal from <hi>Hatfield</hi> on the <hi>Saturday</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
(being the 19th. of that month) and with a great and Royal train set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to <hi>London.</hi> At <hi>Higate</hi> four miles from the City, she was met by all the
Bishops then living, who presented themselves before her upon their knees,
in testimony of their loyalty and affection to her. In which address as she see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to express no small contentment, so she gave to each of them particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
her hand to kiss, except only unto <hi>Bonner</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> whose bloody
butcheries had render'd him uncapable in her opinion of so great a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
At her first coming to the City she took her lodging in the <hi>Charter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,</hi>
where she staid some days, till all things in the Tower might be fitted and
prepared for her reception. Attended by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, with a
stately strain of Lords and Ladies, and their several followers, She entreth
by <hi>Cripple gate</hi> into the City, passeth along the wall till she came to <hi>Bishops
gate,</hi> where all the Companies of the City in their several Liveries waited
her coming in their proper and distinct rancks, reaching from thence until the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end of <hi>Mark Lane,</hi> where she was entertained with a peal of great Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
from the Tower. At her entrance into which place, she render'd her
most humble thanks to Almighty God for the great and wondrous change of
her condition, in bringing her from being a prisoner in that place, to be the
Prince of her people, and now to take possession of it as a Royal Palace, in
which before she had received so much discomfort. Here she remained till
the 5th. day of <hi>December</hi> then next following, and from thence removed by
water unto <hi>Sommerset</hi> House. In each remove she found such infinite throngs
of people, who flocked from all parts to behold her, both by land and water,
and testified their publick joy by such loud acclamations, as much rejoyced
her heart to hear, and could not but express it in her words and countenance,
by which she doubled their affections, and made her self the absolute Mistriss at
all times of their hands and purses. She had been forged upon the anvil of
adversity, which made her of so fine a temper, that none knew better than her
self how to keep her State, and yet descend unto the meanest of her subjects
in a popular Courtship.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the Lords of the Council had given Order for the stopping
of all Ports and Havens, that no intelligence of the Queens death might be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
out of the Realm, by which any disturbance might be plotted or contrived
against it, till all things were setled here at home. But finding such a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
concurrence in all sorts of people, in acknowledging her just and lawful Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
testified by so many outward signs of a publick joy, that there was no fear
of any danger from abroad, that bar was speedily removed, and the Ports open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as before to all sorts of passengers. And in the next place care was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for sending new Commissions unto such Embassadors as resided in the
Courts of several Princes, both to acquaint them with the change, and to assure
those Princes of the Queens desire to maintain all former leagues between
them and the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> but more particular instructions were dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to her Agent in the Court of <hi>Spain;</hi> to whom it was given in charge to
represent unto the King, the dear remembrance which she kept of those many
humanities received from him in the time of her troubles. Instructions are
sent also to Sir <hi>Edward Karn,</hi> the late Queens Agent with the Pope, and now
confirmed by her in the same imployment, to make his Holiness acquainted
with the death of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and her succession to the Crown, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:66032:192"/>out some desire that all good offices might be reciprocally exchanged between
them. But the Pope answered hereunto (according to his accustomed ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour)
<q>That the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> was held in <hi>Fee</hi> of the Apostolick See;
that she could not succeed being illegitimate; that he could not contradict
the declarations of <hi>Clement</hi> the 7th and <hi>Paul</hi> the 3d. that it was a great
boldness to assume the name and government of it without him; yet being
desirous to shew a fatherly affection, if she will renounce her pretensions,
and refer her self wholly to his free disposition, he will do whatsoever may
be done with the honour of the Apostolick See.</q> To the making of which
sudden answer, though there needed no other instigation of his own rough
nature, yet many thought that he was put upon it by some Ministers of the
Court of <hi>France,</hi> who fearing nothing more than that <hi>Philip</hi> will endeavour
by a second mariage, to assure himself of the possession of the Realm of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and to that end sollicit for a dispensation to make way unto it, thought
it expedient to prevent those practices in the first beginning, by putting the
Pope upon such counsels, as would be sure to dash all his hopes that way.</p>
                     <p>But the new Queen having perform'd this office of civility to him, as she did
to others, expected not the coming back of any answer, not took much
thought of it when she heard it. She knew full well, that her legitimation
and the Popes supremacy could not stand together, and that she could not
possibly maintain the one, without a discarding of the other. But in this case
it concerned her to walk very warily, and not to unmask her self too much at
once, for fear of giving an alarum to the Papal party, before she had put her self
into a posture of ability to make good her actions. Many who were imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the cause of Religion, she restored to liberty at her first coming to the
Crown. Which occasioned <hi>Rainsford,</hi> a Buffonly Gentleman of the Court, to
make a sute to her in the behalf of <hi>Mathew, Mark, Luke,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who had
been long imprisoned in a Latine Translation, that they also might be restored
to liberty, and walk abroad as formerly in the English Toung. To whom
she presently made answer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That he should first endeavour to know the minds
of the Prisoners, who perhaps desired no such liberty as was demanded. Which
notwithstanding, upon a serious debate of all particulars, she was resolved to
proceed to a reformation, as the times should serve. In order whereunto, she
constitutes her Privy Council, which she compounds of such ingredients, as
might neither give encouragement to any of those who wish'd well to the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or alienate their affections from her, whose hearts were more
inclined to the Reformation. Of such as had been of the Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

To which last, being then Attorney of the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and one that
had been much employed by her in some former services which had relation
to the Law, she committed the custody of the Great Seal on the 22 of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi>
the Title of Lord Chancellor remaining to Archbishop <hi>Heath</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it did, and that of the Lord keeper being given to <hi>Bacon:</hi> Which being a
new Title, and consequently subject unto some disputes, an Act was passed
in the second Parliament of her Reign for investing the said new Lord <hi>Keeper,</hi>
and all that should from thenceforth enjoy that Office, with all the Powers,
Privileges, and Preheminences which antiently had been exercised and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
by the Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> and for confirming of all sentences
and decrees in <hi>Chancery,</hi> which had or should be made by the said Lord Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
in all times to come. The like mixture she also caused to be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
other her subordinate Ministers, in adding such new Commissioners
for the Peace in every County, as either were known to be of the Reformed
Religion, or to wish well to it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="104" facs="tcp:66032:193"/>The preferring of so many of the Protestant party, as well to places of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
in their several Countries, as to the ranck and dignity of Privy
Counsellors, and the refusal of her hand to Bishop <hi>Bonner</hi> at her very first
comming to the Crown, were taken to be strong presumptions (as indeed
they were) that she intended to restore the Reformed Religion. And as the
Papists, in the first beginning of the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> hoping thereby the
better to obtain her favour, began to build new Altars, and set up the Mass,
before they were required so to do by any publick Authority; so fared it now
with many unadvised Zelots amongst the Protestants, who measuring the
Queens affections by their own, or else presuming that their errors would be
taken for an honest zeal, employed themselves as busily in the demolishing of
Altars, and defacing of Images, as if they had been licenced and commanded
to it by some legal warrant. It hapned also, that some of the Ministers which
remained at home, and others which returned in great numbers from beyond
the Seas, had put themselves into the Pulpits, and bitterly inveighed against
the superstitions and corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Popish Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
did the like, and were not sparing of invectives against the others, whom
they accused of Heresies, Schisms, and Innovation in the Worship of God.
For the suppressing of which disorders on the one side, and those common
disturbances on the other, the Queen set out two Proclamations much about
one time, by one of which it was commanded, that no man, of what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
soever he was in the points of Religion, should be suffered from
thenceforth to preach in publick, but onely such as should be licensed by her
authority; and that all such as were so licensed or appointed, should forbear
preaching upon any point which was matter of Controversie, and might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
rather to exasperate than to calm mens passions. Which Proclamation
was observed with such care and strictness, that no Sermon was preached at
St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Cross or any publick place in <hi>London,</hi> till the <hi>Easter</hi> following:
At what time the Sermons which were to be preached in the <hi>Spittle</hi> (according
to the antient custom) were performed by Doctor <hi>Bill</hi> the <hi>Almoner</hi> to the
Queen, and afterwards the first Dean of <hi>Westminster</hi> of the Queens foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
Doctor <hi>Richard Cox</hi> formerly Dean of <hi>Westminster,</hi> preferred in short time
after to the See of <hi>Ely,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robert Horn</hi> (of whom mention hath been
made before at the troubles of <hi>Franckfort</hi>) advanced not long after to the See
of <hi>Winchester.</hi> The Rehearsal Sermon, accustomably preached at St. <hi>Pauls</hi>
Crosse on the Sunday following, was undertook by Doctor <hi>Thomas Sampson</hi>
then newly returned from beyond the Seas, and after most unhappily made
Dean of <hi>Christ-church.</hi> But so it chanced, that when he was to go into the
Pulpit, the dore was locked, and the key thereof not to be found, so that a
Smith was sent for to break open the dore; and that being done, the like ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
was found of cleansing and making sweet the place, which by a long
disuse had contracted so much filth and nastiness, as rendred it unfit for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Preacher.</p>
                     <p>By the other Proclamation which was published on the 30th. of <hi>December,</hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t was enjoyned, That no man of what quality or degree soever, should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to alter any thing in the state of Religion, or innovate in any of the
rites and ceremonies thereunto belonging, but that all such rites and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
should be observed in all Parish Churches of the Kingdom, as were
then used and retained in her Majesties Chapel, until some further order
should be taken in it. Onely it was permitted, and withall required, that the
Letany, the Lords Prayer, the Creed, and the Ten Commandments, should
be said in the English tongue, and that the Epistle and the Gospel, at the time
of the High Mass, should be read in English, which was accordingly
done in all the Churches of <hi>London</hi> on the next Sunday after,
being New-years day, and by degrees in all the other Churches of the
Kingdom also. Further than this, she thought it not convenient to proceed
at the present, but that she had commanded the Priest or Bishop (for some
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:66032:193"/>say it was the one,<note place="margin">An. Reg. Eliz. 1. 1558/9.</note> and some the other) who officiated at the Altar in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Royal,
not to make any Elevation of the Sacrament, the better to prevent
that adoration which was given unto it, and which she could not suffer to be
done in her sight without a most apparent wrong to her judgment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;
Which being made known in other places, and all other Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
commanded to conform themselves to the example of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
the elevation was forborn also in most other places, to the great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
and trouble of the <hi>Popish</hi> party. And though there was no further
progress toward a Reformation by any publick Act or Edict, yet secretly a
Reformation in the form of Worship, and consequently in point of Doctrine, was both intended and projected. For making none acquainted with her se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
purposes but the Lord Marquis of <hi>Northampton, Francis</hi> Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi>
Sir <hi>John Gray</hi> of <hi>Pergo,</hi> (one of the late Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi>'s brothers) and Sir
<hi>William Cecil;</hi> she committed the reviewing of the former Litutgy to the care
of Doctor <hi>Parker,</hi> Doctor <hi>Gryndal,</hi> Doctor <hi>Cox,</hi> Doctor <hi>Pilkington,</hi> Doctor
<hi>Bill,</hi> Doctor <hi>May,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Whitehead,</hi> together with Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of the Laws, a very learned, moderate, and judicious Gentleman. But
what they did, and what preferments they attained to on the doing of it, we
shall see anon, wheu we shall find the Book reviewed, confirmed by Act
of Parliament, and executed in all parts of the Kingdom, as that Act re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
                     <p>But first, some publick Acts of State, and great Solemnities of Court are
to be performed. The Funeral of the Queen deceased solemnised on the 13th.
of <hi>December</hi> at the Abbey of <hi>Westminster,</hi> and the Sermon preached by Doctor
<hi>White</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> seemed onely as a preamble to the like So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
performed at the said place about ten days after, in the Obsequies of
<hi>Charls</hi> the 5th. which mighty Emperor having first left the world by resigning
his Kingdoms, and retiring himself into a Monastery, as before was said, did
after leave his life also in <hi>September</hi> last; and now upon the 24th. of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<hi>December</hi> a solemn Obsequie was kept for him in the wonted form, a rich
Hearse being set up for him in the Church of <hi>Westminster,</hi> magnificently co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with a Pall of gold, his own Embassador serving as the principal Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and all the great Lords and Officers about the Court attending on the
same in their rancks and orders. And yet both these, though stately and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestical
in their several kinds, came infinitely short of those Pomps and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
which were prepared and reserved for the Coronation. As a Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereunto, she passed from <hi>Westminster</hi> to the <hi>Tower</hi> on the 12th. of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi>
attended by the Lord Mayor, the Aldermen, and other Citizens, in
their Barges, with the Banners and Escutcheons of their several Companies,
loud Musick sounding all the way; and the next day she restored some unto
their old, and advanced others to new honors, according to her own
fancy and their deservings. The Marquis of <hi>Northampton,</hi> who had lain under
an Attaindure ever since the first beginning of the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
in blood, with all his Titles and Estates. The Lord <hi>Edward Seimer,</hi>

                     <p>The ordinary acts of grace and favour being thus dispatched, she prepares

                           </gap>se for ever. Amen.</hi> Which said, she
mounted into her Chariot with so cleer a spirit, as if she had been made for
that dayes solemnity. Entertained all the way she went with the joyful shouts
and acclamations of <hi>God save the Queen,</hi> which she repaid with such a modest
affability, and so good a grace, that it drew tears of joy from the eyes of some,
with infinite prayers and thanksgiving from the hearts of all; but nothing
more indeared her to them, than the accepting of an English Bible richly
gilt, which was let down unto her from one of the Pageants, by a child repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
<hi>Truth.</hi> At the sight whereof she first kissed both her hands, with both
her hands she received the book, which first she kiss'd and after laid unto her
bosome, (as the nearest place unto her heart) giving the City greater thanks for
that excellent Gift, than for all the rest, which plentifully had been that day
bestowed upon her, and promised to be diligent in the reading of it. By which,
and many other acts of a popular piety, with which she passed away that day,
she did not only gain the hearts of all them that saw her, but they that saw
her did so magnifie her most eminent Graces, that they procured the like affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the hearts of all others also.</p>
                     <p>On the next morning with like magnificence and splendor, she is attended
to the Church of St <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Westminster,</hi> where she was crowned according to
the Order of the <hi>Roman Pontifical,</hi> by Dr <hi>Owen Oglethorp,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carlisle,</hi>
the only man among all the Bishops, who could be wrought on by her to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
that office. Whether it were that they saw some alteration coming, to
which they were resolved not to yield conformity, so that they could not be in
a worse case upon this refusal, than they should be otherwise; or that they
feared the Popes displeasure, if they should do an act so contrary unto his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions,
without leave first granted; or that they had their own particular
animosities and spleens against her, (as the Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> particularly for
his being deprived of the seal) is not certainly known. None more condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for the refusal, than the Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> as one that had received his first
preferments from the King her father, and who complyed so far in the time
of King <hi>Edward,</hi> as to assist in the composing of the publick Liturgy, and
otherwise appeared as forward in the reformation, as any other of that Order.
So that no reason can be given either for his denial now to perform that service,
or afterwards for his not complying with the Queens proceedings, but that
he had been one of those which were sent to <hi>Rome</hi> to tender the submission
of the Kingdom to the Pope still living, and could not now appear with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in any such action, as seemed to carry with it a repugnancy (if not a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
inconsistency) with the said ingagement. It cannot be denyed but that
there were three Bishops living of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s making, all of them zealously
affected to the reformation. And possibly it may seem strange that the Queen
received not the Crown rather from one of their hands, than to put her self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hazard of so many denyals as had been given her by the others. But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this it may be answered, that the said Bishops at that time were deprived
of their Sees, (but whether justly or unjustly, could not then be questioned)
and therefore not in a capacity to perform that service. Besides, there being
at that time no other form established for a Coronation, than that which had
much in it of the Ceremonies and superstitions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> she
was not sure that any of the said three Bishops would have acted in it, without
such alterations and omissions in the whole course of that Order, as might have
render'd the whole action questionable amongst captious men, and therefore
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:66032:194"/>finally she thought it more conducible to her reputation amongst forein Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to be Crowned by the hands of a Catholick Bishop (or one at least
which was accounted to be such) than if it had been done by any of the other
Religion.</p>
                     <p>And now the Parliament draws on, summoned to begin on the 25th. of
that month, being the Anniversary day of St <hi>Paul</hi>'s conversion; a day which
seemed to carry some good <hi>Omen</hi> in it, in reference to that great work of the
Reformation which was therein to be established. The Parliament opened
with an eloquent and learned Sermon preached by Dr <hi>Cox,</hi> a man of good cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
with the Queen, and of no less esteem with the Lords and Commons, who
caried any good affection to the memory of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th. The chusing
of which man to perform that service, was able of it self to give some intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Queens design to most of the Auditors; though to say truth, the
Bishops refusing to perform the Ceremony of the Coronation, had made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
uncapable of a further trust. Nor could the Queens design be so closely
caried, but that such Lords and Gentlemen as had the managing of elections in
their several Countries, retained such men for Members of the House of
Commons, as they conceived most likely to comply with their intentions for
a Reformation. Amongst which none appeared more active than <hi>Thomas How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>
Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> whom the Queen had taken into her Council; <hi>Henry
Fitz-allen</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> whom she continued in the Office of Lord <hi>Steward,</hi>
and Sir <hi>William Coecil,</hi> whom she had restored to the place of Secretary, to
which he had been raised by King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th. Besides, the Queen was
young, unmaried, and like enough to entertain some thoughts of an husband;
so that it can be no great marvel, not only if many of the Nobility, but some
even of the Gentry also, flattered themselves with possibilities of being the
man whom she might chuse to be her partner in the Regal Diadem. Which
hopes much smoothed the way to the accomplishment of her desires, which
otherwise might have proved more rugged and unpassable than it did at the
present. Yet notwithstanding all their care, there wanted not some rough and
furious spirits in the House of Commons, who eagerly opposed all propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which seemed to tend unto the prejudice of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Of
which number none so violent as <hi>Story</hi> Dr. of the Lawes, and a great instrument
of <hi>Bonner</hi>'s butcheries in the former Reign. Who being questioned for the
cruelty of his executions, appeared so far from being sensible of any errour
which he then committed, as to declare himself to be sorry for nothing more,
than that instead of lopping off some few boughs and branches, he did not lay
his axe to the root of the tree; and though it was not hard to guess at how
high a mark the wretches malice seemed to aim, and what he meant by laying
his axe to the root of the tree; yet passed he unpunished for the present,
though divine vengeance brought him in conclusion to his just reward. Others
there were, and doubt less many others also in the House of Commons, who
had as great zeal as he to the Papal interess, but either had more modesty in the
conduct of it, or preferred their duty and allegiance to their natural Prince,
before their zeal to the concernments of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this Parliament there passed an act for recognizing the Queens just Title
to the Crown; but without any Act for the validity of her mothers mariage,
on which her Title most depended. For which neglect most men condemned
the new Lord Keeper, on whose judgement she relied especially in point of
Law; in whom it could not but be looked on as a great incogitancy, to be less
careful of her own and her mothes honour, than the Ministers of the late
Queen <hi>Mary</hi> had been of hers. But <hi>Bacon</hi> was not to be told of an old Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Maxim,
<hi>That the Crown takes away all defects and stops in blood, and that from
the time that the Queen did assume the Crown, the fountain was cleared, and all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainders
and corruption of blood discharged.</hi> Which Maxim how unsafe soever
it may seem to others, yet since it goes for a known rule amongst our Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,
could not be questioned at that present. And possible it is that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:66032:195"/>it better for the mariage of the Queens mother to pass unquestioned, as
a matter justly subject unto no dispute, than to build the validity of it on no
better ground than an Act of Parliament, which might be as easily reversed as it
was agreed to. There pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t an Act also for restoring to the Crown the tenths and
first fruits, first serled thereon in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. and afterwards
given back by Queen <hi>Mary</hi> as before was said. For the better drawing on of
which concession, it was pretended, that the Patrimony of the Crown had been
much dilapidated, and that it could not be supported with such honour as it
ought to be, if restitution were not made of such rents and profits, as were of
late dismembred from it. Upon which ground they also passed an act for the
dissolution of all such Monasteries, Convents, and Religious Orders, as h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d
been founded and established by the Queen deceased. By vertue of which Act
the Queen was repossessed again of all those lands which had been granted by
her sister to the Monks of <hi>Westminster</hi> and <hi>Sheene,</hi> the
Knights Hospitalers, the Nuns of <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>on,</hi> together with the Mansion Houses re-edified for the Observants
at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and the Black Friers in <hi>Smithfield.</hi> Which last being planted in
a house neer the dissolved Priory of Great St <hi>Bartholomews,</hi> had again fitted
and prepared the Church belonging thereunto for religious offices; but had
scarce fitted and prepared it, when dissolved again, and the Church afterwards
made a Parochial Church, for the use of the Close, and such as lived within
the verge and precincts thereof. How she disposed of <hi>Sion</hi> House, hath been
shewn already; and what she did with the rich Abby of <hi>Westminster,</hi> we shall see
hereafter.</p>
                     <p>In the passing of these Acts there was little trouble, in the next there was. For
when the Act of the <hi>Supremacy</hi> came to be debated, it seemed to be a thing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrent
even in Nature and Polity, that a woman should be declared to be the
supream Head on Earth of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But those of the reformed
party meant nothing less than to contend about words and phrases, so they
might gain the point they aimed at, which was the stripping of the Pope of all
authority within these Dominions, and fixing the supream power over all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and estates of what ranck soever in the Crown Imperial, not by the name
of <hi>Supream Head,</hi> which they perceived might be made lyable to some just
exceptions; but which comes all to one, of the <hi>Supream Governesse.</hi> Which
when it gave occasion of discourse and descant amongst many of the captious
Papists, Queen <hi>Mary</hi> helped her sister unto one good Argument for her justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and the Queen helped her self to another, which took off the cavil.
In the third Session of Parliament in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s time, there pass'd an Act,
declaring, <hi>That the Regal power was in the Queens Majesty, as fully as it had
been in any of her predecessors.</hi> In the body whereof it is expressed and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<q>That the Law of the Realm is, and ever hath been, and ought to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
that the Kingly or Regal Office of the Realm, and all Dignities,
Prerogatives Royal, Power, Preheminences, Privileges, Authorities and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdictions
thereunto annexed, united, or belonging, being invested either
in Male or Female, are, be, and ought to be, as fully, wholly, absolutely
and intirely, deemed, adjudged, accepted, invested, and taken, in the one
or in the other. So that whatsoever Statute or Law doth limit or appoint
that the King of this Realm may, or shall have, execute and do, any thing as
King, &amp;c. the same the Queen, (being <hi>Supream Governesse,</hi> possessor and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritor
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>he Imperial Crown of this Realm) may by the same power have and
execute, to all intents, constructions and purposes, without doubt, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity,
scruple or question, any custome, use, or any other thing to the con|
trary notwithstanding.</q> By the very tenor of which Act, Queen <hi>Mary</hi>
grants unto her sister as much authority in all Church concernments, as had
been exercised and enjoyed by her Father and Brother, according to any Act
or Acts of Parliament in their several times. Which Acts of Parliament as
our learned Lawyers have declared upon these occasions, were not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
as <hi>Introductory</hi> of a new power which was not in the Crown before,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:66032:195"/>but only <hi>Declaratory</hi> of an old, which naturally belonged to all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Princes, and amongst others to the Kings and Queens of the Realm of
<hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to this purpose it is pleaded by the Queen in her own behalf. Some
busie and sed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tious persons had dispersed a rumour, that by the Act for recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing
of the Queens <hi>Supremacy,</hi> there was something further ascribed unto
the Queen, her heirs and successors, a power of administring Divine Service
in the Church, which neither by any equity or true sence of the words, could
from thence be gathered; And thereupon she makes this Declaration unto
all her subjects, <q>That nothing was or could be meant or intended by the
said Act, than was acknowledged to be due to the most Noble King of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
memory, King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. her Majesties Father, or King <hi>Edward</hi>
the 6th. her Majesties Brother. And further she declareth, That she neither
doth, not will challenge any other authority by the same, than was challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and lately used by the said two Kings, and was of ancient time due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Imperial Crown of this Realm, that is, under God to have the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainty
and Rule over all persons born within her Realms or Dominions, of
what estate (either Ecclesiastical or Temporal) soever they be, so as no
other forein power shall or ought to have any superiority over them.</q> Which
explication published in the Queens Injunctions, <hi>Anno</hi> 1559. Not giving
such a general satisfaction to that groundless cavil as was expected and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
the Bishops and Clergy in their Convocation of the year 1562. by the
Queens authority and consent, declared more plainly, that is to say, <q>That
they gave not to their Princess by vertue of the said Act or otherwise, either
the ministring of Gods word or Sacraments, but that only Prerog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they saw to have been given alwaies to all godly Princes in holy Scripture
by God himself, that is to say, that they should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

committed to their charge by God, whether they be Ecclesiastical

                     <p>By all which, if the cavils of the Adversary be not fully answered, it would
be known upon what reason they should question that in a soverain Queen,
which they allow in many cases to a Lady Abbess. For that an Abbess may be
capable of all and all manner of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, even to the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

lawfully exercise the same upon all such as live within the verge of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
is commonly acknowledged by their greatest Canonists. First for
suspension, it is affirmed by their <hi>Glosse,</hi> that an Abbess may suspend such
Clerks as are subject to her, both from their Benefice and Office. And que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionless
either to suspend a Clerk, or to bring his Church under the sentence
of an Interdict, is one of the chief parts of Ecclesiastical or spiritual Censures.
Nor have they this authority only by way of delegation from the Pope in some

personally invested them, which is the general opinion of their greatest Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists.
Next for the Sacraments, it is sufficiently known that the ministrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Baptism is performed by Midwives, and many other women as of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
course; not only as a thing connived at in extreme necessity, but as a
necessary duty, in which they are to be instructed against all emergencies by
their Parish Priests; for which we have the testimony of the late Lord Legate,
in the Articles published by him for his visitation. And finally for excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
it is affirmed by <hi>Palladanus</hi> and <hi>Navarre</hi> (none of the meanest in the
Pack) that the Pope may grant that power to a woman also; higher than which
there can be none exercised in the Church by the sons of men. And if a Pope
may grant these powers unto a woman, as to a Prioress or Abbess, or to any
other; there can be then no incapacity in the Sex, for exersing any part of that
jurisdiction which was restored unto the Crown by this Act of Parliament.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:66032:196"/>And if perhaps it be objected, that a Lady Abbess is an Ecclesiastical or spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
person in regard of her office, which cannot be affirmed of Queens, Pope
<hi>Gregory</hi> himself will come in to help us, by whom it was not thought unfit
to commit the cognisance of a cause concerning the purgation of a Bishop,
who stood charged with some grievous crime, to <hi>Brunichildis</hi> or <hi>Brunholi</hi>
Queen of <hi>France;</hi> of which, although the Gloss upon the Decretals be pleased to say,<note n="*" place="margin">Fuit hic ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium populari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>r dispeasatum</note>
That the Pope stretched his power too far in this particular, yet <hi>Gregory</hi> did
no more therein but what the Popes may do, and have done of late times by
their own confession; so little ground there is for so great a clamour as hath
been made by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and other of the Popish Jesuites upon this occasion.</p>
                     <p>Now for the better exercising and enjoying of the jurisdiction thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognised
unto the Crown, there are two Clauses in the Act of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
the first whereof contains an Oath for the acknowledgment and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of this <hi>Supremacy,</hi> not onely in the Queen, but her heirs and successors;
the said Oath to be taken by all Archbishops, Bishops, and all other Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
persons, and also by all temporal Judges, Justiciaries, Mayors, or any
other temporal Officers, &amp;c. For the refusal whereof when lawfully tendred
to them by such as were thereto commissionated under the great Seal of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
every such person so refusing, was actually to stand deprived of his or
their E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>clesiastical Preferments, or other temporal office of what sort soever;
onely it was provided, that the Oath should not be imposed on any of the
temporal Peers, of whose fidelity the Queen seemed willing to assure her self
without any such tye; though this exemption was esteemed by others but a
piece of cunning, the better to facilitate the passing of that Act amongst them,
which otherwise they might have hindred. But this provision was not made till
the following Parliament, though for the reason before mentioned it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
now. By the last Clause it was enacted, <q>That it should and might be
lawful to the Queen, her heirs and Successors, by Letters Patents under the
great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> to assigne, name, and authorise, when and as often as
her Highness, her Heirs or Successors, should think convenient, such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
being natural born Subjects to them, to exercise, use, and occupie
under her Highness, her Heirs and Successors, all manner of Jurisdictions,
Privileges, and Preheminences, in any wise touching or concerning any
Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, within the Realms of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Ireland,</hi> or any other her Highness Dominions or Countries, and to visit,
reform, repress, order, correct, and amend all such errors, heresies, schisms,
abuses, offences, contempts and enormities whatsoever, which by any
manner of Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Power, Authority, or Jurisdiction, or
can or may lawfully be reformed, ordered, redressed, corrected, restrained or
amended, to the pleasure of Almighty God, the increase of vertue, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the peace and unity of this Realm.</q> With a Proviso notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
that nothing should from thenceforth be accounted for Heresie, but
what was so adjudged in the holy Scripture, or in one of the four first General
Councils, or in any other National or Provincial Council, determining ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the word of God; or finally which should be so adjudged in the
time to come by the Court of Parliament, first having the assent of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Clergy in their Convocation. This was the first foundation of that
famous Court of <hi>High Commission,</hi> the principal Bulwark and Preservative of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> against the practices and assaults of all her Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
whether <hi>Popish</hi> or <hi>Puritan.</hi> And from hence issued that Commission, by
which the Queens Ministers proceeded in their Visitation in the first year of
her Reign, for rectifying all such things as they found amiss, and could not
be redressed by any ordinary Episcopal power, without the spending of more
time than the exigencies of the Church could then admit of.</p>
                     <p>There also past another Act for recommending and imposing the Book of
Common-Prayer and Administration of the Sacraments, according to such
alterations and corrections as were made therein by those who were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:66032:196"/>to revise it, as before is said. In the performance of which service, there
was great care taken for expunging all such passages in it, as might give any
scandal or offence to the Popish party, or be urged by them in excuse for
their not comming to Church, and joyning with the rest of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Gods publick Worship. In the Letany first made and published by
King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. and afterwards continued in the two Litu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>gies of
King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th. there was a Prayer to be delivered <hi>from the tyranny and
all the detestable enormities of the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>shop of Rome;</hi> which was thought fit to be
expunged, as giving matter of scandal and dis-affection to all that party, or
otherwise wisht well to that Religion. In the first Liturgie of King <hi>Edward,</hi>
the Sacrament of the Lords Body was delivered with this <hi>Benediction,</hi> that is
to say, <hi>The Body of our Lord Jesus Christ which was given for the preservation of
thy body and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ul to life everlasting; The Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, &amp;c.</hi>
Which being thought by <hi>Calvin</hi> and his Disciples to give some countenance to
the grosse and carnal Presence of Christ in the Sacrament, which passeth by
the name of <hi>Trans<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>bstantiation</hi> in the Schools of <hi>Rome,</hi> was altered into this
form in the second Liturgy, that is to say, <hi>Take and eat this in remembrance
that Christ died for thee, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>eed on him in thy heart by faith with thanksgiving.
Take and drink this, &amp;c.</hi> But the Revisors of the Book joyned both Forms
together, lest under colour of rejecting a <hi>Carnal,</hi> they might be thought also to
deny such a <hi>Real Presence</hi> as was defended in the Writings of the Antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Upon which ground they expunged also a whole Rubrick at the
end of the Communion-service, by which it was declared, that kneeling at the
participation of the Sacrament was required for no other reason, than for a
signification of the humble and grateful acknowledging of the benefits of
Christ, given therein unto the worthy Receiver, and to avoid that prophanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and disorder which otherwise might have ensued, and not for giving any
adoration to the Sacramental Bread and Wine there bodily received, <hi>or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of any real and essential presence of Christs body and blood.</hi> And to come up
the closer to those of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it was ordered by the Queens In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions,
that the Sacramental Bread (which the Book required onely to be
made of the finest flower) should be made round in fashion of the Wafers used
in the time of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> She also ordered, that the Lords Table should be
placed where the Altar stood, that the accustomed reverence should be made
at the name of Jesus, Musick retained in the Church, and all the old Festivals
observed with their several Eves. By which compliances, and the expunging
of the passages before remembred, the Book was made so passable amongst the
Papi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ts, that for ten years they generally repaired to their Parish Churches,
without doubt or scruple, as is affirmed not onely by Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> in his

but also by the Queen her self in a Letter to Sir <hi>Francis Walsingham,</hi> then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     </p>
                     <p>And that the Book might passe the better in both Houses when it came to
the Vote, it was thought requisite that a Disputation should be held about
some points, which were most likely to be checked at; the Disputants to be
five Bishops and four other learned men of the one side, and nine of the most
lear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ed men, graduated in the Schools, on the other side; the Disputation
to begin on the 30th. of <hi>March,</hi> and to be holden in the Church of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
in the presence of as many of the Lords of the Council, and of the
Members of both Houses, as were desirous to inform themselves in the state
of the Questions. The Disputation for that reason to be held in the English
Tongue, and to be managed (for the better avoiding of confusion) by a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
interchange of writings upon every point, those writings which were mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
given in upon one day, to be reciprocally answer'd on another, &amp; so from
day to day till the whole were ended. To all which points the Bishops gave
consent for themselves, and the rest of their party, though they refused to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:66032:197"/>stand unto them when it came to the tryal.<note place="margin">An. Reg. Eliz 1. 1559.</note> The points to be disputed on were
three in number, that is to say, <hi>That it is against the word of God, and the custom
of the antient Church, to use a Tongue unknown to the people in Common-Praier,
and in the administration of the Sac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to appoint, take away, and change Ceremonies and Ecclesiastical Rites, so the same
be to edification. 3. That it cannot be proved by the word of God, that there is in the

                     <p>The day being come, and the place fitted and accommodated for so great
an audience, the Lord Keeper <hi>Bacon</hi> takes the Chair as Moderator, not for
determining any thing in the points disputed, but for seeing good order to be
kept, and that the Disputation might be managed in the form agreed on.
When contrary to expectation, the Bishops and their party brought nothing
in writing to be read publickly in the hearing of all the Auditors, but came
resolved to try it out by word of mouth, and to that end appointed <hi>Cole</hi> to
be their Spokesman. For which neglect, being reproved by the Lord Keeper,
they promised a conformity on the Monday following, being the second day
of <hi>April;</hi> but would not stand unto it them, because they would not give their
Adversaries so much leisure as a whole nights deliberation to return an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
Desired and pressed by the Lord Keeper to proceed according to the
form agreed on, for the better satisfaction and contentment of so great an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
it was most obstinately denyed. <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with so little reverence (or so much insolency rather) as to threaten the
Queen with Excommunication in that publick Audience, for which they
were committed to the Tower on the fifth of <hi>April.</hi> The rest of the Bishops
were commanded to abide in <hi>London,</hi> and to give bond for their appearance at
the Council-Table whensoever they should be r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>quired. And so the whole
Assembly was dismist, and the conference ended before it had been well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
the Lord Keeper giving to the Bishops this sharp remembrance, <hi>Sinc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Which notwithstanding produced this good effect in the Lords and Commons,
that they conceived the Bishops were not able to defend their Doctrin in the
points disputed; which made the way more easie for the passing of the publick
Liturgy, when it was brought unto the Vote. Two Speeches there were made
against it in the House of Peers, by <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Fecknam,</hi> and one against the
Queens Supremacy by the Archbishop of <hi>York;</hi> but they prevailed as little in
both points by the power of their Eloquence, as they had done in the first by
their want of Arguments.</p>
                     <p>It gave much matter of discourse to most knowing men, that the Bishops
should so wilfully fall from an appointment to which they had before agreed,
and thereby forfeit their whole Cause to a Condemnation. But they pretended
for themselves, that they were so straightned in point of time, that they could
not possibly digest their Arguments into form and order; that they looked
upon it as a thing too much below them to humble themselves to such a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi>
or <hi>Disputation,</hi> in which <hi>Bacon,</hi> a meer lay-man, and of no great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
was to sit as Judge; and finally, that the points had been determined al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
by the Catholick Church, and therefore were not to be called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:66032:197"/>without leave from the Pope. Which last pretence, if it were of any
weight and moment, it must be utterly impossible to proceed to any Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
in the state of the Church, by which the power and pride of the Popes
of <hi>Rome</hi> may be any thing lessened, or that the corruptions of the Church
should be redressed, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> it consist not with their profit. For want of time they
were no more straightned than the opposite party, none of them knowing with
what arguments the other side would fortifie and confirm their cause, nor in
what forms they would propose them, before they had perused <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>heir recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Papers. But nothing was more weakly urged, than their exception against
the Presidency of Sir <hi>Nicholas Bacon,</hi> which could not be considered as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
either <hi>new</hi> or <hi>strange;</hi> not <hi>strange,</hi> because the like Presidency had been
given frequently to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> in the late Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. and that

as Judge or President, who in the managing of that trust over-acted any thing
which was done by <hi>Cromwel</hi> as Vicar-General to that King, or <hi>Bacon</hi> was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered
to do as the Queens Commissioner. No such unreasonable conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scention
to be found in this, as was pretended by the Bishops and the rest of
that party, to save themselves from the guilt and censure of a Tergiversation;
for which, and other their contempts, we shall find them called to a reckoning
within few months after.</p>
                     <p>In the Convocation which accompanied the present Parliament, there

modesty, or a despair of doing any good to themselves and the cause, that there
was nothing done by the Bishops at all, and not much more by the lower
Clergy, than a declaration of their judgment in some certain points, which
at that time were conceived fit to be commended to the sight of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that is to say, <q>1. That in the Sacrament of the Altar, by vertue of
Christs assisting, after the word is duly pronounced by the Priest, the natural
body of Christ conceived of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is really present under the
species of Bread and Wine, as also his natural Blood, 2. That after the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

there remains not the substance of Bread and Wine, not any sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
save the substance of God and Man. 3. That the true body of Christ
and his Blood is offered for a propitiatory sacrifice for the quick and the
dead. 4. That the supream power of feeding and governing the militant
Church of Christ, and of confirming their brethren, is given to <hi>Peter</hi> the
Apostle, and to his lawful Successors in the See Apostolick, as unto the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars
of Christ. 5. That the authority to handle and define such things which
belong to Faith, the Sacraments, and Discipline Ecclesiastical, hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ever belonged, and onely ought to belong unto the Pastors of the Church,
whom the holy Spirit hath placed in the Church, and not unto Lay-men.</q>

                        <hi>Rochester</hi> and <hi>Ely,</hi> till being found practising against the State, he was finally
shut up in <hi>Wisbich</hi> Castle, where at last he died. <hi>Oglethorp</hi> died soon after his

disease in <hi>December</hi> following; but all of them in their beds, and in perfect li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
<hi>Poole</hi> by the clemency of the Queen, injoyed the like freedom, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously
treated by all persons amongst whom he lived, and at last died upon
one of his own Farms in a good old age. And as for <hi>Christopherson,</hi> he
had been in his time so good a Benefactor to <hi>Trinity</hi> College in <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
whereof he had been sometimes Master, that he could not want some honest
and ingenuous retribution, if the necessity of his estate had required the same.
<hi>Bonner</hi> alone was doomed to a constant imprisonment, which was done rather
out of care for his preservation, than as a punishment of his crimes; the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
proving to that wretch his safest sanctuary, whose horrid tyrannies had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
exposed him to the popular fury. So loud a lie is that of <hi>Genebrard,</hi>
(though a good Chronologer) that the Bishops were not only punished with
imprisonment and the loss of their livelihoods, but that many of them were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
by poyson, famine, and many other kinds of death.</p>
                     <p>The Bishops being thus put to it, the Oath is tendered next to the Deans
and Dignitaries, and by degrees also to the Rural Clergy; refused by some,
and took by others, as it seemed most agreeable to their consciences, or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
ends. For the refusal whereof, or otherwise for not conforming to the
publick Liturgy, I find no more to have been deprived of their preferments,
than fourteen Bishops, six Abbots Priors, and Governours of Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
twelve Deans, and as many Arch-Deacons, fifteen Presidents or Masters
of Colleges, fifty Prebendaries of Cathedral Churches, and about eighty Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Vicars. The whole number not amounting to 200 men, which in a
Realm consisting of nine thousand Parishes, and 26 Cathedral Churches,
could be no great matter. But then we are to know withall, that many who
were cordially affected to the interess of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> dispensed with
themselves in these outward conformities, which some of them are said to do
upon a hope of seeing the like revolution by the death of the Queen, as had
before hapned by the death of King <hi>Edward;</hi> and otherwise that they might
be able to relieve their brethren, who could not so readily frame themselves
to a present compliance. Which notwithstanding so it was, that partly by the
deprivation of these few persons, but principally by the death of so many in the
last years sickness, there was not a sufficient number of learned men to supply
the cures, which filled the Church with an ignorant and illiterate Clergy,
whose learning went no further than the Liturgy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the Book of Homilies,
but otherwise conformable (which was no small felicity) to the Rules of the
Church. And on the other side, many were raised to great preferments,
who, having spent there time of exile in such forein Churches as followed the
platform of <hi>Geneva,</hi> returned so disaffected to Episcopal Government, unto
the Rites and Ceremonies here by law established, as not long after filled the
Church with most sad disorders; not only to the breaking of the bond of
peace, but to the grieving and extinguishing of the spirit of Unity. Private o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
not regarded, nothing was more considered in them, than their zeal
against Popery, and their abilities in learning to confirm that zeal. On which
account we find the Queens Professor in <hi>Oxford</hi> to pass amongst the <hi>Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists,</hi>
though somewhat more <hi>moderate</hi> than the rest; and <hi>Cartwright</hi> the
Lady <hi>Margarets</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> to prove an unextinguished firebrand to the
Church of <hi>England; Whittington</hi> the chief Ringleader of the <hi>Franckfort</hi> Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
preferred unto the Deanry of <hi>Durham,</hi> from thence encouraging
<hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Goodman,</hi> in setting up Presbytery and Sedition in the Kirk of
<hi>Scotland; Sampson</hi> advanced unto the Deanry of <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> and within
few years after, turned out again for an <hi>incorrigible Non-Conformist; Hardiman</hi>
one of the first twelve Prebends of the Church of <hi>Westminster,</hi> deprived soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for throwing down the Altar, and defacing the vestments of the Church.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:66032:199"/>Which things I only touch at now, leaving the further prosecution of them to
another place.</p>
                     <p>Of all these traverses, the Pope received advertisement from the first to the
last. But being of a rugged humou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, he fell most infinitely short of that dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
which the case required, for finding out a fit expedient to prevent the
rupture. When his first sullen fits had left him, he began to treat more seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
with the English Agent; not that the Queen should sue unto him for
the Crown, which she was possessed of, but that no alteration of Religion
might be driven at by her. To whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h <hi>Karn</hi> answered according to such instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
as he had received, That he could give him no assurance in that point,
unless the Pope would first declare, that the mariage of King <hi>Henry</hi> with Queen
<hi>Anne Bollen,</hi> had been good and lawful. Which cross request so stumbled both
the Pope and the Conclave, that they made choise rather of doing nothing,
than to do that, of which they could not promise to themselves any fortunate
issue. Roused at the last by the continual alarums which came from <hi>England,</hi>
he entertains some secret practices with the <hi>French,</hi> and on the sudden signifies
his commands to <hi>Karn,</hi> that he should not depart out of <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>me</hi> without his
leave, and that in the mean time he should take upon him the government of
the English Hospital in the City. In which command each of them is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to have had his own proper ends: For <hi>Karn</hi> affected that restraint, which
he was thought to have procured under hand, because he had no mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn

                        </gap>s like to find a different Religion from that
which he embraced in his own particular. And the Pope had his own ends al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
in hindering as he thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he discovering of that secret intelligence which
he maintained with the <hi>French</hi> King, to the Queens destruction, if his designs
had took effect. But his design was carried with so little cunning, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
it discovered it self, without the help of a revelation from the English
Agent. For whether it were by his instigation, or by the solicitation of the
<hi>French</hi> King, or the ambition of the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> who had then maried the
Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> (as before was said) the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> assumes unto her self
the stile and title of Queen of <hi>England,</hi> quartereth the Arms thereof upon all
her Plate, and in all Armories and Escoutcheons, as she had occasion. And
this she did as Cosen and next heir to the Queen deceased; which could not
be without imputing bastardy to the Queen then living. A folly which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
such displeasure in the heart of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that it could neither be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
nor so much as forgiven, till that unfortunate Lady was driven out of
her Kingdom, hunted into a close imprisonment, and finally brought out to the
fatal block.</p>
                     <p>This as it somewhat startled the new Queen of <hi>England,</hi> so it engaged her
the more resolutely in that Reformation which was so happily begun. And
to that end she sets out by Advice of her Council, a certain Body of Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the same in purpose and effect, with those which had been publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the first of King <hi>Edward,</hi> but more accommodated to the temper of the
present time. Nothing more singular in the same, than the severe course taken
about Ministers Mariages, the use of singing, and the Reverences in Divine
Worship to be kept in Church, the posture of the Communion Table, and
the form of bidding Prayers in the Congregation. This last almost the same

not much observed neither when it first came out, as if it had been published in
the way of caution, to make the Clergy men more wary in the choice of their
wives, than with a purpose of persuing it to an execution. But as for that
concerning the use of singing, and the accustomed Reverences to be kept in
Churches, they are these that follow. Touching the last it is enjoyed, <q>That

there may be sung an Hymn or such like Song to the praise of Almighty
God, in the best Melody and Musick that may be conveniently devised, having
respect that the sentence of the Hymn may be understood and perceived. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which order, as Plain-song was retained in most Parish-Churches

with Organs commonly, and sometimes with other musical Instruments,
as the solemnity required. No mention here of singing <hi>David</hi>'s Psalms in

and the People shewed so much forwardness, that on St. <hi>Bartholomews</hi> day
and the morrow after, they burned in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-yard, Cheap-side, and

out of the Churches. And as it is many times supposed that a thing is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
well done if not over-done, so hapned it in this case also, zeal against su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
had prevailed so far with some ignorant men, that in some places
the Coaps, Vestments, Altar-cloaths, Books, Banners, Sepulchres, and Rood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lofts,
were burned altogether.</p>
                     <p>All matters of the Church being thus disposed of, it will be time to cast
our eyes on the concernments of the civil State which occurred this year, in
which I find nothing more considerable than the overtures of some Marriages
which had been made unto the Queen. <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> had made an offer of
himself by the Count of <hi>Feria</hi> his Ambassadour; but the Queen had heard so
much of the disturbances which befell King <hi>Henry,</hi> by marrying with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
wife, that she had no desire to run into the like perplexities by marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with her sisters husband; and how he was discouraged from proceeding in
it, hath been shewed already. Towards the end of the Parliament the Lords and
Commons made an humble Addresse unto her, in which they most earnestly
besought her, That for securing the peace of the Kingdom, and the contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all her good and loving subjects, she would think of marrying; not
pointing her particularly unto any one man, but leaving her to please her self
in the choice of the person. To which she answered, That she thanked them for
their good affections, and took their application to her to be well intended,
the rather, because it contained no limitation of place or person; which had
they done, she must have disliked it very much, and thought it to have been a
great presumption. But for the matter of their sure, she lets them know, That
she had long since made choice of that state of life in which now she lived,
and hoped that God would give her strength and constancy to go throw with
it; that if she had been minded to have changed that course, she neither want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
many invitations to it in the reign of her brother, not many strong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsions
in the time of her sister. That as she had hitherto remained, so she
intended to continue by the grace of God, though her Words, compared with
her Youth, might be thought by some to be far different from her meaning.
And so having thanked them over again, she licensed them to depart to their
several businesses. And it appeared soon after that she was in earnest, by her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
of a motion made by <hi>Gustavus</hi> King of <hi>Sweden</hi> for the Prince <hi>Ericus;</hi>
for the solliciting whereof, his second son <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Finland</hi> (who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded

                     <p>The next great business of this year was a renewing of the Peace with the
crown of <hi>France,</hi> agreed on at the Treaty near the City of <hi>Cambray;</hi> in which
all differences were concluded also between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> all other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
being accorded, the restitution of <hi>Calais</hi> to the Queen of <hi>England</hi>
seemed the onely obstacle, by which the general peace of Christendom was
at the point to have been hindred. But the Queen, either preferring the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
good before private interest, or fearing to be left alone if she should stand
too obstinately upon that particular, came at the last to this agreement, <hi>viz.</hi>
That <hi>Calais</hi> should remain for the tearm of eight years then next following in
the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> that at the end of the said tearm it should be delive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

unto the <hi>English,</hi> or otherwise the French King should pay unto the Queen the
sum of 500000 Crowns. According unto which Agreement, Peace was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
in <hi>London</hi> on the 7th. of <hi>April</hi> between the Queens Majesty on the

                     <p>WE must begin this year with the Consecration of such new Bishops, as
were elected to succeed in the place of those which had been deprived,
the first of which was that of the most reverend Doctor <hi>Matthew Parker</hi> elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the See of <hi>Canterbury</hi> on the first of <hi>August,</hi> but not consecrated till the
17th. of <hi>December</hi> following. That Dignity had first been offered, as is said by
some, to <hi>Doctor Nicholas Wotton</hi> Dean of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> who grown in
years, and still a well-willer to the Pope, desired to be excused from underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of a charge so weighty. And some say it was offered unto <hi>Whitehead</hi> also,
who had been Chaplain to <hi>Anne Bollen</hi> the Queen's mother; but he returned
the like refusal, though on other grounds, as more inclined (by reason of his
long abode in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Churches) to the Presbyterians than the Episcopal
form of Government; and it was happy, for the Church might have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
by his dissaffection, that he did refuse it. The Chair being better filled by
<hi>Parker</hi> another of Queen <hi>Anne Bollen</hi>'s Chaplains, but better principled, and
of a far more solid judgment in affairs of moment. The <hi>Conge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

day of <hi>July,</hi> within few days after the deprivation of the former Bishops, to
satisfie the world in the Queens intention of preserving the Episcopal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
And therefore why the consecration was deferred so long maybe
made a question; some think it was, that she might satisfie her self, by putting
the Church into a posture by her Visitation, before she passed it over to the
care of the Bishops; others conceive, that she was so enamoured with the
power and title of Supream Governess, that she could not deny her self that
contentment in the exercise of it which the present Interval afforded; For
what are Titles without Power? and what pleasure can be took in Power if no
use be made of it?</p>
                     <p>And it is possible enough that both or either of these considerations might
have some influence upon her. But the main cause for keeping the Episcopal
Sees in so long a vacancy must be found else-where. An Act had passed in the
late Parliament, which never had the confidence to appear in print, in the
Preamble whereof it was declared, That by dissolution of Religious Houses
in the time of the late King her Majesties father, many Impropriations, Tithes,
and portions of Tithes had been invested in the Crown, which the Queen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Lady of a tender conscience, thought not fit to hold, nor could conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
dismember from it without compensation, in regard of the present
low condition in which she found the Crown at her comming to it; And
thereupon it was enacted, that in the vacancy of any Archbishoprick or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick,
it should be lawful for the Queen to issue out a Commission under
the Great Seal, for taking a survey of all Castles, Mannors, Lands, Tenements,
and all other Hereditaments to the said Episcopal Sees belonging or apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and on the return of such surveys, to take into her hands any of the
said Castles, Mannors, Lands, Tenements, &amp;c. as to her seemed good; giving
to the said Archbishops or Bishops as much annual Rents, to be raised upon
Impropriations, Tithes, and portions of Tithes, as the said Castles, Mannors,
Lands, &amp;c. did amount unto. The Church Lands certified according to the
antient Rents, without consideration of the <hi>Casualties</hi> and other <hi>Perq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Court which belonged unto them; the Retribution made in Pensions,
Tithes, and portions of Tithes, extended at the utmost value, from which no
other profit was to be expected than the Rent it self. Which Act not being to
take effect till the end of that Parliament, the interval between the end of
the Parliament, the deprivation of the old Bishops, and the consecration of the
new, was to be taken up in the executing of such surveys, and making such
advantages of them, as most redo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Clause in the said Statutes, by which the patrimony of the Church was as much
dilapida<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ed, <hi>sede plena,</hi> as it was pulled by this in the times of vacancy; for by
that Clause, all Bishops were restrained from making any Grants of their Farms
and Mannors for more than twenty one years, or three lives at the most, except
it were unto the Queen, her Heirs and Successors. But either to the Queen, or
to any of her Heirs and Successors (and under that pretence to any her hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
Courtiers) they might be granted in Fee farm, or for a Lease of fourscore
and nineteen years, as it pleased the Parties. By which means, <hi>Credinton</hi> was

of the new Archbishop was confirmed in the Arches, raised a report, that
the <hi>Nags head</hi> Tavern was the place of the Consecration. And this report
was countenanced by another slander, causing it to be noised abroad, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
in some seditious Pamphlets, that the persons designed by the Queen
for the several Bishopricks, being met at a Tavern, did then and there lay

tale, if there were no other evidence to disprove the same. And yet the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence

Without which, as they would not grant it to be a Church, so could they prove
it to be none by no stronger Argument than that the Bishops (or the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

canonically consecrated as they ought to be. And for the gaining of this
point, they stood most pertina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>For the decrying of this clamour, and satisfying all opponents in the truth

look upon the aid which the Queen sent to those of the reformed Religion
in the Realm of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but carried under the pretence of dislodging such
<hi>French</hi> Forces as were Garrisoned there, and might have proved bad neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> Such of the Scots as desired a Reformation
of Religion, taking advantage by the Queens absence, the easiness of the Earl
of <hi>Arran,</hi> and want of power in the Queen Regent to suppress their practices,
had put themselves into a Body; Headed by some of the Nobility, they take
unto themselves the name of the <hi>Congregation,</hi> managing their own affairs
apart from the rest of the Kingdom, and in assurance of their own strength,
petition to the Queen Regent and the Lords of the Council, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lords Supper might be administred in both kinds, that Divine
Offices might be celebrated in the Vulgar tongue, and that they might have the
choice of their own Ministers according to the practice (as it was pretended)
of the Primitive times. The Answer hereunto was fair and gratious, but rather
for the gaining of time, than with a purpose to grant any of the points de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.
The principal Leaders of the party, well followed by the common
people, put themselves into <hi>Perth,</hi> and there begin to stand on higher terms
than before they did. The news whereof occasioneth <hi>Knox</hi> to leave his Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
in <hi>Geneva,</hi> and joyn himself unto the Lords of the Congregation; At <hi>Perth</hi>
he goes into the Pulpit, and falls so bitterly on <hi>Images, Idolatry,</hi> and other
superstitions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the people in a popular fury deface
all the Images in that Church, and presently demolish all Religious Houses
within that City; This hapned about the end of <hi>May, Anno</hi> 1559. and gave a
dangerous example to them of <hi>Couper,</hi> who forthwith on the hearing of it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
all the Images, and pulled down the Altars in that Church also.
Preaching at <hi>Craile</hi> he inveighed sharply against the Queen Regent, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently
stirred up the people to joyn together for the expulsion of the
<hi>French,</hi> which drew after it the like destruction of all Altars and Images as
was made before at <hi>Perth</hi> and <hi>Couper.</hi> The like followed on his preaching at
St. <hi>Andrews</hi> also, the Religious Houses being pulled down as well as the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and laid so flat, that there was nothing left in the form of a building. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
by the same firebrand, they burned down the rich Monastery of <hi>Scone,</hi>

make themselves Masters of the last, and put up their own Preachers into all
the Pulpits of that City, not suffering the Queen Regent to have the use of
one Church onely for her own devotions.</p>
                     <p>Nor staid they there, but being carried on by the same ill spirit, they pass
an Act among themselves for depriving the Queen Regent of all place and
power in the publick Government; concerning which, the Oracle being first
consulted, returned this Answer, sufficiently ambiguous, as all Oracles are,
that is to say, <hi>That the iniquity of the Queen Regent ought not to withdraw their
hearts from the obedience due to their Soveraigns, nor did he wish any such sentence
to be pronounced against her, but when she should change her course, and submit
her self to good counsel, there should be place left unto her of regresse to the same
honors, from which, for good causes, she ought to be deprived.</hi> This Act is intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Queen Regent, who now begins as seriously to provide for her own
preservation, as she had done before in maintenance of the Queens Authority.
Some Forces had been sent from <hi>France,</hi> together with many Arms and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition
in proportion to them; but these not being great enough to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
those insolencies, she is supplied at times with 3000 Foot, beside <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi>'s
Regiment sent over to make way for the rest. Some Horse were also
shipt from <hi>France,</hi> but so scattered and dispersed by tempest, that few of them
came safely thither. Yet by the terrour of their comming, and the noise of
more, she recovereth <hi>Edenborough,</hi> compelleth the confederate <hi>Scots</hi> to go further
North, fortifies <hi>Lieth</hi> the Port-Town to <hi>Edenborough,</hi> and the chief Key of all
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:66032:204"/>that Kingdom, Garrisoned forthwith by the <hi>French,</hi> not onely to make good
their <hi>Entrance,</hi> but second their <hi>Exit.</hi> On these discouragements, many of
the <hi>Scots</hi> soldiers drop away, and the rest refuse to stand unto their Arms, without
present pay. Had the <hi>French</hi> gone to work like soldiers, and poured such for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
into that Kingdom as the condition of affairs did require at their hands,
they might easily have suppressed that scattered Faction, before they were
united under the protection of a forein Power; but this doing of their work
by halves proved the undoing of the whole, and onely served to give the <hi>Scots</hi>
sufficient time to renew their forces, and call the <hi>English</hi> to their aid. They had
all along maintained a correspondence with some in <hi>England,</hi> but more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
with <hi>Crofts</hi> Governor of the Town of <hi>Barwick;</hi> To him they send for
a supply in this great necessity, by whom their Agents are dispatched with
four thousand Crowns; but the Queen Regent was so seasonably advertised
of it, that she intercepted on the way both the men and the mony.</p>
                     <p>In this extremity they take counsel of despair, with <hi>Knox,</hi> by whom they
are advised to cast themselves into the arms of the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
visible means then left to support the cause; to whom the neighbourhood
of the <hi>French,</hi> upon just jealousies and reasons of State, was not very accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
No better counsel being offered (as indeed none could) <hi>Maitland</hi> and

                        </gap>o the Court of <hi>England,</hi> by whom the Queen is made
acquainted with the state of that Kingdom, the difficulty under which it strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
the danger like to fall on her own Dominions if the <hi>French</hi> should grow
too strong in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and thereupon entreat her succours and assistance for
the expulsion of that People, who otherwise might to both Realms prove alike
destructive. The business being taken into consideration, it was conceived by
some of the Council, that the Queen ought not to give ear unto their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires;
that it was a matter of dangerous consequence, and of ill example, to
assist the Subjects of that or any other Kingdom against their own natural and
lawful Princes, and that she did not know how soon it might be her own case,
to have the like troubles and commotions raised against her by those who liked
not her proceedings in the change of Religion. By others it was thought a
matter of no small impiety not to assist their brethren of the same profession<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
imploring their assistance in the present exigency; that it was a work of charity
to defend their neighbours from the oppression of strangers; that the <hi>French</hi>
were always enemies to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore that it could
not be consistent with the rules of prudence to suffer them to grow too
strong upon their borders; that the French King had already assumed the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of <hi>England,</hi> and it concerned them to take care that they gave him not by
their improvidence the possession also. These reasons carried it for the <hi>Scots,</hi>
And so they are dismist with promise of such present aid, and on such condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as should be agreed on by Commissioners on both sides in the Town of
<hi>Barwick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About the middle of <hi>February</hi> the Commissioners meet, the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi>
for the Queen, the Lord <hi>James Stewart</hi> (one of the bastard brothers of
the Queen of Scots) the Lord <hi>Ruthwen,</hi> and some other principal men of the
Congregation in the name of the rest: By whom it was concluded on the
27th. of that month, That the Queen should send sufficient forces into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
both by Sea and Land, furnished with Mony, Arms, and Ammunition;
that she should not recall her forces till that Kingdom was cleared of all the
<hi>French;</hi> that provision of Victuals for the Army should be made by the <hi>Scots,</hi>
&amp; that the <hi>Scots</hi> should shew themselves enemies to all such as were enemies to
the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> whether <hi>Scots</hi> or <hi>French;</hi> But by all means, that nothing
should be done by vertue of this Agreement, which might import the least
withdrawing of the <hi>Scots</hi> from that loyalty, duty, and obedience which was due
unto their natural Queen, or the King her husband. By which Agreement
with the <hi>Scots</hi> the Queen abundantly provided for her own security from all
Invasions on that side; and by affording them such succours as their wants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:66032:204"/>but chiefly by conferring some small annual pensions on the Chiefs
amongst them, she made her self more <hi>abso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Predecessors in all times before. According to these Capitulations, an Army
gallantly appointed is sent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> consisting of 6000 Foot and 2000
Horse, and commanded by the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> a right expert Soldier, accompanied
by some Lords and Gentlemen of eminent quality; some ships were also sent
to block up the Haven, and hinder all relief which might come by Sea to the
Town of <hi>Lieth,</hi> on the defence whereof depended the whole hopes of the
<hi>French,</hi> together with the interest of that Crown in the Realm of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was about the beginning of <hi>April</hi> that the English Army came before it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
recruited afterwards by the comming of 2000 more; which fresh supply, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with some ill success which they found in the action, did so disanimate
the besieged, that they conceived no possibility of a long resistance; Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors
are therefore sent from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Edenborough,</hi> there to confer with
such of the same quality as should also come thither, authorised by the Queen
of <hi>England,</hi> by whom it was in fine concluded, That all the <hi>French</hi> Forces
should forthwith depart out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> except 60 onely to be left in <hi>Dunbar,</hi>
and as many in the Fort of <hi>Nachkeeth;</hi> that they should be transported for
their greater safety in English Bottoms; that all matters of Religion
should be referred to the following Parliament; that an act of Oblivion
should be passed for the indemnity of all who had born Arms on either side;
that a general Bond of Love and Amity should be made betwixt the Lords and
their Adherents of both Religions; and finally, amongst many other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
that neither the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> nor the <hi>French</hi> King should from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
assume the Titles and Arms of <hi>England.</hi> Which Articles being signed and
confirmed for both Kingdoms, the <hi>French</hi> about the middle of <hi>July</hi> take their
leave of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> Army at the same time set forward for <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi>
being there disbanded and dismissed to their several dwellings. Followed
not long after by the Earls of <hi>Morton</hi> and <hi>Glencarn,</hi> in the name of the rest of
the Congregation, sent purposely to render to the Queen their most humble
thanks for her speedy &amp; prosperous assistance, and to desire the continuance of
her Majesties favours, if the <hi>French</hi> should any more attempt to invade their
Country. Assured whereof, and being liberally rewarded with gifts and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents,
they returned with joy and glad tydings to the <hi>Congregation,</hi> whom
as the Queen had put upon a present confidence of going vigorously on in
their Reformation, so it concerned them to proceed so carefully in pursuance
of it, as might comply with the dependence which they had upon her.</p>
                     <p>First therefore, that she might more cordially espo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>se their quarrel, they
bound themselves by their subscription to embrace the Liturgy, with all the
Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which for a time remained
the onely form of Worship for the Kirk of <hi>Scotland;</hi> when, and by whose
means they receded from it, may be shown hereafter. In the next place they
cause a Parliament to be called in the month of <hi>August,</hi> according to the
Articles of the Pacification, from which no person was excluded, who either
had the right of Suffrage in his own capacity, or in relation to their Churches,
or as returned from their Shrevalties or particular Burroughs; of which last,
there appeared the accustomed number, but of the Lords Spiritual, no more
than six Bishops of thirteen, with thirteen Abbots and Priors or thereabouts;
and of the Temporal Lords to the number of ten Earls and as many Barons:
By whose Authority and consent they passed three Acts, conducing wholly
to the advantage of the Reformation; the first whereof was for abolishing the
Popes Jurisdiction and Authority within the Realm; the second, for annul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
all Statutes made in former times for maintenance of Idolatry and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition;
and the third, for the punishment of the Sayers and Hearers of the
Masse. To this Parliament also some of the Ministers presented <hi>A Confession
of the Faith and Doctrine to be believed and professed by the Protestants of the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:66032:205"/>Kirk of Scotland;</hi> modelled in many places by the Principles of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>'s
Doctrine, which <hi>Knox</hi> had brought with him from <hi>Geneva;</hi> but being
put unto the Vote, it was opposed by no more than three of the Temporal
Lords, that is to say, the Earl of <hi>Atholl,</hi> and the Lords <hi>Somervil</hi> and <hi>Borth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi>
who gave no other reason for it, <hi>but that they would believe as their fathers
did.</hi> The Popish Prelates were silent in it, neither assenting nor opposing:
Which being observed by the Earl-Marshal, he is said to have broke out into
these words following; <hi>Seeing</hi> (saith he) <hi>that my Lords the Bishops (who by their
learning can, and for the zeal they should have to the truth, ought as I suppose to
gainsay any thing repugnant to it) say nothing against the Confession we have heard;
I cannot think but that it is the very truth of God, and that the contrary of it false
and deceivable Doctrine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let us now cross over into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where we shall find the Queen as active
in advancing the reformed Religion, as she had been in either of the other
Kingdoms. King <hi>Henry</hi> had first broke the ice, by taking to himself the Title
of <hi>Supream Head</hi> on earth of the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> exterminating the Popes
authority, and suppressing all the Monasteries and Religious Houses. In mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
doctrinal, and forms of Worship, as there was nothing done by him, so
neither was there much endeavoured in the time of King <hi>Edward,</hi> it being
thought perhaps unsafe to provoke that people in the Kings minority, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
with how many troubles he was elsewhere exercised. If any thing
were done therein, it was rather done by tolleration than command. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
was so done, was presently undone again in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
But Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> having setled her affairs in <hi>England,</hi> and undertaken the
protection of the <hi>Scots,</hi> conceived her self obliged in point of piety, that
<hi>Ireland</hi> also should be made partaker of so great a benefit. A Parliament is
therefore held on the 12th. of <hi>January,</hi> where past an Act, restoring to the
Crown the antient jurisdiction over all Ecclesiastical and Spiritual persons.
By which Statute were established both the Oath of Supremacy and the High
Commission, as before in <hi>England.</hi> There also past an Act for the Uniformity
of Common Prayer, &amp;c. with a permission for saying the same in Latine, in
such Church or place, where the Minister had not the knowledge of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Tongue. But for translating it into <hi>Irish</hi> (as afterwards into <hi>Welsh</hi> in the
5th. year of this Queen) there was no care taken, either in this Parliament, or
in any following. For want whereof, as also by not having the Scriptures in
their native language, most of the natural <hi>Irish</hi> have retained hitherto there old
barbarous customes, or pertinaciously adhere to the corruptions of the Church
of <hi>Rome.</hi> The people by that Statute are required under several penalties, to
frequent their Churches, and to be frequent at the reading of the English Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,
which they understand no more than they do the Mass. By which
means the <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ish</hi> was not only kept in continual ignorance as to the Doctrines
and Devotions of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but we have furnished the Papists
with an excellent Argument against our selves, for having the Divine Service
celebrated in such a language as the people do not understand.</p>
                     <p>There also past another Statute for restoring to the Crown the first fruits,
and twenty parts of all Ecclesiastical promotions within that Kingdom; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of all impropriat Parsonages, which there are more in number than those
Rectories which have cure of souls. King <hi>Henry</hi> had before united the first
fruits, &amp;c. to the Crown Imperial, but Queen <hi>Mary</hi> out of her affection to
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> had given them back unto the Clergy, as before was
said. The like Act passed for the restitution of all such lands belonging to the
Knights of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as by that Queen had been regranted to the
Order; with the avoidance of all Leases and other grants, which had been
made by Sir <hi>Oswald Massingberd,</hi> the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

what was like to follow, had voluntarily forsook the Kingdome in the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust</hi>
foregoing, and thereby saved the Queen the charge of an yearly pension,
which otherwise he might have had as his Predecessors had before him in the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:66032:205"/>
time of King <hi>Henry.</hi> During the Reign of which King, a Statute had been made
in <hi>Ireland</hi> (as in <hi>England</hi> also) for the electing and consecrating of Archbishops
and Bishops, repealed in the year first of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and now revived by her
sister, in which there is nothing more memorable, than that amongst many
other Ceremonies therein directed, there is mention of giving the <hi>Pall</hi> to a new
Archbishop, that being an Ornament or Habit peculiar only unto those of the
highest ranck in the holy Hierarchy. And that she might not only take care
for the good of the Church, without consulting her own safety, she caused an
Act to pass for the recognition of her own just title to the Crown, as before
in <hi>England.</hi> All which being done, she left the prosecution of the work to her
Bishops and Clergy, not so well countenanced by power as they were by
Law; and yet more countenanced by Law than they made good use of. For
many of them finding how things went in <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and knowing that the like
alterations would ensue amongst themselves, resolved to make such use of the
present times, as to inrich their friends and kindred by the spoil of their
Churches. To which end they so dissipated the revenues of their several Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks,
by long Leases, see Farms, and plain alienations, that to some of their
Sees they left no more than a Rent of five Marks <hi>per annum,</hi> to others a bare
yearly Rent of 40 shillings, to the high displeasure of Almighty God, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of Religion, the great disservice of the Church, and the perpetual igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny
of themselves for that horrible sacrilege.</p>
                     <p>It is now time that we hoise sail again for <hi>England,</hi> where we shall find an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
made ready for us in a Sermon preached by Reverend <hi>Jewel,</hi> then
newly Consecrated Bishop of the Church of <hi>Sarisbury.</hi> The Sermon preached

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:66032:206"/>token or a remembrance of Christs body, had therefore been iudg'd for an Heretick.
13. Or that it was lawful then to have thirty, twenty, fifteen, ten, or five Masses
said in one day. 14. Or that images were then set up in the Churches, to the intent
the people might worship them. 15. Or that the lay people were then forbidden to
read the word of God in their own tongue. 16. Or that it was then lawful for the
Priest to pronounce the words of Consecration closely, or in private to himself. 17.
Or that the Priest had then authority to offer up Christ unto his Father. 18. Or to
communicate and receive the Sacrament for another, as they do. 19. Or to apply the
vertue of Christs death and passion to any man by the means of the Masse. 20. Or
that it was then thought a sound doctrine to teach the people, that Mass <hi>ex opere
operato,</hi> that is, even for that it is said and done, is able to remove any part of our sin.
21. Or that any Christian man called the Sacrament the Lord his God. 22. Or that
the people were then taught to believe that the body of Christ remaineth in the
Sacrament, as long as the accidents of Bread and Wine remain there without corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
23. Or that a mouse, or any other worm or beast, may eat the body of Christ,
(for so some of our Adversaries have said and taught.) 24. Or that when Christ
said <hi>hoc est corpus meum,</hi> the word <hi>hoc</hi> pointed not the Bread, but <hi>individuum
vagum,</hi> as some of them say. 25. Or that the Accidents, or Forms, or Shews of
Bread and Wine, be the Sacraments of Christs body and blood, and not rather the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Bread and Wine it self. 26. Or that the Sacrament is a sign or token of the body
of Christ that lyeth hidden underneath it. 27. Or that ignorance is the mother and
cause of true Devotion; <hi>the conclusion is, that I shall be then content to yield

                     <p>This <hi>Challenge</hi> being thus published in so great an auditory, startled the
English Papists both at home and abroad, none more than such of the fugitives,
as had retired to <hi>Lovain, Doway,</hi> or St <hi>Odomars</hi> in the Low Country Provinces
belonging to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> The business first agitated by the exchange of
friendly Letters, betwixt the said Reverend Prelate, and Dr <hi>Henry Cole</hi> the late
Dean of St <hi>Pauls;</hi> more violently followed in a book of <hi>Rastal</hi>'s who first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in the lists against the <hi>Challenger.</hi> Followed therein by <hi>Dorman</hi> and
<hi>Marshal,</hi> who severally took up the cudgels to as little purpose; the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well beaten by <hi>Nowel,</hi> and the last by <hi>Calfhil,</hi> in their discourses writ against
them. But they were only <hi>velilations,</hi> or preparatory skirmishes in reference
to the main encounter, which was reserved for the Reverend Challenger him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and Dr. <hi>John Harding,</hi> one of the Divines of <hi>Lovain,</hi> and the most
learned of the College. The Combatants were born in the same County,
bred up in the same Grammar School, and studied in the same University also:
So that it may be said of them, as the Historian hath of <hi>Jugurth</hi> and <hi>Sylla</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Caius Marius,</hi> that is to say, that they both learned those feats of Arms
in the same Camp, and under the same Commander, which afterwards they
were to exercise against one another. Both zealous Protestants also in the
time of King <hi>Edward,</hi> and both relapsed to Popery in the time of Queen
<hi>Mary; Jewel</hi> for fear, and <hi>Harding</hi> upon hope of favour and preferment by it.
But <hi>Jewel</hi>'s fall may be compared to that of St <hi>Peter,</hi> which was short and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
rising again by his repentance, and fortified more strongly in his faith than
before he was: But <hi>Harding</hi>'s like to that of the other <hi>Simon,</hi> premeditated and
resolved on, never to be restored again (so much was there <hi>within him of the
gaul of bitternesse</hi>) to his former standing. But some former differences had
been between them in the Church of <hi>Sarisbury,</hi> whereof the one was Prebenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and the other Bishop, occasioned by the Bishops visitation of that Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral,
in which as <hi>Harding</hi> had the worst, so was it a presage of a second foil
which he was to have in this encounter. Who had the better of the day, will
easily appear to any that consults the writings. By which it will appear how
much the Bishop was too hard for him at all manner of weapons. Whose lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
answers as well in maintainance of his <hi>Challenge,</hi> as in defence of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology,
(whereof more hereafter) contain in them such a magazin of all sorts
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:66032:206"/>of learning, that all our controversors since that time, have furnished themselves
with Arguments and Authority from it.</p>
                     <p>But these discourses came not out until some years after, though the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was given now by this famous <hi>Challenge;</hi> the interval being spent in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
by the <hi>Romish</hi> party, before they shewed themselves in publick. In
the mean time, the Papists mad enough before, seemed to grow more outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
upon this occasion, though they were willing to impute it to some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cause. <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> shewed himself much incensed against her, as well
for altering the Religion here by him established, as for refusing him in mariage
when the offer had been made unto her by the Count of <hi>Feria;</hi> Nor was the
Count less troubled at it than the King. And in this melancholy humour he
imploys all his interess with the Pope then being, for subjecting her unto a
sentence of Excommunication. Which motion if it had been press'd on
Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the 4th. who seemed very much displeased at her for accepting the Crown
without his consent, there is no question to be made but that it had
been hearkned to with a listning ear, and executed with a rash and ungoverned
hand. But <hi>Paul</hi> the 4th. deceased about the middle of <hi>August,</hi> in the year last
past, and <hi>John Angelo</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Medices,</hi> succeeded him by the name of
Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the 4th. in <hi>December</hi> following. Who being a more moderate man,
did not think fit to proceed to such extremities. For seeing that his power was
a thing rather consisting in the conceits of men, than in truth and substance, if
it should once appear that this thunderbolt of Excommunication (whereby
the world is so much terrified) should prove ineffectual and without all power,
then might this great authority fall into contempt, and become ridiculous.
Upon which ground he goes another way to work, and is resolved to try all
fair and plausible means, for gaining her to the obedience of the See Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
To which end he directs unto her an affectionate Letter, in which he
calls her his dearest daughter, and seems exceeding careful of her salvation, and
the prosperity of her people; not to be found by wandring out of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Catholick Church, to which she is again invited with much Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
meekness. Which Letter he dispatcheth by the hands of <hi>Vincentius Parpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
a right trusty Minister, and one (by reason of some former imployments
hither in the time of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>) not unknown to her. Whom he had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
also with some secret instructions to be communicated to her at his
being in <hi>England.</hi> Concerning which (for with that intimation he concludes
his Letter) the same <hi>Vincentius</hi> was to deal more largely with her, and declare
his fatherly affection towards her; She being in like sort desired to receive him
lovingly, hear to him diligently, and to give the same credit to his speeches, as
she would to the Pope himself.</p>
                     <p>This letter of the Popes bears date on the 5th. of <hi>May, Anno</hi> 1560.
before which time the Queen had caused the English Liturgy to be translated into
Latine, using therein the pen and diligence of <hi>Walter Haddon,</hi> (as some sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
who afterwards appeared against <hi>Ossorius</hi> upon several Arguments. And
being translated into Latine, it was commended by her Letters Parents of the

to the Colleges of <hi>Eaton</hi> and <hi>Winchester,</hi> to be used by them in their several
and respective Chapels. And she caused further, some selected Hymns to be
added to it for some particular occasions, but most especially to be sung in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
and solemn obsequies; which not being warranted by the Statute of the
year preceding, were therefore authorized with a <hi>non obstante.</hi> All which as
she was thought to do, to satisfie and instruct all forein Princes in the form and
fashion of our Devotions; So did she so far satisfie the Pope then being, that
he shewed himself willing to confirm it by his Papal power. The learned <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

that this <hi>Parpalio</hi> was instructed to offer in the name of his Holiness, that
the English Liturgy should be confirmed; the use of the Communion in both
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:66032:207"/>kinds allowed of. And that all Sentences which had passed in the Court of
<hi>Rome</hi> against the marriage of her Mother, should be rescinded and made void,
conditioned onely, that she would re-unite her self to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
and acknowledge the Primacy of that See. For the carrying on of which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
the Abbot was commissionated to distribute some thousands of Crowns
amongst such men, as should be found most forward to effect the same. <hi>Sanders</hi>
makes this to be another of his secret mandates, that if she had any diffidence
in her Title to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> either in regard of the doubtfulness of
her Legitimation, or any thing which had been done by the authority of the
Pope and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> all matters should be cleared and sweetned to her
best advantage, by the benignity and favour of the See Apostolick. But for all
this, the Abbot came no nearer than <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

being suffered to set foot upon English ground, whether it were upon a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
suspition, that under colour of such plausible and specious overtures,
he was designed to encourage a Rebellion amongst the Papists, as was thought
by some; or rather, that the Queen was grown so confident of her own just
Title, and the affections of her people, as not to be beholden to the Pope for
a confirmation, remains a matter undetermined by our best Historians. How it
succeeded with this Pope in another project for the reducing of this Kingdom
under his command, we shall see hereafter.</p>
                     <p>But all this while there was no care taken to suppress the practice of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

rather at some Rites and Extrinsecalls of it. Their purpose was to shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so expert in the Art of War, as to take in the Out-works of Religion
first, before they levelled there Artillery at the Fort it self. The Schismaticks
at <hi>Franckfort</hi> had no sooner heard of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s death, but they made
what haste they could for <hi>England,</hi> in hope of fishing better for themselves in
a troubled water than a composed and quiet Current; Followed not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

all their haste, they came not time enough to effect their purposes,
either in reference to the Liturgy or Episcopal Government, on which the
Queen had so resolved according to her own most excellent judgment, that
they were not able to prevail in either project. It grieved them at the heart
that their own Prayers might not be made the rule of Worship in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,
and that they might not Lord it here in their several Parishe, as
<hi>Calvin</hi> did in the Presbytery of the Church of <hi>Geneva.</hi> Some friends they had

their ends; and he was seconded therein by <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> who thought
his interest in <hi>England</hi> to be greater than <hi>Calvin</hi>'s, though his name was not
so eminent in other places. But the Queen had fixed her self on her resolution
of keeping up the Church in such outward splendor, as might make it every
way considerable in the eye of the world; so that they must have faith enough
to remove a mountain, before they could have hope enough to draw her to
them. When therefore they saw the Liturgy imposed by Act of Parliament,
and so many Episcopal Sees supplyed with able Pastors, nothing seemed more

against Capps and Surplices, and such particulars as had then been questioned
in the publick Liturgy; And herein they were seconded (as before in King
<hi>Edward</hi>'s time) by the same <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> as appears by his Letters to a name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:66032:207"/>friend, bearing date at <hi>Zarick</hi> on the 4th. of <hi>November</hi> 1560. to which
he added his dislike in another of his Letters to the same friend also, touching
the same and other points proposed unto him, that is to say, the Cap, the
Episcopal Habit, the Patrimony of the Church, the manner of proceeding to
be held against Papists, the Perambulation used in the Rogation weeks, with
many other points of the like condition, in which his judgment was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired.</p>
                     <p>But these helps being too far off, and not to be consulted with upon all
inconveniencies, without a greater loss of time than could consist with the
impatiency of their desires, they fell upon another project, which promised
them more hopes of setting up their Discipline, and decrying the Liturgy,
their quarrells about Caps and Vestments. Some friends they had about the

themselves, and in that Church not onely to erect the <hi>Genevian</hi> discipline, but
to set up a form of Prayer, which should hold no conformity with the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Liturgy. They could not but remember those many advantages which
<hi>John Alasco</hi> and his Church of Strangers afforded to the <hi>Zuingiian</hi> Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
in the Reign of King <hi>Edward,</hi> and they despaired not of

to some other place, the Christians obtained that it should be dedicated
to the blessed Virgin, and by that name was given unto the Brotherhood of
<hi>St. Anthony</hi> of <hi>Vienna</hi> by King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3d. After which time, an Hospital
was there founded by the name of <hi>St. Anthony,</hi> consisting of a Master, two
Priests, one School-master, and twelve poor men; Inlarged in the succeeding
times by the addition of a fair Grammar-School, and other publick Buildings
for the use of the Brethren. It was privileged by King <hi>Edward</hi> the 4th. to
have Priests, Clerks, Scholars, poor men, and Brethren of the same, or Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

                     <p>And now again we have another Church in <hi>London,</hi> as different from the
Church of <hi>England</hi> in Government and forms of Worship, and some Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
also, as that of <hi>John Alasco</hi> was in the <hi>Augustine Friers.</hi> Not must we
marvail if we find the like dangerous consequents to ensue upon it: for what
else is the setting up of a Presbytery in a Church, founded and established by
the Rules of Episcopacy, than the erecting of a Commonwealth or popular
Estate in the midst of a Monarchy? Which <hi>Calvin</hi> well enough perceived, and
thereupon gave <hi>Gryndal</hi> thanks for his favour in it, of whom they after served
themselves upon all occasions. Upon the news of which success, divers both
<hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> repaired into <hi>England,</hi> planting themselves in the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towns,
and openly professing the Reformed Religion, under which covert,
they disguised their several Heterodoxies and blasphemous Dotages, some of
them proving to be <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> others infected with unfound opinions of as
ill a nature, but all endeavouring to disperse their Heretical Doctrines, and
by invenoming the good people amongst whom they lived, to encrease their

them all by her Proclamation to depart the Kingdom, whether they were
Aliens or natural born English, and not to stay above the tearm of twenty

Religion, under colour of conforming to this command, defaced all such
Images of Christ and his Apostles, all Paintings which presented any History
of the holy Bible, as they found in any windows of their Churches or Chapels.
They proceeded also to the breaking down of all Coats of Arms, to the tearing
off of all the Brasses on the Tombs and Monuments of the dead, in which the
figures of themselves, their wives or children, their Ancestors, or their Arms,
had been reserved to posterity. And being given to understand, that Bells had

had been abused to Superstition and Idolatry, their zeal transported them in
fine to sell their Bells, to turn the Steeples into Dove-coats, and to rob the
Churches of those sheets of Lead with which they were covered. For the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining
of which Sacrilege and prophane abuses, she gave command in her
said Proclamation of the 19th. of <hi>September,</hi> 
                        <q>That all manner of men should
from thenceforth forbear the breaking or defacing of any parcel of any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument,
or Tomb, or Grave, or other Inscription and Memory of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
deceased, being in any manner of place; Or to break any Image of
Kings, Princes, or Nobles, Estates of this Realm, or of any other that have
been in times past erected and set up for the onely memory of them to their
posterity, in common Churches, and not for any Religious honor; Or to
break down or deface any Image in glass-windows in any Church, without
the consent of the Ordinary, upon pain of being committed to the next
Gaol without Bail or Mainprize, and there to remain till the next com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the Justices for Gaol-delivery, and then to be further punished by
Fine or Imprisonment (besides the restitution or re-edification of the thing
broken) as to the said Justices shall seem meet, and if need shall be, to use
the advice of her Majesties Council in her Star-chamber.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was also signified in the said Proclamation, <q>That some Patrons of
Churches and others, who were possessed of Impropriations, had prevailed
with the Parson and Parishioners, to take or throw down the Bells of
Churches or Chapels, and the Lead of the same, and to convert the same
to their private gain, by which ensued not onely the spoil of the said
Churches, but even a slanderous desolation of the places of Prayer. And
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:66032:208"/>thereupon it was commanded, that no manner of person should from
thenceforth take away any Bells or Lead off any Church or Chapel, under
pain of Imprisonment during her Majesties pleasure, and such further Fine
for the contempt as shall be thought meet; With a charge given to all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and other Ordinaries, to enquire of all such contempts done from the
beginning of her Majesties Reign, and to enjoyn the persons offending to
repair the same within a convenient time, and of their doing therein to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the Privy Council, or the Council in the Star-chamber, that order may
be taken therein.</q> And in persute of this most seasonable and religions
Act, she did not onely signe the said Proclamation, one for all, to authorise
it for the Press, as the custom is, but signed them every one apart (amounting
to a very great number) with her own Royal Hand, that so it might be known
rather for her own proper act than an act of the council.</p>
                     <p>With like care also she provided for the honor and prosperity of her estate,
in affairs Politick and Civil. The monies of the Realm had been much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based
by King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. to the great disprofit of the Merchant, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of the Kingdom, for which, no remedy had been taken by her Brother
or Sister, though they had better opportunities, and more advantages to go
thorow with it. But this brave Queen, endeavouring nothing more, than the
restoring of her Kingdom to its antient splendor, first caused all such base
monies as were coined by any of her Predecessors, to be decryed to a less va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
according to the fineness or alloy thereof; and that being done, by vertue
of her Proclamation bearing date the 28th. of <hi>September,</hi> she caused all the
said base monies, so reduced to a lower value, to be brought in to her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Mint, for which she gave them mony of the purest silver, (such as passed
commonly by the name of <hi>Easterling</hi> or <hi>Sterling</hi> mony) since which time, no
base mony hath been coyned in <hi>England,</hi> but onely of pure Gold and Silver,
to pass for current in the same; save that of late times, in relation to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of poor people, a permission hath been given to the coyning of Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things,
which no man can be forced to accept in satisfaction of a Rent or
Debt; which as it could not be affirmed of <hi>England</hi> in the times preceding, so
neither can it now be said of any State or Nation in the Christian world, in all
which, there are several sorts of copper mony, as current with them for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
uses, as the purest metal. She provided also in like manner for her peoples
safety, and the encrease of Trade and Merchandise in English Bottoms; For
towards the end of this second year, she made great preparation of Ordinance,
Arms, Munition, and Powder of her own materials, to be in a
readiness to defend her Realm in all emergencies of danger; For the
advancing of which service it so pleased the divine Providence which watched
over her actions, that a rich Mine of Brass was found near <hi>Keswick</hi> in <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi>
such as sufficed not onely for furnishing her own Forts and Ships
with all manner of Ordinance, but for supplying other Countries as their
wants required. And to compleat so great a mercy in her preservation, the
Stone called <hi>Lapis Calaminaris,</hi> exceeding necessary for all Brass-works, was
at the same time also found in <hi>England</hi> in most plentiful manner. And whereas
complaint was made unto her by the Merchants of the <hi>Hans-towns,</hi> or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
of the <hi>Stilyard</hi> as then commonly called, that King <hi>Edward</hi> had first
ceized their Liberties, and that afterwards Queen <hi>Mary</hi> had raised their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
upon all sorts of Merchandises from one to twenty in the Hundred,
her Answer was, That as she was resolved not to Innovate any thing, so she
could grant no other privileges and immunities to them than those in which
she found them when she came to the Crown. Their Trading hereupon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
intermitted, the English Merchants took the managing of it upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and thrived therein so well after some adventures, that Cloth, and
other Manufactures, heretofore transported in the ships of those Merchants,
were from henceforth fraughted and dispersed in English Vessels; By
means whereof, the English in a very short time attained unto the reputation
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:66032:209"/>
of being the wealthiest Merchants, the most expert Mariners, and the ablest
Commanders for Sea-fights of any Nation in the world.</p>
                     <p>I shall conclude this year with a work of piety in the foundation of the
Collegiat Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Westminster,</hi> which in the space of twenty
years had been changed from an Abbey to a Deanry, from a Deanry to a See
Episcopal, reduced unto a Deanry again, and finally restored to the state of an
Abbey. But the Abbey being dissolved in the foregoing Parliament, an offer
was made to <hi>Fecknam</hi> and the rest of the Convent (if <hi>Sanders</hi> be to be believed
in this particular) for continuing in their places and possessions as before they
did, clogged with no other conditions than the taking of the Oath of <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi>
and officiating all divine Offices by the English Liturgy. But this offer
being by them rejected, the Act of dissolution passed in both Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
Concerning which there goes a story, that the Lord Abbot being then
busied in planting some young Elms in the Deans yard there, one that came
by advised him to desist from his purpose, telling him, That the Bill was just
then passed for dissolving his Monastery. To which the good old man replied,
That he resolved howsoever to go on with his work, being well assured, that
that Church would be always kept for an encouragement and seat of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And so it proved in the event; for the Queen having pleased her self in
the choice of some of the best Lands which remained unto it, confirmed the
rest upon that Church, which she caused to be called the <hi>Collegiat Church of
St. Peter in Westminster,</hi> as appears by her Letters Parens bearing date in the
second year of her most gracious and most prosperous Reign. A foundation of
a large capacity, and as amply privileged, consisting of a Dean, and twelve
secular Canons, two School masters, and forty Scholars, petit Canons and
others of the Quire to the number of thirty, ten Officers belonging to the
Church, and as many servants appertaining to the College diet, and twelve
Alms-men, besides many Officers, Stewards, Receivers, and Collectors, for
keeping Courts, and bringing in of their Revenue; the principal of which,
called the High Steward of <hi>Westminster,</hi> hath ever since been one of the prime
Nobility, and in great favour at the Court. The Dean entrusted with keeping
the <hi>Regalia,</hi> honored with a place of necessary service at all Coronations, and
a Commissioner for the Peace within the City of <hi>Westminster</hi> and the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of it by Act of Parliament. The Dean and Chapter vested with all manner
of jurisdiction both Ecclesiastical and Civil, not onely within the City and
liberties of <hi>Westminster,</hi> but within the precinct of St. <hi>Martins le grand,</hi> and
some Towns of <hi>Essex,</hi> exempted in the one from the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and in
the other from the power of the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> The Scholars an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
preferred by election, either to <hi>Christ-Church</hi> in <hi>Oxon,</hi> or <hi>Trinity Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege</hi>
in <hi>Cambrige,</hi> each College being bound by an Indenture made with Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to take off yearly two or three at the least (though since, that
number is extended to four or five) to be preferred to Scholarships &amp; Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
in their several Houses. A College founded as it proved in such a
happy conjuncture, that since this new foundation of it, it hat given bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and preferment to four Archbishops, two Lord Chancellors, or Lord
Keepers of the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> twenty two Bishops, and thirteen
Deans of cathedral Churches, besides Archdeacons and Prebendaries, and
other dignitaries in the Church to a proportionable number; which is more
than can be said of either of the two famous Colleges of <hi>Aeton</hi> and <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
or of both together, though the one was founded 168, and the other 114
years before it.</p>

when he had scarce lived to the end of his 17th. year, and had Reigned
but one year and five months, or thereabouts. His death much altered both
the counsels and affairs of Christendom, distracting the <hi>French</hi> Nation into
schisms and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Reformation, and promising no small security to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in regard
of the pretensions of the Queen of <hi>Scots.</hi> But so little was her condition
bettered by it, that she seemed to be in more danger by the acts of her enemies
after his decease, than formerly in the time of his life and government. <hi>Francis</hi>
of <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ise,</hi> a man of great abilities for Camp and Counsel, had made himself
a very strong party in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> which he intended to make use of
for the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> whose Mother, the late Queen Regent of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was
his only sister. And this he might the better do by reason of a division in the
Court of <hi>France</hi> about the government of the Kingdom, during the minority
of <hi>Charls</hi> the 9th. the second brother, and next heir to the King deceased.
<hi>Katherine de Medices</hi> the Relict of <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d. and the Mother of <hi>Charls,</hi>
layes claim to the Regency; for who could have a greater care either of the
young Kings person or estate, than his natural Mother? But against her, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Duke of <hi>Vendosme</hi> by descent, and King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> at the least in Title, in the
Right of <hi>Joan d' Albret</hi> his wife, the sole Heir of that Crown, layes his claim
unto it, as being the first Prince of the blood, and therefore fitter to be trusted
with the Regency by the rules of that government. The <hi>Guisian</hi> faction joyn
themselves to that of the Queen, of whom they better knew how to make ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
than they could of the other, and to that end endeavour by all subtil
artifices, to invest her in it.</p>
                     <p>To this end they insinuate themselves into the Duke, perswade him either
to relinquish his demands of the Regency, or to associate himself with the
Queen-Mother in the publick government; and to joyn counsels with the
Catholick party for suppressing the <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

him to, or at least take him off from his first persute, they offered to procure a
Divorce from his present wife, and that instead of holding the Kingdom of
<hi>Navarr</hi> in Right of his wife, he should hold it in his own personal capacity by
a grant from the Pope, his wife being first deprived of it by his Holiness, as
suspected of <hi>Lutheranism;</hi> that being divorced from his wife, he should marry
<hi>Mary</hi> Queen of the <hi>Scots,</hi> with whom he should not only have the Kingdom
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but of <hi>England</hi> also, of which <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was to be deprived on the
same account; that for the recovery of that Kingdom, he should not only
have the Popes authority, and the power of <hi>France,</hi> but also the forces of the
King of <hi>Spain;</hi> and finally, that the Catholick King did so much study his
contentment, that if he would relinquish his pretensions to the Crown of
<hi>Navarr,</hi> he should be gratified by him with the soverainty and actual possession
of the Isle of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> of which he should receive the Crown with all due so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities.
By which temptations when they had render'd him suspected to
the Protestant party, and thereby setled the Queen-Mother in that place and
power, which so industriously she aspired to, they laid him by as to the Title,
permitting him to live by the air of hope for the short time of his life, which
ended on the 17th. of <hi>November, Anno</hi> 1562. And so much of the game was
plaid in earnest, that the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ke of <hi>Guise</hi> did mainly labour with the Pope, to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
his Excommunications against <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as one that had renounced his
authority, apostated from the Catholick Religion, and utterly exterminated
the profession of it out of her Dominions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="138" facs="tcp:66032:210"/>
But the Duke sped no better in this negotiation, than the Count of <hi>Feria</hi>
did before. The Pope had still retained some hope of regaining <hi>England,</hi> and
meant to leave no way unpractised by which he might obtain the point he
aimed at. When first the See was vacant by the death of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the 4th.
the Cardinals assembled in the <hi>Conclave</hi> bound themselves by oath, that for the
better setling of the broken and distracted estate of Christendome, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
formerly held at <hi>Trent,</hi> should be resumed withall convenient speed that
might be. Which being too fresh in memory to be forgotten, and of too great
importance to be laid aside, the new Pope had no sooner setled his affairs in
<hi>Rome,</hi> which had been much disordered by the harshness and temerity of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor,
but he resolved to put the same in execution. For this cause he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults
with some of the more moderate and judicious Cardinals, and by his reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
and dexterity, surmounts all difficulties which shewed themselves in
the design; and he resolved not only to call the Council, but that it should be
held in <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> to which it had been formerly called by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the 3d. 1545.
that it should rather be a continuance of the former Council which had been
interrupted by the prosecution of the wars in <hi>Germany,</hi> than the beginning of a
new; and that he would invite unto it all Christian Princes, his dear daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England</hi> amongst the rest. And on these terms he stood
when he was importuned by the Ministers of the Duke of <hi>Gvise,</hi> to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
her to a sentence of Excommunication, and thereby to expose her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
to the next Invader. But the Pope was constantly resolved on his first
intention of treating with her after a fair and amicable manner, professing a
readiness to comply with her in all reciprocal offices of respect and friendship,
and consequently inviting her amongst other Princes to the following Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;
to which if she should please to send her Bishops, or be present in the
same by her Ambassadors, he doubted not of giving them such satisfaction, as
might set him in a fair way to obtain his ends.</p>
                     <p>Leaving the Pope in this good humour, we shall go for <hi>England,</hi> where we
shall find the Prelates at the same imployment in which we left them the last
year, that is to say, with setting forth the Consecrations of such new Bishops
as served to fill up all the rest of the vacant Sees. The first of which was <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Horn,</hi> Dr. in Divinity, once Dean of <hi>Durham,</hi> but better known by hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
up the English Liturgy, and such a form of Discipline as the times
would bear, against the schismaticks of <hi>Franckfort,</hi> preferred unto the See of
<hi>Winchester,</hi> and consecrated Bishop in due form of Law, on the 16th. of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary.</hi>
Of which we shall speak more hereafter on another occasion. On
which day also Mr. <hi>Edmond Scambler,</hi> Batchelor of Divinity, and one of the
Prebendaries of the new Collegiat Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Westminster,</hi> was
consecrated Bishop of the Church of <hi>Peterborough.</hi> During the vacancy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and in the time of his incumbency, Sir <hi>William Caecil</hi> principal Secretary of
Estate, possess'd himself of the best Mannors in the <hi>Soake</hi> which belonged unto
it; and for his readiness to confirm the same Mannors to him, preferred him
to the See of <hi>Norwich, Anno</hi> 1584. Next followes the translation of Dr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Young</hi> Bishop of St. <hi>Davids,</hi> to the See of <hi>York,</hi> which was done upon the
25th. of <hi>February</hi> in an unlucky hour to that City, as it also proved: For
scarce was he setled in that See, when he pulled down the goodly Hall, and
the greatest part of the Episcopal Palace in the City of <hi>York,</hi> which had been
built with so much care and cost, by <hi>Thomas</hi> the elder, one of his predecessors
there, in the year of our Lord 1090. Whether it were for covetousness to
make money of the materials of it, or out of fordidness to avoid the charge of
Hospitality in that populous City, let them guess that will. Succeeded in the
See of St. <hi>David</hi>'s, by <hi>Davis</hi> Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> translated thither the 21 of
<hi>May,</hi> 1561. as he was by another of the same name, Dr. <hi>Thomas Davis,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
few months after.</p>
                     <p>The Province of <hi>York</hi> being thus fitted with a new Archbishop, it was not
long before the consecration of Dr. <hi>James Pilkinton</hi> to the See of <hi>Durham,</hi>
                        <pb n="139" facs="tcp:66032:210"/>

Bishoprick, when that Town seemed to be in danger of such <hi>French</hi> forces as
had been brought into that Kingdom, or otherwise might fear some practice
of the popish party, for the advancing of the interess of the Queen of <hi>Scots.</hi>
The Bishops Tenants were protected in their corn and cattel by the power of
this Garison, and consequently the more inabled to make just payment of
their rents; and it was thought to be no reason that the Queen should be at
the sole charge of protecting his Tenants, and he enjoy the whole benefit of
it without any disbursement. But this was only a pretence for raising some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
to the Crown out of that rich patrimony; the pension being still ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him with relation to his brother <hi>George,</hi> a man much used in many imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

their several prisons for their further cure. At which the Papists made good game,
and charged it on the score of the Reformation, as if the Principles thereof
did naturally lead men to those dreams and dotages. Whereas they could not

needs be taken and accounted for the holy Ghost. Or if they think the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
might pretend unto more perfection than the Primitive times, they
should have looked no farther back than to King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3d. in whose
Reign the Popes authority in <hi>England</hi> was at the highest; and yet neither the
Pope by his authority, nor by the diligence of his Preachers and other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
could so secure the Church from <hi>Mores</hi> and <hi>Geoffrys,</hi> but that two
men rose up at that very time, both which affirmed themselves to be <hi>Jesus

the necessity of the like condemnation.</p>
                     <p>Nor did the <hi>Zuinglian Gospellers,</hi> or those of the <hi>Genevian</hi> party, rejoyce
much less at a most lamentable accident which hapned to the cathedral
Church of St. <hi>Paul</hi> on the fourth of <hi>June,</hi> on which day, about four or five
of the clock in the afternoon, a fearful fire first shewed it self near the top of
the Steeple, and from thence burnt down the Spire to the stone-work, and
Bells, and raged so terribly, that within the space of four hours the Timber and
Lead of the whole Church, and whatsoever else was combustible in it, was
miserably consumed and burnt, to the great terror and amazement of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders;
Which Church, the largest in the Christian world for all dimensions,
contains in length 720 foot, or 240 Taylors yards, in breadth 130 foot, and
in heighth from the pavement to the top of the roof 150 foot. The Steeple
from the ground to the cross or Weather-cock contained in height 520 foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of which the square Tower onely amounted to 260. the Pyramid or Spire
to as many more. Which Spire being raised of ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ie Timber, and covered
over with sheets of Lead, as it was the more apt to be inflamed, so was the
mischief more incapable of a present remedy. The terror being over, most men
began to cast about for the first occasion of such a miserable misfortune; the
generality of the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> or <hi>Genevian</hi> party affirmed it for a just judgment
of God upon an old idolatrous Fabrick, not throughly reformed and purged
from its Superstitions, and would have been content that all other Cathedrals
in the Kingdom had been so destroyed. The Papists on the other side ascribe it
to some practice of the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> faction, out of their hatred unto all solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and decency in the service of God, performed more punctually in that
Church, for examples sake, than in any other of the Kingdom. But generally
it was ascribed by the common people to a flash of lightning, or some such
suddain fire from heaven, though neither any lightning had been seen, or
any clap of thunder had been heard that day. Which fiction notwithstanding
got such credit amongst the vulgar, and amongst wiser persons too, that the
burning of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Steeple by lightning was reckoned amongst the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Epoches</hi> or accounts of time in our common Almanacks; and so it stood
till within these thirty years now last past, when an old <hi>Plumber</hi> at his death
confessed that wofull accident to have hapned through his negligence onely,
in leaving carelesly a pan of coals and other fewel in the Steeple when he
went to dinner, which catching hold of the dry timber in the Spire before his
return, was grown so dangerous, that it was not possible to be quenched, and
therefore to no purpose (as he conceived) to make any words of it. Since which
discovery, that ridiculous Epoche hath no more been heard of.</p>
                     <p>But the Queen quickly hearing what a great misfortune had befallen the
City, regarded not the various reports of either party, but bent her thoughts
upon the speedy reparation of those fearful ruines; And knowing right well
(without the help of an Informer) that the Patrimony of that Church had
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:66032:211"/>
been so wasted in these latter times, that neither the Bishop, nor the Dean and
Chapter were able to contribute any thing proportionable to so vast a charge;
She directed her Letters to the Lord Mayor and city of <hi>London</hi> to take care
therein, as most concerned in the preservation of their Mother-Church, and
in the honor of their City. In obedience to whose Royal pleasure, the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
granted a Benevolence and three Fifteens to be speedily paid, besides the
extraordinary bounty of particular persons, or was to be issued from the
chamber. And that they might proceed therein with the greater zeal, the
Queen sent in a thousand Marks in ready money, and warrants for one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
load of timber to be served out of her Majesties woods. Incouraged by
which brave example, the Clergy of the Province of <hi>Canterbury</hi> contributed
towards the furtherance of the work, the fortieth part of their Benefices which
stood charged with first fruits, and the thirtieth part of those which had paid the
same. The Clergy of the Diocess of <hi>London</hi> bestowing the thirtieth part of
such of their Livings as were under the burthen of that payment, and the
twentieth part of those which were not. To which the Bishop added at seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times the sum of 900 l 1 s. 11 d. the Dean and Chapter 136 l. 13 s. 4 d. By
which and some other little helps (the benevolence, the three fifteens, and the
contributions of the Bishop and Clergy, with the aid aforesaid, amounting
to no more than 6702 l. 13 s. 4 d.) the work was carried on so fast, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the end of <hi>April</hi> 1566. the timber work of the roof was not only fitted,
but compleatly covered. The raising of a new spire was taken also into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
but conceived unnecessary; but whether because it was too
chargeable, or that some feared it might prove a temptation, is not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.</p>
                     <p>And now the season of the year invites the Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
already in his way as far as <hi>Flanders,</hi> and there expecting the Queens
pleasure touching his admittance; For the Pope always constant to his reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
could not be taken off from sending his <hi>Nuncio</hi> to the Queen, with
whom he conceived himself to stand upon tearms of amity. It had been much
laboured by the <hi>Guisiards</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> faction to divert him from it, by telling
him that it would be an undervaluing of his power and person, to send a <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>o</hi>
into <hi>England,</hi> or to any other Princes of the same perswasions, who openly
professed a separation from the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> To which he made this prudent
and pious answer, that he would humble himself even to Heresie it self; in
regard that whatsoever was done to gain souls to Christ, did beseem that See.
And to this resolution he adher'd the rather, because he had been told and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by <hi>Karn</hi> the old English Agent, that his <hi>Nuncio</hi> would be received by one
half of the Kingdom with the Queens consent. But as it proved, they recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned both
without their Host and Hostess too, who desired not to give enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
unto any such guests. For having designed the Abbot <hi>Martiningo</hi> to
this imployment, and the Abbot being advanced as far as <hi>Flanders,</hi> as before
was said, he there received the Queens command not to cross the seas. Upon
advertisement whereof, as well the King of <hi>Spain</hi> himself, as <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi>
Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> (the most powerful Minister of that King) did earnestly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
that he might be heard; commending the cause of his Legation, as visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
conducing to the union of all the Christian Church in a general Council.
But the Queen persevered in her first intent, affirming she could not treat with
the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> whose authority was excluded out of <hi>England</hi> by consent
of Parliament. Nor had the Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> in <hi>France</hi> any better fortune in
treating with <hi>Throgmorton</hi> the English Agent in that Court, to advance the
business; who though he did solicit by his Letters both the Queen and the
Council, to give some satisfaction in that point to the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
(though not unto the Pope himself) could get no other answer from them,
but the same denyal.</p>
                     <p>For so it was, that on the first noise of the <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s coming, the business
had been taken into consideration at the Council Table, and strongly pleaded
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:66032:212"/>
on both sides, as mens judgements varied. By some it was alleged in favour
of the <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s coming, that Pope <hi>Pius</hi> was nothing of so rugged a nature, as
his Predessor; that he had made a fair address unto the Queen by his last years
Letters; that his designs did most apparently tend to the peace of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
that the admitting of the <hi>Nuncio</hi> was a matter which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

his Overtures; but that the refusing to admit him to a publick audience, was
the most ready way to disoblige all Catholick Princes, with whom she stood
at that time in terms of amity. On the other side it was alleged, that King
<hi>Henry,</hi> a most prudent Prince, had formerly protested against the calling of
this Council by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the 3d. who did as much pretend to the peace of
Christendome, as the Pope now being; that to admit a Minister of the Pope,

the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have alwaies raised great advantages by the smallest conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and therefore that it was most expedient for the good of the Kingdom,
to keep him alwaies at a distance; that Queen <hi>Mary</hi> in favour only unto <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

refused to give admittance to Cardinal <hi>Peitow,</hi> though coming from the Pope
in quality of a <hi>Legate</hi> a <hi>Late<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>e;</hi> that a great part of the people were in discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
with the change of Religion, and wanted nothing but such an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to break out into action, as the <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s presence might afford them;
and therefore that it concerned the Queen to be as zealous for Religion and
the weal of her people, as her sister the late Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was in maintenance
of Cardinal <hi>Pole</hi> and his private authority. And to say truth, the greatest ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle
in the way of the <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s coming, was partly laid in it by the indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
of some Papists in <hi>England,</hi> and partly by the precipitancy of the Popes
Ministers in <hi>Ireland.</hi> For so it was, that the only noise of the coming of a
<hi>Nuncio</hi> from the Pope, had wrought in sundry evil-disposed persons such a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and boldness, that they did not only break the Laws made against the
Pope and his authority, with great audacity, but spread abroad false and slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
reports, that the Queen was at the point to change her Religion, and
alter the government of the Realm. Some also had adventured further, even
to a practising with the Devil by conjurations, charms, and casting of Figures,
to be informed in the length and continuance of her majesties Reign. And on
the other side, the Popes Legate being at the same time in <hi>Ireland,</hi> not only
joyned himself to some desperate Traytors, who busied themselves in stirring
up rebellion there, but for as much as in him was, had deprived her Majesty of
all Right and Title to that Kingdom. Upon which grounds it was carried
clearly by the Board against the <hi>Nuncio.</hi> Nor would they vary from the Vote
upon the intercession of the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> or (whose displeasure was
more dangerous) of the Duke of <hi>Alva.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nothing discouraged with the repulse which had been given to the <hi>French</hi>
and <hi>Spaniard,</hi> the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> must make tryal of his fortune also,
not as they did, in favour of the <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s coming, but in perswading her to
return to the old Religion. To this end he exhorts her by his Letters in a
friendly way, not to relinquish the Communion of so many Catholick Kings
and Princes, and her own Ancestors into the bargain; nor to prefer her sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
judgement, and the judgement of a few private persons, and those not the
most learned neither, before the judgement and determination of the Church
of Christ. That if she were resolved to persist in her own opinion, she should
deal favourably with so many reverend and Religious Prelates as she kept in
prison, and which she kept in prison for no other reason but for adhering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that Religion which himself professed; and, finally he intreats most earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that she would set apart some Churches to the use of the Catholicks, in
which they might with freedome exercise their own Religion, according to
the Rites and Doctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> To which desires she made a
full and sufficient answer, by satisfying him touching her merciful dealing with
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:66032:212"/>
those Bishops, whom for their obstinacy and many other weighty reasons, she
had deprived of their preferments in the Church. And to the rest she answered,
That she had setled her Religion on so sure a bottome, that she could not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be changed; that she doubted not but that she had many learned men in
her Dominions, which were able to defend the doctrine by them taught, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all Opponents; and that for granting any Churches to the use of the
Papists, it was a point so contrary to the polity and good Lawes of the Land,
that she desired to be excused for not yielding to it. In which last she seemed
to have an eye upon the Edict of the Emperour <hi>Constantine,</hi> touching the mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the <hi>Marcionites, Novatians, Valentinians,</hi> and other Hereticks of that
age; In which it was enjoined, that none of them should from thenceforth
hold any assemblys, and that for the more certain conforming unto his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
those Churches or other houses whatsoever they were, in which they
used to hold their Meetings, should be demolished to the ground, to the end
that there might be no place in which such men as were devoted to their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
faction, might have the opportunity of assembling together. For
which the Reader may consult <hi>Eusebius</hi> in the life of <hi>Constantine, l. b. 3. cap.</hi> 63.
But that it might appear both to him and others, that she was ready to shew
all just favours, she laid a most severe command upon all her Officers, for the
full payment of all such pensions, as had been granted unto all such Abbots,
Monks and Friers, in the time of her father, as were not since preferred in the
Church to cures or dignities. And this to be performed to the utmost far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
on pain of her most high displeasure in neglect thereof.</p>
                     <p>It could not be but that the governing of her affairs with such an even and
steady hand, though it occasioned admiration in some, must needs create both
envy and displeasure in the hearts of other Christian Princes, from none of
which she had a juster cause to fear some practice, than the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or
rather from the fierce and intemperate Spirit of the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> as appeared
afterwards when he was made Lord Deputy, or Vice-Gerent of the Belgick
Provinces. They had both shewed themselves offended, because their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
in behalf of the <hi>Nuncio</hi> had found no better entertainment; and when
great persons are displeased, it is no hard matter for them to revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
if they find their adversaries either weak or not well provided. But the
Queen looked so well about her, as not to be taken tardy in either kind. For
which end she augments her store of Arms and Ammunition, and all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for the defence of her Kingdom; which course she had happily begun in
the year foregoing. But holding it a safer maxim in the Schools of Polity, not
to admit, than to endeavour by strong hand to expel an enemy, She entertains
some fortunate thoughts of walling her Kingdom round about with a puissant
Navy, for Merchants had already increased their shipping, by managing some
part of that wealthy trade which formerly had been monopolized by the <hi>Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>se</hi>
or <hi>Easterlings.</hi> And she resolves not to be wanting to her self in building ships
of such a burthen, and so fit for service, as might inable her in short time, not
only to protect her Merchants, but command the Ocean. Of which the <hi>Spaniard</hi>
found good proof to his great loss, and almost to his total ruine, in the last 20
years of her glorious government. And knowing right well that mony was the

                        </gap>inew of war, she fell upon a prudent and present course to fill her coffers. Most
of the monies in the Kingdom were of forein coynage, brought hither for the
most part by the Easterling and <hi>Flemish</hi> Merchants. These she called in by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,

for current within this Realm, which counsel took such good effect, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
came flowing into the Mint, insomuch that there was weekly brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> for the space of half a year together, 8000. 10000.
12000. 16000. 20000. 22000 l. of silver plate, and as much more in Pistols,
and other gold of <hi>Spanish</hi> coins, which were great sums according to the stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:66032:213"/>
of those early dayes, and therefore no small profit to be growing to her by
the coynage of them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Genevians</hi> slept not all this while, but were as busily imployed in practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
upon the Church, as were the <hi>Romanists</hi> in plotting against the Queen.
Nothing would satisfie them, but the nakedness and simplicity of the <hi>Zuingli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Churches, the new fashions taken up at <hi>Franckfort,</hi> and the Presbyteries of
<hi>Geneva.</hi> According to <hi>the pattern which they saw in those mounts,</hi> the Church
of <hi>England</hi> is to be modell'd; nor would the Temple of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> have served
their turn, if a new Altar fashioned by that which they found at <hi>Damascus,</hi>
might not have been erected in it. And they drove on so fast upon it, that in
some places they had taken down the steps where the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tar stood, and brought
the Holy Table into the midst of the Church; in others they had laid aside the
antient use of Godfathers and Godmothers in the administration of Baptism,
and left the answering for the child to the charge of the father. The weekly
Fasts, the time of Lent, and all other dayes of abstinence by the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
were looked upon as superstitious observations. No fast by them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
of but occasional only, and then too of their own appointing. And
the like course they took with the Festivals also, neglecting those which had been instituted by the Church, as humane inventions, not fit to be retained in
a Church reformed. And finally, that they might wind in there outlandish
Doctrines with such forein usages, they had procured some of the inferiour
Ordinaries to impose upon their several Parishes, certain new books of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
and Expositions of the holy Scripture, which neither were required
by the Queens Injunctions, nor by Act of Parliament. Some abuses also
were discovered in the Regular Clergy, who served in Churches of peculiar or
exempt jurisdiction. Amongst whom it began to grow too ordinary, to marry
all such as came unto them, without Bains or Licence, and many times not
only without the privity, but against the express pleasure and command of
their Parents. For which those Churches past by the name of <hi>Lawlesse Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi>
in the voice of the people.</p>
                     <p>For remedy whereof it was found necessary by the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
to have recourse unto the power which was given unto him by the Queens
Commission, and by a clause or passage of the Act of Parliament <hi>for the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of Common Prayer and Service in the Church, &amp;c.</hi> As one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
for Causes Ecclesiastical, he was authorized with the rest of his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociates,
according to the Statute made in that behalf, <hi>To reform, redresse, order,
correct and amend all such Errours, Heresies, Schisms, abuses, offences, con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>empts
and enormities whatsoever,</hi> as might from time to time arise in the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> and did require <hi>to be redressed and reformed to the pleasure of Almighty
God, the increase of vertue, and conservation of the peace and unity of the Kingdom.</hi>
And in the passage of the Act before remembred, it was especially provided,
<q>That all such Ornaments of the Church, and of the Ministers thereof, should
be retained and be in use, as were in the Church of <hi>England</hi> by authority of
Parliament, in the second year of the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th. until
further Order should be therein taken by authority of the Queens Majesty,
with the advice of her Commissioners Appointed &amp; Ordered under the Great
Seal of <hi>England</hi> for Causes Ecclesiastical, or of the Metropolitan of this
Realm. And also if there shall happen any contempt or irreverence to be
used in the Ceremonies or Rites of the Church, by the misusing of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the said Book of Common Prayer; the Queens Majesty might by the
like advice of the said Commissioners or Metropolitan, Ordain or publish
such further Ceremonies or Rites, as should be most for the advance of Gods
glory, the edifying of his Church, and the due reverence of Christs holy My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
and Sacraments.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fortified and assured by which double power, the Archbishop by the Queens
consent, and the advice of some of the Bishops, Commissionated and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to the same intent, sets forth a certain book of Orders to be diligently
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:66032:213"/>
observed and executed by all and singular persons whom it might concern. In
which it was provided, <q>That no Parson, Vicar or Curate of any exempt
Church, (commonly called <hi>Lawless</hi> Churches) should from thenceforth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to conjoin, by solemnization of Matrimony, any not being of his
or their Parish Church, without sufficient testimony of the Bains being
ask'd in the several Churches where they dwel, or otherwise were sufficiently
licenced. That there should be no other dayes observed for Holy days or
Fasting dayes, as of duty and commandment, but only such Holy dayes as
be expressed for Holy dayes in the Calendar lately set forth by the Queens
authority; and none other Fasting dayes to be so commanded, but as the
Lawes and Proclamations of the Queens Majesty should appoint; that it
should not be lawful to any Ordinary, to assign or enjoyn the Parishes to
buy any Books of Sermons or Expositions in any sort, than is already, or shall
be hereafter appointed by publick Authority; that neither the Curates, or
Parents of the children which are brought to Baptism, should answer for
them at the Font, but that the antient use of Godfathers and Godmothers
should be still retained; and finally, that in all such Churches in which the
steps to the Altar were not taken down, the said steps should remain as before
they did; that the Communion Table should be set in the said place
where the steps then were, or had formerly stood; and that the Table of Gods
Precepts should be fixed upon the wall over the said Communion Board.</q>
Which passage compared with that in the Advertisements, published in the
year 1565. (of which more hereafter) make up this construction, that the
Communion Table was to stand above the steps, and under the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and therefore all along the wall, on which the ten Commandments
were appointed to be placed, which was directly where the Altar had stood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Some other Innovations and disorders had been obtruded on the Church
at the same time also by those of the <hi>Genevian</hi> faction; for the suppressing
whereof, before they should prescribe to any Antiquity, the like course was
taken. But what those Innovations and disorders were, will easily be seen by
the perusal of the <hi>Orders</hi> themselves, which were then published in Print by
the Queens command; as a judicious Apothecary is able to conjecture by the
Doctors <hi>Recipe</hi> at the distemper of the Patient, and the true quality of the
disease.</p>
                     <p>Nothing else memorable in this year of a publick nature, but the foundation
of the <hi>Merchant-Taylors</hi> School in <hi>London,</hi> first founded by the Master, War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and Assistants of the Company of <hi>Merchant-Taylors,</hi> whence it had the
name, and by them founded for a seminary to St <hi>John</hi>'s in <hi>Oxon,</hi> built and
endowed at the sole costs and charges of one of their Livery. The School kept
in a fair large house in the Parish of St <hi>Laurence Poutney,</hi> heretofore called the
Mannor of <hi>Roose,</hi> belonging to the Dukes of <hi>Ruckingham;</hi> towards the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
and accommodating whereof to the present use, five hundred pounds
was given by one <hi>Richard Hills,</hi> who had been once Master of the Company,
and still lives in the charity of so good a work. The day of the foundation is
affirmed by <hi>Stow</hi> to have been the 21 of <hi>March,</hi> and so may either fall in the
year 1560. or 1561. according to the several computations which are now in
use; but howsoever within the compass of this third year of the Queen. And
it is probable, that it may be fixed by him upon that day, either because the
purchase of the House doth bear date upon it, or because it was then first open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for a Grammar School. And of this kind, but of a far more private nature,
was the foundation of another Grammar School in the Town of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> built
at the charge of Sir <hi>Roger Manwood,</hi> and indowed with 40 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> which
was a very large allowance as the times then were.</p>

                        </gap>ession was made of the
whole Clergy of the city, of the Divines &amp; Prelates, (who besides the Caroinals
were 112 that did wear <hi>Miters</hi>) accompanied by their families, and by many
country people armed, going from St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church to the Cathedral,
where the Cardinal of <hi>Mantua</hi> sung the Mass of the holy Ghost, and <hi>Gasparo
del Fosso</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Rheggio</hi> made the Sermon; his subject was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Church, Primacy of the Pope, and Power of Councils; He said,
That the Church had as much authority as the Word of God, that the Church
hath changed the Sabbath ordained by God, into Sunday, and taken away Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
formerly commanded by Divine Majesty, and that these precepts are
changed, not by the preaching of Christ, but by the authority of the Church.
Turning himself unto the Fathers, he exhorted them to labour constantly
against the Protestants, being assured, that as the Holy Ghost could not erre,
so neither could they be deceived. And having sung the Hymn of <hi>Come holy
Ghost,</hi> the Secretary, who was Bishop of <hi>Tilesie,</hi> read the Bull of the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the foresaid Archbishop propounded the Decree for opening the
Council, saying, <hi>Fathers, doth it please you that the General Council of</hi> Trent
<hi>should be celebrated from this day, all suspension whatsoever being removed, to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle

                           </gap>sing, to remove the controversies of Religion, correct Manners, and reconcile the
Peace of the Church?</hi> To which they answered <hi>Placet</hi> with so full a vote, that
there were found no more than four Bishops, and those four all <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
who stumbled at the clause about discussing nothing in the time of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
but what the Legats should propose; so servile were the rest, in prostitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Authority of the Council to the lust of the Pope.</p>
                     <p>In the first opening of the Council it was propounded by the Legates
amongst other things, <hi>Whether a safe conduct should be given unto those who were
fallen into heresie, with a large promise of great and singular clemency, so that they
would repent, and acknowledge the power of the Catholick Church.</hi> In the discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of which point, the Cardinal of <hi>Man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ua</hi> was for the affirmative, seeing
that it was a remedy used by all Princes, in Seditions or Rebellions, to pardon
those whom they could not overcome, because by that means, those which
were least faulty did retire, and the other did remain more weak. But as for
the safe conduct, after it had been considered of and resolved at <hi>Rome,</hi> it was
again disputed in the Council on the third of <hi>March,</hi> whether it was to be
given by name to the <hi>French, English,</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> and some spake of the <hi>Greeks</hi>
and other Nations of the <hi>East.</hi> It was presently seen, that these poor men, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
in servitude, could not without danger and assistance of mony think
of counsels; And some said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there being a division of the Protestants, it was
good to let them alone, and not to name them, alleging the danger of moving
ill humors in a body which was then quiet. To give a safe conduct to the
English-men, which neither they nor any of them did require, would be a
great indignity; they were content it should be given to the <hi>Scots,</hi> because
their Queen would demand it, but so, as that the demand should first be made.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:66032:214"/>
For <hi>France</hi> there was a doubt made,<note place="margin">An. Reg. Eliz. 4. 1560.</note> whether the Kings Council would take
it ill or not, because it would be thought to be a declaration that that King had
Rebels. Of <hi>Germany</hi> none would doubt, because it had been formerly granted
unto them; and if it were granted to that Nation alone, it would seem that
the others were abandoned. But at the last, all difficulties were resolved into
this conclusion, that the safe conduct should be given unto those of <hi>Germany</hi> in
the same words wherein it formerly had passed, <hi>An.</hi> 1552. &amp; that the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
in the self-same words wherin it was given to the <hi>Germans,</hi> should be given
to all of every Nation, Province, City and Place, where any thing was preached,
taught, &amp; believed, contrary to that which was believed in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Legats might have spared themselves the trouble of these conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
the Protestant Bishops of <hi>England</hi> not being so forward to venture
themselves into that Council on such weak assurance, considering how ill the
safe conduct had been formerly kept to <hi>John Hus</hi> and <hi>Jerom of Prague</hi>
at the Council of <hi>Constance:</hi> And as for those of the Papal party, though they
might have a good will to be gadding thither, yet the Queen kept them safe
enough from going abroad. So that there was no hopes for any English Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of either party to attend that service; The Queen had absolutely refused
to admit the <hi>Nunci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> when he was sent on purpose to invite them to it. And
some of the most learned of that sacred Order had shown sufficient reasons in
their printed <hi>Manifest,</hi> why no such service or attendance could be looked for
from them. One <hi>Scipio,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Venice,</hi> who formerly had some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with Bishop <hi>Jewel</hi> when he was a student in <hi>Padua,</hi> had heard of
<hi>Martiningo</hi>'s ill success in his Negotiation, which notwithstanding, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to spend some eloquence in labouring to obtain that point by his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Letters, which the <hi>Nuncio</hi> could not gain as a public Minister; And to
this end he writes his Letters of expostulation to his old friend Mr. <hi>Jewel,</hi>
preferred not long before to the See of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> in which he seemed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
exceedingly that <hi>England</hi> should send no Ambassador, nor Message, or
Letter, to excuse their Nations absence from the general Appearance of
Christianity in that <hi>Sacred Council,</hi> In the next place, he highly extolled the
antiquity and use of <hi>General Councils,</hi> as the onely means to decide contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
in Religion, and compose the distractions in the Church, concluding
it a superlative sin for any to decline the authority of it. But this Letter did
not long remain unanswered, that learned Prelate was not so unstudied in the
nature of <hi>

eloquently penned, and so elaborately digested<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that neither <hi>Scipio</hi> himself, nor
any other of that party, durst reply upon him; the Answer to be found at large
in the end of the history of this Council, translated into English by Sir <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel

                        </gap>
or refusing the Popes invitation, it will not be amiss to present the
sum and substance of it in a short Epitome.</p>
                     <p>In the first place he signifies to the said <hi>Scip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>o,</hi> that a great part of the world
professing the name of Christ (as <hi>Greeks, Armenians, Ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>o nor summoned to this Council.
Secondly, That <hi>England</hi>'s absence was not so great a wonder, seeing many
other Kingdoms and Free states (as <hi>Denmark, Sweden, Scotland,</hi> Princes of
<hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Hanse-towns</hi>) were not represented in this Council by any of
their Ambassadors. Thirdly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That this pretended Council was not called
according to the antient custom of the Church, by the <hi>Imperial Authority,</hi>
but by the <hi>Papal Usurpation.</hi> Fourthly, That <hi>Trent</hi> was a petty place, not of
sufficient receit for such multitudes as necessarily should repair to a <hi>General
Council.</hi> Fifthly, That Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the 4th. by whose command the Council
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:66032:215"/>
was re-assembled, purcha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>d his place by the unjust practices of Simonie and
Briberie, and managed it with murder and cruelty. Sixthly, That repairing to
Councils was a free act, and none ought to be condemned of <hi>Contumacy,</hi> if
it stood more with their conveniency to stay at home. Seventhly, That an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
it was accepted as a reasonable excuse of <hi>holy Pis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ops,</hi> absenting or
withdrawing themselves from any Council, if they vehemently suspected
ought would be acted therein prejudicial to the truth, lest their (though not
<hi>actual) included concurrence</hi> might be interpreted a countenancing thereof.
Eighthly, That our Bishops were employed in feeding their Flocks, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
their Churches, and could not be spared from their charge without
prejudice to their consciences. Ninthly, That the Members of that Council
of <hi>Trent,</hi> both Bishops and Abbots, were by Oath pregaged to the Pope, <hi>To
defend and maintain his authority against all the world.</hi> And lastly, He desired to
know in what capacity the English Clergy should appear in this Council, not
as free persons to debate matters therein, in regard they had been pre-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
as Hereticks by Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the 3d. nor as <hi>offenders</hi> to receive the
sentence of condemnation, to which they had no reason to submit themselves.</p>
                     <p>Of these refusals and the reasons of them, neither the Pope at <hi>Rome,</hi> nor
the Cardinal Leg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ts in the Council could pretend to be ignorant, yet still the
expectation of the comming of some English Bishops must be kept on foot,
partly for the encouragement of such as were there already, and partly for the
drawing on of others who came slowly forwards, and sometimes also it was
used for an artifice to divert the Prelates when any business was in agitation
which seemed dangerous to them. For so it hapned, that some of the Prelates
being earnest in the point of Residence, none of the Legats could devise a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
expedient to put off that Question, than to propose that some means should
be used to set at liberty the English Bishops which were imprisoned by their
Queen, that comming to the Council it might be said, that that noble Nation
was present also, and not wholly alienated from the Church. This pleased all,
but the common opinion was, that it might sooner be desired than hoped for:
They concluded, that the Queen having refused to receive a <hi>Nuncio</hi> expresly
sent from the Pope, it could not be hoped that she would hearken to the
Council; therefore all they could do was, to perswade the Catholick Princes
to mediate for them: And mediate though they did, as before was said, both
for the admitting of the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and the restoring of those Bishops to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
liberty, they were not able to prevail, especially as to the licensing of any
of them to attend the Council; which if the Queen had yielded to, she must
have armed so many of her enemies to disturb her peace, who questionless
would have practised with the Ambassadors of all Princes, and with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
of all Nations whom they found there present, to work some notable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
in the Government and affairs of <hi>England.</hi> Of all the Bishops which
were left in <hi>England</hi> at the end of the Parliament, I find none but <hi>Pates</hi> of
<hi>Worcester</hi> and <hi>Goldnel</hi> of <hi>St. Asaph</hi> who forsook the Kingdom, though possibly
many of the rest might have done so also, if they had not either been well
watched, or trusted upon their <hi>Parol</hi> to be forth-comming (as the phrase is)
upon all occasions. And though I find the name of <hi>Pates</hi> subscribed to some
of the former Sessions, yet it is not to be found to this, the man being of a

by the authority and reputation which <hi>Calvin</hi> carried in those Churches,
and the contentment which the people took in a form of Government, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they were to have a share by the rules of their Discipline, and thereby draw
the managery of affairs unto themselves. Being grown numerous in the City
of <hi>Tours,</hi> and not permitted to enjoy the liberty of assembling within the
walls, they held their meetings, at a village not far off, for their publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions;
the way to which leading through the gate of St. <hi>Hugo</hi> is thought to
have occasioned the name of <hi>Hugonots,</hi> which others think to have been given
them by reason of their frequent nightly meetings, resembled by the <hi>French</hi>
to the walking of a Night-spirit which they called St. <hi>Hugh;</hi> but from what
ground soever it came, it grew in short time to be generally given as a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name
to those which professed the Reformed Religion, (whether in <hi>France</hi> or
else-where) after <hi>Calvin</hi>'s platform. Their numbers not diminished by so
many butcheries, gave them the reputation of a party both stout and active,
which rendred them the subject of some jealousie to the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> and
specially to those of the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> who laboured nothing more than
their extirpation. But this severity sorted to no other effect than to confirm
them in their Doctrines, and attract many others to them, who disdained to
see poor people drawn every day to the Stake to be burned, guilty of nothing
but of zeal to worship God, and to save their own souls: To whom were
joyned many others, who thinking the <hi>Guisiards</hi> to be the cause of all the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders

they might oppose with Arms the violent Domination of the House of <hi>Guise,</hi>

an Edict is published by the King on the 18th. of <hi>March</hi> 1560, (in the <hi>French</hi>

they profered to her the said Towns whereof they had charge, if it
would please her Majesty to further their proceedings in defence of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
(as they called it.) And seemed to justifie their offer by a publick ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement,
that her Majesty was not only true inheritour to those
Towns, but also to the whole Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi> But neither their coming,
not their message was unknown unto her, who had been secretly advertised of
all passages there by Sir <hi>Nicholas Throgmorton,</hi> a vigilant and dexterous man,
who being her Majesties Resident in that Kingdom, had driven the bargain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hand, and made all things in readiness against their coming. Nor was the
Queen hard to be intreated to appear in that cause which seemed so much to
her advantage. She was not ignorant of the pretensions of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi>
and the practices of her Uncles of the House of <hi>Gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>On these and other considerations of the like importance, it was agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
between them, that the Queen should supply the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and his
associates, with a sufficient quantity of money, corn, and ammunition, for
the service of the French King, against the plots and practices of the House of
<hi>Guise;</hi> that she should aid them with her forces both by land and sea, for the
taking in of such Castles, Towns, and Ports, as were possessed by the faction
of the said Duke; that the said Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and his associates should not
come to any terms of peace with the opposite party, without the privity and
approbation of the Queen; and that as well for securing the payment of all
such monies, as for the safe going in and out of all such forces as her Majesty
should supply them with, the Town and Port of <hi>Newhaven</hi> should be put unto

her Majesties hands, to be garrison'd by English souldiers, and commanded by
any person of quality, whom her Majesty should authorise to keep and defend
the same. Immediately on which accord, a Manifest was published in the name
of the Queen; in which it was declared, how much she had preferred the peace
of Christendom before her own particular intere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

general affection to the publick peace, she had relinquished her claim to the
Town of <hi>Calais</hi> for the term of eight years, when as all other Princes were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
by that Treaty to their lost estates; that for the same reasons she had
undertaken to preserve the <hi>Scots</hi> from being made vassals to the <hi>French,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
retaining any part of that Kingdom in her own possession after the service
was performed; that with the like bowels of commiseration, she had observed
how much the Queen-Mother of <hi>France</hi> was awed, and the young King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
inthralled by the <hi>Guisian</hi> faction, who in their names, and under pretence
of their authority, endeavoured to root out the professors of the Reformed

of those counsels, she proceeds to the supplying of the said Prince and his
party, with all things necessary for the war, and sends over a sufficient strength
of ships, arms, and men, as well to scour the seas, as secure the land. The
men amounting to 6000, were divided into two equal parts, of which the one

all <hi>Scots,</hi> and of the Regiment of Count <hi>Montgomery,</hi> which were

which proved a great refreshment to the souldiers in it. And on the 6th. the

betwixt whom and the garison souldiers of <hi>Hareflew</hi> on the one side, and those

skirmishes.</p>
                     <p>Cross we next over into <hi>Scotland,</hi> that we may see in what condition our
affairs stood there. The death of the late <hi>French</hi> King had made that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
so uncomfortable to the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> that she desired to hasten back
into her own. And thereunto she was much animated by the Heads of either
faction, but on different ends. Her presence earnestly solicited by the Popish
party, in hope by her authority to suppress their opposites, and by the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
on some strong presumptions, that they could deal better with her when
they had her there, than when she was protected by the power of <hi>France,</hi> and
governed by the counsels of the <hi>Guisian</hi> faction. Before her leaving of that
Kingdom, she had been pressed by <hi>Throgmorton</hi> the English Resident, to ratifie
the Pacification m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>de at <hi>Edenborough,</hi> to which she would by no means yield,
till she had advised with the nobility, and other of her subjects of the Realm
of <hi>Scotland.</hi> This makes the Queen of <hi>England</hi> doubtful that she should be
deserted by the Scots of the Congregation, to whom she had done so many
good offices in the time of their troubles. But having dealt with some of the
chief amongst them, she found a resolution in them, for adhering to her, which
so assured her on that side, that she feared but little danger from the Queen
and her party, whensoever she came. Which notwithstanding, it was held to
be the safer course to intercept her if they could in her passage thither. And to
that end a squadron of ships was sent to sea, but under colour of suppressing
some Pirates, by whom the trade of merchandise was given out to be hindered.
But the taking of one of the <hi>Scotish</hi> ships, with the Earl of <hi>Eglington,</hi> and other
passengers of that Nation were making homewards, declared sufficiently that
they looked for a far richer prize. But for the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> her self, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of a thick fog which hung over the seas, she past by the <hi>English</hi> unpercei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and landed at the Port of <hi>Leeth</hi> on the 20th. of <hi>August, Anno</hi> 1561. From
thence she sends <hi>Lethington</hi> the younger, with Letters to the Queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
tending especially to express that great love and kindness which she bare

true and sincere friendship with her. At what time she received letters also to
the same effect from some of the Nobility of that Kingdom. In which they sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
withall, <hi>That the surest way to continue amity and friendship betwixt them

                     <p>But this demand, as it was unlooked for, so was it of too high a nature to be
hastily answered. So that the Laird of <hi>Lethington</hi> could prevail no further at
that time, than to gain a promise from the Queen, that she would do nothing
to the prejudice of the Title of her Cosen of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The rest was left to be
considered of in a personal conference, appointed to be held at <hi>York</hi> in the
end of <hi>June.</hi> Which motion first proceeded from the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> who was
thought to have been earnest and real in it, partly for making a firm peace with

of that Country. Neither was the meeting disliked of the better sort, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it would serve, besides the preservation of the common peace, to bring
her to a liking of the Reformed Religion. But they who were popishly set,
fearing greatly the conference, spake openly against it, saying, that of such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terviews,
there was never seen any good effect; and that it would not be safe
for the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> to put he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

she had made a claim. But notwithstanding these unprofitable delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the interview was agreed upon, and the numbers on either side determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and all things provided for the journey, when suddenly the Queen of
<hi>England</hi> by her Letters excused her self, desiring that it might be respited till
the year next following. Which the <hi>Scots</hi> Queen was not sorry to hear upon
further thoughts, considering how much the <hi>French</hi> King and her Uncles of
the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> might have been dissatisfied on the newes of that Inter-Parleance.
Neither did Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> want her reasons to decline the
meeting, which some believe was never really intended by her; but that she ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the fail would have been on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

the same cause of quarrel against the daughter, which King <hi>Henry</hi> took against
the father, on the like disappointment. Others conceived, that she might fear
a growing less by it in the eyes of her people, the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> having so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
advantages above her both in youth and beauty. But it was generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
to be against all reason of State, to give her Rival opportunity of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gracious with the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>England,</hi> and laying the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a faction in the Court it self.</p>
                     <p>But the Queen had deeper matters to take up her thoughts than any such
feminine jealousies and emulations, though these perhaps might also have their
place amongst them. A spirit of sedition had begun to shew it self in the year
last past, upon the bare noise of the coming of the <hi>Nuncio</hi> hither. Not
much diminished (if it were not much increased) by the sitting of the
Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> in which it was believed that some proceedings would
be had against her. Which seeds being sowen, began first to shew themselves
in a petit rebellion, in <hi>Merton</hi> College in <hi>Oxon;</hi> sufficiently discovered by
those small beginnings, that some design of greater consequence was in agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Wardenship of that house being void by the death of <hi>Gervase,</hi> one
<hi>Man</hi> is chosen to the place. But his election being questioned, and his admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
thereupon opposed by a contrary faction, the gover<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ment of the College
devolved of course upon one <hi>Hall</hi> a Senior Fellow, sufficiently known to be
of Popish inclinations, though for the saving of his place he had conformed as
others did, to the present time. No sooner was he in this power, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trives
some old superstitious hymns, which formerly had been sung on several
Festivals in the times of Popery, prohibiting the use of such as had been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by <hi>Gervase</hi> the late Warden there. This gave incouragement and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to the Popish party, to insult over the rest, especially over all those
of the younger sort, who had not been trained up in their <hi>Popish</hi> principles;
so that it seemed a penal matter to be thought a Protestant. Notice whereof
being given to Archbishop <hi>Parker,</hi> (the Ordinary Visitour of that College in
the Right of his See) he summoneth <hi>Hall</hi> on the 20th. of <hi>May</hi> to appear before
him, and caused the Citation to be fastned to the Gate of the College. But his
authority in that case was so little regarded, that the seal of the Citation was
torn off by some of that party. Hereupon followed a solemn visitation of the
College by the said Archbishop. The result whereof was briefly this, that all
were generally examined; <hi>Man</hi> confirmed Warden, <hi>Hall</hi> justly expelled, his
party publickly admonished; the young scholars relieved, the Papists cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
and suppressed, and Protestants countenanced and incouraged in the whole
University.</p>
                     <p>But this was only the Essay of those greater commotions which were to have
insued upon it; though withall it proved a prognostick of their ill success,
which constantly attended the designs of the Romish faction. For presently

encouragements and exasperations to put that party upon dangerous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive

the Race of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th. by <hi>Margaret</hi> his eldest daughter, married to
<hi>James</hi> the 4th. of <hi>Scotland;</hi> which may the rather be supposed, because I find

Certain it is, that many strange whispers were abroad, and no small hopes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by those of the Popish faction for suppressing the Protestants in all
parts of the Kingdom, and setting up their own Religion as in former times;
a matter neither to be entertained without strong temptations, nor compassed
without stronger forces, than they could raise amongst themselves, but by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
&amp; supply from some forein Princes. On which account, amongst some
others which were found to be of the Plot, <hi>Arthur Pole,</hi> granchild of <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi>

she carried to their Royal extraction.</p>
                     <p>And yet it may be possible that there was something in it of State-craft as
well as clemency, which might induce the Queen to spare them from the
stroke of the Ax, which was, to keep them for a ballance to the House of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi>
of whom she now began to conceive some jealousies. The Lady <hi>Katharine

the Lady <hi>Katherine Gray</hi> languisheth long under the disgrace of this rejection,
none daring to make any particular addresses to her, for fear of being involved
in the like calamities as had befallen her father and the rest of that Family.
But at the last the young Earl of <hi>Hertford</hi> contracts himself privately unto
her, and having consummated the marriage with her, gets leave to travail

corrupted to give way unto it. Which practice so incensed the Queen, that
hurried on with jealousie, and transported with passion, she caused a fine of
five thousand pounds to be set upon him in the Star-chamber, and kept him
close prisoner for the space of nine years, at the end whereof he was restored
to liberty by the death of the Lady, who died a prisoner in the Tower. And

being newly restored unto the Title of <hi>Hertford,</hi> by the great goodness of the
Queen, incurred her high displeasure, and was thereupon committed prisoner

of those <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> than to our own natural English. But whether
it were true or not, or rather how untrue it is in all particulars, the exchange
of writings on both sides doth most plainly manifest. In general it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
<q>That the <hi>Apology</hi> was published in the name of the Church of

the profession of the Doctrine contained in it was offered unto the whole
Church of God, and so unto the Pope and the Council too, if they were
any part or member of the Church; that if names be so necessary, he had the
names of the whole Clergy of <hi>England</hi> to confirm that Doctrine, and <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>'s
too amongst the rest in the time of King <hi>Edward;</hi> that for not having
the Princes privilege, it might easily be disproved by the Printer; that it
was not conceived in such a dark corner as was objected, being afterwards
imprinted at <hi>Paris</hi> in Latine, and having since been translated into the

<hi>France, Flanders, Germany, Spain, Poland, Hungary, Denmark, Sweden, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Italy, Naples,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> it self, it was tendred to the judgment of the
whole Church of God; that it was read and seriously considered of in the
convent of <hi>Trent,</hi> and great threats made that it should be answered, and the
matter taken in hand by two notable learned Bishops, the one a <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
and the other an <hi>Italian,</hi> though in fine neither of them did any thing in it;
and finally, that certain of the English Papists had been nibling at it, but
such as cared neither what they writ, nor was cared by others.</q> And so much
may suffice in general for this excellent Piece, to the publishing whereof, that
learned Prelate was most encouraged by <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> (as appears by <hi>Martyr</hi>'s
Letter of the 24th. of <hi>August</hi>) with whom he had spent the greatest part of
his time when he lived in Exile: And happy had it been for the Church of
<hi>England</hi> if he had never done worse offices to it, than by dealing with that
reverend Bishop to so good a purpose. But <hi>Martyr</hi> onely lived to see the
Book which he so much longed for, dying at <hi>Zurick</hi> on the 12th. day of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi>

                     <p>THe last years practices of the Papists, and the dangers thereby threatning
both the Queen and State, occasioned her to call a Parliament on the
12th. of <hi>January,</hi> in which first passed an Act, <hi>For assurance of the Queens Royal
power over all Estates and Subjects within her Dominions.</hi> In the body whereof
it was provided, <q>That no man living or residing in the Queens Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
under the pains and penalties therein appointed, should from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth,
either by word or writing, or any other open deed, willingly and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly
endeavour to maintain the Power and Jurisdiction of the Bishop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> heretofore claimed and usurped within this Realm.</q> And for the
better discovery of all such persons as might be popishly affected, it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted,
<q>That none should be admitted unto holy Orders, or to any Degree
in either of the Universities, or to be Barrester or Bencher in any of the
Inns of Court, &amp;c. or to practise as an Atturney, or otherwise to bear any
Office in any of the Courts at <hi>Westminster</hi> Hall, or any other Court what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
till he or they should first take the Oath of Supremacy on the holy
Evangelists; With a Power given to every Archbishop and Bishop within
this Realm and the Dominions of the same, to tender or minister the Oath
aforesaid, to all and every spiritual person in their proper Diocesses, as well
in places exempt as else-where.</q> Of which last clause the Reader is to take
especial notice, because of the great controversie which ensued upon it, of
which, more hereafter. And because many of the Popish party had lately bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
themselves by Conjurations, and other Diabolical Arts, to enquire into
the length or shortness of her Majesties life, and thereupon had caused some
dark and doubtful prophecies to be spread abroad; There passed two other
Statutes for suppressing the like dangerous practices, by which her Majesties
person might be endangered, the people stirred to rebellion, or the peace
otherwise disturbed. For which consult the Acts of Parliament, 5 <hi>Eliz. c</hi> 15, 16.

                     <p>In reference to Religion, and the advancement of the service and worship

made by those of <hi>Rome,</hi> when they were charged with the administration of
the Service and Sacraments in an unknown Toung, it was enacted, <q>That the

That one Book of either sort being so translated and imprinted, should be

Parish Churches &amp; Chapels of Ease where the said Toung is commonly used;
the Ministers to pay one half of the price, and the Parishioners the other.</q>

                        </gap>use of Convocation, to repair unto them; By whom it was signified unto
their Lordships, that some of the Clergy had prepared certain Bills, containing
a specification of such matters as were conceived to be amiss in the state of the
Church, and that the Articles of Religion agreed upon in the Reign of King
<hi>Edward</hi> the 6th. had been delivered unto others to be considered of, corrected,
and accommodated as they found it necessary. Being encouraged in the last,
and furthered by the diligence of some of the Bishops who were employed in
the same work, the Articles were agreed upon, publickly read before the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
in the Chapter-house of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> on the 29th. of the same month, and
by all of them subscribed with great unanimity. The Prelates had observed
some deviation from the Doctrine of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Reign, which had been
made by the <hi>Calvini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>n</hi> on <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Gospellers, in the Articles of <hi>Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Grace, Free-will,</hi> and <hi>final perseverance:</hi> Nor could they but take notice
with how little reverence the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred,
and the Authority of the Church despised by too many of the same par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
also; which they were willing to impute to the want of some known rule
amongst them, by which they were to regulate their judgments, and conform
their actions: To which end it was thought expedient, that the Book of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:66032:220"/>
agreed upon in Convocation, <hi>Anno</hi> 1552. should be revised and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated
to the use of the Church, the Queens leave being first obtained for
their warrant in it. In the managing of which great business, I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I should more admire their moderation, or their wisdome. Their wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
eminent, in not suffering any Outlandish Divine who might drive on
a different interess from that of the Church, either to vote amongst them, or
carry any stroke in their consultations. Their moderation no less visible, in
declining all unnecessary determinations, which rather tended to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
of controversies, and ingendring strifes, than either unto edification
or increase of piety. So that they seemed to have proceeded by those very
Rules which King <hi>James</hi> so much approved of in the conference at <hi>Hampton</hi>
Court, First in not separating further from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in points of
Discipline or Doctrine, than that Church had separated from what she was
in her purest times; Secondly, in not stuffing the Book of Articles with all
Conclusions Theological, in which a latitude of judgement was to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as far as it might be consistent with peace and charity; and Thirdly, in not
thrusting into it every opinion or <hi>Position negative,</hi> which might have made it
somewhat like Mr. <hi>Craiges</hi> Confession in the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who with his I
<hi>renounce, and I abhor, his detestations and abrenunciations,</hi> did so amaze the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
people (as the King observeth) that not being able to conceive or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
all those points, utterly gave over all, and fell back to Popery, or
else remained in their former ignorance. Upon which grounds, as they omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
many whole Articles, and qualified the expressions of some others in King
<hi>Edward</hi>'s book; so were they generally very sparing in defining any thing which
was meerly matter of moduli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y, or <hi>de modo</hi> only: As namely, touching the
manner of Christs presence in the Holy Eucharist, the manner of effecting
grace by the blessed Sacraments, or of the operation of Gods grace in a mans
conversion. Which rules being carefully observed by all the Bishops, on
whose authority and consent, the greatest part of the whole Work did seem
to rest, and all particulars agreed upon amongst themselves, it was no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if they passed their Votes without contradiction.</p>
                     <p>But in taking the subscriptions of the lower house, there appeared more
difficulty. For though they all testified their consent unto them, on the said
29th. of <hi>January,</hi> either by words express, or by saying nothing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
which came all to o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e; yet when subscription was required, many of
the <hi>Calvinians,</hi> or <hi>Zuinglian</hi>-Gospellers, possibly some also which enclined
rather to their old Religion, and who found themselves unsatisfied in some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
had demurred upon it. With this demur their Lordships are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
by the Prolocutor, on the 5th. of <hi>February.</hi> By whom their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
were desired in the name of that House, that such who had not hitherto
subscribed the Articles, might be ordered to subscribe in their own proper
house, or in the presence of their Lordships. Which request being easily
granted, drew on the subscription of some others, but so, that many still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in their first unwillingness. An Order thereupon is made by their
Lordships, on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oth. then following, that the Prolocutor should return the
names of all such persons who refused subscription, to the end that such fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
course might be taken with them, as to their Lordships should seem most
fit. After which we hear no news of the like complaints and informations;
which makes it probable (if not concluded) that they all subscribed. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus subscribed by all, they were soon after published both in <hi>English</hi> and
<hi>Latine,</hi> with this following Title, that is to say, <hi>Articles agreed upon by the
Archbishops and Bishops of both Provinces, and the whole Clergy, in the Convocation
holden at</hi> London <hi>in the year 1562. for the avoiding of diversities of opinions, and
establishing consent touching true Religion.</hi> But what they were, and wherein
they agreed or differed with or from those established by King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th.
shall be referred (for the avoiding of all interruptions in the course of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story)
to a place more proper. Nothing else brought to a conclusion by them,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:66032:221"/>
but the Bill of Subsidy, which having past that House, was confirmed in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Nothing else brought into conclusion, though many things were had in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation.
On <hi>Friday</hi> the 5th. of <hi>February,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>Salisbury, Exon,</hi> St
<hi>David</hi>'s and <hi>Lichfield,</hi> were appointed by the rest of the Prelates, to examine
a Catechism which it seems was presented to them. But being by them remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the consideration of the lower house, they were advertised by <hi>Day</hi> and
<hi>Sampson</hi> on the 3d. of <hi>March,</hi> that the said house unanimously had approved
thereof. And there it rested for that time, and for ever after, nothing being
done in confirmation of it, as a publick Doctrine, (by whomsoever it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten)
nor any further speech made of it in the time succeeding. Which fortune
also hapned to a Book of <hi>Discipline</hi> projected amongst some of the Clergy, and
render'd to the Bishops by the Prolocutor, and ten others of that House, on the
26th. of <hi>February.</hi> To which some additionals being made by the first contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
it was a second time tender'd to them by the Prolocutor, in the name
of the lower House of Convocation, by whom it had been generally and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously
recommended to them. But the Bishops let this sleep also as they
did the other. More was it to the profit of the Clergy generally, to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
into certain Articles, which by the Archbishop, with the consent of all
the rest of the Prelates, were delivered in writing. The Tenour of which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
was, <q>1. Whether if the Writ of <hi>Melius inquirendum</hi> be sent forth,
there be any likelyhood that it will return to the Queens profit? 2. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
some Benefices ratably be not less than they be already valued?
3. That they enquire of the manner of dilapidations, and other spoliations
that they can remember to have passed upon their Livings, and by whom.
4. To signifie how they have been used for the levying of the arrerages of
tenths and Subsidies, and for how many years past. 5. As also how many
Benefices they find that are charged with pensions newly imposed to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the pensions of Religious persons. 6. And lastly, to certifie how
many Benefices are vacant in every Diocess.</q> But what return was made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these enquiries, I find as little in the Acts of this Convocation, as either in
allowance of the <hi>Catechism,</hi> or the Book of <hi>Discipline.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Religion and the State being thus fortified and secured in <hi>England,</hi> it will not
be amiss to see what they do in <hi>Scotland;</hi> where the young Queen was graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
enclined to forget all injuries, and grant more liberty to her subjects, in
the free exercising and enjoying of their own perswasions, than she could
gain unto her self. For in a Parliament held in <hi>May,</hi> within few months after
the end of that in <hi>England,</hi> the Act for oblivion, formerly condescended to in
the Treaty at <hi>Edenborough,</hi> was confirmed and ratified; but without reference
to that Treaty, the results whereof, the Queen by no means would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
to be good and valid. And thereupon it was advised that the Lords
should supplicate on their knees in the House of Parliament for the passing of
it, which was accordingly performed by them, and vouchsafed by her. There
also past some other Acts of great advantage to the Church, as affairs then stood;
that is to say, one Act for the repairing and upholding of Parish Churches, and
the Church-yards of the same, for burial of the dead. Another against letting
Parsonages, Glebes, or Houses, into long Leases or Fee. But this came some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of the latest, a great part of the Tythes, Houses, and possessions which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to the Church, having been formerly aliened or demised for a very
long term by the Popish Clergy, when they perceived they were not likely to
enjoy them longer for themselves. But on the other side, no safety or prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
could be found for her own Religion; no, not so much as in the Chapel-Royal,
or the Regal City. In contempt whereof, a force was violently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in the month of <hi>August,</hi> in the Chapel of the Palace of <hi>Holy Rood
House,</hi> (the <hi>Whitehall</hi> of <hi>Edenborough</hi>) where certain of the Queens servants

to the Admiral <hi>Chastilion</hi> to the use of the Princes, <hi>March</hi> the 2d. After
which followed the surrendry of <hi>Bayeulx, Faleise,</hi> St. <hi>Lods,</hi> and divers other
Towns and Castles. The Town of <hi>Hareflew</hi> on the <hi>Seine</hi> gallantly taken by
the help of the <hi>English</hi> of <hi>Newhaven,</hi> on the 10th. and garrison'd by such soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers

amazed the heads of the <hi>Guisian</hi> faction, that they agreed unto an Edict of paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
by which the <hi>French</hi> Princes were restored to the Kings favor, the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots</hi>
to the free exercise of their own Religion, and all things setled for the
present to their full contentment. But they must buy this happiness by betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>English</hi> whom they had brought into the Country, and join their forces
with the rest, to drive them out of <hi>Newhaven,</hi> if they would not yield it on
demand. Of this the Queen had secret notice, and offereth by <hi>Throgmorton,</hi> to
deliver up <hi>Newhaven</hi> in exchange for <hi>Callis.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> resolve to hold the
one, and recover the other; so that new forces are sent over to make good the
Town. The <hi>French</hi> draw toward it in great numbers, under the conduct of

Constable himself, with many other <hi>French</hi> Lords of the highest quality. The

a fiercer enemy within the Town, than any whom they found without. The

                        </gap>ilence had got in amongst them, and raged so terribly for the time, that the
living were scarce able to bury the dead. And to compleat the miseries of the
besieged, the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Montpensier,</hi> shewed themselves
openly amongst the rest in the Camp of the enemies, that the last act of the
Tragedy might be plaid in their presence. All things conspiring thus against
them, the <hi>English</hi> are necessitated to a capitulation, by which they left the
Town behind them on the 29th. of <hi>July,</hi> but carried the plague with them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>England.</hi> Which might by some be looked on as an argument of Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
on this Nation, for giving aid unto the Rebels of a Christian Prince,
though masked with the vizard of Religion.</p>
                     <p>Passe we on further toward <hi>Trent,</hi> where we find the Fathers in high
displeasure against Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> exasperated by her aiding the <hi>French
Hugonots</hi> against their King. But more for passing the Statute above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
for punishing all those which countenanced and maintained the Popes
authority within her dominions. The Pope hereby so much incensed, that he
dispatched a Commission to the Fathers of <hi>Trent,</hi> to proceed to an excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
of the Queen of <hi>England.</hi> The Emperour had his aims upon her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at that time solicitous for effecting a mariage betwixt her and <hi>Charles</hi> of
<hi>Inspruch,</hi> his second son; of which his Ministers entertained him with no
doubtful hopes. In contemplation of which mariage, on the first notice which
was given him of this secret purpose, he writ Letters both to the Pope and to
the Legates, in which he signified unto them, that if the Council would not
yield that fruit which was desired, that they might see an union of all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
to reform the Church; at least they should not give occasion to the
Hereticks to unite themselves more, which certainly they would do, in case
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:66032:222"/>
they proceeded so against the Queen of <hi>England;</hi> by means whereof they
would undoubtedly make a league against the Catholicks, which must needs
bring forth many great inconveniences. Nor did this Admonition coming
from a person of so great authority, and built on such prudential reasons, want
its good effect: Insomuch that both the Pope desisted at <hi>Rome,</hi> and revoked
the Commission sent before to the Legates in <hi>Trent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Ministers of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would not so give over, the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Otranto</hi> in the Realm of <hi>Naples,</hi> keeping the game on foot when the
rest had left it. And because he thought the proposition would not take, if it
were made only in relation to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> he proposed a general
ana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>atizing of the Hereticks, as well dead as living, <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius,</hi>
and the rest; which he affirmed to be the practice of all Councils, in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
times, and that otherwise it might be said that the Council had labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
all this while in vain. To which it was replyed by one of the Legates, that
dive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s times required different Counsels; that the differences about religion in
those elder times, were between the Bishops and the Priests; that the people
were but as an <hi>accessory;</hi> that the <hi>Grandees</hi> either did not meddle, or if they
did adhere to any Heresie, they did not make themselves Heads and Leaders.
But now all was quite contrary, for now the Hereticks Ministers and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
could not be said to be heads of the Sects, but the Princes rather, to
whose interess their Ministers and Preachers did accommodate themselves;
that he that would name the true Heads of Hereticks, must name the Queens
of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Navarr,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the Elector Palatine of the <hi>Reine,</hi>
the Elector of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> and many other Dukes and Princes of <hi>Germany;</hi> that
this would make them unite, and shew they were sensible of it; and that the
condemnation of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> only, would so provoke them, that
some great confusion would certainly arise; and therefore they must not do
what they would, but what they could, seeing that the more moderate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
was the better. After which grave and prudent Answer, it was not
long before the conclusion of the Council (which ended on the 3d. of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>)
had put an end to all those practices or designs, which otherwise might have
much distracted the peace of Christendom, and more particularly the tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Realm of <hi>England.</hi> And so I take my leave of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>
without making any other character or censure of it, than that which is given
by the <hi>Historian,</hi> that is to say, <q>That being desired and procured by godly men
to reunite the Church which then began to be divided, it so established the
schism, and made the party so obstinate, that the discords are become irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable;
that being managed by Princes for the Reformation of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Discipline, it caused the greatest deformation that ever was since
Christianity began; that being hoped for by the Bishops to regain the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
authority, usurped for the most part by the Pope, it made them lose
it altogether, and brought them into a greater servitude; and on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that being feared and avoided by the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

following was kept at <hi>Hartford,</hi> the houses in <hi>London</hi> being not well cleansed,
nor the air sufficiently corrected for so great a concourse. Under pretence
whereof, the Council of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> residing in <hi>Brussels,</hi> commanded Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
to be made in <hi>Antwerp</hi> and other places, that no English ship with
cloths, should come into any parts of the Low Countries. Besides which, they
alleged some other causes, as namely, the raising of Impost upon goods, as well
inwards as outwards, as well upon English men as upon strangers, &amp;c. But the
true reason of it was, because a Statute had been passed in the first year of the
Queen, by which divers Wares and Commodities were forbidden to be
brought into this Realm out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and other places, (being the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
of those Countries) to the end that our own people might be set on
work; as also that no English or stranger might ship out any white cloths
undrest, being of price above 4 l. without special licence. But at the earnest
sute of the Merchant Adventurers, the Queen prohibited the transporting of
Wool unwrought, and the Cloth-Fleet was sent to <hi>Embden,</hi> the principal
City in East <hi>Fruzland,</hi> about Easter following, where it was joyfully received,
and where the English kept their Factory for some years after. And though the
<hi>Hanse Towns</hi> made such friends in the Court of the Emperour, that the English
trade was interdicted under the pretence of being a Monopoly, yet by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
of the Queen, the courage of the Merchants, and the dexterity of their
Agents, they prevailed at last, and caried on the trade themselves, without any
Competitours.</p>
                     <p>The apprehension of this dealing from the Council of <hi>Spain,</hi> induced the
Queen to hearken the more willingly to a peace with <hi>France.</hi> Which she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
upon terms of as good advantage as the times would bear, the demand
for <hi>Calais</hi> being waved till the eight years end, at which it was to be restored
unto her by the Treaty of <hi>Cambray.</hi> Which peace was first Proclaimed before
her Majesty in the Castle of <hi>Windsor,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador being present; and
afterwards at <hi>London</hi> on the 13th. of <hi>April.</hi> And for creating the greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
and amity between both Princes, it was not long before she sent the
Lord <hi>Henry Huns<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

and Gentlemen, to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> to present that King with the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and Habit of the Garter, into which Noble Order he had been elected at a
General Chapter. <hi>Garter</hi> the King at Arms was also sent along with them to
invest him in it, with all the Ceremonies and Solemnities thereunto belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
to make it the more acceptable in the sight of that people. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
these courses on the one side, and the indignities put upon her
by the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Princes on the other, Reason of State prevailed with her not
to lay aside the care of their safety and affairs. For wel she knew, that if the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots</hi>
were not incouraged under hand, and the <hi>Guisian</hi> faction kept in breath
by their frequent stirrings, they would be either hammering some design a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
her in her own Dominions, or animate the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> to stand to
her Title and pretensions for the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> Upon which general
ground of self-preservation, as she first aided those of <hi>Scotland</hi> for the expelling
of the <hi>French,</hi> and the French Protestants from being ruined and oppressed by
the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> so on the same, she afterwards undertook the Patronage
of the <hi>Belgick Neatherlands,</hi> against the tyranny and ambition of the Duke of
<hi>Alva,</hi> who otherwise might have brought the war to her own dores, and hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the peace and safety of her whole Estate.</p>
                     <p>Having secured her self by this peace with <hi>France,</hi> and being at no open
enmity with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> she resolves to give her self some pleasure,
and thereupon prepareth for her Summers progress. In the course whereof
she bestowed a visit upon <hi>Cambridge</hi> on the 5th. of <hi>August,</hi> where she was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably
received by Mr. Secretary <hi>Cecil,</hi> being then Chancellor of that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity;
together with all the Heads of Houses, and other Students attired in
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:66032:223"/>
their Academical Habits,<note place="margin">An. Reg. Eliz. 6. 1564.</note> according to their several and distinct degrees. Her
lodging was provided in <hi>Kings College,</hi> the dayes of her abode there, spent in
Scholastical exercises of Philosophy, Physick, and Divinity; the nights in
Comedies and Tragedies, and other pleasing entertainments. On <hi>Wednesday</hi>
the 7th. of the same month, she rode through the Town, and took a view of
all the Colleges and Halls; the goodly Monuments of the piety of her prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
and of so many men and women famous in their generations. Which
done, she took her leave of <hi>Cambridge</hi> in a Latine Oration, in which she gave
them great encouragement to persue their studies, not without giving them
somes hopes, that if God spared her life and opportunity, she would erect some
Monument amongst them of her love to Learning, which should not be infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
unto any of her Royal Ancestors. In which diversion she received such
high contentment, that nothing could have seemed to be equal to it but the
like at <hi>Oxon,</hi> where she was entertained about two years after for seven days
together, with the same variety of Speeches, Ente<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ludes, Disputations, and
other Academical expressions of a publick joy. In one point, that of <hi>Oxford</hi>
seemed to have the preheminence, all things being there both given and taken
with so even an hand, that there could be no ground for any emulation, strife,
or discord to ensue upon it. But in the midst of those contentments which she
had at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> were sown the seeds of those divisions and combustions, with
which the Church hath been continually distracted to this very day: For so it
hapned, that Mr. <hi>Thomas Preston</hi> of <hi>Kings College,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thomas Cartwright</hi>
of <hi>Trinity College,</hi> were appointed for two of the Opponents in a Disputation;
In which the first, by reason of his comely gesture, pleasing pronunciation,
and graceful personage, was both liked and rewarded by her, the other receiving
neither reward or commendation; Which so incensed the proud man, too much
opinionated of himself and his own abilities, that he retired unto <hi>Geneva,</hi>
where having throughly informed himself in all particulars, both of Doctrine
and Discipline, wherein the Churches of that platform differed from the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> he returned home with an intent to repair his credit, or
rather to get himself a name, (as did <hi>Erastrotus</hi> in the burning of <hi>Diana</hi>'s Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
by raising such a fire, such combustions in her, as never were to be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
(like the fire of <hi>Taberah</hi>) but by the immediate hand of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Genevians</hi> had already began to blow the coals, and brought fewel to
them, but it was onely for the burning of Caps and Rochets. The Common-Prayer
book was so fortified by Act of Parliament, that there was no assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it without greater danger than they durst draw upon themselves. And
as for the Episcopal Government, it was so interwoven and incorporated
with the Laws of the land, so twisted in with the Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ogative of the Crown
and the Regal Interess, that they must first be in a capacity of trampling on
the Laws and the Crown together, before they could attempt the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it. But Caps and Typpets, Rochets and Lawn sleeves, and Canonical
Coats, seemed to be built upon no better foundation than superstitious cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
some old Popish Canon, or at the best some temporary Injunction of
the Queens devising, which could not have the power and effect of Law. This
<hi>Game</hi> they had in <hi>chase</hi> in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time, which now they are resolved
to follow both with <hi>horn</hi> and <hi>hound,</hi> and <hi>hunt</hi> it to the very last: But as good
<hi>Huntsmen</hi> as they were, they came off with loss, they that sped best in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
torn by the <hi>briers</hi> and <hi>bushes,</hi> through which the fury of their passion car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
them in pursute of the sport: Amongst which, none sped worse than <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
because none had so much to lose in the prosecution; for resting obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in refusing to wear that habit which of right belonged unto his place, he
was deprived of that place by the High Commissioners, to which the habit did
belong. So eminent a Preferment as the Deanry of <hi>Christ-church</hi> deserved a
man of a better temper, and of a more exemplary conformity to the rules of
the Church; Both which were found in Dr. <hi>Thomas Godwin,</hi> Chaplain in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
to the Queen, advanced unto this Deanry first, and after to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:66032:223"/>
of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells;</hi> more fortunate in being father to Dr. <hi>Francis God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
a late Bishop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> never to be forgotten for his Commentaries of
the English Bishops, digested with such infinite pains, and no less in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity.</p>
                     <p>The obstinacy of these men in matter of Ceremony, prompted the Bishops
to make trial of their Orthodoxie in points of Doctrine. The Articles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
lately agreed upon in Convocation, had been subscribed by all the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
who had voted to them, subscribed not onely for themselves, but in the
name of all those in the several Diocesses and Cathedral Churches, whom
they represented. But the Bishops not thinking that sufficient to secure the
Church, required subscription of the rest in their several places, threatning no
less than deprivation to such as wilfully refused, and obstinately persisted in
that refusal. Many there were who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> bogled at it, as they all did, but did it not
so perversely, nor in such great numbers as when their faction was grown
strong and improved to multitudes. Some stumbled at it in regard of the first
clause added to the 20th Article, about the Authority of the Church, others
in reference to the 36th. touching the Consecration of Archbishops and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops;
some thought they attributed more authority to the Supream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
over all persons and causes both Ecclesiastical and Civil, than could
consist with that Autocratie and Independency which <hi>Calvin</hi> arrogated unto
his Presbyteries and other Churches of that platform: And others looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Homil es</hi> as beggarly rudiments, scarce milk for Babes, but by no
means to be served in for a stronger stomach. In general, thought by the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevians</hi>
and <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Gospellers to have too much in them of the Pope, or
too little of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and therefore not to be subscribed by any who desired
the reputation of keeping a good conscience with faith unfeigned. Of which
number none so much remarkable as <hi>father John Fox</hi> the Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

before appeared in the Schism at <hi>Franckfort,</hi> and left that Church (when <hi>Cox</hi>
had got the better in it) to retire to <hi>Geneva;</hi> being now called on to subscribe,
that the opinion which was had of his parts and piety might advance the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
he is said to have appeared before the Bishop (but whether before the
Archbishop or his own Diocesan is not much material) with the New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                        <q>To this (said he) I will subscribe, and it this will not serve,

Church of <hi>England,</hi> and much good may it do you.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This refractory answer (for it was no better) might well have moved the
Bishop to proceed against him, as he did against some others who had stood on
the same refusal; but kissing goes by kindness, as the saying is, and so much
kindness was shewed to him, that he both kept his resolution and his place
together; which whether it might not do more hurt to the Church, than that
preferment in the Church did advantage him, I think no wise man will make
a question; for commonly the exemption or indemnity of some few particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
confirms the obstinacy of the rest, in hope of being privileged with the
like indemnity. And therefore it was well observed by Bishop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> when
King <hi>James</hi> proposed the writing of a Letter to the Bishop of <hi>Chester,</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiting
some Ministers of his Diocess from a present conformity, That if this
purpose should proceed, the copy of those Letters would fly over the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and then others would make the same request for some friends of theirs,
and so no fruit would follow of the present <hi>Conference,</hi> but that all things
would be worse than before they were. But Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was not drawn
so easily to the like indulgencies, for which she received her own just praises
from the Pen of an Adversary, <hi>Harding</hi> by name, in his Epistle Dedicatory
prefixed before his Answer to the Bishops <hi>Apology,</hi> commends <hi>her earnest zeal
and travail, in bringing those disordered Ministers into some order of decent appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
which yet some of them wanted reason to apply themselves to.</hi> And <hi>Sanders</hi>
(who seldom speaks well of her) first informs his Reader, <q>What bickerings
there were in <hi>England</hi> about the Rochet, and other Vestments of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy;
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:66032:224"/>
that many of the opposite party regarded not the Queens judgment in
it, but sent for counsel and advice to <hi>Germany, France, Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
but specially to <hi>Theodore Beza</hi> and <hi>Peter Martyr;</hi> but finally that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the advice of the one, and the addresses of the other, the Queen
proceeded vigorously to the deprivation of all such persons as wilfully op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
her order made in that behalf.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It seems by this that our <hi>Genevians,</hi> for the greater countenancing of their
inconformity, had stirred up the most eminent Divines of the <hi>Gallick</hi> and
<hi>Helvetian</hi> Churches to declare in favour of their doings; And it appears also,
by remembrances in some Authors, that <hi>Calvin</hi> apprehending some neglect
from Mr. Secretary <hi>Cecil,</hi> in making either no return, or a return which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
nothing, to his first addresses, had laid aside his care of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> for which he could expect no thanks from the Bishops, or had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so little from the grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> men of the Court. But <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> while he lived,
conceived himself to have some interess in this Church, in which he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
such a good preferment, but more in some particular persons and
members of it, who seemed to depend upon his judgment, and to ask counsel
of him as their surest Oracle: In which, how much he countenanced that
faction in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time, both by his practice and his pen, and what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
he gave them in this present Reign, hath been shewn before;
how much out-gone by <hi>Theodore Beza,</hi> who next usurped a super-intendency
over all the Churches of this Island, may be seen hereafter: All that shall now
be said of either of them, or of all together, shall be briefly this, that this poor
Church might better have counted their best helps in points of Doctrine, than
have been troubled with their intermedlings in matter of Discipline. More
modestly then so dealt <hi>Bullinger</hi> and <hi>Gualter,</hi> two Divines of <hi>Suitzerland,</hi> as
eminent in all points of learning as the best amongst them; who being solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
by some some zealous brethren to signifie their judgment in the present
controversie, about the Aparel of the Clergy, return an approbation of it,
but send the same inclosed in several Letters to <hi>Sandys, Horn,</hi> and <hi>Gryndal,</hi>
that they might see that neither of them would engage in the affairs of this
Church, without the privity of the Governors and Rulers of it.</p>
                     <p>To bring this quarel to an end, or otherwise to render all opponents the
more inexcusable, the Queen thought fit to make a further signification of
her Royall pleasure, not grounded onely on the Soveraign Power and Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
Royal, by which she published her <hi>Injunctions</hi> in the first year of her
Reign, but legally declared by her Commissioners for causes Ecclesiastical, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Acts and Statutes made in that behalf; for then it was to be
presumed, that such as had denyed obedience to her sole commands, would
at least give it to the Laws. The Archbishop is thereupon required to consult
together with such Bishops and Commissioners as were next at hand, upon the
making of such Rules and Orders as they thought necessary for the peace of the
Church, with reference to the present condition and estate thereof: Which
being accordingly performed, presented to the Queen, and by her approved,
the said Rules and Orders were set forth and published in a certain book, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled,
<hi>Advertisements, partly for due order in the publick Administration of the
Common-Prayers, and using the holy Sacraments; and partly for the Apparel of all
persons Ecclesiastical, by vertue of the Queens Majesties Letters commanding the
same, the</hi> 15th. <hi>day of</hi> January, &amp;c. And that they might be known to have
the stamp of Royal Authority, a Preface was prefixed before them, in which
it was expressed, <q>That the Queen had called to her remembrance how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
it was for the advancement of God's glory, &amp;c. for all her loving
subjects of the state Ecclesiastical, not onely to be knit together in the
bonds of Uniformity touching the ministration of Gods Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but also to be of one decent behaviour of outward aparel, that by
their distinct habits they might be known to be of that holy vocation,

Letters, that upon conference had with such other Bishops as were autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rised
by her Commission for causes Ecclesiastical, some order might be took,
whereby all diversities and varieties in the premises might be taken away;
And finally, that in obedience unto her commands, the said Metropolitan
and the rest there named had agreed upon the Rules and Orders ensuing,
which were by her thought meet to be used and followed.</q>

                     <p>To return therefore where we left, the next considerable action which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
on the Queens reception at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> but more considerable in the
consequents than in the act it self, was the preferring of Sir <hi>Robert Dudley,</hi> the
second son then living to the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> to the Titles of Lord
<hi>Denbigh</hi> and Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> which honour she conferred on him on <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas</hi>
day, with all the Pomps and ceremonies thereunto accustomed; She
had before elected him into the Order of the Garter, made him the Master of
her Horse, and Chancellor of the University of <hi>Oxon,</hi> suffered him to carry a
great sway in all affairs both of Court and Council, and given unto him the
fair Mannor of <hi>Denbigh,</hi> being conceived to be one of the goodliest Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in <hi>England,</hi> as having more Gentlemen of quality which owes sure and
service thereunto, than any other whatsoever in the hands of a subject: And
now she adds unto these honors the goodly Castle and Mannor of <hi>Kenelworth,</hi>
part of the patrimony and possession of the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaster.</hi> Advanced
unto which heighth, he ingrossed unto himself the disposings of all Offices in
Court and State, and of all preferments in the Church, proving in fine so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeasable

in any other than himself) might either be connived at, or not complained of,
he cloaks them with a seeming zeal to the true Religion, and made himself the

was the death of <hi>Calvin,</hi> by whose authority so much disorder and confusion
was to be brought upon it in the times succeeding; a name much reverenced,
not onely by those of his own party and perswasions, but by many grave and
moderate men, who did not look at first into the dangers which ensued upon
it. His platform at <hi>Geneva</hi> made the onely pattern, by which all reformed
Churches were to frame their Government; his Writings made the onely
rule, by which all Students in Divinity were to square their Judgments. What
<hi>Peter Lombart</hi> was esteemed to be in the Schools of <hi>Rome,</hi> the same was <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
reckoned in all those Churches, which were reformed according to the

as the saying was, he was not so esteemed in <hi>England,</hi> nor was there any
reason why it should be so; for though some zealous brethren of the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi>

whereof redounded more to her own security, than to the profit and advantage
of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> was young, poffessed of that
Kingdom, and next Heir to this; first married to the Daulphin of <hi>France,</hi> and
sued to after his decease in behalf of <hi>Charls,</hi> the younger son of the Emperor
<hi>Maximilian,</hi> as also of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria;</hi> But
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had found so much trouble and danger from her first alliance
with the <hi>French,</hi> that she was against all Marriages which might breed the
like, or any way advance the power of that Competitor: But on the contrary,
she commended to her the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> whom she pretended to have
raised to those eminent honors, to make him in some fort capable of a Queens
affection. Which proposition proved agreeable to neither party, the Queen of
<hi>Scots</hi> disdaining that unequal offer, and <hi>Leicester</hi> dealing underhand with
<hi>Randolph</hi> the English Resident, to keep her still in that averseness. He had
foolishly given himself some hopes of marrying with <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his own dread
Mistress, interpreting all her favours to him to proceed from affection, and
was not willing that any Proposition for that purpose with the Queen of
<hi>Scots</hi> should be entertained. During these various thoughts on both sides, the
English began to be divided in opinion concerning the next heir to the Crown
Imperial of this Realm; One <hi>Hales</hi> had writ a discourse in favour of the House
of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> but more particularly in defence of the late marriage between the
Earl of <hi>Hertford</hi> and the Lady <hi>Katherine,</hi> for which he was apprehended and
committed prisoner. The Romish party were at the same time sub-divided,
some standing for the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> as the next heir apparent, though an
alien born; others for <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Darnlie,</hi> eldest son to the Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi> born
in the Realm, and lineally descended from the eldest daughter of King <hi>Henry</hi>
the 7th. from whom the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> also did derive her claim.</p>
                     <p>The Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> also at the same time, grown jealous of the practices of
the Lord <hi>James</hi> her bastard-brother, whom she had not long before made
Earl of <hi>Murrey;</hi> and being over-powered by those of the Congregation, was
at some loss within her self for finding a fit person, upon whose integrity she
might depend in point of counsel, and on whose power she might rely in point
of safety: After a long deliberation, nothing seemed more conducible to her
ends and purposes than the recalling of <hi>Matthew</hi> Earl of <hi>Lenox</hi> to his native
Country, from whence he had been forced by the <hi>Hamiltonians</hi> in the time of
King <hi>Henry.</hi> Being of great power in the West of <hi>Scotland,</hi> from the Kings
whereof he was extracted, <hi>Henry</hi> conceived that some good use might be
made of him for advancing the so much desired marriage between his onely
son Prince <hi>Edward</hi> and the Infant-Queen: The more to gain him to his side,
he bestowes upon him in marriage the Lady <hi>Margaret Dowglas,</hi> daughter of
Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> his eldest sister, by <hi>Archibald Dowglas</hi> Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> her se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

more anone) and <hi>Charls</hi> the second son (whom King <hi>James</hi> created Earl of
<hi>Lenox</hi>) father of <hi>Arabella,</hi> before remembred. And that they might support
themselves in the nobler equipage, he bestowes upon him also the Mannor of

the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which made him the more estimable both with his own
Queen, and the English Papists. Being returned into his Country, he found
that Queen so gracious to him, and such a handsome correspondence with the
chief Nobility, that he sends for his two sons to come thither to him, but
leaves his wife behind in the Court of <hi>England,</hi> lest otherwise Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
might take some umbrage or displeasure at it, if they should all remove at
once.</p>
                     <p>It was about the middle of <hi>February</hi> that the Lord <hi>Darnly</hi> came to the Court
of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1564/5;.</note> Who being not full twenty years old, of lovely person, sweet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
and a most ingenuous disposition, exceedingly prevailed in short
time on the Queens affection. She had now met with such a man as might
please her fancy, and more secure her title to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> than
any of the great Kings in <hi>Europe.</hi> What then should hinder her from making
up a mariage so agreeable to her, so acceptable to the Catholick party in both
Kingdoms; and which she thought withall of so safe a condition, as could
create no new jealousies in the brest of <hi>Elizabeth?</hi> But those of the <hi>Leicestrian</hi>
faction conceived otherwise of it, and had drawn most of the Court and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
to conceive so to. For what could more secure the interess of the Queen
of <hi>Scots,</hi> than to corroborate her own Title with that of <hi>Darnly?</hi> from which
two, what children soever should proceed, they would draw to them many
hearts in the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> who now stood fair and faithful to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Queen. In this great fear (but made much greater of set purpose to
create some trouble) it was advised that the Queen should earnestly be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to think of mariage, to the end, that the succession might be setled in her
own posterity; that all Popish Justices (whereof there were many at that
time) might be put out of Commission, and none admitted to that office, but
such as were sincerely affected to the Reformed Religion; that the old depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Bishops, which for the most part lived at liberty, might be brought to a
more close restraint, for fear of hardning some in their errours, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
others with whom they had the freedom of conversation; that a greater
power might be conferred upon the English Bishops, in the free exercise of
their jurisdiction, for suppressing all such Popish Books as were sent into
<hi>England,</hi> depriving the English Fugitives of all those Benefices in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which hitherto they had retained; and all this to be done without incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the danger of a <hi>Premunire,</hi> with which they were so often threatned by the
common Lawyers. It was advised also, that for a counterpoise unto the Title
of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> some countenance should be given to the House of
<hi>Suffolk,</hi> by shewing favour to the Earl of <hi>Hartford</hi> and the Lady <hi>Katherine;</hi>

of the Romish party, who faithfully had adher'd to their natural Queen in
all her former troubles, conceived that some of them might be as capable of
the Queens affections, as a young Gentleman born in <hi>England,</hi> and one that
never had done any service which might enoble and prefer him before all
the rest. The Ministers exclaimed against it in their common preachings, as if
it were designed of purpose to destroy Religion, and bring them under their
old vassalage to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Noble men and others of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,

In <hi>May</hi> she had convented the Estates of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to whom she com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
her intention, with the reasons of it. Which by the greatest part
of the Assembly seemed to be allowed of, none but the Lord <hi>Ochiltrie</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
what the rest approved. About the middle of <hi>July,</hi> the mariage Rites
were celebrated in the Royal Chapel by the Dean of <hi>Restairig,</hi> and the next
day the new Duke was proclaimed King by sound of Trumpet, and declared
to be associated with the Queen in the publick government. The newes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
being brought unto Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> she seemed more offended than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
she was. For well she knew, that both the new King, and the Earl his
Father, were men of plain and open natures, not apt to entertain any dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
counsels to the disturbance of her quiet; that as long as she retained the
Countesse with her (who was the Mother of the one, and the Wife of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
they seemed to stand bound to their good behaviour, and durst act no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> had neither fortified her self in the love of her peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
nor in alliances abroad; and that it could not otherwise be, but some
new troubles must break out in <hi>Scotland</hi> upon this occasion, by which it
would be made uncomfortable and inglorious to her. And so it proved in the
event, for never was mariage more calamitous to the parties themselves, or
more dishonourable to that Nation, or finally more scandalous to both Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions;
in nothing fortunate but in the birth of <hi>James</hi> the 6th. born in the

and the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> being <hi>Sureties</hi> with her at the Font. She called him

and <hi>Fortunatus</hi> in regard that he came so luckily into the world, when his

came hither at that time upon two solemnities; that is to say, to be instal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Knight of the <hi>Garter</hi> in the place and person of that King, and to present
the Order of St <hi>Michael,</hi> (the principal Order of that Kingdom) to <hi>Thomas</hi>

the subjects discharged from their obedience to the Laws, and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Catholick</hi> from an <hi>English Protestant.</hi> And it is possible enough that
they might have stood much longer to their first conformity, if the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
brought into the Church by the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> faction, together with
their many innovations both in Doctrine and Discipline, had not afforded
them some further ground for the desertion. For in this year it was that the
<hi>Zuinglian</hi> or <hi>Calvinian</hi> faction began to be first known by the name of <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi>
if <hi>Genebrard, Gualier,</hi> and <hi>Spondanus</hi> (being all of them right good Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologers)
be not mistaken in the time. Which name hath ever since been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
to them, because of their pretending to a greater <hi>Purity</hi> in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God, than was <hi>held forth</hi> unto them (as they gave it out) in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Prayer Book; and to a greater opposition to the Rites and Usages of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than was agreeable to the constitution of the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> But this <hi>Purity</hi> was accompanied with such irreverence, this opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
drew along with it so much licenciousnesse, as gave great scandal and
offence to all sober men; so that it was high time for those which had the
care of the Church, to look narrowly unto them, to give a check to those disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and confusions, which by their practices and their preachings they had
brought into it, and thereby laid the ground of that woful schism which soon
after followed. And for a check to those disorders, they published the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement

preach, not publickly interpret, but only read that which is appointed by
publick authority, without special Licence of the Bishop under his Seal;

people might hear and understand; that they would keep the Register book
according to the Queens Majesties Injunctions; that they would use sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
in apparel, and especially in the Church at Common Prayers, according
to Order appointed; that they would move the Parishioners to quiet and
concord, and not give them cause of offence, and help to reconcile them
that be at variance, to their utmost power; that they would read dayly at
the least one Chapter of the Old Testament, and another of the New, with
good advisement, to the increase of their knowledge; that they would in
their own persons, use and exercise their Office and Place, to the honour of
God, and the quiet of the Queens subjects within their charge, in truth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord

<hi>Edmond Ploydon,</hi> whose learned Commentaries do sufficiently set forth his
great abilities in that Profession; and one Mr. <hi>Lovelace,</hi> of whom we find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the name.</p>
                     <p>By them and their Advice, the whole pleading chiefly is reduced to these
two heads, (to omit the nicities and punctilioes of lesser moment) the first
whereof was this, That <hi>Bonner</hi> was not at all named in the indictment, by
the stile and title of Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> but only by the name Dr. <hi>Edmond
Bonner,</hi> Clerk, Dr. of the Lawes, whereas at that time he was legally and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and therefore the Writ to be <hi>abated,</hi> (as our Lawyers
phrase it) and the cause to be dismissed our of the Court. But <hi>Ploydon</hi> found
here that <hi>the Case was altered,</hi> and that this Plea could neither be allowed by
<hi>Catiline,</hi> who was then Chief Justice, nor by any other of the Bench, and
therefore it is noted by Chief Justice <hi>Dyer</hi> who reports the Case, with a <hi>Non
allocatur.</hi> The second principle Plea was this, That <hi>Horn</hi> at the time when the
Oath was tender'd, was not Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and therefore not impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the said Statute, to make tender of it by himself or his Chancellor. And
for the proof of this, that he was no Bishop, it was alleged that the form of
Consecration of Archbishops and Bishops, which had been ratified by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the time of King <hi>Edward,</hi> had been repealed in the first year of Queen
<hi>Mary,</hi> and so remained at <hi>Horn</hi>'s pretended consecration. The Cause being
put off from Term to Term, comes at the last to be debated amongst the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
at <hi>Serjeants Inne.</hi> By whom the cause was finally put upon the issue, and
the tryal of that issue Ordered to be committed to a Jury of the County of
<hi>Surry.</hi> But then withall it was advised, that the decision of the Point should
rather be referred to the following Parliament, for fear that such a weighty
matter might miscarry by a contrary Jury, of whose either partiality, insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:66032:228"/>
there had been some proof made before,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>An. Reg. Eliz.</hi> 8. 1566.</note> touching the grants made by
King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Bishops; of which a great many were made under this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
that the Granters were not actually Bishops, nor legally possessed of
their several Sees.</p>
                     <p>According to this sound advice, the business comes under consideration in
the following Parliament, which began on the 30th. of <hi>September,</hi> where all
particulars being fully and considerately discoursed upon, it was first declared,
<q>That their not restoring of that Book to the former power in terms signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant
and express, was but <hi>Casus omissus;</hi> and Secondly, That by the Statute
5th. and 6th. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6th. it had been added to the Book of Common Prayer
and administration of the Sacraments, as a member of it, or at least an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
to it; and therefore by 1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> was restored again, together
with the said Book of Common Prayer, intentionally at the least, if not
in <hi>terminis.</hi> But being the words in the said Statute were not cleer enough
to remove all doubts, they did therefore revive it now; and did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
Enact, that all persons that had been, or should be made, Ordered,
or Consecrate Archbishops, Bishops, Priests, Ministers of Gods Holy
Word and Sacraments, or Deacons after the form and order prescribed in
the said Book, be in very deed, and also by authority hereof, declared and
enacted to be, and shall be, Archbishops, Bishops, Priests, Ministers and
Deacons, rightly made, Consecrate, and Ordered, Any Statute, Law,
Canon, or any thing to the contrary notwithstanding.</q> Nothing else done
in this Parliament which concerned the Church, not any thing at all in the
Convocation, by which it was of course accompanied, more than the granting
of a Subsidy of six shillings in the pound out of all their Benefices and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And as for <hi>Bonner,</hi> who was the other party to the cause in question,
it was determined, that neither he, nor any other person or persons, should
be impeached or molested in regard of any refusal of the said Oath heretofore
made, and hereafter to be made before the end of that Parliament. Which
favour was indulged unto them of the Laity, in hope of gaining them by fair
means to a sence of their duty; to <hi>Bonner</hi> and the rest of the Bishops, as men
that had sufficiently suffered upon that account, by the loss of their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks.</p>
                     <p>By this last Act the Church is strongly setled on her natural pillars of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
Government and Worship, not otherwise to have been shaken, than

own heads, rather than suffer it to stand in so much glory. And here it will be
time to conclude this History, having taken a brief view of the State of the
Church, with all the abberrations from its first constitution as it stood at this
time, when the Puritan faction had began to disturb her Order, and that it
may be done with a greater certainty, I shall speak it in the words of one,
who lived, and writ his knowledge of it at this time, I mean <hi>John Rastel,</hi> in
his answer to the Bishops challenge. Who though he were a Papist, and a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive
Priest, yet I conceive that he hath faithfully delivered to many sad
truths in these particulars. Three books he writ within the compass of three
years now last past against Bishop <hi>Jewel,</hi> in one of which he makes this address
unto him, viz. <hi>And though you Mr.</hi> Jewel <hi>(as I have heard say) do take the
bread into your hands when you celebrate solemnly, yet thousands there are of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Ministers, whose death it is to be bound to any such external fashion, and
your Order of celebrating the Communion is so unadvisedly conceived, that every
man is left unto his private Rule or Canon, whether he will take the bread into
his hands, or let it stand at the end of the table, the Bread and Wine being
laid upon the table, where it pleases the Sexton or Parish-Clerk to set them.

Thus have we seen the Church established on a sure foundation the Doctrine
built upon the Prophers and Apostles, according to the explication of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Fathers; the Government truly Apostolical, and (in all essential parts
thereof) of Divine institution; the Liturgy an extract of the Primitive forms;
the Ceremonies few, but necessary, and such as tended only to the preservation
of decency, and increase of piety. And we have seen the first Essays of the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan</hi>
faction, beginning low at Caps and Surplices, and Episcopal habits; but
aiming at the highest points; the alteration of the Government both in Church
and State, the adulterating of the Doctrine, and the subversion of the Liturgy
and form of worship here by Law established. But the discovery of those dangerous
Doctrines, and those secret Plots, and open practises, by which they did not onely
break down the roofe and walls of this goodly building, but digged up the found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of it, will better fall within the compasse of a Presbyterian, or Acrian Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
for carring on of whose designes since the dayes of <hi>Calvin,</hi> they have most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably
imbroyled all the Estates and Kingdomes of these parts of Christendome;
the Realmes and Churches of Great Brittaine more than all the rest. Let it suffice
me for the present if I have set the Church on its proper bottom, and shewed her to
the world in her Primative lustre, that we may see how strangely she hath been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setled,
how monstruously disfigured by unquiet men, whose interess is as incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
with the rights of Monarchy, as with distinction of apparrell, the Government
of Bishops, all set formes of Prayer, and whatsoever also they contend against. And
therefore heare I will conclude my History of the Reformation, as not being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to look further into those disturbances, the lamentable effects whereof wee
feele to this very day.</p>

                     <p>THe <hi>Lutherans</hi> having published that famous <hi>Confession</hi> of their faith,
which takes name from <hi>Ausb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

consideration of <hi>Charls</hi> the 5th. and the Estates of the Empire there assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1530. In tract of time, all other Protestant and Reformed Churches
followed that example; And this they did, partly to have a constant Rule a|
mongst
themselves, by which all private persons were to frame their judgments,
and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rtly to declare that consent and harmony which was betwixt them and
the rest of those National Churches, which had made an open separation from
the Popes of <hi>Rome.</hi> Upon which grounds, the Prelates of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
having concurred with the godly desires of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, for
framing one uniform Order to be used in God's publick Worship; and publish|
ing
certain pious and profitable Sermons in the English Toung for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the people, found a necessity of holding forth some publick Rule, to
testifie as well their Orthodoxie in some points of Doctrine, as their abhorrency
from the corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the extravagancies of the
Anabaptists and other Sectaries. This gave the first occasion to the Articles of
Religion published in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, <hi>Anno</hi> 1552. as
also of the Review thereof by the Bishops and Clergy assembled in their Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
under Queen <hi>Elizabeth, Anno</hi> 1562. which being compared with one
another will appear most plainly, neither to be altogether the same, nor yet
much different, the later being rather an explication of the former, where the
former seemed to be obscure, or not expressed in such full and significant tearms
as they after were, than differing from them in such points, wherein they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
from the <hi>Romanists</hi> and some modern Hereticks: But what these dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
were, both for weight and number, the Reader may observe by seeing the
<hi>Articles</hi> laid before him in their several Columns (as hereafter followeth)
wherein the variations are presented in a different character, or otherwise mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out by their several figures in the line and margin: Which was first done
with reference to some Annotations intended once upon the same, for shewing
the reason of those Additions, Substractions, and other alterations which were
thought necessary to be made to, and in, King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Book, by the Bishops
and Clergy in their Convocation, <hi>Anno</hi> 1562. But that design being laid
aside, as not so compatible with the nature of our present History, the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
shall be laid down plainly as they are in themselves, leaving the further
consideration of the differences which occur between them to the Reader's care.</p>
