         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Banner of Love; Under which The ROYAL ARMY is Preserved, and Safely Conducted.</head>
            <p>THE Loving Kindness of the Lord God is abundantly made manifest, and with the Cords of it the hearts of many are drawn unto him, and made willing to Love, Serve and Obey Him, and to Deny what is contrary to him, and to Follow his Leadings to come into more Acquaintance with Him; whereby there is a true Tenderness begotten, which doth earnestly Thirst after Him, and there is nothing so Dear as His Love, and for His Love the World is Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp; the Thirst is more and more increased after God, and presses after more Communion with His Love, and in the Breathings the Love opens, and the Streams thereof reach the Thirsty, and with the sweet Savor of it the Thirsty is Refreshed, and it becomes exceeding Pretious, and in it Strength is Renewed, and the Bones are made Fat, and so the breathing Babe is Nourished; and this Fountain is Freely Opened, that all that Thirst may come, and all that Hunger may be partakers of the Love of God, and in the Light of Christ it is obtained: For it is given of God to seek those that are out of the Love, and to bring them into the Love; and as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52591:3"/>
to discover that which Separates from the Love, the mind Turning unto it, the Judgement takes hold, and that which separates from the Love is Denied, and upon the Cross crucified, and the power removes it out of the way, whereby there is Ease given to that which is Oppressed, and the w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y is cleared of that which Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from God, and so the Light Leads out of the Earth and all Earthly things, and Leads up to God the Fountain of Eternal Love, in whose Pure, Presence the fulness of Joy is found: And as the Light is believed in, so is the Translation wrought, and the Power puts off the Old, and makes all New, and a Birth comes to be Born that is of God, and it loves the Father and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to do His Will, and the Father spreads his Love over it for a Banner, by which it is Protected and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in its Growth and Increase; and what it makes War against, the Love is a Banner over it, and the furious Beasts are thereby Stopped, and also driven back, and that which Presses after Communion with God, it goes forward, and the Banner of Love is Spread over it; and this is the great Battel to be Fought, and unto it hath the Lord God gathered a Remnant, and orders them under His Banner, by which they are Encouraged to make War in Righteousness, and in Love to overcome their Enemies, and in Patience to silence the foolish and gainsayers; and of the Immortal Seed is this Royal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Born, and they are Conquerours through Him that loves them, and spreads his Banner over them, and their Weapons are Love and Patience, by which they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome; and they do not think ill to their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, but Love their Enemies, and are Ready to do Good to those that are contrary minded; and they would have all come to the Love of God, that they

might be saved; and what the Father Leads them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, His Love Constrains them to follow, and when they are Persecuted the Love Constrains them to Bless, and in Patience they Endure it, and seek no Revenge upon it, but overcome Evil with Good: and this is the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Army of the Lamb, who are Born again, and redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the World, and their Union is with that which was before the World, therefore are they Persecuted and Evil entreated by the World, who are Separated from the Love, which they are partakers of, and over whom it is spread for a Banner, and they have nothing in their hearts but Love and Good Will to all men: And this is an Army that the Lord God hath gathered, and is gathering, from amongst the Earthly Warriors, whose strength is in the Horse and his Rider, and the Lord God puts into their hands the Spiritual Weapon, and with it they go forth to Battel, and they seek to Save mens Lives and not to Destroy them, their Weapon is Stretched forth to cut down the Proud Lustful Nature, from whence all Warrs arise, and so to bring People to the Meek and quiet Spirit, and to Live Peacebly with all men. And this is not like the Aliens Army, who are strangers unto that Spirit that Leads into Love and Good Will, and to <hi>do Justly, and walk Humbly with God,</hi> it is quite of a contrary Nature; The Aliens Army draw their Swords, and kill one another; the Royal Army have put up their Swords, and would have all men Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and who needs to fear such an Army, whose <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is Love,</hi> And their <hi>Weapons Good Will?</hi> There need no Horsemen and Strong Armies to oppose them, nor Prisons to quiet them, for they are Marching under the <hi>Banner of Love,</hi> and in <hi>Love</hi> Meet their Enemies, and Quench their Fury; and whatever can be done against

is to be kept Faithful, and they stand Watchful, left they should be drawn aside and thereby fall into Danger; for the Enemy is near, and if the Watch be not Kept, he will Tempt, and also Entangle, and so bring the <hi>Hands to be weak, and the Knees to be feeble,</hi> and Draw the Mind to look at the weakness, and then bring up his Army, and place them in the way, and they appearing Mighty in Strength, he then draws into Reasoning which way they must be Overcome, and if that cannot be seen Speedily, then he draws to Consult which way to Escape them; and if he take not there, then he labors to drive Back again, as if it were not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to Overcome such strong Enemies in such a weak and feeble state; but he is a liar; therefore let none en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline unto him, though here he hath wronged many, and hath secretly entised them from under the <hi>Banner of Love,</hi> and hath drawn them out of the Order of Gods <hi>Royal Army;</hi> But the Watchful are preserved in safety, and walk in the strength of <hi>Love,</hi> and believe that <hi>all things are possible,</hi> and <hi>their Faith works by Love,</hi> and in the Faith they go forward, and by Faith in the <hi>Love</hi> they <hi>are made Conquerors</hi>; and these are Free-born Children of the Living God, who are gathered under the <hi>Banner of his Love,</hi> and there <hi>fight against the World, the Flesh and the Devil,</hi> against <hi>Principallities and Powers, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual wickedness in high Places,</hi> and <hi>they stand by Faith,</hi> and <hi>fight the good fight of Faith,</hi> by which <hi>Victory</hi> is <hi>obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and in the <hi>Faith that works by Love, Flames are quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Lyons mouthes are stopped:</hi> And this is the Saints Weapon with which they go forth to Battel, and in which they are made stronger than their Enemies, and they are of the Royal Seed, that God hath blessed, and are true <hi>Followers of the Lamb,</hi> and fight under his <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>

and they must have the Victory; for in the <hi>Love</hi> are all things ended, and as the Lamb appeares and spreads forth His lovely <hi>Banner,</hi> so unto him will the gathering be; and unto His <hi>Royal Army</hi> there shall be a great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, and they shall wax stronger and stronger, and their enemies weaker and weaker; and as the Gathering is unto Him, and His <hi>Banner</hi> known, so will <hi>Swords be beaten into Plowshares, and Spears into Pruning Hooks, and Wars will cease, and Cruelty come to an end, and Love will abound,</hi> and the <hi>Banner</hi> of it reach over Nations; and <hi>this is the Lord bringing to pass</hi> with <hi>His holy Arme,</hi> and a lovely Army hath he Gathered, and they willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow Him, and <hi>His Banner over them is Love,</hi> and under it they are Protected, and safely Conducted, and goe Forward in the strength of <hi>Love,</hi> and all that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands them must fall before them; For the Lamb makes the way, and His <hi>Royal Army</hi> follows Him, and He exalts Himself upon his Throne, and Establishes His own Government in Everlasting Righteousness, and in His <hi>Royal Army</hi> doth His Purity shine, &amp; His Meekness, Patience and Gentleness, is the Garment of their Praise, and with His Vertuous Life are they beautified, and their strength is in Him, and under His <hi>Banner</hi> they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide, and when He Leads, they stand in readiness to Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and so keep the good Order, and He prepares the way and makes it Easie; and though many Tribulations and afflictions come upon them, yet he doth not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake them, but stands by them, and His <hi>Lovely Banner</hi> covers them, and with it He preserves them, and He bears the Affliction with them, and so upholds them in it, and makes way through it, and works Deliverance from it; And this is the Lamb of Glory, who Leads His <hi>Royal Army</hi> in the Way of Peace, and He Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims

His <hi>Peace on Earth and his Good Will towards Men,</hi> and doth not <hi>Destroy Mens Lives,</hi> but appears to <hi>Save them;</hi> And the same Mind he begets in his Followers, who are an <hi>Army of Peace,</hi> as He is <hi>The Prince of Peace</hi>; And yet they Fight His Battel, under the <hi>Banner of his Love,</hi> and their <hi>Warfare is not Carnal, but Spiritual,</hi> and in the <hi>Spiritual</hi> He sets up His own Kingdom, and into it He Conducts His <hi>Royal Army,</hi> and there gives unto them an <hi>Everlasting Inheritance,</hi> in <hi>His Everlasting Kingdom,</hi> which doth Recompence their Faithfulness; And these are a <hi>Royal Army</hi> that Fight the Lords Battel boldly, and yet dare not Destroy the Life of any, but abide under the <hi>Banner of Love,</hi> and there in Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence rest; And He appears His own Cause to plead, and makes them <hi>more than Conquerors through His own Love</hi>; And these are a Peaceable People, who are guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a peaceable Principle that is of God, and in Peace they obtain the Victory, and the Lamb comes forth in His Power, and takes the Dominion, and sets up His own Government in the Kingdom of Peace; And this is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Work, and it is His own, &amp; not to be accomplished by any Carnal Weapon, for that cannot Establish a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Kingdom, and the <hi>Lamb's Kingdom is Spiritual,</hi> His <hi>Government Spiritual,</hi> His <hi>Royal Army Spiritual,</hi> &amp; they cannot fight about an Outward Kingdom, but mind the Inward Work, and to be Kept with Him, whose <hi>Kingdom is not of this World</hi>; And so they come more into an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Spiritual Work, and wait to know an Inward Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Change, whereby Christ is Revealed in Spirit, and comes in his Power and Glory, and takes his Right and Sets up his Kindom, and in it Reigns, and puts down all his Enemies under him; and this is his Battel in which he appears to exalt his own Name in Dominion, and in

            <p>Now all that are Striving and Warring, and have it in their hearts so to do, and thereby think to set up their Religion, and their Observation; or such as Expect a time in which Christ will appear Personally upon the Earth to Reign, and have it in their hearts to cut off and destroy the contrary minded, and so by Weapons of War Fight for His Kingdom, and thereby exalt Him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Dominion, unto such sorts of People it is said, <hi>Be still and quiet, lest ye put sorth your hand to do Evil, and so provoke the Holy One to anger,</hi> and in your froward minds provoke one another, and so kindle Wrath and Anger one in another; From which comes all Wars and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, which is not the way that Christ appears in, nor the path in which he leads His <hi>Royal Army</hi>: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let all men appear in the Moderation, and cease from Warring and Fighting, and Killing one another, and let them mind the thing that concerns their own Peace, and follow that pure Principle of Light in their own Conscience, which will teach them to put up their Swords, and to live Peaceably with all men; And it will purge out that Revenging Blood-thirsty Spirit which provokes hastily to commit Cruelty, and it will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer one man to Kill another, for it commands the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and he that Kills transgresseth against it, and is not of the Lamb's <hi>Royal Army,</hi> who have put up their Swords and cannot <hi>learn War any more</hi>; And unto such it is said, <hi>Be Faithful still,</hi> that a clear Deliverance may be wrought out, and <hi>let the Patient be Patient still,</hi> that <hi>Patience may have its perfect Work,</hi> and that there may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be

Sweetly; They that Abide in their measure, Receive their Consolation, and Feel their Gathering into Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Life, and in it are Translated out of the Earthly, and so an Undefiled Birth is Born, which in the Chaste Mind is Retained, and truly Beloved, and unto it alone belong the Issues from Death; it is not to be Contained in any one Place, nor Comprehended in any one Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel; There is no Limitation of its Breaking forth, but when and where, and in whom it pleaseth; it Prepares <hi>the Vessel for its use,</hi> and makes it Honourable in its own Holiness; It Springs and Fills according to its Pleasure, and the Vessel must be New that doth Contain it; This<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the day of its Renown, and many Partake of its preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Virtue; The Low Estate is exceeding Sweet, and to be truly Humble is the <hi>Way of Life;</hi> To keep Self in the Nothingness, brings in Joy and Peace, and to be Abased makes truly Contented; for in that Path the Streams do Run, and in the Savor thereof is Sweet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation; The Patient Waiter knows it, and the Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Heart can Seal unto it; And this is a Birth of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency born of Immortality, and as it doth Arise it hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the Mortal unto the Death of the Cross, and makes self of no Reputation, and in the Believer it works its own Freedom, and Purges out the Corruptible, and makes Way into the Believers Heart, and puts Joy and Gladness therein, whereby a Supply is Ministred unto that which stands in Need, and with this are the Babes Nourished, and the Lambs Refreshed, and herein is Joy and Peace obtained and truly possessed; and as the Mind in the Lowness sinks down to the Life, so doth the Life Exalt it self into Honour, and Spreads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad its Renown in the Heart, and becomes exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glorious in the Beauty of its own Holiness, and

and He is their <hi>God,</hi> and dwells amongst them, and walks in them, and the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> orders them, and they are His <hi>Royal Army,</hi> in whose Love and Life they stand in Unity, and give up their Bodies and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits unto God, that his own Will may be <hi>done,</hi> and the Intents of his own Heart <hi>performed,</hi> and his own Name therein <hi>glorified.</hi>
