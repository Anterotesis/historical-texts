         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE

ROBERT
EARL OF
SUNDERLAND;
Baron Spencer of Wormleighton.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>'TIS the Fate of Illustrious
Persons to be often visited
by such Importunate Addressers.
Their Quality, which priviledges
them on so many other occasions,
<pb facs="tcp:44397:3"/>
does but the more expose them to
frequent Persecutions of this nature.
Nay, their Retirements are not
able to protect them; for a true
Town-Dedicator will Invade their
most private recesses, and attacque
them even in their Solitude. As I
own my self somewhat interested
in the Reputation of my Author, I
was resolved, that whatever Injuries
he suffer'd in the Translation, he
should have right done him in the
Choice of a Patron; and therefore
to pitch upon one who was no
stranger to his Person or to his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
and who best understood his
value, because he has the truest and
most accurate Judgment in the
World. 'Tis true, my Lord, he
needs no Patronage, as he shines in
his Native Language, for there his
own Merit abundantly secures him;
but I am sensible, that after all the
<pb facs="tcp:44397:3"/>
care that has been taken with him,
he will stand in need of it, as he
appears in ours: With this view,
my Lord, I have presum'd to give
you the trouble of this bold Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress;
and perhaps your Lordship
is the first Person in the World,
that has suffer'd upon the score of
being the Friend of Monsieur <hi>de</hi>
St. <hi>Evremont.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But besides this, my Lord, you
have another Title to this Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
We have long labour'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Mean, but unjust Character
with our Neighbours, who lye more
to the Southward, and are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
obliged to your Lordship for
reversing it. For I don't at all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
but that your Lordship's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Merit, drew from
our Author that Ingenuous Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
which in his admirable Discourse
to the Marescal <hi>de Crequi,</hi> he makes

does but the more expose them to

obliged to your Lordship for

to the Marescal <hi>de Crequi,</hi> he makes
<pb facs="tcp:44397:5"/>
of the Partiality and unjust Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
of his own Country-men;
your Lordship's Acquaintance has
convinc'd him that colder Climates
than his own, may produce Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of as sprightly a Wit, and
strong a Judgment; and that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteness
and Elegance were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
to <hi>France.</hi> Thus our whole
Island, my Lord, reaps the benefit
of your Noble Qualifications. They
have procured one of the most Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic
Testimonies in the World,
to pass in its Favour. No Foreigner
will urge our distance from the Sun,
or have the hardiness hereafter to
impute Barbarity to us. St. <hi>Evre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
has acquitted us from that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.
St. <hi>Evremont</hi> has own'd
us not to be inferiour in Wit to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of our Neighbouring Nations;
and 'tis to your Lordship that we
stand indebted for so advantageous
a Confession.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:44397:5"/>
I said, My Lord, one of the
most Authentic Testimonies in the
World. For I believe it will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
on all hands that since the
Declension of the <hi>Roman</hi> Eloquence
and Empire, there never was a
truer or nicer Judge of Men and
manners than our Author, or one
in whom a fruitful Wit and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundnefs
of reason were so happily
reconciled. Amongst his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Men
or indeed any where else,
<hi>I</hi> find none that can dispute the
prize with him but <hi>Montagne;</hi> who
was in truth an extraordinary Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
and has left those remains
behind him that will entertain and
instruct, as long as Mankind pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
any Taste for Wit and good
Sense. Tho' he writ in a very
impolite Age, and his Language
derives an unhappy tincture from
one of the worst Provinces of <hi>France,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:44397:6"/>
yet there is something so forcible, so
vigorous, and so masculine in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
that after all the considerable
improvements the French Tongue
has received since his time, it still
pleases, nay it Charms and affects us.
Now as all this, and a great deal
more, may deservedly be said in
his Praise, yet his warmest Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
must be forced to confess with
me, that Nicety was never his
Talent; that amongst his infinite
Variety of Citations (for as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
says very well of him, he's no
troublesome Host, but when his
own Conversation fails him, he has
some Friends to keep it up, till he
has got Breath again,) some ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
deserved to be mentioned, and
others are urged <hi>Mal a Propos;</hi>
in short, that his way of writing is
too Pindarical, and his Excursions
too frequent. 'Tis true, he is so
<pb facs="tcp:44397:6"/>
Complaisant to his Reader, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to leave him in any Barren
Uncultivated places; he gives him
an agreeable <hi>Vista</hi> of Groves and
Meadows: The Scene varies eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
moment, and consequently, must
delight him; but still he makes
him wander; still he leads him out
of the way, or at least for the
sake of one Beautiful Prospect car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
him a Mile or two about;
and this at long run cannot fail to
disgust nice Persons who are in
pain till they arrive at their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
end. On the other hand
St. <hi>Evremont</hi> is not only Master
of all the good Qualities of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagne</hi>
without any of his defects,
but possesses several others, to which
the former was either altogether a
Stranger, as Gallantry and a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licateness
of Discernment, or else
was but slightly acquainted with.
<pb facs="tcp:44397:7"/>
To dismiss this Comparison, he has
a greater depth of penetration; a
greater justness in Reasoning; a
better tast of polite Learning, and a
more exquisite knowledge of the
World. Not to speak of his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
which will admit no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison.
I cannot conclude this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
without observing, that even in
his Misfortunes, our Author has recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
an honourable Elogy from one of
the most Judicious Writers in
<hi>France,</hi> but a Member of that
Order, which is seldom guilty of
paying Incense to Persons in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace;
and what is remarkable, an
Order to which he himself had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
no great Respect.</p>
            <p>But I humbly beg your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
pardon, for dwelling so long
upon a Subject which your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
better understands than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
person whatever. I am sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
<pb facs="tcp:44397:7"/>
I should Commit the same
Solecism, should I enlarge upon all
your several Eminent Qualities
since they are as well known to
the greater part of mankind, as St.
<hi>Evremonts</hi> Character is to your
Lordship. That Air of politeness
which distinguishes every thing you
say or do; that Unwearied Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity
in extending your Favours;
that greatness of Mind, that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Sagacity and Experience in all
Affairs, are so readily ackowledged as
well by those that have the honour to
be admitted into your Conversations,
as others that behold you at a
distance, and only view you in
your Character as it is universally
established; that as they cannot be
set in a better light, so the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
of them wou'd be no <hi>New
Discovery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet my Lord, as in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb facs="tcp:44397:8"/>
of the World, it has been (if
I may be allowed the expression,)
the <hi>Appennage</hi> of a conspicuous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to meet with many Enemies;
you have not been without your
share of them; but Heaven be
Praised for setting such great Odds
between their discretion and their
Malice. 'Twas your Lordships hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
that they charg'd you with
things so disproportion'd and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd,
that none seemed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them, but those who receive
every thing without examination,
or those whose interest it was to
spread them. For as it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for them to say the least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
thing of you without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
recourse to fiction, they mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
it so profusely, that like the
Old Relators of <hi>Heroic</hi> adventures,
they destroyed that very belief
they endeavoured to Propagate.
<pb facs="tcp:44397:8"/>
Even that Instrument, which by
one of the most industrious Agents
of Hell was designed to ruin your
Reputation with the rest of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
for which purpose no Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of Threats and promises were
left unpracticed; that very Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
my Lord, served to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
your Lordships Virtue to the
World; and never was Innocence
more triumphant, and never did Truth
gain a more glorious Conquest.</p>
            <p>And now, my Lord, if your
Candor has not been wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted
in forgiving these injuries, I
humbly beg you to employ it once
more in pardoning the imperfections
of this Translation. My Friends and I
did our best endeavours, but
found to our expence, it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
difficult to imitate and
Translate St. <hi>Evremont.</hi> The peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods
every where so Harmonious
<pb facs="tcp:44397:9"/>
and yet so unaffected, the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
so comprehensive and yet so
clear, so Polite and yet so Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
that tho' we cou'd pretend to
have reached his meaning in all
places, which is no easy matter
in an Author so very nice and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating,
yet we cannot without a
sensible regret, observe how much
we have fallen below the Original.
Your Lordship has received bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
presents from other hands,
but this is offered with no less sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity.
And in this single presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I was glad of this occasion to
declare to all the World with what
Zeal and Integrity,</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Had designed to have made some
Critical Remarks and Observations
upon those Chapters in the Second Volume
of Monsieur <hi>de St. Evremont,</hi> where
the occasion Naturally required them.</p>
            <p>But the Book happening to swell larger
by several Sheets than was expected, I
have no room here to insert them. Mr.
<hi>Dryden</hi> indeed, who in his excellent <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi>
before the first Volume, has given us
a very good account of our inimitable
Author, seems to have spared me this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
but however, he has not so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted
the Subject, but that there is still
a very ample Field for those that come
after him to Cultivate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:44397:10"/>
I shall here take no notice of what
our Author, both in his Discourse to the
<hi>Mareschal de Crequi,</hi> and in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to <hi>Monsieur Justel,</hi> the late Learned
Library-keeper at St. <hi>James's,</hi> has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
upon the Score of Religion. For
besides that he has managed the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
like a Gentleman, and not <hi>en
Theologue;</hi> 'tis certain he drew his
Character of the Reformed from the
<hi>Huguenots</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> a sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
whom we are not obliged to justify.</p>
            <p>The first Volume will speedily be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed,
with great Amendments, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions;
where I shall have a proper op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to prefix Dissertation, which I
am forced for want of room here to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>

MONSIEUR
THE
MARSHALL de CREQVI,
Who ask'd the temper of my Mind, and my
Thoughts of things in general.</head>
            <byline>By Dr. <hi>DRAKE.</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>WHEN we are young, the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
Opinion sways us, and
we are more solicitous to gain
the Esteem of others then of our selves.
But arriv'd to Old Age, we are apt to
have a less value for Foreign things, and
are most taken up with our selves, when
we are ready to abandon our selves.</p>
            <p>Life is like our other Possessions, all
vanishes, when we think our stock great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est:
Our measures are seldom rightly
understood, till little remains to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged.
Hence we see young Men squan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
(as it were) their Being, in which
they think they have a long term of
Years to come. We grow more chary of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44397:11"/>
our selves, as we grow nearer to lose
our selves.</p>
            <p>The time has been, when my roving,
uncontrol'd Fancy rambled after every
thing strange to it: At present my
Mind contracts it self to the Body, and
unites more straitly with it: Nor is
this out of any sense of Pleasure from
such an Alliance, but out of necessity of
the mutual Succour and Assistance, which
they endeavour to afford one another.</p>
            <p>In this feeble Condition, I yet retain
some pleasures, but I have lost all
sense of Vice, without knowing whether
this change be owing to the Infirmity
of a decay'd Body, or the moderation of
a Mind better improv'd in Wisdom than
heretofore. I fear my Age has a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
share in it than my Vertue, that I
have more reason to complain, than
bragg of the Obedience of Inclinations.</p>
            <p>In vain should I ascribe to my Reason
the Fower of subjecting my desires, if
they are too weak to raise themselves; and
what Wisdom soever Men at my Years
may boast of, it is hard to distinguish,
whether those Passions, we now no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
feel, be subdued or expired.</p>
            <p>Howsoever it be, when our senses are
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44397:11"/>
no longer touch'd with their Objects, nor
our Souls mov'd by their Impressions, it
is properly no more then a State of Indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:
Yet is not this indolence without
it's Charms, To think himself exempt
from all uneasiness, is enough to give Joy
to a reasonable Man.</p>
            <p>The Enjoyment of Pleasures is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
required; the privation of pain well
used, renders our Condition sufficiently
happy.</p>
            <p>If any misfortune befall me, I am na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
little sensible of it, without dash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this happy Constitution with any
thoughts of Constancy. For Constancy
is only dwelling longer upon our Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
It appears the most aimable Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in the World to those who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
no afflictions, but is truly a new load
to such as are.</p>
            <p>Resistance only Fretts us, and Instead
of easing one grievance adds another:
Without Resistance we suffer only the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
inflicted on us, with it our own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements
too. For this reason under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Calamities, I resign all to Nature; I
reserve my prudence for times of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity.
Then by reflecting upon my own
Indolence, I take pleasure in the pains, I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44397:12"/>
endure not, and by this means make hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
the most indifferent State of Life.</p>
            <p>Experience grows with Age, and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
commonly with Experience: But
when I ascribe this Vertue to Old
Men, I mean not that they are always
Masters of it. This is cerrain that they
have always the Liberty to be wise, and
to knock off decently those Fetters
which prejudice has put upon the World.
They only are allow'd to take things for
what they really are.</p>
            <p>Reason does as 'twere plant every thing
in our Education; which is afterward in
a manner quite over-run by Fancy. Age
only has the power to drive out the one
from what she had usurp'd, and reesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
the other in what the had lost.</p>
            <p>For my self, I observe religiously all
real Duties. The imaginary I refuse or
admit, as I like or dislike 'em. For in
things to which I am not oblig'd, I think it
equal reason to reject what does not please
me, or to accept what does.</p>
            <p>Every day frees me from one link at
least of the Chain, nor is it less for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of those from whom I disengage
my self, then me, who regain my liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
They are as great gainers in the loss
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44397:12"/>
of an useless Man, as I should have been
a loser, by idely devoting my self any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to 'em.</p>
            <p>Of all Ties, that of Amity is the only
one that has, in my Opinion, almost
irresistible Charms, and were it not for
the disgrace that attends no Return, I
cou'd love meerly for the pleasure of
Loving, even where I was not belov'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>In Love ill plac'd, the Sentiments of
Amity entertain us purely by their own
agreeable sweetness. But we ought to
divest our selves of a just hatred for the
Interest of our own quiet.</p>
            <p>Happy is that Mind which can entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deny some Passions, and only unbend
it self to some others. It would then
be void of Fear, Sadness, Hatred, or
Jealousie. It wou'd desire without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
Hope without impatience, and
Enjoy without transport.</p>
            <p>The state of Vertue is not a state of
Indolence. We suffer in it a perpetual
Conflict betwixt Duty, and Inclination.
Now we do what disgusts us, and now
oppose what relishes well: Being almost
always under force, both in our Actions,
and Abstinence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:44397:13"/>
That of Wisdom is sweet and calm.
It reigns Peaceably over our movements,
being only to Govern well as Subjects,
what Vertue Combats as Enemies.</p>
            <p>I can say one thing of my self, as extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
as true, that is, that I have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in my self felt any Conflict between
Passion, and Reason. My Passion never
oppos'd what I resolv'd out of Duty;
and my Reason readily comply'd with
what my Pleasure Inclin'd me to.</p>
            <p>I pretend not that this easie accord is
praise worthy; on the contrary, I confess
I have been often the more Vicious for it.
Not out of any perverse disposition to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;
but because Vice cover'd the Crime,
with an appearance of Pleasure.</p>
            <p>It is certain, the nature of things is
much better discover'd by reflection on
'em, when past, then by their impressions
at perception. Now the great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
with the World, hinders all atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Youth. What we see in others
hinders us from examining well our selves.</p>
            <p>Crowds please us at an Age, when we
Love (as one may say) to diffuse our
selves. Multitudes grow troublesome
at another, when we naturally recoil to
our selves, or instead of numbers come to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44397:13"/>
paucity of Friends, who are more
united to us.</p>
            <p>'Tis this humour, that insensibly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws
us from Courts. We begin through
that to seek some Mean between Hurry
and Retirement. We grow afterwards
asham'd to show an old Face amongst
young Fellows.</p>
            <p>Let us not flatter our selves with our
Judgments: A brisk Buffoonery will run
it down; and the false glittering of a
youthful Fancy will turn to Ridicule our
most delicate Conversations. If we have
Wit, the best use of it is in private Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies;
for in a Crowd the Spirit main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
it self but ill against the Body.</p>
            <p>This Justice which we are oblig'd to
do our selves, ought not to make us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
to the young Men. We ought not
perpetually to cry up our own Times, or
enviously always condemn theirs. Let
us not rail at Pleasures when we are past
them, or censure Diversions, whose only
Offence is our Incapacity.</p>
            <p>Our Judgments ought to be always the
same. We may live, but must not judge
by Humour. There is in mine an odd
peculiarity, which makes me mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
Magnificence more by its trouble
than pomp.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:44397:14"/>
Shows, Feasts, and great Assemblies,
invite not me to the sight of 'em: The
Inconveniencies I must suffer, deter me.
The elegant harmony of Consorts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages
not me so much, as the difficulty of
adjusting 'em disobliges me. Abundance
disgusts me at my Meals, and Rarities
seem to me an affected Curiosity. My
fancy cannot recommend any thing to my
palate by my scarcity. My choice shou'd be
of things easily to be had, that my Delicacy
may not be ruled by Fancy.</p>
            <p>I am as fond of Reading as ever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it depends more particularly on the
mind, which tires not like the Senses. In
truth, I seek in Books my Pleasure, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than my Instruction.</p>
            <p>As I have less time for Practice, I
have less desire to learn. I have more
need of a stock of Life than of methods
of living; and the little that remains,
is better spent in things agreeable, than
Instructive. The Latin Authors afford me
the most, and I read whatever I think fine,
a thousand times over without being cloy'd.</p>
            <p>A nice Choice has confin'd me to a few
Books, in which I seek rather found than
fine Wit; and the true Taste (to use a
Spanish Expression) is ordinarily found in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44397:14"/>
the Writings of considerable Men. I am
pleas'd to discover in <hi>Tully</hi>'s Epistles, both
his own Character, and that of those
Persons of Quality that Write to him. He
never divests himself of his Rhetorick, and
the least recommendation to his most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
Friend is as artificially Insinuated,
as if he were to prepossess a Stranger in
an Affair of the greatest Consequence in
the World.</p>
            <p>The Letters of the rest want those fine
turns; but in my Mind, they have more
good Sense than his, and this makes me
judge very Advantageously of the great
and general Abilities of the <hi>Romans</hi> at
that time.</p>
            <p>Our Authors prefer the Age of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi>
upon the account of <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race;</hi>
and perhaps more yet upon the
score of <hi>Maecenas,</hi> who encouraged Men
of Learning, than for those Men of
Learning themselves.</p>
            <p>It is neverthelsess certain, that their
Parts as well as Courages began at that
time to decay. Grandeur of Soul was
converted to Circumspect Conduct, and
sound Discourse to Polite Conversation:
I know not what to think of the Remains
of <hi>Maecenas,</hi> unless it be that they had
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44397:15"/>
something of Grimace, which was made
to pass for delicate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maecenas</hi> was <hi>Augustus</hi>'s great Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite;
The Man that pleas'd, and whom
all the Polite, and sprightly Witts court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
now is it not likely that his judgment
over-rul'd the rest, that they affected his
Air, and Ap'd, as much as they could,
his Character?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Augustus</hi> himself leaves us no great
Idea of his Latinity. What we see of
<hi>Terence,</hi> what was reported at <hi>Rome</hi> of
politeness of <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Laelius,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and what we have of
<hi>Cicero,</hi> with the complaint of this last
for the loss of what he calls, <hi>Sales, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pores,
Venustates, Vrbanitas, Amaenitas,
Festivitas, Iucunditas;</hi> all together make
me believe, upon better consideration,
That we must search some other time
than that of <hi>Augustus,</hi> to find the sound
and agreeable Wit of the <hi>Romans,</hi> as well
as the pure and natural Graces of their
Tongue.</p>
            <p>It may be said, That <hi>Horase</hi> had a
very nice Palate in all these Matters;
which perswades me, that the rest of his
Contemporaries had not. For the nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his Relish consisted chiefly in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44397:15"/>
that of others ridiculous. But as for
the Impertinencies, false Manners, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectations
which he laugh'd at, his sense
wou'd not at this day appear so very just.</p>
            <p>I own that of <hi>Augustus</hi> to have been the
Age of excellent Poets; but it follows not,
That it was that of Universal Genius's.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Poetry</hi> requires a peculiar Genius, that
agrees not overmuch with good sense.
It is sometimes the Language of Gods,
sometimes of Buffoons, rarely that of a
Civil Man. It delights in Figures, and
Fictions, always besides the reality of
things, tho' it be that only, that can sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
a found Understanding.</p>
            <p>Not but that there is something Noble
in making good Verse; but we must
have a great command of our Genius, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
the mind is possess'd with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
Foreign, which hinders it from the
free management of it self.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He's a Block-head</hi> (say the <hi>Spaniards)
that can't make two Verses, and a Fool
that makes four.</hi> If this Maxim pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
over all the World, we should
want a thousand fine Works, the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of which gives us a very delicate
pleasure; but this Maxim respects Men
of Business, rather than profess'd Poets.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44397:16"/>
However, those that are capacitated for
such great Works, will not oppose the
force of their Genius, for what I can say;
and it is certain, that amongst Authors,
those only will write few Verses, who
find themselves curb'd more by their own
natural Unaptness, than by my Reasons.</p>
            <p>Excellent <hi>Poets</hi> are as requisite for our
pleasure, as great <hi>Mathematicians</hi> for our
use: But it is sufficient for us to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with their Works, and not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
our selves in the solitary Enthusiasm
of the one, or to exhaust our Spirits in
Meditation like the other.</p>
            <p>Of all Poets, <hi>Comedians</hi> are most proper
for the converse of the World: For they
oblige themselves to paint naturally what
passes in it, and to express after a lively
manner the Thoughts, and Passions of
Men.</p>
            <p>How new an Air soever, may be given
to old Thoughts, that sort of Poetry
is very tedious which is fill'd with Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of the Morning, the Sun, Moon, and
Stars. Our Descriptions of a calm and a
tempestuous Sea, represent nothing which
the Antients have not done much better.</p>
            <p>Now we have not only the same Ideas,
but the very same Expressions, the same
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44397:16"/>
Rhymes. I never hear of the Harmony
of Birds, but I prepare my self for the
murmuring of Brooks; the Shepherds
are always lolling upon Fern, and you
may sooner find a Grove without a
Shade in its proper sight, than in our
Verses.</p>
            <p>This must necessarily at length be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
tedious; which cannot happen in
Comedy, where with pleasure we see our
own Actions drawn, and are touch'd with
Paralel Motions.</p>
            <p>A Discourse of Woods, Rivers, Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
Fields, and Gardens, make but a
very languishing Impression upon us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
their Beauties be wholly new: But
a discourse of Humanity, its Inclinations,
Tendernesses, and Affections, finds some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at the bottom of our Souls pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
to receive it; the same nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
and receives 'em, and they are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
transfused from the Actors to the
Spectators.</p>
            <p>The Delicacy of Love sooths me, and
its tenderness touches me; and as in <hi>Spain</hi>
they love the best of any Country in the
World, I am never weary of reading in
their Authors Amorous Adventures. I
am more affected with the Passion of one
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44397:17"/>
of their Lovers, than I shou'd be with my
own, were I yet capable of any. The
very Imagination of those Amours raises
in me certain motions for the Gallant,
which I cou'd never feel for my self.</p>
            <p>There is perhaps as much Witt in the
other Writings of that Nation, as in ours;
but it is a Wit that gives me no satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
except that of <hi>Cervantes</hi> in <hi>Don
Quixot,</hi> which I cou'd read all my life
without being disgusted one single mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Of all the Books I have ever read, <hi>Don
Quixot</hi> is that, of which I shou'd be most
ambitious to have been the Author. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in my Opinion, can contribute more
to the forming in us a true relish of every
thing. I wonder how <hi>Cervantes</hi> cou'd, as
it were out of the Mouth of one of the
greatest Fools in the World, shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
maiter of all the Understanding and
Knowledge imaginable. I admire the
diversities of his Characters, which are
of the most uncommon stamp in the
World, and at the same time the most na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quevedo</hi> indeed appears a very Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Author, but I esteem him more for
wishing all other Books Burnt, when he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44397:17"/>
had read <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> than for having
been able to read 'em.</p>
            <p>I am not acquainted enough with <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
Verse, to taste their delicacy, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
their Grace and Beauty; I meet
with some Histories in that Tongue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all the Moderns, and some Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Politicks even above what the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
have Written.</p>
            <p>As for the Morality of the <hi>Italians,</hi> it
is full of Conceipts, which savour more
of a Fancy that aims to Sparkle, than of
solid Sense founded on deep Reflections.</p>
            <p>I am very curious of every thing that
is fine in <hi>French,</hi> and am very much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasted
at a thousand Authours, that seem
only to have written for the Reputation
of being Authors. I read not for the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of having read abundance, and this is
it which tyes me up to certain Books,
where I'm assur'd to meet satisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montagne</hi>'s Essays, <hi>Malherbe</hi>'s Poems,
<hi>Corneille</hi>'s Tragedies, and <hi>Voiture</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
have established to themselves, as it
were, a Title to please me during Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montagne</hi> has not the same success with
others through their whole Course. As
he particularly lays open Men, the
Young and the Old are pleased to see
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44397:18"/>
themselves in him by the resemblance of
their Thoughts. The space intermedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
to these Ages, takes 'em off from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to other Professions; and then they
find less in <hi>Montagne</hi> that fits 'em. The
Art Military employs the General; Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks
the States-man; Divinity the
Church Man; and Law the Judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montagne</hi> returns upon us, when Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
has brought us back again to our
selves; and the approach of Age, when
we truly feel what we are, recalls the
Prince as well as his meanest Subjects from
his Engagements to his Function, to the
more near and sensible interest of his
Person.</p>
            <p>I Write not this out of any impulse
of vanity, which urges Men to make
their Fancies publick. I instruct my
self by what I say, and understand my
self better by expressing the Notion I
have form'd of my self, then I could by
private thoughts, and Internal Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>The Idea a Man has of himself by
simple attention to Internal Meditations,
is always a little confus'd. The Image
which is outwardly express'd is much
more exact, and gives us much truer
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44397:18"/>
Judgment of our selves, when it is again
submitted to the Examination of the
mind, after having been laid before our
eyes.</p>
            <p>Besides, the flattering Opinion of our
own merit loses half its Charms, as
soon as it comes into the light; and the
complaisance of self Love insensibly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
leaves behind it only a disgust
of its sweetness, and shame for a vanity
as foolishly entertain'd as judiciously quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>To equal <hi>Malherbe</hi> to the Antients, I
find nothing finer then his own compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.
I wou'd only in his works re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench
what is not worthy of him. It were
injustice to postpone him to any one who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
But he must bear with us, if
for the honour of our own Judgments, we
make him give place to himself.</p>
            <p>Almost the same we may say of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neille.</hi>
He wou'd be above all the Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
of Antiquity, if he were not in some
of his pieces much below himself. He
is so admirable in what is fine, that he
take saway all patience for what is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
What in him is not excellent, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
is naught; not that it is bad, but
that it wants the perfection of the rest.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44397:19"/>
It is not enough for him to please us light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he's bound to touch us to the quick.</p>
            <p>If he ravishes not our minds, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
their utmost penetration, enviously
to discover the difference between him
and himself.</p>
            <p>Some Authors may simply move us.
But those are petty ticklings, pleasing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
when we have nothing else to
mind. <hi>Corneille</hi> prepares our minds for
transports: If they be not elevated, they
are left in a condition more uneasie than
languour.</p>
            <p>It is, I confess hard, always to Charm:
Very hard at pleasure to raise a mind
from its temper, to unhinge a Soul. But
<hi>Corneille</hi> by having done it so often, has
laid upon himself an Obligation to do it
always. Let him expunge what is not
noble enough for him, and he will leave
us in a full admiration of those Beauties
which no one can Parallel.</p>
            <p>I should not excuse <hi>Voiture</hi> for a great
many of his Letters, which he ought to
have suppress'd, had himself been the
Publisher: But he was like some Fathers,
equally kind and prudent, who have a
natural affection for their Children, and
in secret cherish those that want worth,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44397:19"/>
thereby to avoid exposing their Judgments
to the Publick by their Indulgence.</p>
            <p>He might have shew'd all his Fondness
to some of his Works; for there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in 'em so unaccountably ingenious
so polite, so fine, and so agreeable, that it
takes away all taste of the <hi>Sales Attici</hi>'
and the <hi>Roman <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rbanitas;</hi> ecclypses quite
the Spirit and Wit of the <hi>Italians,</hi> and the
Gallantry of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have in <hi>French</hi> some particular
pieces of admirable Beauty; of which
number is the Funerall Oration of the
Queen of <hi>England</hi> by Monsieur <hi>de Meaux.</hi>
There is a certain Spirit diffus'd through
the whole discourse, which gives as great
an opinion of the Author before he is
known, as of his Work, after 'tis read.
His Character is impress'd on all that he
says; so that altho' I have never seen
him, I pass easily from the admiration
of his Discourse to that of his Person.</p>
            <p>Nor am I less affected with the Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of General History done by the same
Prelate. Such reach is there in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections:
The sense so sound, so
great a purity of Reasoning! What a
capacity of mind must he have in one
Scheme to comprehend so great a variety
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44397:20"/>
of Events, so far disjoyn'd both in time
and place? What Judgment to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
'em as he do's, and draw from 'em
Consequences so advantagious to the true
Religion?</p>
            <p>How great soever the pleasure of Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is to me, yet that of Conversation
will ever be more sensible. The acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the Ladies would afford the
sweetest, if their Charms did not put us
to too much pain to defend our selves from
doing Homage to 'em. Yet this is a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<hi>I</hi> rarely suffer; as my Age renders
me unacceptable, my Experience makes
me nice; and if they can't be pleas'd with
me, <hi>I</hi> am by way of return as little sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with them.</p>
            <p>There are some whose Merits make a
considerable impression on my mind, but
their Beauty has little influence on me.
And if <hi>I</hi> am at any time surprized by it,
<hi>I</hi> presently reduce my Passion to a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
reasonable Amity, that has none of
the uneasinesses of Love.</p>
            <p>Amongst Ladies, the most meritorious
person with them, is the Lover; the
next, the Confident of their Inclinations;
the third, he that ingeniously sets off all
that is amiable in 'em. If nothing will
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44397:20"/>
win their hearts, we may at least gain
their Favours by Complements; for next
to the Lover, to whom all must give place,
he pleases 'em most, that can make 'em
please themselves best.</p>
            <p>When you converse with 'em, avoid
carefully all indifference, they are from
their Souls Enemies to such coldness, or
love your self, or flatter what they love,
or paint 'em so as to plunge 'em still deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in Love with themselves, For Love
of some sort or other they must have, it
is a Passion their Hearts are never unfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
with. Direct a poor Heart how to
employ it.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, some of 'em can have esteem,
and even tenderness too without Love;
and others there are as worthy of our
Confidence and Secrets as the most trusty
of our Friends.</p>
            <p>I know some that have no less Wit
and Discretion, then Charms and Beauty:
But those are Rarities, that Nature wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly
bestows on the World, whether by
design or caprice, and we can draw no
Consequences in Favour of the Generall,
from things so particular, and from Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
so uncommon. Women so extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
seem to invade the Character of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44397:21"/>
Men; and perhaps it is a kind of revolt
from their Sex, to shake off the Natural
Conditions of it for the real Advantages of
ours.</p>
            <p>I confess I have formerly been more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
in the choice of the Men, with whom
I Convers'd, then at present I am; and I
think my self not so much a Loser in point
of Delicacy, as a gainer in point of Sense.
I then sought for Men that cou'd please
me in every thing, I now seek every thing
that may please me in any Man.</p>
            <p>A Man in all respects agreeable, is too
great a Rarity, and it is no Wisdom to
hunt for what we are hardly ever like to
find. That Delicacy of pleasure, which
our imagination paints to us, is what we
seldom enjoy; the sickly nice Fancy gives
us a disrelish of those things, which we
during the whole course of our lives
might obtain.</p>
            <p>Not that, to say Truth, it is impossible
to find such Jewels, but it is very rarely
that Nature forms 'em, and that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
favours us with 'em. My good Stars
made me know one of this rank in <hi>France,</hi>
and another of equal merit in a Forreign
<hi>Country,</hi> who was the whole delight of my
Life. Death has robbed me of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44397:21"/>
and I can never think on that cruel
day on which Monsieur <hi>Daubigny</hi> died,
but I may with a sad and sensible regrett,
say,
<q>
                  <l>—Quem semper acerbum,</l>
                  <l>Semper honoratum, sic dî voluistis, habebo.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Among your other measures for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Society, you must take care to
apprehend the good things seperately; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
to distinguish Solidity from Prolixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
good Nature from want of Sense,
Science from Ridicule. You will find these
Qualities promiscuously blended, not only
among those Men whom you may at
pleasure make choice of, or repudiate, but
even among those whom your interest,
or other tyes as obligatory, shall bind you
to.</p>
            <p>I have seen a Man of the gayest natural
parts in the World, lay aside the happy
facility of his Genious, and engage in
Arguments of Science and Religion, in
which he betray'd a ridiculous ignorance.</p>
            <p>I know one of the most Learned Men
in <hi>Europe,</hi> of whom one may Learn a
Thousand things curious or profound,
in whom nevertheless you will find an
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44397:22"/>
impotence of Beleif in every thing extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
fabulous, or exceeding Credit.</p>
            <p>That great Master of the Stage, to
whom the <hi>Romans</hi> are more beholding
for the Beauty of their thoughts, then to
their own Wit or Vertue: <hi>Corneille</hi> who
sufficiently discovers himself without na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
speaks like an ordinary Man when
he speaks for himself. He exhausts all
his stock of thought for a <hi>Greek</hi> or a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi>
A <hi>French-man</hi> or <hi>Spaniard</hi> abates
his courage; and when he speaks for him,
he is quite dispirited. He racks his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
for all that is noble to adorn his
Old <hi>Heroe's,</hi> and you would say, that he
debarr'd himself the advantage of his own
proper Wealth, as, if he were not worthy
the use of it.</p>
            <p>If you know the World perfectly, you
will find in it abundance of Men valuable
for their Talent, and as contemptible for
their failing. Expect not they shou'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
display their good Qualities, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly
cover their Infirmities. You shall
see 'em slight their Vertues, and fondly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
their defects. It rests upon your
Judgment to make a better choice then
themselves, and by your Address, to draw
from 'em that worth, which they cou'd
not easily communicate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:44397:22"/>
For these Ten Years, which I have spent
in a Forreign Country, I have found as
much pleasure, and been as happy in the
enjoyment of Conversation, as if I had been
all the time in <hi>France.</hi> I have met with
Persons of as great Worth as Quality, whose
Society has been the greatest comfort of
my Life. I have known Men as witty as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
I have ever seen, who have join'd the
pleasure of their Friendship to that of
their Company.</p>
            <p>I have known some Ambassadors so
delicate, that it seem'd to me a considerable
loss, whenever the Duty of their Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
suspended the exercise of their more
peculiar Excellencies.</p>
            <p>I have formerly thought that there were
no Man of Honour but in our Court; that
the effeminacy of warmer Climates, and
a kind of Barbarity in the colder, hinder'd
the Natives from being rais'd to this pitch,
except very rarely. But experience has
at length convinc'd me, that there are
such every where, and if I have not disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
it soon enough, it is because it is
difficult for a <hi>French-man</hi> under long
use to relish any but those of his own
Country.</p>
            <p>Every Nation has it's excellence, with
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44397:23"/>
a certain turn proper and peculiar to its
Genious. My Judgement, too much wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to our own Air, rejected as faulty
what was Foreign to us. Because we
see 'em imitate us in the Fashion of things
Exterior, we wou'd impose upon 'em
the imitation of us, even in the Dress of
Vertue too.</p>
            <p>In truth, the grounds of any Essential
Quality, are every where the same; but
we endeavour to fit the Extrinsicks to our
Humour, and those among us that pay
the greatest deference to Reason, must have
with it something to gratifie their Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
            <p>The difference which I find between
the Air of us and other Nations, to speak
ingenuously, is that ours is industriously af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
and that of other Nations impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by Nature, as it were in an indelible
Character.</p>
            <p>In all my life, <hi>I</hi> have never known but
two Persons that were universally tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and those differently. The one had
agreeable Qualities of all sorts; for the
ordinary sort of Men, for the Humorists,
and even for the Fantastical; he seem'd
to have in his Nature, wherewith to
please every body. The other had so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44397:23"/>
rare Accomplishments, that he might
assure himself of esteem where-ever Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
was rever'd. The first cou'd insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
himself, and never fail'd to gain
the Affections. The second was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
morose and fierce, but command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
esteem. To compleat this difference,
a Man gave himself up with pleasure to
the insinuations of the former, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
oftentimes with reluctance to the
worth of the latter. I had a strict
Friendship with 'em both, and can say,
That <hi>I</hi> never saw anything in the one,
but what was agreeable; or in the other,
but what was valuable.</p>
            <p>When I want the company of men of
Conversation, <hi>I</hi> have recourse to the
Learned; and if I meet with Men skilfull
in polite Learning, <hi>I</hi> think my self no
great loser by exchangeing of the delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the present, for that of past Ages.
But there are very few that have a true
Judgment: Polite Learning is by most
Mens management rendered very nause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>Of all the Men <hi>I</hi> ever knew, Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is the most indebted to Mr. <hi>Waller,</hi>
not only for the nicety and fineness of his
apprehension, which he employs to dive,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44397:24"/>
even into the Soul of the Antients for their
true meaning, but likewise for the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his Fancy, with which he embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishes
their Thoughts too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> have seen in few Years abundance of
Criticks, and but few good Judges. I
affect not that sort of Learned Men, that
rack their Brains to restore a Reading,
which is not mended by the Restitution.
The whole Mystery of their Learning
lyes in what we might as well be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of, and what is worth the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they never understand. They never
imagine, never think nicely enough to
taste the delicacy of the Sense, or the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legance
of a Thought. They may serve
well enough for Expositors to Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians;
they drudge the same way, and are
made of the same Lump: but they can
never rightly apprehend any Man of Sense
among the Antients; such a Talent is
diametrically opposite to theirs.</p>
            <p>In History, they neither mind Men, nor
matters; they lay the whole weight on
Cronology; and for the date of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul's
Death, neglect the knowledge of his
Character, or of the Transactions during
his Consulate. <hi>Tully</hi> with them had
been no more then a Compiler of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44397:24"/>
or <hi>Caesar</hi> then a Scribler of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries.
The Consul, the General slip by
'em without notice, the Spirit that ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
their Works is unperceiv'd, and the
principal Matters they treat of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> value infinitely a Critic of Sense, if
the expression may be allow'd. Such is
the excellent Work of <hi>Machiavel</hi> upon the
<hi>Decades</hi> of <hi>Livy;</hi> and such wou'd be the
reflections of Monsieur <hi>de Rohan</hi> upon <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars</hi>
Commentaries, had he peirc'd deeper
into his Designs, and expos'd to a clearer
light the secret Springs of his Conduct.
Notwithstanding, <hi>I</hi> must own that he has
equall'd, if not outreach'd the penetration
of <hi>Machiavel</hi> in his remarks upon the cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
of <hi>Caesar</hi> in the Civil Wars. But
we may see that his own experience
of such Wars, gave abundance of light to
those judicious Observations.</p>
            <p>After the Study of polite Learning
(for which <hi>I</hi> have a more particular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,)
<hi>I</hi> Love the Science of those great
<hi>Lawyers,</hi> who might themselves be Legis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators;
who reascend to that Original Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
that rules Humane Society, that
know what liberty Nature permits in
establisht Governments, and what for the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44397:25"/>
publick Good, easies private Men of the
burthen of Politicks.</p>
            <p>The Conversation of Mr. — affords
these instructions with as much pleasure
as profit. From <hi>Hobbs,</hi> that great geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of <hi>England,</hi> we may receive these shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lights, yet not altogether so true;
for somethings he mistakes, others he
pushes too far.</p>
            <p>Were <hi>Grotius</hi> yet alive, all things might
be Learnt of that universally Learn'd
Man, who is yet more valuable for his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings
than for his Learning. Tho' he
is Dead, his Writings still resolve the
most important difficulties; and were
Justice only regarded, they might be a
standing rule to all Nations in points of
War, and Peace. His Book, <hi>de Iure Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li
&amp; Pacis,</hi> ought to be the chief Study of
Soveraign Princes, their Ministers, and
whoever else have any share in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the People.</p>
            <p>Nay, even the knowledge of that Law
which descends to the affairs of private
Men, ought not to be slighted. But this is
left to the care of the Gentlemen of the <hi>Gown,</hi>
and denied to Princes as a thing below-them,
tho' every moment of their Reign,
they issue out Warrants that extend to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44397:25"/>
the Fortunes, Liberties, and Lives of
their Subjects.</p>
            <p>They are only entertain'd with Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues
about Valour, which is only an
instrument of Destruction, and Discourses
of Liberality, which is but a more regular
method of squandering, unless it is boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by Justice. They ought indeed to
suit the Vertues they preach to the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
of every ones temper: To infuse
Liberality into the Covetous, to spur the
unactive with the thirst of Glory, and
curb, as much as is possible, the ambitious
with the Reins of Justice. But amongst
all the diversity of Tempers, Justice is
still most requisite; for it keeps up order
as well in him that does it, as in them to
whom it is done.</p>
            <p>This is not a constraint that lessens the
power of a Prince, for in doing it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
he learns to do it to himself, and so
it is in him a voluntary act, tho' we neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
receive it from his power.</p>
            <p>I read not in History of any Prince, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Educated then <hi>Cyrus</hi> the great. They
were not contented exactly to inform
him what was Justice in all respects,
but they made him put his Instructions in
Practice as often as occasion was offer'd; so
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44397:26"/>
that they did at the same time imprint
the notions of it on his Mind, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
an habitual Justice in his Soul.</p>
            <p>The Education of <hi>Alexander</hi> was of
somewhat too large an extent: He was
Taught the knowledge of every thing in
Nature, but himself. His ambition af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
diffus'd it self as far as his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and knowing all, he grew desirous
to Conquer all. But he had little or no
method in his Conquests, and abundance
of irregularity in his Life for want of
knowing what he owed to the publick,
to private Men, and to himself.</p>
            <p>No Men Whatsoever can take too ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
a care to make themselves just,
for they have naturally too strong a Biass
the contrary way.</p>
            <p>Justice is the foundation and the Fence
of all Society; without it we should still
be Strowlers, and Vagabonds; our impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuosity
would soon reduce us to our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
confusion, out of which we are
happily extricated, yet instead of chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
acknowledging the benefit, we find
a regret to submit to that happy Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it keeps us in, and still long after that
Fatall Liberty which would be the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of our Lives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:44397:26"/>
When the Scriptures tell us that the
Just are few, it means not in my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that Men are not yet inclin'd to
good Works. But it seems to intimate
how little an Inclination they have to 'em
out of a principle of Justice.</p>
            <p>Indeed were Mens good Actions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,
they would most of em be found
to have their source from the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of some other Vertues. Bounty, Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
and Benevolence are the ordinary
Spring<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from whence they flow: Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
supplies our Neighbours wants; Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality
bestows, and Generosity obliges.
Justice which ought to partake in all, is
laid aside as burthensome; and necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
alone gives it a share in our Actions.</p>
            <p>Nature endeavours to find a kind of
self complaisance in these first qualities,
where we act upon pleasing Motives:
But in this she finds a secret violence,
where anothers Right extorts from us
what we owe, and we only acquit our
selves of our own Obligations, not lay any
upon them by our beneficence.</p>
            <p>It is a secret aversion to Justice that
makes us fonder of giving than returning,
of obliging than acknowledging. Thus
we see the most liberal, generous Men
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44397:27"/>
are not usually the most Just. Justice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
a regularity that bridles 'em, as
being founded on a constant method of
Reason, oppos'd to those natural impulses,
which are the Hinges upon which libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
almost always moves.</p>
            <p>There is something, I know not what,
heroical in great Liberality, as well as in
great Valour; and there is a great Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
between those two Vertues, the one
raises the Soul above the Consideration of
Wealth, as the other beyond the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and desire of Life. But with all
these gay and generous Motives, without
good Conduct, the one becomes ruinous,
and the other Fatal.</p>
            <p>Those whom cross accidents of Fortune
have undone, are pityed by all the World,
because it is a misfortune the Conditions
of Humanity submit us to: But those that
are reduc'd to Misery by vain profusion,
raise more contempt than commiseration;
because it is the Issue of a peculiar Folly,
from which every Man has the good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt
to think himself exempt.</p>
            <p>But besides Nature is always a sufferer
little by compassion, and to relieve her
self of an uneasie thought, She represents
to her self the Folly of the Prodigall, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44397:27"/>
than rest on the prospect of the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.
All things consider'd, it is enough
for private Men to be Benefactors.</p>
            <p>As this ought not to be meerly through
a softness of Nature which lukewarmly
lets go what it has not its strength to
keep; I despise the weakness which
we call ill plac'd Bounty, and hate no
less the vanity of those that never do a
kindness but for the pleasure of boasting
of it.</p>
            <p>There are not so many ungratefull Men,
as there are thought to be; because there
are not so many generous Men as we
imagin. He that in silence suppresses a
favour receiv'd is an unthankful Fellow,
that deserv'd it not. But he that publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
one that he has done, turns it to an
Injury, shewing to your disgrace the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
you had of him.</p>
            <p>I would have an honest Man cautious
of receiving obligations, and sensible of
'em when receiv'd: I would have him
that obliges satisfyed with the generosity
of the Action, and not think of any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
from the Party oblig'd.
When a return is expected, it is no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
liberality; it is a sort of Trade, which
the spirit of Interest wou'd introduce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Favours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:44397:28"/>
'Tis true, there are some persons in
whose nature ingratitude is rooted: Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
is the main ingredient in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position;
with that their Heart their Soul,
and every part is season'd: Then make
no returns to Love, not because they are
hard and insensible, but because they are
ingratefull.</p>
            <p>This ingratitude of the Heart is of all
the kinds of it the most opposite to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.
For a generous Man may be
sometimes necessitated to banish the
thoughts of a past kindness, to ease himself
of the trouble that some Obligations are
apt to give. But Friendship knitts, not
fetters us together; and without some
extraordinary violence to Nature, it is
impossible to resist its tender engaging
Charms.</p>
            <p>The Ingratitude of the Soul is a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
indisposition to acknowledge a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
even without regard to Interest.
Avarice may sometimes suppress an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation,
to avoid the expence of a return.
But pure Ingratitude is without farther
design in it self averse to all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements.</p>
            <p>There is another sort of Ingratitude
founded on a Conceipt of our own worth;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44397:28"/>
our Vanity mistakes services done us, for
dues paid to us.</p>
            <p>The ambition of Liberty has likewise
its ingratitude as well as Vanity. The
only subjection it allows is to the Laws;
out of abhorrence of a dependance, it hates
the memory of Obligations that show a
superiority in the Benefactor. This makes
Republicans ingratefull. They think
that a Diminution of their liberty, which
others impute to their Ingratitude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brutus</hi> thought it meritorious to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
his Obligations to his liberty. All the
kindnesses heap'd on him were converted
to Injuries, when he began to look upon
'em as Fetters. He could kill a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor
that aim'd to be his Master. An
abominable Villany amongst the Patrons
of gratitude. An admirable vertue with
the Sticklers for liberty.</p>
            <p>As there are Men purely ingratefull,
out of a meer sense of ingratitude, so there
are some meerly thankful out of a pure
sense of thankfulness. Their Hearts are
sensible not only of good turns, but even
of good will too; and have of themselves
a propensity to acknowledge all manner
of Obligations.</p>
            <p>There is as great a diversity of thanks,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44397:29"/>
as of ingratitude; there are some poor Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
that think themselves oblig'd by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing, as well as vain Humours that do
so by nothing.</p>
            <p>If self-conceipt has its proud ingrates,
distrust of Merit has its weak thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ones, that take common Justice for
an Obligation.</p>
            <p>This diffidence of themselves gives 'em
an inclination to <hi>subjection,</hi> and that obliges
them to make another sort of acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
These Persons as they are encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd
with liberty, and asham'd of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude,
raise up chimerical Obligations,
to give an honourable colour to their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</p>
            <p>I will not reckon among the grateful,
those poor wretches that think themselves
oblig'd to us for not hurting 'em. They
are not only Slaves, but Slaves that have
not the Courage to hope well. To these
transported Wretches all treatment that
is not rigourous is favourable, and every
thing that is not an injury, they think a
kindness.</p>
            <p>I shall only now consider Court Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments,
which have not so much
respect to the past, as design upon the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
They acknowledge obligations to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44397:29"/>
all that are in any post to oblige; and by
an affected gratitude for favours never
done insinuate themselves into those, in
whose power it is to do 'em, and indus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triously
put themselves in the way of
'em. This trick of thanks as it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
no Vertue, so neither is it a
vice but cunning, which it is lawful to
serve our selves with, and guard our selves
from.</p>
            <p>The great ones in requital have a
trick as artificial to excuse themselves
from doing kindnesses, as the Courtiers
can have to engage 'em to it. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
men with Services never done,
and complain of ingratitude, tho' they
have hardly ever obliged any one, to
draw from hence a specious pretence to
oblige no body.</p>
            <p>But let this affected Gratitude, and
these mysterious Complaints of Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
pass; let us see what is to be
wish'd in the pretences to, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution
of Benefits. I cou'd wish in
the Pretenders more merit than Address,
and in the Disposers more Generosity
than Ofsentation.</p>
            <p>Justice respects every thing in the
distribution of Favours: It regulates the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44397:30"/>
liberality of the Donour, and weighs the
merit of the Receiver.</p>
            <p>Generosity thus circumstantiated is an
admirable Vertue: not so, it is the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Soul truly noble, but ill govern'd;
or of a wild Ostentatious Humour, that
thinks Reason a clogg to it.</p>
            <p>There are so many things to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
in the distribution of kindnesses,
that the safest way is always to observe
strict Justice, and consult Reason equally
about those we make the Objects of 'em.
But even among those that intend strict
Justice, how many are misguided by their
tempers to reward or punish? When we
give way to Insinuation, and yield to
Complement, Self-Love represents to us
as Justice a Lavishness to them that
flatter us; and we reward 'em for the
Artifice they use to deceive our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and prevail upon the imbecility
of our Wills.</p>
            <p>They cheat themselves yet more easily,
that mistake a morose Temper for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to Justice. The itch of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is ingenious in 'em to set an ill gloss
upon every thing. Pleasure with them is
Vice, and Error a Crime. A man must
divest himself of Humanity to escape
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44397:30"/>
their Rigour. Misled by a false Notion
of Vertue, they think they chastise Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals,
while they torment the Misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>If Justice appoints a great Punishment,
(which is sometimes necessary) it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd
to some great Crime, but is
never harsh or rigorous. Severity and
Rigour are no part of it, but spring from
the humour of those persons that execute
it. As these sorts of Punishments flow
from Justice without rigour, so likewise
does Pardon in some cases rather then
from Clemency. To pardon Faults of
Error is but Justice to the failings of our
Nature.</p>
            <p>I might proceed to several other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
of Justice, but it is now high time
to think of Religion, which ought to be
our principal care.</p>
            <p>After the manner that <hi>I</hi> have liv'd in
the World, People will not easily believe
that <hi>I</hi> am very solicitous about Salvation.
Yet <hi>I</hi> can safely aver, that no man e're
thought of the next World with more
Application than my self. 'Tis stupidity
to set up our Rest in a Life that may ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
every moment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:44397:31"/>
Meer Curiosity will make us inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to know what shall become of us af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our Death. We are too dear to our
selves to agree to the irrecoverable loss of
our selves. Self Love secretly opposes the
Notion of annihilation. We are desirous
to exist always, and the Soul as it is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess'd
in its own conversation, improves
this desire we have of receiving some light
into a thing so obscure.</p>
            <p>Yet the Body finding by certain expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
that it must die, and unwilling to
die alone seeks reasons to involve the
Soul in one common State. But the Soul
which knows its Actions are independant
of those Organs, is sensible that it can sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
without 'em. I have called all the
light I could both from the Antients
and Moderns to assist my reflections to
dive into so dark a matter: I have read
all that has been Written on the Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Soul, and after I have done it
with all my attention possible, the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Proof that I find of the Eternity of
my Soul, is my own perpetual desire that
it may be so.</p>
            <p>I wish I had never read <hi>Mousieur Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes's
Meditations:</hi> The great reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that excellent Man among us gave
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44397:31"/>
me some hope of finding that demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
he promises; but there appears
to me rather probability then certainty
in his arguments; and how desirous
soever I was to be convinc'd by his
Reasons, all that I can do in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
or my own, is to rest where I was
before.</p>
            <p>I leave the Study of <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> to
make an enquiry into Religion, and
looking a Book upon that Antiquity of
which I am so fond, I find among the
<hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> nothing more then a
Superstitious Idolatrous Worship, or
politick humane contrivances establish'd
for the Government of Men. It is not
difficult for me to see the advantages
of the Christian Religion over all the
rest; and submitting my self the best
I can with reverence to the Belief of
its Misteries, I leave my Reason to
tast with pleasure the purest, and most
perfect Morality in the World.</p>
            <p>Amidst the diversity of Beleifs that
divide Christianity, the true Catholick
engages me as well by my own free
Election, were <hi>I</hi> yet to choose, as by
the habitual Impression it has long since
made upon me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:44397:32"/>
What we now call Religion is indeed
but a difference in Religion, and
not a different Religion. I rejoyce that
my Faith is more sound then a Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;
yet instead of Hating him for
this difference, I Love him because he
agree's with me in the Fundamentals.
The means at length to agree in the
whole, is always to commuicate in
something. A desire of Reunion can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be inspir'd till the enmity that arises
from division be suppress'd. Men
may seek one another as sociable, but they
never join with their Enemies.</p>
            <p>Besides, the difference of Doctrine in
some points affected in every Sect, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
as it were, a sort of particular Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that distinguishes 'em. The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
tends particularly to the love of God,
and good Works. We look upon this
first Being, as an Object soveraignly ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and tender Souls are touch'd with
the sweet and agreeable impressions it
makes on 'em.</p>
            <p>Good Works follow necessarily from
this Principle; for Love once receiv'd
within, actuates us without, and puts us
upon endeavouring all we can to please
him we love. All we have to fear in this
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44397:32"/>
case is, lest the source of this Love, the
Heart, should be corrupted by the mixture
of any Passion altogather humane.</p>
            <p>It is likewise to be feared, that instead
of obeying the Ordinance of God, we
should frame methods of serving him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our own Fancies. But if this
love be real and pure, nothing in the
world yields that true sweetness and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
            <p>The inward joy of devout Souls rises
from a secret assurance they have of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
agreeable to God; and the true Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications,
and holy Austerities are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but pious Sacrifices of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>The Reformed Religion divests men of
all confidence in merit. The Opinion of
Predestination, which it dares not forgo,
leaves the Mind languid, unmov'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Affection, under prerence of waiting
with submission for the Will of Heaven.
It is Content barely to obey, and seeks not
to please; and in a set common Worship,
makes God the Object rather of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity
than Love.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Calvinists</hi> abstract from Religion
every thing that appears humane, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
its Purity: but in endeavouring to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44397:33"/>
debar Man of what is humane, they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
retrench too much of what is
address'd to God.</p>
            <p>Their dislike of our Ceremonies, makes
'em industrious to refine upon us. Yet
when they have attain'd to this dry nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Purity, they have not so much De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.
Those that are pious among 'em,
raise up a private Spirit, which they think
inspir'd; so much dissatisfied are they
with a Formality that to them seems too
common.</p>
            <p>There are in matters of Worship two
sorts of Humours. The one wou'd be
always adding to, and the other always
retrenching what is established. In
the first, there is a hazard of giving too
much out-side to Religion, and covering
it with so many Exteriors, that the real
ground of it cannot be seen through
'em. In the other, the danger is least
after having cut off all that appears su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous,
Religion it self should be
pared.</p>
            <p>Tho' the Catholicks have abundance
of Ceremonies, yet that hinders not but
that men of understanding may see well
enough through 'em.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:44397:33"/>
The Reform'd use too little, and their
ordinary Worship is not sufficiently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd
from the common Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Life. In places where it is not
tolerated, the difficulty heightens their
disgust, and the Dispute raises a warmth
that animates 'em. Where it rules, it
produces only an exact Compliance, as
the Civil Government, or any other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
might do.</p>
            <p>Good manners among the <hi>Huguenots</hi>
are only the effects of their Faith, and
the Subjects of their Belief. We are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
on both sides, that every Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
is bound to Beleive, and live aright,
but our ways of expressing it differ:
they say that good Works without Faith
are but Dead Works, and we, that
Faith without good Works is but Dead
Faith.</p>
            <p>They that began the Reformation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
us of Corruption and Vice; and
we now object against them our good
Works.</p>
            <p>Those that reproach'd us with ill li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
will now take no other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of us then that of an imaginary
purer Faith. We allow the necessity of
Belief, but Charity was commanded by
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44397:34"/>
Jesus Christ, and the Doctrine of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
is much more plain then that of his
Misteries. Our Faith is obscure, but
our Law is very clearly expressed.
The necessary points of our Faith are
above the apprehension of abundance
of Men, but those of our Duty are suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the capacities of all the World.
In a word, God has given us light e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to do well; and we would serve
with it our curiosity of knowing too
much; and instead of acquiescing in
what he is pleased to discover to us,
we wou'd pry into what he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
from us.</p>
            <p>I know that the contemplation of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
things does sometimes happily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage
us from the World: But it is
frequently no more then meer specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the fruit of a vice very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
to Mankind.</p>
            <p>The immoderate Ambition of knowledge
extends it self beyond Nature even to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into what is most misterious in its
Author, not so much out of a design
to adore him, as out of a vain curiosity
of knowing all things.</p>
            <p>This vice is close followed by another:
curiosity breeds presumption, and we as
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44397:34"/>
boldly define, as we rashly inquire, we erect
a Science of those things that are to us
altogether inconceiveable. So depravedly
do we use the will and understanding. We
proudly aspire to know every thing and
cannot; we may Religiously observe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing and will not: let us be just, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable,
and patient according to the
principles of our Religion, and we shall
know and observe all together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> leave it to our Doctors to refute the
errours of the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> 'tis enough
for me to be perswaded that our opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions
are the sounder. But if rightly
apprehended, <hi>I</hi> dare say the Spirit of
both Religions is differently grounded
on good Principles; only one more
extends the exercise of good Works;
with the other, the cautions to avoid
Evill, take deeper root.</p>
            <p>The Catholick with an active resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Loving industry is perpetually
seeking some new way of pleasing God.
The <hi>Hugenot</hi> with all circumspection and
respect dares not venture beyond a known
Precept, for fear by imaginary novelties
of giving too much sway to his Fancy.</p>
            <p>To be always disputing points of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
is not the means to reunite us.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44397:35"/>
Arguments are inexhaustible, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
will last as long as there are
Men to manage it. But if we wou'd
leave these disputes, that only serve to
exasperate us, and return without passion
to that Spirit that distinguishes us. <hi>I</hi>
think it not impossible to find some ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
in which we may agree.</p>
            <p>Let us Catholiques bridle the restless
Zeal, that makes us act a little too
much of our own Heads. Let the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots</hi>
quit a little their unactive regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and animate their languour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
departing from their submission to
Providence. Let us do somthing in
condescention to them, that they may
return as much in complaisance to us.
Then without thinking of Free will,
or Predestination, we shall frame insens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ibly
a true rule for our actions, which
will be follow'd by that of our opinions.</p>
            <p>If we come to a reconciliation of wills
upon the good conduct of Life, it will soon
produce a good understanding in doctrine.
Let us do what we can to joyn in <hi>good works.</hi>
and we shall not long be of separate <hi>Faiths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> conclude from the little that has
been said, that it is an ill Method of
converting Men, to Attack 'em by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44397:35"/>
their Judgments. A Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
his Notions either as truth, or as
his own; and however it be, he raises
a hundred objections against the Person
that wou'd convince him.</p>
            <p>Nature has given to every one his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Sense, and seems to have engag'd
him to it by a secret fond Iudulgence,
He can submit to the will of another,
tho' he be free: he can own himself infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
in courage and Vertue; but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
a submission to another Mans Sense, is
what he is Scandaliz'd at: And he is most
naturally <hi>averse</hi> to acknowledge a Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority
of Reason in any one whomsoever.</p>
            <p>The chief advantage of humanity is
to be born reasonable, and to hear ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pretend more of it then our selves
gives us the greatest jealousies. If we
Consult the conversions of Antient Times,
we shall find that their Souls were mov'd,
but their Understandings very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd.
The first disposition to receive the
truths of <hi>Christianity</hi> is formed in the Heart.</p>
            <p>Things purely Natural, the Mind may
conceive, and it's knowledge Springs
from it's Relation to the Object. With
supernatural the Soul is taken, it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
it adheres, and unites it self,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44397:36"/>
without ever comprehending 'em.</p>
            <p>Heaven has better prepar'd our Hearts
for the impressions of grace, then our
Understandings for illumination. It's
immensity confounds our narrow Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects.
It's bounty agrees better with
our Love. There is <hi>I</hi> know not what
within us that secretly pleads for a God,
which we cannot comprehend, and
hence it is that to succeed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of Men, we must settle a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
commerce with 'em, by means of
which we may inspire 'em with the
same movements: For in disputes of
Religion the Mind in vain strains it self
to make us see, what we see but too
much. In a sweet and pious familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
it is easie for the Soul to infuse
the same sentiments.</p>
            <p>To consider well the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
wou'd make one think, that God
had depriv'd it of the light of our minds,
that it might turn more upon the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of our Hearts. To Love God and
our Neighbour includes all, says St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
And what is this, but to require a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of Heart as well towards God
as Man? It is to oblige us to do out
of a principle of Love, what the civil
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44397:36"/>
Government enjoyns by rigorous Laws,
and morality requires by a severe order
of Reason.</p>
            <p>Charity makes us relieve and succour,
while Justice forbids us to do wrong.
The one with difficulty hinders <hi>opposition,</hi>
the other with pleasure procures Relief.</p>
            <p>Those that have the true Notions that
our Religion inspires, can't be unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to a Friend or ungrateful to a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor.
With these good sentiments
a Heart innocently Loves these objects
God has made amiable, and the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
of our Love is the most Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and tender.</p>
            <p>Look upon Man in a civil Society,
if Justice be necessary to him, yet 'tis
a restraint. In the State of Nature,
his liberty will have something of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity
in it; and if he govern himself
by morality, his reason is austere. All other
Religions raise in our Minds tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous
Thoughts, and troublesome Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
They erect against Nature su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
Fears, and a furious Zeal:
sometimes to the Sacrificing our Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,
like <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> at other times to
the devoting our selves, like <hi>Decius.</hi>
Only the Christian Religion composes
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44397:37"/>
all our inquietudes; softens all our Feirce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
sets all our tender movements a
going, not only for our Friends and
Neighbours, but for the indifferent,
and even for our Enemies.</p>
            <p>This is the end of the Christian
Religion, and this was once the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of it. If it be otherwise now,
it is because we have let it lose its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
on our Hearts, and given way
to the Encroachments of our Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Hence springs the division of
our minds about Faith, instead of the
Union of our wills in good Works:
so that what ought to be a band of
Charity betwixt Men, is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Subject of their quarrells,
their jealousies, and their ill Nature.</p>
            <p>From this diversity of Opinions has
arisen that of Parties, and the adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to Parties has caused Revolts
and Wars. Many Thousands have
Died in disputing the manner of take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Sacrament, which they have
agreed must be taken. This mischeif
will last till Religion quits the curiosity
of our Minds for the tenderness of our
Hearts, and discourag'd by the Foolish pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of our enquiries, shall return to
the sweet motions of our Love.

            <p>The greatest and most prudent of the
Goddesses favours scandalous Passions,
and lends her assistance to carry on a
Criminal Amour.</p>
            <p>The same Goddess employs all sorts of
Artifice to destroy a small hand-full of
innocent People, who by no means de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
her indignation.</p>
            <p>She thought it not sufficient to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
her power and that of the other

but even corrupts the God of sleep to cast

affairs, that by his Treachery the poor
<hi>Pilot</hi> dropt into the Sea, and there pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished.</p>
            <p>There is not one of these Gods in these
Poems that does not bring the greatest mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
upon Men, and set them on the
most Fatal attempts. Nothing is so Villain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
here below, which is not executed
by their Order, or authoriz'd by their
Example, And this is one of the things
that principally contributed to give Birth
to the Sect of the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to support it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:44397:38"/>
               <hi>Epicurus, Lucretius,</hi> and <hi>Petronius</hi>
wou'd rather make their Gods lazy,
and enjoying their Immortal Nature in
an uninterrupted tranquility, than see
them active, and cruelly employ'd to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb
our Repose.</p>
            <p>Nay, <hi>Epicurus</hi> by doing so, pretended
he show'd his great respect for the Gods;
and from hence proceeded that saying
which <hi>Bacon</hi> so much admire. <hi>Non De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os
vulgi negare profanum, sed vulgi Opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
Diis applicare profanum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I don't mean by this, that we
are oblig'd to discard the Gods out of
our works, and much less from those of
Poetry, where they seem to enter more
Naturally than any where else. <hi>A Iove
principium Musae.</hi> I am for introducing
them as much as any man, but then I wou'd
have them bring their Wisdom, Justice,
and Clemency along with them, and not
appear, as we generally make them, like a
pack of Impostors and Assassins. I wou'd
have them come with a conductto regulate
all matters, and not in a disorder to
confound every thing.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it may be reply'd, that these
extravagancies ought only to pass for
Fables and Fictions, which belong to the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44397:38"/>
jurisdiction of Poetry. But I wou'd fain
know what Art and Science in the World
has the power to exclude good Sense?
If we need only write in Verse to be
priviledged in all extravagancies, for my
part I wou'd never advise any Man to
meddle with Prose, where he must im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
be pointed at for a Coxcomb,
if he leaves good Sense and Reason ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so little behind him.</p>
            <p>I wonder extreamly that the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Poets who were so scrupulous to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
probability in Actions purely Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
violated it after so abominable a
manner when they come to recount the
Actions of the Gods. Even those who
have spoken of their Nature more sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than the rest, cou'd not forbear to
speak extravagantly of their Conduct.</p>
            <p>When they establish their Being, and
their Attributes, they make them Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal,
Infinite, Almighty, Perfectly wise,
and Perfectly good. But at the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they set them a working, there is
no weakness to which they don't subject
them; there is no folly or wickedness
which they don't make them commit.</p>
            <p>We have two common sayings, which
appear to be directly opposite to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44397:39"/>
and yet I look upon both to be true.
The one is, that Poetry is the Language
of the Gods; the other, that there is not
such a Fool in Nature as a Poet.</p>
            <p>Poetry that expresses with force and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
those impetuous <hi>Passions</hi> that disturb
Mankind, that Paints the <hi>Wonders</hi> of the
Universe in lively expressions, does elevate
things purely Natural, as it were above
Nature, by the sublimity of its Thoughts,
and the magnificence of its Discourses,
which may justly enough be called the
Language of the Gods.</p>
            <p>But when Poets come once to quit this
noble Field of Passions and Wonders, to
speak of the Gods, they abandon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the caprice of their own Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
in matters which they do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
and their Heat having no just I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas
to govern it, instead of making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as they vainly believe, wholly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
they are in truth the most extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Sots in the World. It will be no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
matter to be perswaded of the truth
of this Assertion, if we consider that this
absurd and fabulous Theology, is equally
contrary to all Notions of Religion, and
all the Principles of good Sense.</p>
            <p>There have been some Philosophers that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44397:39"/>
have founded Religion upon that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
which Men may have of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
by their Natural reason. There
have been Law givers too that have sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
themselves the Interpreters of the
will of Heaven, to establish a Religious
Worship without any concurrence of
Reason. But to make, as the Poets have
done, a perpetual Commerce, a familiar
Society, and if I may use the expression,
a mixture or hotch potch of Men and
Gods, against Religion and Reason, is
certainly the boldest, and perhaps the most
unaccountable thing that ever was.</p>
            <p>It remains for us to know, whether
the Character of a Poem has virtue to
rectifie that of impiety and folly. Now,
as I take it, we don't give so much pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to the secret force of any Charm. That
which is wicked, is wicked for good and
all; that which is extravagant can be
made good Sense on no respect.</p>
            <p>As for the Reputation of the Poet, it
rectifies nothing any more than the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of the Poem does. Discernment is
a Slave to no body. That which is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
bad, is not a jot the better for
being found in the most celebrated Author:
And that which is just and solid, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44397:40"/>
the worse for coming from an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
hand.</p>
            <p>Amongst a hundred fine and lofty
thoughts, a good Judge will soon discover
an extravagant one, which a great Genius
threw out when it was warm, and which
too strong an imagination was produced
in defiance of good; On the other
hand, in the course of an infinite
number of extravagant things, this same
Judge will admire certain Beauties, where
the Spirit in spight of its impetuosity was
just and regular.</p>
            <p>The elevation of <hi>Homer</hi> and his other
noble Qualities, don't hinder me from tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
notice of the false Character of his
Gods: And that agreeable and judicious
equality of <hi>Virgil,</hi> that pleases all Learn'd
Men, does not conceal from me the least
defects of his <hi>Aeneis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If amongst so many noble things which
affect me in <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to remark what is defective in them;
yet amongst those passages that displease
me in <hi>Lucan</hi> either for being too flat, or
weary me for being too far carried on, I
cannot forbear to please my self in consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the just and true grandeur of his
Heroes. I endeavour to relish every word
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44397:40"/>
in him, when he expresses the secret move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Caesar</hi> at the discovery of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s
Head; and nothing escapes me in
that inimitable Discourse of <hi>Labienus</hi> and
<hi>Cato,</hi> where they debate whether they
shall consult the Oracle of <hi>Iupiter, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
to know the destiny of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth.</p>
            <p>If all the ancient Poets had spoken as
worthily of the Oracles of their Gods, I
should make no scruple to prefer them to
the Divines and Philosophers of our time,
and 'tis a passage that may serve for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
in this matter to all succeeding Poets</p>
            <p>One may see in the concourse of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
People that came to consult the Oracle
of <hi>Ammon,</hi> what effects a publick Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
can produce, where Zeal and Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are mingled together.</p>
            <p>One may see in <hi>Labienus</hi> a pious sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Man, who to his respect for the Gods,
unites the consideration and esteem we
ought to preserve for true Virtue in good
Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cato</hi> is a religious severe Philosopher,
weaned from all vulgar Opinions, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains
those lofty thoughts of the Gods,
which pure undebauched Reason and a
truly elevated Wisdom can attain to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:44397:41"/>
Every thing here is Poetical, every thing
is consonant to Sense and Truth; it is not
Poetical by the ridiculous Air of a Fiction,
or by the extravagance of an Hyperbole,
but by the daring greatness and Majesty
of the Language, and by the noble elevation
of the Discourse. 'Tis thus that Poetry is
the Language of the Gods, and that Poets
are wise. And 'tis so much the greater
wonder to find it in <hi>Lucan,</hi> because it is
neither to be met in <hi>Homer</hi> or <hi>Virgil.</hi>

            <head>OF
RETIREMENT.</head>
            <byline>By Mr. <hi>BROWN.</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>WE see nothing more ordinary with
Old Men than to desire a Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and nothing so rare with them as
not to repent of it when they are once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired.
Their Souls that are in too great a
Subjection to their Humours, are disgusted
with the World for being tiresome, but
scarce can they quit this false Object of
their misfortune, but they are as angry
with solitude as they were with the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44397:41"/>
World, disquieting themselves where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but themselves can give them any
disquiet. This infirmity in some man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is peculiar to Old Age: But 'tis not
impossible for a wise man to preserve
himself from it.</p>
            <p>A wise man that knows what is really
good in every thing, draws all the assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
and agreements which they have,
as well in a Retirement as in Society.</p>
            <p>The essential reason that obliges us to
withdraw our selves out of the World,
when we are Old, is to prevent that
laughter and contempt which Age brings
along with it.</p>
            <p>If we quit the World to good purpose,
we shall still preserve the Idea of that
merit, which we had there. If we tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
too long in it, we shall proclaim our
own defects, and what we are then,
will efface the memory of what we
were. Besides 'tis a shame for a Person
that values his credit to drag about him
the infirmities of Old Age at the Court,
where the end of his Services occasions
that of his interests and merit.</p>
            <p>Nature does redemand us to liberty,
when we have nothing more to hope
from Fortune. Behold what a sense of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44397:42"/>
what the care of our Reputation,
what good Manners, and Nature it self
require from us.</p>
            <p>Nor is this all, for the World has still
a right to demand the same thing of us.
Its Commerce furnished us with pleasure
so long as we were capable of relishing it:
And it would be the highest ingratitude
to be a charge to it, when we can give it
nothing but disgust.</p>
            <p>As for my self, I am fully resolved to
live in a Convent or a Desert, rather
than give my Friends an occasion to pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
me, or to furnish those that are not so,
with a subject for their malicious Mirth
and raillery. But the mischief is, that a
Man is not sensible when he becomes weak
and ridiculous.</p>
            <p>It is not enough to know that we are
wholly worn away, but we ought to be
the first that perceive this declension, and
like prudent Men to prevent the publick
knowledge of this alteration.</p>
            <p>Not that every alteration that Age
brings along with it, ought to inspire us
with the resolution of retiring. 'Tis true,
we lose a great deal by growing Old, but
amongst the losses we sustain, some of
them are recompensed by considerable
advantages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:44397:42"/>
If after I have lost my Passions, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
continue with me still; I shall
find less inquietude in my Pleasures, and
more discretion in the conduct of my Life.</p>
            <p>And in respect of others, if my imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
diminishes, I shall not please so much
sometimes, but I shall be infinitely less im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
for the general part. If I quit all
Company, I shall be less Embarassed. If I
come from large Companies to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
of a few, 'tis because <hi>I</hi> know
how to make the better choice.</p>
            <p>Besides this, 'tis to be considered, that
if we change, we do it amongst People
that change as well as our selves; Men of
equal Infirmities, or at least subject to the
very same And therefore I shall not be at
all ashamed to search in their presence
some relief against the weakness of Age;
nor shall I be afraid to supply by Art what
begins to fail me by Nature.</p>
            <p>The greatest precaution against the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
of time, the nicest management of
a Health that daily becomes more feeble,
cannot scandalize any Men of Sense, and
we ought not to trouble our selves with
those that are not so.</p>
            <p>For to say the Truth, that which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleases
in old People, is not too affected
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44397:43"/>
a care of their own preservation. We
should easily forgive them every thing that
relates to themselves, if they had but the
same consideration for others. But the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
they assume is full of injustice and
indiscretion; for they unadvisedly oppose
the Inclinations even of those that bear the
most with their infirmities. Their long
course of life has untaught them how to
live amongst their fellow Creatures, for
they show nothing but a Spirit of rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
austerity and contradiction to those
very Men, from whom they are so unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
as to exact affability, condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and obedience. All that themselves do,
they imagine to be virtuous, and place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the rank of Vices every thing that
lies out of their power. In a word, as they
are constrained to follow Nature, where
she is tiresome and offensive, they wou'd
by their good will, almost always oppose
themselves to her, where she is sweet and
agreeable.</p>
            <p>'Tis an envious Humour that hates in
other Men the good we possess no longer,
or a temper purely Melancholy, that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
the Mind to find fault with every
thing.</p>
            <p>There is no part of our Life wherein we
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44397:43"/>
ought to Study our own humour with
more application than in Old Age, for it
is never so difficult to be discovered as
then.</p>
            <p>An impetuous Young Fellow has a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
returns, when he his dissatisfied with
his Extravagances: But Old People de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote
themselves to their humours as if it
were a virtue, and take pleasure in their
own defects, because they carry a false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
of commendable Qualities.</p>
            <p>In effect, proportionably as they render
themselves more difficult, they vainly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that they become more Delicate.
They take up an invincible aversion to
pleasure, believing that they are justly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the current of Vice. A serious Air
passes with them for Judgment, Phlegm
for Wisdom, and hence proceeds that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious
authority they allow themselves
to censure every thing. They look upon
Melancholy to supply the place of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
against sin, and gravity of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency.</p>
            <p>The only sure Remedy, when we once
have proceeded so far, is to consult our
reason in the intervalls when she is disen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
from our humour, and if by its as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
we can arrive to the knowledge
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44397:44"/>
of our defects, we ought out of that little
force that remains in us to form a resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of concealing them from the sight of
mankind. 'Tis all that our Wisdom can
do at this juncture to hide them, and it
wou'd be a superfluous labour to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
wholly to get clear of them.</p>
            <p>'Tis at this point of our life that we
ought to assign some time between it and
death, and to chuse a convenient place to
pass it in devotion if possible, at least with
prudence, or with a devotion that gives
us confidence, or with reason that promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
us Repose.</p>
            <p>When our reason, which is so serviceable
for the World, is, if I may use the expression
worn out with long useing, a wise man
forms another out of it to serve him in his
retreat, which of ridiculous Sots, as we
appear to be in Conversation, makes us
truly wise in respect of our selves.</p>
            <p>Of all the retreats that a man can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
make when he is Old, I should infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
prefer that of a Convent to all the
rest, if their rules were less severe, and
mortifying.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain that Old Age shuns a
crowd out of a Delicate and retired Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
that cannot suffer either importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44397:44"/>
or an embarrass; and yet it avoids
solitude with greater diligence, where it is
delivered up to its own black disquietudes,
or to sullen vexatious imaginations. The
only remaining releif against all this is the
Conversation of an honest Society: Now
what society can better agree with it than
a Religious one, where all manner of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
helps are afforded with more Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
than else where, and where their vows
all unite to demand those succours from
Heaven, which cannot reasonably be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from Men? I confess we some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
meet a Religious (As the World calls
them) of inestimable merit, such as
throughly know the vanity of the World
which they quitted. They are your truly
virtuous and truly devout persons, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the Sentiments of Morality by
those of Piety. They live not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
from the Tyranny of their Passions,
but enjoy a most admirable serenity of
Mind. They are more happy in desiring
nothing, than the greatest Monarchs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
earth in possessing all—I cou'd wish
that we had established Societies, where
honest Gentlemen might Commodiously
retire after they have done the publick all
the service they were capable to perform.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44397:45"/>
When they were once entered here, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of a consideration of their future
State, a dislike of the World, or a desire
of tranquillity, which is to succeed the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
agitations of Fortune, they might
taste the delight of a pious retreat, and
the innocent pleasure of an honest and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
Conversation.</p>
            <p>As for my self, <hi>I</hi> wou'd freely retreat to
such a place from the delights of the World
at an Age, when a Man's relish of pleasure
is as it were extinguished; but then <hi>I</hi>
wou'd not be without the Conveniences
of it at this time, when we more sensibly
feel whatsoever incommodes us, as in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
we become more nice in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of what pleases us, or are less tender
in Relation to what affects us.</p>
            <p>These conveniences so desirable in
Old Age ought to be as far removed from
abundance, that occasions disorder, as from
those Anxieties that follow the heels of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity;
and to explain my self more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon this Chapter, I wou'd have a true
frugality rightly manag'd.</p>
            <p>I was formerly acquainted with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
person that had several pleasant
thoughts about this affair. <hi>How happy
might a man live,</hi> said he, <hi>in any Society
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44397:45"/>
where he disarms Fortune of that jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
she pretends to have over him. We sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to this Fortune, our Estates, our repose,
our years, and perhaps unprofitably, and if we
arrive to possess its Favours, we purchase the
short-liv'd Enjoyment, sometimes at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of our liberty, and sometimes of our
Lives. But suppose all our greatness should
continue as long as we lived, yet it would
at least expire with our selves: And what
use of their Grandeur have these great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites
made, who never beheld the course
of their Fortune interrupted? don't they
seem to have acquired this mighty stock of
Glory, and to have heaped these prodigious
Riches for no other end, than to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
more sensible of the torment of being
neither able to quit nor keep them.</hi> These
were his usual Sentiments, and this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
Courtier, whose Conversation
gave the greatest delight imaginable to
his Friends, suffer'd himself to be intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
possest with this train of thoughts,
sometimes judicious, but always serious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> truly acknowledge there is a certain
time when the wisest Action we can do,
is to quit the World; but as fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
as <hi>I</hi> am, of the truth of this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion,
<hi>I</hi> should infinitely sooner be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44397:46"/>
by Nature to my Retirement, than
by my Reason.</p>
            <p>Hence it proceeds, that in the midst of
the World, <hi>I</hi> live after such a fashion as
if <hi>I</hi> were retired out of it. <hi>I</hi> still continue
in it as far as <hi>I</hi> seek what pleases me, and
am still out of it as far as <hi>I</hi> avoid whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
incommodes me there. Every day <hi>I</hi>
steal away from Acquaintances that wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and Conversations that tire me. Every
day <hi>I</hi> establish a sweet Commerce
with my Friends, and find the most sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
pleasure in the delicacy of their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment.</p>
            <p>After my way of living, I neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
a full Society, nor a perfect Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
'Tis only an innocent bringing of
my self to that station which does most
square with my Inclinations. And thus I
possess all those harmless sweetnesses that
are most suitable to the Repose of Old
Age, and are justly fitted for the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what <hi>I</hi> am able to relish agreably.</p>

            <head>A
NOVEL.</head>
            <byline>By another Hand.</byline>
            <p>AT the time that Monsieur <hi>de Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minges</hi>
was Ambassadour from the
most Christian King to the King of Great
<hi>Britain,</hi> there came to <hi>London</hi> a Phisitian,
who called himself an <hi>Irish-man:</hi> This
Person passed for a great Philosopher, and
a mighty performer of Wonders, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the opinion of the Credulous, and
his own perswasion; and the way he made
use of to Cure the Distemper'd, made him
to be suspected in many places for a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician.</p>
            <p>Some Persons of Quality having entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Monsieur <hi>de Comminges</hi> to send for him
to his House in order to see some of his
Prodigies, he was very willing to grant
them that satisfaction, as well through his
Natural curiosity, as his complaisance for
them. Whereupon he sent notice to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44397:47"/>
this pretended Magician, that he should
come to his House.</p>
            <p>Upon the Noise, which was every
where dispersed of this News, the House
of Monsieur <hi>de Comminges</hi> was soon filled
with sick People, who came with a full
assurance of their Cure.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Irish-man</hi> made them wait for him
some time; and after an impatient expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
the Sick and curious saw him ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
with a grave, but simple Countenance,
which carried in it not the least mark of
an Impostor.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Comminges</hi> prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to examine him nicely, hoping to
be well enabled to enlarge himself at his
pleasure upon all that he had read in <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
and <hi>Bodin:</hi> but he could not effect it,
to his great concern: for the crowd became
so troublesome, and the infirm pressed
on so eagerly to be Cured the first, that
they had much a do with Menaces and
even force to regulate their ranks.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Irish</hi> Physitian referred all indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
to Spirits, and all infirmities were,
in his Sense, Possessions.</p>
            <p>The first that was presented to him, was
a man oppressed with Gouts, and certain
Rheumatisms, which it had been impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:44397:48"/>
for him to get Cured of. <hi>Which Our
Wonder-Maker observing, I have seen long
since,</hi> says he, <hi>this sort of Spirits in Ireland.
They are Water-Spirits which bring Coldness,
and excite superfluities of Humours in these
poor Bodies. Thou Evil Spirit, who hast left
the habitation of the Waters to come and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
this miserable Body, I command thee to
abandon thy new abode, and to return to thy
Antient residence.</hi> This being said, the
Sick Man retired; and another supplied
his room, who said he was Tormented
with Melancholly Vapours.</p>
            <p>Indeed, he was one of those who are
ordinarily called Hypocondriacks and sick
of imagination, altho' they are but too
much so in effect. <hi>Airy Spirit,</hi> says the
Irish-man, <hi>return into the Air to exercise thy
Trade in raising of Tempests, and stir up no
more Hurricanes in this sad and miserable
Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This sick person gave way to another
who was disturbed, according to the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Physitian, with a simple Hobgob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,
which would not have force enough to
withstand his discourse a moment. He sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
that he had sufficiently observed him
by certain Marks, which did not appear to
us; and smiling upon the Assembly. This
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:44397:48"/>
sort of Spirit, <hi>says he,</hi> are seldom trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
and almost always diverting.</p>
            <p>In short, he pretended he was ignorant
of nothing in matter of Spirits. He was
acquainted with their Number, their
Ranks, their Names, their Employments,
and all the Functions to which they were
destined; and he made a familiar boast of
understanding the Intrigues of Demons,
much better than the affairs of Men.</p>
            <p>You cannot imagin what Reputation
he gain'd in a very little time. Catholicks
and Protestants came to him from all
parts; and you would have said that the
power of Heaven was lodged in the hands
of this Man, when an unexpected Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
destroyed the wonderful Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the Publick entertain'd of him.</p>
            <p>A Man and Woman of the Country,
who were Married together, came to
seek some relief in his Miracle-working
Virtue against certain Spirits of Discord,
<hi>said they,</hi> which disturbed their Marriage,
and ruined the peace of the Family.</p>
            <p>It was a good Gentleman, aged about
45 years, who look'd like one of Estate
and Quality. Methinks <hi>I</hi> have the Lady
before my Eyes. She was about 30 years
old, and seemed to be of a goodly make;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44397:49"/>
but one might already see in her face, that
there had been formerly more Delicacy in
the Features of her Beauty. I have Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the Husband first by reason of the
dignity of his rank; yet the Wife would
speak first, whether it was because she
believ'd her self to be more tormented
with her Spirit, or that she was only pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with that Ambition of talking, which
is natural to her Sex.</p>
            <p>I have a Husband, <hi>said she,</hi> who is one of
the best Men of the World, to whom I give
a thousand disquiets, and who gives me no
less in his turn. My intention would be
to live comfortably with, and I should
always do so, if a strange Spirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
I feel my self possessed at certain
times, did not render me so fierce, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable,
that it is not possible to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
me: After these Agitations are cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
I return to my natural good humour,
I then forget no care, nor no agreement
that conduces to the obliging of my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:
But his Demon possesses him,
when mine forsakes me; and this Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
who has so much patience for my
Transports, has nothing but fury for my
Reason. And alas! <hi>I</hi> have no less to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
from him, than he from me. Here
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44397:49"/>
stopt a Woman in all appearance sincere e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough,
and the Husband, who was no
less, began his discourse as follows.</p>
            <p>Whatsoever reason I have to complain
of my Wive's Devil, I am however
under an Obligation to him, in that he
has not taught her to lye; and I must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that she has said nothing but
what is very true. All the time she ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to me to be in agitation I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
but as soon as her Spirit leaves her
in peace, mine Torments me in its turn;
and with a new Courage, and new forces,
which I find myself stirred up with, I make
her discern with all possible vigour the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
of a Wife, and the superiority of
a Husband. Thus our lives pass either in
committing or enduring mischeif: Which
renders us in a worse condition, than the
most miserable. Behold our Torments,
Sir; and if it be possible that you should
know a Remedy, I conjure you to be our
Deliverer. The cure of a Distemper so
strange as this of ours, will procure you
no inconsiderable Honour.</p>
            <p>These are neither Hobgoblins, nor Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
said the <hi>Irish-man,</hi> they are Spirits of
the first order, and of the Legion of <hi>Lucifer:</hi>
Proud Demons, great Enemies to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:44397:50"/>
and very hard to expell. You will
not take it amiss, Gentlemen, <hi>pursued he,</hi>
turning to the Assembly, that I examine
my Books a little; for I have occasion for
words that are not of the common stamp.
Thereupon he with drew into a Closet, in
order to turn over his Books and Papers; and
after having made use of a hundred forms,
as too weak against such powerful Enemies,
he fell at last upon one, that was capable
in his opinion, of confounding and expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
all the Devils in Hell.</p>
            <p>The first effect of the conjuration was
upon himself; for his Eyes began to rowl in
his Head, with so many <hi>Grimaces</hi> &amp; <hi>Convulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
that he might very well appear distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to those who came to seek his assistance.</p>
            <p>After having turned his Staring Eyes
on all sides, he fixed them at length upon
this Virtuous Couple, and striking both of
them with a Wand, which was not
without Vertue: Be gone, Devils, <hi>says he,</hi>
go ye Spirits of dissension, and exercise dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
in Hell, and by your departure let
that happy Union be re-established, which
you have impiously broken. Then he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
softly to the Ears of the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Possessed, and raising a little the tone
of his voice, I hear you murmur Devils,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44397:50"/>
at the obedience which ye are forced to
render me: But were ye to burst with mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
ye must be gone. Depart, depart,
and you my Friends, go and enjoy that
repose, which ye have been deprived of
so long. It is sufficient, Gentlemen, I
protest to you that I am all in a Sweat
with the Labour, which the opposition of
these obstinate Devils has given me. I Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
I have had to do with two Thousand
Spirits in my life time, who all together
have not given me so much pain and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as these. Which being done, the <hi>Irish-man</hi>
retired, and all the company went out of the
House, and our good People returned to
their Lodgings, with a satisfaction more
wonderfull, than the Prodigy which had
been effected in their Favour.</p>
            <p>When they were come home, every
thing appeared agreeable to them by this
new alteration of mind, which created a
strange severity in their <hi>Senses</hi> They found a
smiling Air in all things; they lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
themselves with pleasure, and were
not wanting in sweet and tender words to
express their Love. But, vain delights,
how little dependence is there upon your
duration! and how unseasonably do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
rejoyce, that are born to Misfortunes,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:44397:51"/>
when they obtain a small happiness.</p>
            <p>Such was their tranquillity, when a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of their acquaintance came to express
to them the general joy of the Town for
their Cure.</p>
            <p>They answered this civility with all
the discretion in the World; and the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Complements on this occasion being
made and returned, the Husband began a
very pertinent Conversation upon the
happy condition they were in, after so
long a train of miseries. Our Wife, either
to cause a greater admiration of these won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
or else to please her own malicious
humour, enlarged her self with satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
upon the tricks which her Devil
had suggested to her, to torment her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
Upon which the Husband jealous
of the honour of this Devil, or at least, of
his own authority, gave her to understand,
That she talked too much of things past,
the remembrance whereof was irksom to
him. He added that in the state wherein
they found themselves re-established, she
ought to think of nothing else, but that
obedience, which a Wife ows to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
as he would only consider on his side,
how to make a lawful use of his priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
in order to make their condition as
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:44397:51"/>
happy for the future, as it had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
hitherto.</p>
            <p>Our Wife being offended at the word
<hi>Obedience,</hi> but especially at the cruel
injunction to be silent, forgot no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that might serve to prove an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in Marriage, saying; <hi>That the Devils
were not at such a distance, but they might be
recalled, in case this equality was violated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Lady above mentioned, who
was as discreet and judicious as any of her
Sex, wisely represented to her the duty
of Wives, not forgetting the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
and good management, whereto Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
were obliged. But her Reason in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of composing, did but incense her
the more, and she became more insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
than before. You are in the
right, dear Wise, <hi>replyed the Husband,</hi> the
Devils were not gone so far, but they
might be recalled; or rather, you have
been so kind to yours, that he was resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to continue with you, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the command which was given
him to leave you. I am too weak of
my self to be concerned alone with you
and him; which obliges me to retire, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
as I am to such dangerous Forces. And
I likewise retire, <hi>say she,</hi> with this Spirit,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44397:52"/>
that will not abandon me. He must be a
very ill humour'd, damn'd sort of a Devil
indeed, if he is not more tractable than so
troublesome and so cursed a Husband.
Then turning towards her Friend. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I go, <hi>said she to her,</hi> I am glad I
have an occasion, Madam, to tell you
with freedom, that I expected quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Treatment from your Friendship, and
that you have forgot the interest which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
you, to take a Wives part against the
violence of her Husband. 'Tis a very strange
thing to see my self run down by one that
should support me. Adieu, Madam, adieu;
your visits do me a great deal of honour, but
one may very well dispense with them,
if they do no more good than this.</p>
            <p>This good, but too discreet Lady was
extreamly amaz'd; instructed by her own
experience, that even Wisdom has its
excess, and that for the most part one
makes an ill use of ones Reason with those
who have none.</p>
            <p>You may judge that she did not stay
long alone in a House, where nothing
was talked of but Devils, and nothing
done but what was of the highest pitch
of extravagance. The Husband passed the
rest of the day and all the Night in his
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:44397:52"/>
Chamber, ashamed of the short-liv'd joy
he had received, vexed at the present
state of his Affairs, and reflecting upon
what might happen to him from this sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
return of his Wives distemper, with
great anxiety of Mind.</p>
            <p>As the agitation of the Wife had been
much greater, so it remain'd not so long;
so that return'd soon to her Senses, she
made sad reflections upon the loss of those
Pleasures, whereof she found her self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd.
There are certain tempers in the
World, that after a few moments come to
themselves again, and demand of their
Reason why they should sacrifice their
Interest and their pleasure to a foolish Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Contention that does them no good
at all. This consideration that sometimes
prevails with Women, and chiefly a
Nights when they cannot sleep, had its
desired effect upon our Lady, in so much
that resigning her self up purely to the
Conduct of Nature, she awaked her
Husband as soon as it was day, designing
to ascribe all past disorders to a strange
power, which was neither Natural nor
Human.</p>
            <p>I know, <hi>said she,</hi> in the lucid interval
I enjoy at present, that our Spirits did
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:44397:53"/>
not surrender themseves at the command
of the <hi>Irish-Man;</hi> and if you believe me,
my dear, but too unhappy Husband, we
will return and ask him for a stronger and
more effectual Charm.</p>
            <p>The poor Husband oppressed with
grief, as he was, and fainting under the
severity of his destiny, judge if he were
not very glad to find so unexpected
a calm, and tenderly affected with
this amorous return of his Spouses
submission: Let us bemoan, my Dear,
<hi>says he to her,</hi> let us bemoan our common
misfortunes, and go a second time to
search a remedy, which the first could not
give us.</p>
            <p>The Wife was agreably surprised at
this discourse; for instead of a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Demon whose insults she expected,
she happily found a Man tender and
compassionate, who gave her Comfort
for the Evil she had done him.</p>
            <p>They spent an hour or two in inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
one another with a mutual confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and after having placed all
their hopes in the vertue of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician;
they returned to the House of
Monsieur de <hi>Comminges,</hi> in order to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:44397:53"/>
seek a more powerful releif, than that
which they had experienc'd before.</p>
            <p>Scarce were they entered into the
House, but the <hi>Irish-man</hi> perceived them,
and calling them pretty loud that he might
be heard of all the Company, Come, <hi>says he
to them,</hi> and Publish the Wonders which are
effected in you, and make an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to that all Puissant Virtue, which has
Delivered you from that miserable slavery
under which ye groaned.</p>
            <p>The Wife immediately replied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
consulting, that instead of the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
he demanded, they were ready to give
him a very fine one of the obstinacy of the
Devils, and not of his skill. For in truth,
venerable Father, <hi>added she,</hi> since your fine
Operation they have Tormented us, as it
were out of spite, more violently than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>You are incredulous (<hi>cried out the
good Irish-man in a wonderful passion,</hi>) or
at least ungrateful, who maliciously deny
those benefits ye have received. Approach
hither, approach; that I may convict you
both of incredulity, or Malice.</p>
            <p>When they were come near, he nicely
examined all the lines of their Faces. He
particularly observed their Looks, and as
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:44397:54"/>
if he had discovered in the Apple of their
Eyes some impression of these Spirits; ye
are in the right, <hi>says he, all amaz'd,</hi> ye are
in the right, they are not yet dislodg'd.
They were too deeply rooted in your Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
but they shall hold fast indeed, if I
don't turn them out by the Virtue of
a few words I am going to pronounce.</p>
            <p>Leave, curst Race, an Habitation of
Repose too sweet for you, and go and
rave for ever in places where dwell Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
Madness, and Despair.</p>
            <p>'Tis done, my Friends, ye are most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
Delivered: But return no more, I
intreat ye. I owe my time to all the
World, and ye have had as much of it as
ye ought to have.</p>
            <p>Now our Patients supposed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
at the end of all their Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes:
This day seemed to them as it
were the first of their Marriage, and the
Night was expected with the same impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
as that of their Nuptials had been
formerly. This Night so much desired
came, but Alas! how ill did it answer
their desires?</p>
            <p>Too much Love causes the shame of
Lovers, and I leave to the imagination of
the Reader the great confusion of an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:44397:54"/>
               <l>Where excess of desire,</l>
               <l>Does extinguish the fire.</l>
            </q>
            <p>'T was happy for the Husband, that
the Wife accused the Devils that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent;
But our Physitian, somuch cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
abroad, was no more in her esteem
than a poor <hi>Irish-man,</hi> who had not skill
enough to conjure down an <hi>Ignis Fatuus.</hi>
Sometimes she imputed to her self this
non-performance of her Husband, after
the Examples of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Women, who
attribute to themselves, in these occasions,
the failings of their Lovers, in regard of
a perswasion they have, that the force of
their Charms ought neither to submit to
the infirmity of Nature, nor to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Witch-craft.</p>
            <p>Thus the Wife, who accused the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
in every thing else, when he was
most innocent, justifies him when he was
most deficient in Family-Duties, choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
rather to impute a Want of Love in
him, to a want of Charms in her self, than
to impute it to a real defect, which
would prove eternally destructive of her
Pleasures. But as a Lady doth not willingly
entertain a thought that hurts the Interest
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44397:55"/>
of her Beauty; she immediately recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in her mind the Malice of the Devils,
and turn'd her confusion into Anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Irish</hi> Man, who had not been
expert enough to cure them.</p>
            <p>It is a long time, <hi>said she blunty, and as
if she had been inspir'd,</hi> it is a long time
since the simplicity of the <hi>Irish</hi> Man has
amus'd us, and I know very well, that we
shall expect in vain our deliverance from
him. But it is not enough to be undecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
justice obliges us to undeceive others
as well as our selves, and to make known
to the World, the vanity of these Quacks.</p>
            <p>Sweet-heart, <hi>replyed the Husband,</hi> 'tis
undoubtedly true, that the misfortune of
this Night is the pure malice of our Devils.
The <hi>Irishman</hi> had a mind to laugh at them,
but they were resolved to ridicule him and
us in their turn. You know me, and I know
my self; such a strange Impotence cou'd
not naturally happen, and behold
how strangely Conjuration has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
upon us. As for the rest, Sweet-heart,
when you shall make your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
to this fine Physician, take care
that you descend not to any particulars of
this nature; and that you let nothing
slip, I beseech you, which may tend to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:44397:55"/>
our shame. All Family secrets ought to
be concealed: But this in a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
manner than any other.</p>
            <p>The Wife was ready to be offended
upon seeing her self suspected of such an
indiscretion: But not to embroil things
anew, that were tending to a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,
she promis'd so to manage
her self, that the <hi>Irish Man</hi> alone
should find fault with her proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>We usually seek the Night to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
our shame, but the day here appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to disperse it; and these unhappy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who were not yet well recovered of
their Misfortune, got up with the Sun,
who enlivens all things, in hopes of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
success for the time to come.</p>
            <p>They rose out of their Bed with more
tranquillity, than they had remained
there, and after a small Break-fast and a
little Conversation to fortify their Bodies,
and reconcile their Minds, they went in
peace and good Union towards the House,
where they had been twice with Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and from whence they had twice
returned without any relief. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
advice there, that the <hi>Irish-man</hi> was
gone to St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s to perform some Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44397:56"/>
there, at the instance of Monsieur
<hi>d' Aubigny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was the same Monsieur <hi>d' Aubigny</hi> so
well known of all the World, for the most
agreeable Man that ever was. Behold
then some of the Prodigies which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked
at St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s with less credulity
than the Multitude, and less prejudice
than Monsieur <hi>d' Aubigny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Already did the Blind suppose they saw
that light they did not see; already did
the Deaf imagine they heard, and heard
not; the Lame already thought they were
grown well, and the impotent resumed in
imagination the first use of all their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
A strong Idea of Health had made
the Sick forget their Distempers; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination
which was no less active in the
curious, than in the Sick, gave the first, a
false prospect out of a desire of seeing,
as it did a false Cure to the second, out of a
desire of being Cured.</p>
            <p>Such was the power of the <hi>Irish-man</hi>
upon our minds: Such was the force of
our Minds upon our Senses. Thus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was the Subject, but Prodigies; and
these Prodigies came from so great an
Authority, that the astonished multitude
receiv'd them with submission, whilst
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44397:56"/>
some more knowing Persons durst not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
them by their knowledge.</p>
            <p>A Timerous and slavish know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
always pays respect to an imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Authoriz'd Errour: The Soul
was feeble, where the understanding was
sound; and they, who saw best in their i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginary
Cures, were afraid to declare
their real Sentiments amongst a prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and Inchanted people.</p>
            <p>Such was the triumph of the <hi>Irish-man,</hi>
when our Couple couragiously broke
through the crowd in order to come and
insult over him in all his Majesty. Art
not thou ashamed, <hi>said the Wife to him,</hi> to
abuse the simple and credulous People as
thou dost, by the ostentation of a power,
which thou never didst enjoy? Thou
hast directed our Devils to leave us in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and they have only Tormented us
the more. Thou hast commanded them
to go out, and they persist to remain not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
thy orders, equally deriding
our sottish credulity, and thy ineffectual
impotence.</p>
            <p>The Husband continued the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
with the same contempt, so far
as to refuse him the name of Impostor,
because there was need of Capacity, <hi>said
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:44397:57"/>
he,</hi> for an Impostor, and this miserable
wretch had none.</p>
            <p>The Physician lost his Speech in losing
the Authority which made him venerable;
and this formidable Power, establish'd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in a superstitious Subjection of Spirits,
came to nothing, so soon as there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
persons bold enough to disown it; sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd,
nonplust, confounded, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,
and went out at the Back-door.</p>
            <p>His confusion extreamly mortified the
Assembly; there being nothing that the
mind of Man receives with so much sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
as the opinion of Miraculous
things, nor leaves with more difficulty
and concern.</p>
            <p>As for Monsieur <hi>d' Aubigny,</hi> he soon plac'd
this Physician in the rank of others, whom
he had tryed; being resolved for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to keep to those of the Country,
without an ambition to make use of
New Comers, meerly because they were
Strangers.</p>
            <p>All the company retired, ashamed of
their easiness to be abus'd, and yet vexed
at the loss of their Error. Our married
couple, glorious and Triumphant, enjoyed
the pleasures of Victory, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thoughts of the Devils; and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44397:57"/>
               <hi>d' Aubigny,</hi> who passed from one O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
to another, with an incredible fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility,
quitted his former belief of our
Miracle-monger, to give himself the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of laughing with me, at what had
happen'd.</p>
            <p>At my breaking out into a sudden fit of
laughter, the Husband turned his Head
towards us, and perceiving Mr. <hi>d' Aubig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
he came civilly to excuse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for what he had done at his
House, without asking his permission.
Mr. <hi>d' Aubigny</hi> replyed to him very civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
giving him thanks not only for having
disabused the publick, but also for having
undeceiv'd himself in particular.</p>
            <p>The Wife immediately took her part
in the Conversation, which did not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it less agreeable; for altho' she was
really extravagant, yet it was a sort of
extravagance which did not proceed so
much from her Mind, as from her Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour:
But now she took care to conceal
it; and we talk'd of nothing but mirth
and pleasantry, when Mr. <hi>d' Aubigny</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
them with the the gravest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
in the World, which I little expected.</p>
            <p>I am a person of an acknowledging
temper, <hi>said he to them,</hi> and I should be
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:44397:58"/>
ungrateful, if I did not draw you from
your Error, after the obligation I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to you for having drawn me from
mine. Is it possible that ye should have
Devils in reality? As if it was not enough
for your own Minds to torment ye, and
that there must be something else, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
a long Marriage, to afford ye that
trouble, which has harrassed you this
pretty while. There is no Man, but is
sometimes at a loss with himself. The
wisest are weary of themselves after they
have been weary of others. And would ye
have a Husband and Wife, who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
always of different minds, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
humours, be able to live eternally
together without disgust, without offence,
and without disputes? Believe me, Sir,
of a hundred married couple, fourscore
and ten at least are possessed, after your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,
but without any intervening of the
Devil. The only difference I find between
you is, that they suffer their misfortunes
with patience, and conceal them with
discretion, whereas you importune Heaven
and Hell for yours, in accusing Demons
that are innocent of your unhappiness,
and in going to seek a supernatural assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
when there is no occasion for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:44397:58"/>
That which was a great Prodigy, was
the alteration of the Mind of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
and Wife upon the Discourse of
Mr. <hi>d' Aubigny;</hi> they look'd upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with astonishment, asham'd of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been their own Devils, and to find
nothing of Possession, but the contrariety
of their Humours.</p>
            <p>The Husband was the first who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
from his confusion to give a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
thanks to Mr. <hi>d'Aubigny,</hi> for having
given them the true knowledge of their
misfortune. But, <hi>replyed the Wife,</hi> doth
this knowledge make us e're the less un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy?
And have we not as much need
of a remedy against the torment of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
as we supposed we had against that
of the Devils?</p>
            <p>When I observed Mr. <hi>d' Aubigny</hi> just
ready to say something pleasant upon a
Subject that was sufficiently so; I had a
mind to preserve to him the merit of a
gravity, which was not ordinary with
him. Whereupon I immediately took
up the Discourse.</p>
            <p>Of all the Remedies one can seek against
a troublesome Marriage, I know none, <hi>said
I to them,</hi> more sure, nor more wisely
practised, than that of believing ones self
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44397:59"/>
more happy than others; and to remain in
this Error, in case one is mistaken in it,
you will like an English Proverb, better
than all the Reasons I can alledge to you.
<q>He that lives in this World without being
deceived, is an unhappy Man.</q> To see, Sirs,
how far the pleasure of Deceit goes, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of your Enemies makes himself agreeable,
when he imposes upon ye; and the best of
your Friends seldom undeceive ye, but you are
offended at it.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>d' Aubigny,</hi> weary of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
was now minded to end the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;
and after the usual civilities at
parting, every one returned to his home,
extreamly well satisfied.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>d' Aubigny</hi> had afterwards a very
particular Conference with the Woman,
and in spite of the Rules of Marriage,
she told him all that happen'd during
their imaginary Possession.</p>

         <div type="letter">
            <pb n="117" facs="tcp:44397:59"/>
            <head>A
LETTER
To Monsieur D'OLONNE.</head>
            <byline>By the same Hand.</byline>
            <p>AS soon as I heard of your disgrace, I
gave my self the honour of write<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to you, in order to testify my great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
for you; and I write to you at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to let you know that you ought at
least to avoid so troublesome a Companion
as Melancholy is, at a time when it is not
in your power to relish any joy.</p>
            <p>If such valuable commodities, as Men
of good Sense are to be had in the place
where you are, their Conversation may in
some manner repair the loss of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondences
you have quitted. And if
you find none there, Books and good chear
may be a great assistance to you, and give
no ordinary consolation.</p>
            <p>I speak to you like a Master that designs
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:44397:60"/>
to prescribe Lessons: not that I presume
much upon the force of my Reasoning,
but I fancy I have some right to assume
an Authority over persons that are Unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,
by the long experience I have had
of Misfortunes and unhappy Revolutions.</p>
            <p>Amongst the Books you are to choose
for your entertainment in the Country,
apply your self principally to those that
strike in with your humour by their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements,
rather than those that pretend
to fortify your Mind by Arguments and
Reasons. The last engage with your Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper,
which is always done at the
expence of the person, in whom this
troublesome Scene is Acted; The first
makes it to be forgotten, and it is no hard
matter to make a sentiment of Joy suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to an obliterated Grief.</p>
            <p>Systems of Morality are only proper to
set the Conscience in good order, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve
it from confusion; and I have seen
several grave and composed Men come out
of its School, who were not over-stocked
with the Rules of a prudent behaviour.</p>
            <p>Your true Men of Sense need not hunt
Books to read these Lessons, but only to
make Lessons for themselves; for
as they know what's good by the singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:44397:60"/>
exactness of their Taste, so they are
disposed to it by their own voluntary
motion. Not but that there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
occasions, wherein such assistances
are not to be rejected; but where it is
a Man's fortune to have need of its aid,
he may easily deliver himself from these
perplexities. If you were reduced to the
necessity of having your Veins opened,
I would permit you to read <hi>Seneca,</hi> and
to imitate him: Yet would I choose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to fall into the carelessness of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronius,</hi>
than to study for a constancy
which is not obtain'd without a great
deal of difficulty.</p>
            <p>If you were of a humour to devote your
self for your Country; I would advise
you to read nothing else but the lives of
those <hi>Romans,</hi> who courted a glorious
Death for the good of their Nation: But
considering your present Circumstances, <hi>I</hi>
think you lie under an Obligation to live
for your self, and to spend the remainder
of your life as agreeably as you can.</p>
            <p>Now things being in this scituation,
leave off all study of Wisdom, which
doth not contribute to the lessening of
your troubles, or to the regaining of your
Pleasures. You will seek for Constancy
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44397:61"/>
in <hi>Seneca,</hi> and you will find nothing in
him but severity. <hi>Plutarch</hi> will be less
troublesome, however he will make you
grave and serious, rather than sedate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montagne</hi> will instruct you better in
what relates to Man, than any other. But
after all, this rational Tool, this Man with
all his mighty stock of knowledge, which is
usefull indeed in good Fortune to teach
him moderation, has nothing but sad and
afflicting Thoughts, which serve to deject
him in the bad.</p>
            <p>Let not the unhappy then seek in Books
to be disturbed at Our Miseries, but to
rejoyce at Our follies. For this reason
you will prefer the Reading of <hi>Lucian,
Petronius,</hi> and <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> before that
of <hi>Seneca, Plutarch,</hi> and <hi>Montagne.</hi> But
I recommend to you <hi>Don Quixot</hi> above
all. What pressure soe're of affliction
you have, the fineness of his ridicule
will insensibly conduct you to the taste
of Joy.</p>
            <p>You will tell me perhaps, that I am
not of so pleasant and easie a humour in
my own Misfortunes, as I appear to be
in yours; and that it is indecent for a
Man to afford all his concern to his own
unhappiness, when at the same time he
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:44397:61"/>
preserves an indifference, nay, and even
a gayety for the misfortune of his Friends.
I should agree with you in that respect,
if I behaved my self so: But I can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
to you with reality, that I am not
less concerned at your Exile than your
self; and the joy which <hi>I</hi> advise you to,
is in order to have a share of it my self,
when I shall see you capable of receiving
any.</p>
            <p>As for what relates to my Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
if <hi>I</hi> have formerly appeared to
you more afflicted under them, than I
seem to you at present, it is not that I
was so in effect. <hi>I</hi> was of opinion that
disgraces exacted from us the decorum
of a Melancholy Air; and that this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
Mortification was a respect we
owe to the will of Superiors, who sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
think fit to punish us without a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to afflict us. But then you are to
know, that under this sad out-side and
Mortified Countenance, I gave my
self all the satisfaction I could find in my
self; and all the Pleasure <hi>I</hi> could take in the
correspondence of my Friends.</p>
            <p>After having found the vanity of that
grave temper we learn from Morality,
I should be ridiculous my self, if I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:44397:62"/>
so serious a discourse; upon this
score I shall quit the Subject, and give
you some Counsels that shall be less trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome,
than Instructions.</p>
            <p>Adapt, as much as possibly you can,
your Palate and Appetite to your Health;
'tis a great secret to be able to reconcile
the agreeable and the necessary in
two things, which have been almost
always repugnant and opposite.</p>
            <p>Yet after all, to arrive to this great
secret, or mistery, we want nothing but
Sobriety and Judgment; and what ought
not a sensible man to do, that he may
learn to chuse those delicious Dishes
at his Meals, which will keep both his
Mind and Body in a good disposition
all the remainder of the Day?</p>
            <p>A man may be Sober without being
Delicate; but he can never be Delicate
without being Sober. Happy is the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that enjoys both these qualities to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether!
He doth not separate his Diet
from his Pleasure.</p>
            <p>Spare no cost to obtain the Wines of
<hi>Champagne,</hi> were you 200 Leagues from
<hi>Paris.</hi> Those of <hi>Burgundy</hi> have lost all
their credit with Men of good taste, and
scarce do they preserve a small remainder
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:44397:62"/>
of their old Reputation with the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants.</p>
            <p>There is no Province that affords ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Wines for all Seasons, but <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne.</hi>
It furnishes us with the Wine of
<hi>Ay, Avenet, Douillé</hi> till Spring; <hi>Tessy, Selle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
for the rest of the Year.</p>
            <p>If you demand of me which of all these
Wines I prefer, without falling into the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
tastes, which are introduced by those
who have a false sense of delicacy; <hi>I</hi> will
affirm to you that the good Wine of <hi>Ay</hi>
is the most natural of all Wines, the
most wholsome, the most extracted from
all Terrene smell, and of the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
agreeableness, in regard of its
Peach-taste which is peculiar to it, and
is in my opinion, the chief of all tastes.</p>
            <p>L. X. C. V. F. I. and H. VIII. had each
of them their several Houses in <hi>Ay,</hi> in
order to the more curious making of their
Wines. Amongst the greatest affairs of the
World, which those Princes were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to disentangle, it was not the least
of their cares to have some of the Wine
of <hi>Ay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Express but little curiosity for extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<hi>dishes,</hi> and show much choice in what
may be obtained with convenience. A good
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:44397:63"/>
wholsome, natural Pottage, which
is neither too high nor too little
seasoned, nor too much Jelly is to be
preferred for common use before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as well for the exactness of its
taste, as for the advantage of its use.</p>
            <p>Mutton tender and juicy, good suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Veal, white and curious; your Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door
Fowls, your fat Quail taken in the
Country, your Pheasant, Partridge, and
Rabbet, all which have an agreeable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
in their taste, are the true Meats
which are able to furnish your Table all
the different Seasons of the Year. Your
<hi>Wood-Hen</hi> particularly, is estimable for its
excellency, but is not to be sought after
where you are, or where I am, because of
its great rarity.</p>
            <p>If an indispensible necessity obliges
you to dine with some of your Neighbours,
who shall have excused themselves from
the <hi>Arrier-ban</hi> either by their Money, or
their address, you may commend the Hare,
the Stag, the Roe-Buck, the Wild-boar,
but eat none of them: Let Dogs,
and nets partake of the same praises.
Of all Black-Meats, the Snipe alone
is to be commended, in Favour of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:44397:63"/>
its taste, though it is somewhat prejudicial
to Health.</p>
            <p>Let all mixtures and Kitchin-compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
called <hi>Ragoo</hi>'s, or Out-works, pass
with you for a sort of Poison. If you
eat but a little of them, they will do you
but a little harm; If you eat a great
deal, it's impossible but their Pepper,
their Vinegar, and their Onions must
Ruine your taste at last, and soon cause
an alteration in your Health.</p>
            <p>Your Sauces, if you make them as
simple and plain as is possible, can do
no great harm.</p>
            <p>Salt and Orange are the most Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and most natural Seasonings.</p>
            <p>Fine Herbs are wholsomer, and have
something in them more exquisite than
Spices; but they are not equally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
in all things. One must employ them
with Judgment in Meats where they
are most agreeable; and distribute them
with so much discretion, that they may
improve the proper taste of the Meat,
without making their own discerned.</p>
            <p>After having Discoursed to you of
the Quality of Wines, and the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Meats, 'tis necessary to come to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44397:64"/>
the most proper counsel for the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Taste and Health.</p>
            <p>Let Nature incite you to drink and
eat by a secret disposition, which is light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perceived, and doth not press you to
it through necessity.</p>
            <p>Where there is no Appitite, the most
wholesome nourishment is capable of
hurting us, and the most agreeable of
disgusting us.</p>
            <p>Where there is hunger, the necessity of
eating is an Evil which causes another af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Meal is over, by having forced a
man to an excess of Eating.</p>
            <p>The Appetite prepares, if I may so speak,
an exercise for our heat in the digestion:
Whereas Greediness prepares Labour and
Pains for it. The way to keep us always in
an agreeable disposition, is to suffer nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
too much emptiness, nor too much
repletion; to the end that Nature may
never have wherewithal to fill it self gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
with what it wants, nor to ease it
self with eagerness of its oppression.</p>
            <p>Behold all the Counsels that my expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
has been able to furnish me with,
in relation to reading and good chear; I
will not end without giving you a word
or two concerning Love.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:44397:64"/>
If you have a Mistress at <hi>Paris,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
her as soon as possibly you can; for
she will not fail to change, and it is good
to prevent the unfaithful.</p>
            <p>A Person aimable at Court will be
Lov'd there, and where she is Loved, she
Loves to the end.</p>
            <p>They who preserve a Passion for
persons that are absent, raise but
little in those who see them; and the
continuance of their Loves for the
absent is less an Honour to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
than a Scandal to their Beauty.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, whether your Mistress lov's
another, or whether she Loves you still,
good Sense ought to make you leave
her as deceitful, or contemned.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, in case you live to see an
end of your disgrace, you ought not to put
an end to your Love; so short an absence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites
passions, whereas a long one destroys
them.</p>
            <p>What way soever your mind turns, give
not a new weight to it by the ponderous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of too serious things. Disgrace carries
but too much heaviness along with it.</p>
            <p>Do in your Exile, what <hi>Petronius</hi> did
at his Death. <hi>Amove res serias, quibus
gravitas, &amp; constantiae gloria peti solet. Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:44397:65"/>
ut illi, Levia Carmina, &amp; faciles
versus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are some whose Misfortunes,
have rendered them devout by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
compassion, and a secret pitty, which
a man is apt to entertain for himself, proper
enough to dispose Men to a more Religious
Life. Never did my disgraces give me this
sort of compassion.</p>
            <p>Nature has not made me Sensible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of my own Misfortunes. The
loss of my Friends might be able to
excite in me those tender sorrows, and
those nice afflictions, out of which
the Sentiments of Devotions are formed
in process of time.</p>
            <p>I will never advise any one to resist
that devotion, which is formed out of
compassion, nor that which gives us an
assurance.</p>
            <p>Both the one and 'tother agreeably
touch the Soul, and confirm the Mind
in a sweet Repose; but all men, and
particularly the unhappy, ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themselves with care from a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
Devotion, least it should
mingle its blackness with that of their
Misfortune.</p>

            <head>Of the PLEASURE that
WOMEN
Take in their
BEAUTY.</head>
            <byline>By Mr. <hi>BROWN.</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>THERE is nothing so natural to
persons of the Fair Sex, as to
take a pleasure in their own Beauty.
They please themselves as much as 'tis
possible for others to please them, and
are the first that discover their own
Charms, and fall in Love with them.</p>
            <p>But the motions of this self-love are
so sweet and so pleasing, That they are
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:44397:66"/>
scarce sensible; for self-love only flatters;
but Love of another nature, when it
comes to visit us, makes us feel it with a
Vengeance.</p>
            <p>This first sort of Love is congenial to
all Women, it is naturally formed in them,
and has themselves only for its Object.
The second comes from without, and is
either caused by a secret sympathy, or by
the violence of an amorous impression.</p>
            <p>The one is a Good that only occasions
Pleasure, but yet it is always a Good,
and lasts as long as their Beauty does.
The other is capable of touching them
more sensibly, but is more subject to
change and alteration.</p>
            <p>To this advantage of duration, which
the pleasure that the Ladies take in their
Beauty, has above the influence of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
we may add the following one,
<hi>viz.</hi> That a Beautiful Woman is more
concerned to preserve her Beauty than
her Lover; and shews less tenderness for
a Heart already vanquish'd, than she
expresses vanity and ostentation, in ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tending
her Conquests. Not but that she
may very well be allowed to be sensible
for her Gallant; but in all probability,
she will sooner resolve to suffer the loss
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44397:66"/>
of what she loves, than lose and ruine
what causes her to be beloved.</p>
            <p>There is a certain sort of a pleasure,
tho' 'tis in a manner impossible truly to
describe it, which we feel in deploring
the death of one we love.</p>
            <p>Our Love supplies the place of a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in the Reign of grief; and thence
proceeds that affection to this mourning
which has its Charms.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Cease, <hi>Thyrsis,</hi> cease, by an ill tim'd relief,</l>
               <l>To rob me of my best Companion, Grief.</l>
               <l>Sorrow to me all lovely does appear,</l>
               <l>It fills the place of what I held so dear.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But 'tis not so with the loss of Beauty.
This loss is a full consummation of all
other Calamities; it cruelly robbs the
Ladies of the hopes of ever receiving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
pleasure as long as they live.</p>
            <p>As long as a Woman is in full possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of her Beauty, no Misfortune can
befall her, which she cannot in some
measure alleviate. But when once that
Blessing has left her, all the other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of Fortune will never be able to
give her any tolerable satisfaction. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
she goes, the remembrance of what
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:44397:67"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>

               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:44397:68"/>
she has lost, or the consideration of wha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>she
is at present, will give her a thou
sand uneasinesses.</p>
            <p>In such a case, her best remedy will be
to employ all her discretion to make her
self easie under that unfortunate Condition.
But alass! what an unpalatable remedy
is it for a Woman, who has once been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored,
to abandon so dear a vanity, and
come back to her Reason. 'Tis a new and
mortifying experiment this, after a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
has been used to entertain her self
with such agreeable Thoughts.</p>
            <p>The last Tears that beautiful Eyes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
are spent in bewailing themselves,
after they are effaced out of all Hearts.
The only person that still laments a lost
Beauty, is the miserable Possessor.</p>
            <p>One of our best Poets, endeavouring to
comfort a great Queen for the loss of her
Royal Spouse, would make her asham'd
of the extravagance of her Affection, by
citing to her the Example of a certain
Princess in despair, who so wholly aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
her self to this weakness, that she
reproached the Stars, and accused the Gods
for the loss of her Husband.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:44397:68"/>
               <l>Boldly she charges every Power above.</l>
               <l>(So much her Reason's govern'd by her Love.)</l>
               <l>With all that fruitful anger can inspire,</l>
               <l>When Grief indulg'd, renews the glowing Fire.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But finding that the horrour of Impiety
was not strong enough to make any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
on a mind so disordered by grief;
for his last and concluding Reason, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
to her that it was her Interest to
be sedate, as if he had no better a remedy
against this excess, but to put her in mind
of the great injury it did her Beauty.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Those charming Locks the rudest Hands would spare,</l>
               <l>And yet they suffer by your own despair.</l>
               <l>Alass! what Crimes have those fair Tresses done?</l>
               <l>Think what a train of Conquests they have won.</l>
               <l>Is grief so cruel, or your rage so blind,</l>
               <l>That to your self you must be thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind?</l>
            </q>
            <p>He excused the Ladies for paying some
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:44397:69"/>
Tribute to their Sorrow, but he never
pardons them the Sin of making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
less amiable. This is a Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
that he imagins will easily create an
horror in them, without urging any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Considerations.</p>
            <p>It had been mere impertinence to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to reduce them by reason; but
to set before their Eyes the interest of
their Beauty, was the strongest Argument
he could think of to oppose to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy
of their Grief, and he knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
beyond that, which was capable to
reform this extravagance.</p>
            <p>That we may fully know how far the
Ladies are devoted to their Beauty, let
us consider the most retired and solitary
amongst them. There are some in that
station who have renounced all Pleasures;
who are weaned from the Interests of the
World; who endeavour to please no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and whom no body pleases. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst
all this coldness and indifference
for every thing else, they secretly flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
themselves, to see they are still agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
enough.</p>
            <p>There are others that abandon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to sorts of austerities; yet if
they accidentally happen to see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:44397:69"/>
in a Glass, you shall hear them
sigh, to behold so Melancholly an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration.
They do every thing that helps
to disfigure their Faces with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
readiness, but can't endure the
sight of them when they are once dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured.</p>
            <p>Nature that can consent to destroy her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
out of Love to God, secretly opposes it
self to the least change of Beauty, out of a
principle of self-love that never dies
with us.</p>
            <p>Let a Fair Person retire into what
place she pleases, let her condition be
what it will, yet her Charms and Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are still dear to her. They will
be dear to her even in the time of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and if her sickness goes as far as
Death, the last sigh that passes from her
is more for the loss of her Beauty,
than for that of her Life.</p>

            <head>A
LETTER
TO
Monsieur the Count de B. R.</head>
            <byline>By the same Hand.</byline>
            <p>YOU ask me what I have been do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Country, and since the
place cou'd not furnish me with agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Conversations, whether I did not
take great Pleasure to entertain my self
in Contemplation. I will tell you then
without affection, that I endeavour to
divert my self as much as possible, where
I am. Every Country has its Rarities,
which we learn not without satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and the most Savage places have their
Pleasures, if we are in a capacity to
use them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:44397:70"/>
It cannot otherwife happen, but that
every thing must displease me, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I begin, I employ my self in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
for to speak soberly upon the
matter, we never fail to be tiresome to
our selves, in too long and too serious a
commerce with our own Thoughts.</p>
            <p>Solitude has this peculiar to its self,
that it imprints upon us I don't know
what sort of a Mournful Air, barely
with thinking upon the wretchedness of
our State. Oh strange condition of Man!
If he intends to live happy, he must
make but few reflections upon life; nay
he must often depart as it were, from
himself, and amidst the Pleasures which
exteriour Objects furnish him with,
steal from the knowledge of his own
Miseries.</p>
            <p>Divertisements have their name for the
diversion they give us from tiresome
objects, to those that are Pleasant and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
Which sufficiently shows how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficult
a matter it is to overcome the
hard-ships of our Condition by any force
of Mind; but that a man may turn
them away from him by dexterity and
address.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:44397:71"/>
In effect, chuse the firmest Soul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth; can she digest without regret
the knowledge of what we are, and of
what we shall one day be? As for my
part, I believe it is almost impossible;
but tho' by a long habitude and solid
reasoning, we may arrive to such a pass,
as to look indifferently upon all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
objects whatever; yet they will
at least give us an austere humour, far
from any Sentiments of Pleasure, nay
from the very Idea of joy.</p>
            <p>'Tis the distinguishing Character of
God alone, that he can view himself, and
there find perfect Felicity and Repose. We
can scarce cast our Eyes upon our selves,
but we there discover a thousand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
which obliges us to seek elsewhere
that which is wanting in us.</p>
            <p>Glory, Reputation, and Fortune, are
a mighty relief against the rigours of
Nature, and the miseries of Life. Thus
we had Wisdom given us for no other
end, but only to regulate these Goods, and
to direct our conduct; but let our stock
be never so great, we shall find it stands
us in small stead, when we are alarm'd
with the pains and approaches of
Death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:44397:71"/>
I know there are several persons who
prepare themselves against it by solid
judicious reflections, and by designs well
concerted: But it generally so happens,
that the extremity of pain dashes all
these fine resolutions to pieces; that a
Feavour throws them into a <hi>delirium,</hi> or
that by doing every thing out of Season,
they are strangely fond of Life, when
they ought to take up a Resolution of
quitting it
<q>
                  <l>These empty Pretenders, so vain and high Flying,</l>
                  <l>That Preach up a Constancy without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting,</l>
                  <l>Resemble the Fop, who as he lay dying,</l>
                  <l>Begg'd his Maker to give him three Years to Repent in.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>All the circumstances of Death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
only those that remain behind.
The Weakness, the Resolution, the
Tears, the Indifference, all is equal at
the last moment; and 'tis very ridiculous
to imagine that this ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
as a great matter by those, who
are going to be nothing themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:44397:72"/>
There is nothing that can effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conquer the horrour of this dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but a firm perswasion of another
Life; we must put on a Spirit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
and place our selves in such a scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
as to hope every thing, and fear
nothing.</p>
            <p>In truth, 'tis impossible not to make
some reflections upon a thing so Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
nay, a man must be guilty of a
strange effeminacy not to dare to think
of it.</p>
            <p>We may say the same thing of sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and indeed of all sorts of grief;
'tis a Chimera for Man to wish to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage
himself absolutely from them. I
may add, they are sometimes lawful,
and I think they may be reasonably used
on certain occasions.</p>
            <p>An indifference is perfectly scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in some sort of Misfortunes. A
tenderness is justly paid to the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of a faithful Friend; but then we
are to observe, that as greif ought to
be rare, so it ought to be soon laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side.</p>
            <p>After having observed the greatest
part of People that hunt after their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
I have found four sorts of them,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:44397:72"/>
and I am apt to perswade my self, that
<hi>I</hi> know all their Sentiments exactly:
They are the sensual, the hasty or
Choleric, the voluptuous, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate.</p>
            <p>The sensual apply themselves more
grosly to that which is most Natural;
and like other Animals, follow their own
simple Appetites</p>
            <p>That which touches the Voluptuous,
makes an impression upon the Senses,
which reaches as far as the Soul. I
don't mean that intelligent Soul, from
whence proceeds the light of Reason,
but a Soul more mixt, and interessed in
the Body; which the passions cause to
languish, and which may be tickled with
all manner of Pleasures.</p>
            <p>The Choleric have a more lively
Sense, and a more violent Soul; sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of impressions, and full of Heat in
all their Movements.</p>
            <p>The Mind has a greater share in
the taste of the Delicates, than in that
of others. To these do we owe our
inventions and refinements in Luxury;
without them Gallantry had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known;
Musick harsh and rude, and our
Eating mean and ill ordered. To these
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:44397:73"/>
are we indebted for the <hi>eruditus luxus</hi>
of <hi>Petronius,</hi> and all the exquisite discoveries,
the politeness of our Age has made. But it
must be confest, that if these Persons
are ingenious in preparing Pleasures for
other Men, they are fruitful in disgusts
for themselves, and having too great an
Idea of the perfection of things, are over
difficult to be pleased.</p>
            <p>I have made some observations too
upon the objects that please us; and
methinks I have remark'd very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
differences in them.</p>
            <p>There are a slight sort of impressions,
that if you'l pardon the expression, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
glance upon the Soul, and employ
it for the time upon agreable things,
where it is fixed with complacency,
without the least invention of care to
disturb it. This we call agreeableness;
and it is conformable enough to the
humour of the most Virtuous Persons,
who mingle this sort of Pleasure with
their most serious Occupations.</p>
            <p>I have observed another, which the
Ancients called <hi>Mollities,</hi> a soft volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
impression, that flatters and tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
the Senses, and diffuses it self delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
all over the Soul. From hence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:44397:73"/>
a certain Laziness that insensibly
robs the Mind of its vivacity and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour;
insomuch that being once Charm'd
with it, 'tis a difficult matter to shake
off so sweet a Lethargy.</p>
            <p>Offensive disagreeable Subjects are felt
after a manner quite opposite to this.
They do violence to the Senses; the
Soul is wounded by them, and this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
so far as to give a disturbance
and inquietude to the Mind.</p>
            <p>But the highest degree of merit in Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
is that which is touching; which
penetrates even to the bottom of the
Heart, which raises the finest Images in
our Minds, and moves us after the most
tender manner imaginable.</p>
            <p>It is hard to speak of it well, and
there is no expression but comes infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
short of what those persons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
that are affected by it. These trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
and deliquiums proceed from the
want of proportion between the Objects
and the Soul that receives the impression
of them. Whether it is, because not being
able to contain our selves, we are as it
were, carried out of our selves by a sort of
ravishment, or that overwhelmed with
excess of pleasure, we faint away under
the weight of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:44397:74"/>
I should never have done, if I were
minded to pursue all the differences that
are to be found in so copious a Subject.
The best way is to chuse what we find
most conformable to our taste, to our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
or to our Genius.</p>
            <p>Let gay Persons search after diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and joy; let the indifferent content
themselves with what is agreeable; let
the Delicate refine upon the most cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
things; let passionate Souls suffer
themselves to be touched with tender
Objects, provided that Reason banishes all
disorder, and corrects the excess of them.</p>
            <p>This is all I had to say to you, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Article of Pleasure. It now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
that I say something of a Mind
which is restored to it self, and enjoys
a perfect degree of tranquillity.</p>
            <p>We are not always possessed by our
Passions; and it is to be feared, that instead
of tasting true liberty, a lazy, unactive Scene
of Repose, may throw us into a state of
wearisomness. However that time which
a Man renders tedious to himself by
his sullen Humour, is no less placed to
his account, than the sweetest part of
Life; and those Melancholy hours, we
desire to pass away with so much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:44397:74"/>
do full as much contribute to
fill up the measure of our days, as those
that escape us with regret.</p>
            <p>I am not of their Opinion, who spend
their time in complaining of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
instead of thinking how to relieve
and sweeten it.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Vnhappy knowledge, source of all our Woes,</l>
               <l>Destructive of our Pleasure and Repose;</l>
               <l>Why, when some dire mischance has been sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,</l>
               <l>Should the ungrateful Image be retain'd?</l>
               <l>Must we to Grief this slavish homage pay,</l>
               <l>As sigh our best, our dearest Hours away?</l>
               <l>Or to improve the pressures of our doom,</l>
               <l>Must we bewail the past, and fear the Ills to come?</l>
            </q>
            <p>I freely leave these Gentlemen to their
Murmurs, and take what care I can to
extract some comfort from those very
things they complain of: I endeavour to
entertain my self with an agreeable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of what is past; and furnish
my self with pleasant Ideas of what is to
come. If I am obliged to regret any thing,
my regrets are rather sentiments of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
than of grief.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:44397:75"/>
If in order to avoid any Evil, we must
of necessity foresee it, my fore-sight ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
goes so far as Fear. 'Tis my aim, that
the knowledge of feeling nothing that
troubles me, and the consideration to see
my self free and Master of my self, shou'd
give me the spiritual pleasure of good <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picurus.</hi>
I mean that agreeable indolence,
which is not, as the vulgar imagine, a
state without grief, and without pleasure;
but the sentiments of a pure and delicate
joy, which proceeds from a repose of
Conscience, and a serenity of Mind.</p>
            <p>After all, whatsoever sweetness we find
in our selves, let us take care to keep it
there as long as we can. 'Tis an easie leap
from these secret joys to inward griefs;
and there is no less good Husbandry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in the Enjoyment of our own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
goods, than in the use of those that
are external. Who does not know that
the Soul is tired to be always in the same
posture, and that at long run, it would
lose all its vigour, if it were not awaken'd
by the Passions?</p>
            <p>In short, a man must make but very
few reflections upon life, if he designs to
pass it happily; nay, he ought to use
a quite different Conduct. He must
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:44397:75"/>
often steal as it were from himself, and
amongst the pleasures that other Objects
give him, forget the knowledge of his
own Misfortunes.</p>

            <head>A
Letter to Monsieur D. L.</head>
            <p>YOU left me yesterday in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
that insensibly became a
furious dispute. There was every thing
said that can be alledged <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con,</hi> either
for the disgrace or advantage of Learning.</p>
            <p>It is not necessary to acquaint you with
the parties; you need only know they were
both of them <hi>interested</hi> very much to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their own cause. <hi>B.</hi> having little obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Nature for his Genius; and <hi>N.</hi> might
say, without being ungrateful, that he ow'd
his Talent neither to Arts nor Sciences.</p>
            <p>The occasion of the dispute was this.
Some body happen'd to commend the
great variety of Madam <hi>G—'s</hi> knowledge:
When <hi>N.</hi> all on the sudden rose from his
Chair, and taking off his Hat with a
scornful Air. <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> says he, <hi>if</hi>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:44397:76"/>
               <note n="*" place="margin">I am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve from what follows, that the famous <hi>Christina</hi> is here meant, who, as all the World knows, was a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of great learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and abdica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Crown of <hi>Sweden.</hi>

               <hi>Madam G.</hi> had known

lost all that she had. See
what good is come of her
Knowledge and fine Learning, which you
boast of so much.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> seeing such an injury done to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam

to dispute with an Ignorant. To conclude,
where can you find me any extraordinary Man,
who was not a Man of Letters, and exquisite
knowledge?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He began with Monsieur the Prince,
and went on as far as <hi>Caesar;</hi> from <hi>Caesar</hi>
to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great; and God knows
how far the matter had gone, if <hi>N.</hi> had
not interrupted him with so much vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence,
that he was forced to hold his
Tongue.</p>
            <p>In troth, <hi>says he,</hi> you do mighty feats
here with your <hi>Caesars,</hi> and <hi>Alexanders.</hi>
For my part, I don't know whether they were
learned or unlearned, it does not signifie a
farthing: But this I am sure of, that ever
since I knew the World, no Gentlemen were
oblig'd to study, but only those that were designed
for the Church; and now for the generality of
them, they content themselves with the Latin
of the Breviary. As for those that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
for the Court, or for the Army, they
go fairly and honestly to an Academy. There
they learn to ride the great Horse, to Dance,
to handle their Arms, to play upon the Lute,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:44397:77"/>
to Vault. Then comes a little spice of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks,
and that's all. We have in <hi>France</hi>
several thousand Souldiers, and all of them Men
of honour. By this means, such and such Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
I could name to you, if I were minded, made
their Fortune. Latin! I thank myStars for't, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
since I was born, Latin has been thought scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
for a Gentleman. I know the great quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Monsieur the Prince, an am his Humble
Servant. But I must tell you, there was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
person of Quality that knew how to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his Credit in the Provinces, and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
at Court, yet was not able to Read;
with the Devil a word of Latin, but only good
French on his side.</p>
            <p>It happen'd luckily for <hi>N.</hi> that his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
had the Gout; otherwise he had
revenged the Quarrel of <hi>Latin</hi> with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more effectual, than meer bluster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and big words.</p>
            <p>At last the Contest was renewed a fresh.
The former being resolved to dye a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr
for his Opinion, and the other still
maintaining the cause of ignorance with
great ardour and resolution. When a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
Father who chanced to be in the
Room, interposed to accommodate the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;
being ravished to meet so favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
an opportunity to show his Wit and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:44397:77"/>
Learning. He cough'd thrice very Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically,
and then turning himself towards
the Doctor, he thrice sneer'd (as your Men
of the World use to do) at our pleasant
Ignoramus. When he thought he had
composed his Countenance well enough,
<hi>digitis gubernantibus vocem,</hi> he spoke after
this manner.</p>
            <p>I must tell you, Gentlemen, I must tell you,
that Learning adds to the Beauty of Nature;
and likewise that a natural Genius gives a
grace to Learning. A genius of it self, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Rule and Art, is like a Torrent that
pours down irregularly: And Knowledge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a natural Talent, resembles those dry and
barren Fields that are so disagreeable to the
sight. Now, Gentlemen, the business is how to
reconcile what you have so unadvisedly divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
to re-establish an Vnion where you have
made a Divorce. Learning is nothing in the
World, but a perfect knowledge, and Art is
nothing but a Rule that directs Nature. And
wou'd you, Sir, <hi>addressing himself to</hi> N. be
ignorant of the things you speak of, and value
your self only upon your natural force, which
is irregular and far from perfection? And
you Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will you renounce the natural Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Mind, to render your self a slave to
troublesome Precepts, and borrow'd Knowledge?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:44397:78"/>
               <hi>Come, come,</hi> replies <hi>N.</hi> very briskly, <hi>let us
make an end of this Discourse;</hi> I wou'd ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bear with his knowledge than with
the great Harangue you have made us
here. At least he is Laconic, and I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
you no better than I do him.</p>
            <p>The good Man, who was not of an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable
Nature, soon suffer'd himself
to be sweetned; and to quit scores with
<hi>N.</hi> prefer'd his agreeable ignorance to the
Magnificent words of the Father.</p>

            <head>A Letter to Madam L.</head>
            <p>HOW violent soever my Friendship
is, it has left me force enough to
write to you with less concern than I u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to do. And to tell you the truth, <hi>I</hi> am
somewhat ashamed to send you Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
sighs, which have neither the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
nor delicacy of those you hear. But
let them be what they will, <hi>I</hi> must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
hazard them; and endeavour to
make you remember me at a time when
all the World endeavours to make me be
forgotten.</p>
            <p>I don't question but that the interview
of your Pious Mother, and the rest of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:44397:78"/>
your godly Family was accompanied
with abundance of Tears To be sure
to such a Mother's Tears, you paid a civil
and respectful return like a well-bred
Daughter. But then you know the World
too well to exchange a real tenderness for
the grief of Hyppocrites, whose Virtue is
nothing else but a mere Artifice to deprive
you of those Pleasures, which themselves
regret.</p>
            <p>'Tis enough you show'd your obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
once, and Sacrificed your Repose to
a complaisance, which perhaps you did
not owe her; she is unjust, if after she has
exacted so severe an obedience from you,
she pretends to regulate your Inclinations,
and constrains the only thing she has left
in your power.</p>
            <p>We Love that which pleases us, and not
what is barely permitted to us; so that if
you must demand leave of your Parents,
before you are suffer'd to Love, so well
am I acquainted with their humour, that I
dare assure you, you'l have but a little occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be accquainted with that Passion,
should you live as long as a <hi>Sibill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But perhaps this discourse may seem ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
impertinent to you, and considering
your present circumstances, I ought rather
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:44397:79"/>
to be apprehensive of those persons that
counsel you to Love, than those that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
it. Perhaps you may follow the advice
I give you, and laugh at the reprimands
of your Mother. How do I know but
that this poor Mother of yours, to whom
I wish so much mischief, may be in my
interests; and that to stifle a growing
Friendship in its birth, she does not give
you the liberty to Love a Person so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from you.</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have had all the reason in the
World to commend your constancy and
resolution; but I doubt whether a meer
Idea will be able to dispute it long against
a Face, and memory against Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I have too great a concern
upon me, to leave the advantage of
being present with you any longer, to
those Gentlemen that daily behold
you and within a few days; no
manner of business shall hinder me
from throwing my self at your feet.
While you are expecting that I should
come and entertain you with my passion,
remember how many Thousand Oaths
you have sworn to Love me, and only me
as long as you Live.</p>

            <head>Another Letter to the same Person.</head>
            <p>YOU imagine, Madam, that I hate
you, and so far you are in the right
on't, that if you consult the reason I
have to do so, you may well believe that I
hate you most abominably. But then if
you consider what a mighty power you
have always had upon me, you conclude
rightly enough, that it is not in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to hate you; and to my shame I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it, that I still Love and Doat
upon you, after all the cruel injuries you
have done Men.</p>
            <p>The difference between your and my
way of procedure is extraordinary e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
you wish me ill because you have
been obliged by me; on the other hand
I wish you all the Prosperity in the
World, in spite of the ill treatments <hi>I</hi>
have received at your hands. For God sake,
Madam, pardon me the injuries you
have done me; forget what I have done for
you, and you will remove all the occasion
you have to hate me.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore, if you please, begin
a new sort of Friendship, where neither
reproach, nor Justification, nor Quarrels,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:44397:80"/>
nor Reconcilements, shall have any thing
to do. The only motive of my Friendship
is, because you are lovely in all respects;
that of yours ought to be the opinion
you now have, or at least, I desire you to
have, that I am an honest well meaning
Admirer of yours.</p>
            <p>Excuse my Vanity. The practice and
custom of the <hi>Gascons</hi> could not give me
a less share of it, and provide I keep my self
here without making further advances, you
&amp; I are sufficiently even with one another;
but I will by no means promise to imitate
those People in all things, particularly
where you have any manner of Concern.</p>

the Count of <hi>B.</hi> In case I should be so
unfortunate as to meet my Death there;
in which particular I have been so well o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed,
that you do not hate him at all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

you have punctually obeyed my orders,
and should I continue to give you the

would see it carefully executed.</p>
            <p>You may imagine, Madam, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to hide a real grief under a pretended
grievance; and being so well acquainted
with my Passion, you cannot without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
perswade your self, that I suffer a
Rival without jealousy. But do you not
know, Madam, that if I dare not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of you for obliging me to Love you
too much, I dare complain of him, for your
Loving him not much less. And if you
must of necessity make me angry, teach me
whom I am to be most angry with, either
the person who goes to rob me of my Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress;
or you who steal my Friend from
me.</p>
            <p>Let the matter be how it will, you need
not give your self much trouble to appease
my indignation. My Passion is too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
to allow the least Interval to my
Resentments; and my tenderness will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
make me forget the injuries, I have
received from you. I Love you, tho' you
are perfidious and faithless, and only fear
that a sincere Lover is none of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites
of Heaven. Farewell, let us
enter I beseech you, into a new un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known

            <p>Generosity, Gratitude, and Obligation

            <p>I must frankly own to you, Madam,

            <p>As for your self, who as far as <hi>I</hi> can

            <p>Not that <hi>I</hi> am reduced to the last

for your Lover, or whether <hi>I</hi> am still

            <head>A Letter to Madam de N.</head>
            <p>I Am injustly accused for having too
great a Complaisance for Madam <hi>de
Mazarin.</hi> There is no Person that she
has greater reason to complain of, than
my self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:44397:83"/>
For Six Months together <hi>I</hi> was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously
spying out something in her
which might displease me but in spite;
of all my endeavours, <hi>I</hi> cou'd discover
nothing there that was not too Lovely,
and too Charming.</p>
            <p>An ill-natur'd curiosity made me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
every Lineament of her Face, with
a design to meet either some irregularity
there to disgust me, or some disagreements
to render me less her Adorer. But how
unluckily did <hi>I</hi> succeed in my design?
Every Feature about her has a particular
Beauty, that does not in the least yeild to
that of her Eyes: And her Eyes, by
the Consent of all the World, are the
Finest Eyes in the Universe.</p>
            <p>Her Teeth, her Lips, her Mouth, and
all the graces that accompany it, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
amongst the great and different
Beauties of her Face; if we compare them
to those pretty Mouths, that are the
greatest Charms about those Persons
whom we most admire. They extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish,
and efface every thing which is
but little distinguished in them; and don't
give us leave to consider what is most
remarkable in others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:44397:84"/>
The Malice of my curiosity did not
stop here; I proceeded to find out some
defect in her shape; and <hi>I</hi> found, <hi>I</hi> know
not what graces of Nature so happily
and so liberally scattered in her Person,
that the Charms of other Persons only
seem to be constraint and affectation.</p>
            <p>When Madam <hi>de Mazarin</hi> pleased me
too much in her negligent Air, <hi>I</hi> counsel'd
her to have recourse to Art, hoping that
her Ornaments and her Dress wou'd not
fail to ruine those Natural agreements.
But scarce had she Drest her self, but <hi>I</hi>
was forc'd to confess that <hi>I</hi> never saw in
any Person, so great and so Noble an Air
as hers.</p>
            <p>My ill Nature was not satisfied with
all this; <hi>I</hi> had a mind to see her in her
Chamber amongst her Dogs, her Squir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
and her Birds; hoping that the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
of her Dress wou'd make her lose
the Majesty of that Beauty that astonish'd
us at Court. But here it is that she is a
hundred times more amiable; here it is
that a more Natural Charm gives us a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust
to all that Art and Industry can do;
here it is that the freedom of her Wit and
of her Humour leave none to the Person
that beholds her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:44397:84"/>
What cou'd the greatest of her Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
do more? <hi>I</hi> wish'd some sickness
might invade her to undermine her Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
but alas we had more reason to
complain than she had in her pains. Her
very pains have a Charm that does us a
greater mischief than she suffers by them.</p>
            <p>After <hi>I</hi> had waited some time to see
what wou'd be the consequence of her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition,
<hi>I</hi> endeavoured to raise her
some Enemies, or to be of the number of
them my self: With this design <hi>I</hi> purposely
contradict all she says; I excite her Anger
by some dispute; <hi>I</hi> imagine she wrongs
me at Play: <hi>I</hi> insinuate to my self all the
circumstances of my oppression, to furnish
me with a pretence for a real Resentment.
But alas! to what purpose is all this trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
industry? Her ill treatment pleases
instead of provoking; and her injuries,
more charming than the Caresses of others,
have so many Charms that they engage
me to her will.</p>
            <p>I pass from her serious moments to
those of her gayety; <hi>I</hi> was willing to see
her serious, out of hopes to find her less
agreeable; I was willing to see her more
free, thinking to find her indiscreet. When
she was serious, she made me admire
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:44397:85"/>
her good Sense; when she was pleasant,
she made me Love her Judgment.</p>
            <p>She knows as much as any Man can
know; she conceals her knowledge with
all the discretion that a reserved Woman
ought to have.</p>
            <p>She has some acquired Learning, which
upon no occasion <hi>betrays</hi> the <hi>study</hi> that was
employ'd to acquire it. She has some happy
thoughts that are as far from an affected
Art that displeases us, as from a natural
excess that offends us.</p>
            <p>I have seen some Ladies that have got
themselves Lovers by the advantage of their
Beauty, and lost them again through a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of Wit. I have seen others that have
engaged Us to them by being beautiful and
witty together; and discouraged us from
a farther pursuit by their Indiscretion, and
want of good Conduct. But in Madam <hi>de
Mazarin,</hi> pass from her Face to her Wit;
from the qualities of her Mind, to those of
her Soul, you will find that every thing at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
you, that every thing fastens and
binds you, and that nothing can disen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
you.</p>
            <p>We defend our selves from the Triumphs
of other Ladies by our Reason. 'Tis Reason
that either frees us, or else subjects us to its
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:44397:85"/>
power. Our Love begins or ends our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Here our Love cannot end, unless we
lose our Reason.</p>
            <p>What I observe to be most extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
in Madam <hi>de Mazarin,</hi> is that she
daily inspires new desires; and that in the
habitude of a continual Commerce, she
makes us feel all the tender sweetnesses of
a growing Passion.</p>
            <p>She is the only person of her Sex, for
whom one may be eternally constant; and
with whom one may enjoy every Hour
the diversion of Inconstancy. We never
change for her person: we change every
moment for her attractions. One relishes
in some manner, all that new, that lively
Joy which unfaithfulness in Love makes
us feel.</p>
            <p>Sometimes her Mouth is abandon'd for
her Eyes. Sometimes we leave her Eyes to
gaze at her Mouth. Her Cheeks, her Nose,
her Eye-brows, her Fore-head, nay, her
Ears (so much pains has Nature taken to
make every thing perfect in this beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Body) her <hi>Ears</hi> attract our Inclinations
in their turn, and make us taste the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Change.</p>
            <p>To consider her Features separately, one
would say that there is a secret jealousie
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:44397:86"/>
between them, and that they are still busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to attract Lovers. To consider them in
conjunction, and as they are united and
joyn'd together, we see they form a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tv,
that neither suffers inconstancy for it
self, nor infidelity for others.</p>

            <head>A Conversation of Monsieur de St. Evre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont
with Monsieur d'A—</head>
            <p>BY the following Discourse it appears, that
our Author was not over much a Friend
of the <hi>Jansenists,</hi> whom he consider'd as the
Recommenders of too austere a Morality, to
pass with the generality of Mankind. I am <hi>en
passant,</hi> to inform the Reader, that in the
French Copy, the word <hi>Jansenists</hi> is not writ
out at length, but only the first Letter:
However, since 'tis plain the Author meant
them; whatever Reasons he had, not to name
them at large, the Translator did not think
himself obliged to follow that Conduct.</p>
            <p>Having one day recounted to Monsieur
<hi>d'A—</hi> the Conversation which <hi>I</hi> had with
Father <hi>C.—</hi> it is not reasonable, <hi>says he to
me,</hi> that you should find more freedom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Iansenists</hi> than amongst us.
Take the pains to hear me, and I dare be
confident you'll find me no less a Man of
Honour, than the Reverend Father whom
you mention'd to me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:44397:86"/>
I must tell you that we have a World
of Ingenious Men that take the part of
the <hi>Iansenists</hi> in their Works; of vain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
Discoursers; that to do themselves
the honour of being thought <hi>Iansenists,</hi>
and raise continual Disputes in all Houses
where they come; of wise able Men, that
prudently manage both the one and the
other.</p>
            <p>You will find amongst the first great
Learning, a Faith well enough principled,
oftentimes too much Heat, and sometimes
a little Animosity.</p>
            <p>In the second Class there is much obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
and Fancy. The least usefull of them
fortifie their Party by their Numbers; and
those that are considerable, give it some
credit by their Quality.</p>
            <p>As for the Politicians they employ each
of them their Talent to govern the
Machine, by ways and resorts unknown to
the particular People whom they set on
work.</p>
            <p>Those that Write or preach upon Grace,
that handle this Question which is so cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated,
and has been so often discussed.
Those that place the Councils above the
<hi>Popes;</hi> who oppose themselves to <hi>Innocent</hi>
their Pastor; who defeat the great preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:44397:87"/>
of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> act with a
góod Faith, and are effectually perswaded
of the truth of what they say.</p>
            <p>Our Directors are but little concerned
for the different Sentiments of the Doctors.
Their aim is to set Catholic against Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic,
and Church against Church, to
make a great Party in the Church, and a
great Faction in the State.</p>
            <p>They are for making a Reformation in
the Convents, but don't think of reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves; they exalt Penance to the
Skies but never practice it; they recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the eating of Herbs to those People
that have a mind to distinguish themselves
from the rest of their Brethren, by a few
singularities; but at the same time, they
are so complaisant to their own Bodies, as
to eat every thing that persons of the best
Rank use to eat.</p>
            <p>After all, our Politicians, such as I have
described them, do the <hi>Jansenists</hi> more ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
by their Directions, than our Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
do with all their Books.</p>
            <p>'Tis their Sage and prudent Conduct
that supports us; and if ever Monsieur <hi>de
G. B.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de L.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de C.</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de B.</hi> fail us, unless I am mightily
mistaken, we shall find a great change a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:44397:87"/>
the <hi>Iansenists.</hi> The reason is, because
our Opinions will hardly subsist of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
They commit an everlasting vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
upon Nature; they take away from
Religion all that comforts us, and in the
room of it, place Fear, and Grief, &amp; despair.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iansenists,</hi> who by their good will,
would make every Man a Saint, are scarce
able to find out ten Men in a Kingdom, to
make such Christians as they would have.
Christianity without question is divine,
but they are Men still that receive it; and
whatever measures we take, we ought to
accommodate our selves to <hi>Human Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Too austere a Philosophy makes few
wise Men; too rigorous a Government
few good Subjects; too harsh a Religion,
few religious Souls, I mean, that will long
continue so.</p>
            <p>Nothing is durable that is not suited to
Nature. Grace it self, of which Monsieur
<hi>A—</hi> speaks so much, accomodates it self to
it. God makes use of the docility of our
Minds, and the tenderness of our Hearts, to
cause himself to be receiv'd and lov'd by us.</p>
            <p>It is certain that your <hi>austere Casuists</hi>
cause a greater aversion to themselves, than
to Wickedness. The <hi>Pennance</hi> they preach
up, perswades the <hi>Ignorant</hi> to prefer the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:44397:88"/>
Ease they find in continuing to be <hi>wicked,</hi>
to the <hi>difficulties</hi> in getting free from Vice.</p>
            <p>The other Extream appears equally
Vitious to me. I hate those Sullen, Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
Spirits, that fancy there is Sin in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing; no less do I hate those easie
<hi>complaisant Doctors</hi> that admit it no where;
that favour the Irregularities of Nature, by
making themselves secret Partisans of Evil
Manners. In their hands the Gospel al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
us more indulgence than Morality
does; and Religion as it is managed by
them, opposes all manner of Crimes more
feebly than Reason.</p>
            <p>I respect virtuous intelligent Persons,
that judge soundly of our Actions; that
seriously exhort to what is good, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
us, as much as in them lies, from
what is Wicked.</p>
            <p>I heartily wish that a just and nice dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
wonld make them know the
real difference of things; That they wou'd
distinguish the effect of a Passion from the
execution of a design; That they wou'd
distinguish a Vice from a Crime, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
from Vices; That they wou'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
our Weaknesses and condemn our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders;
That they would not confound
light, simple, and natural Appetites, with
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:44397:88"/>
wicked and perverse <hi>Inclinations.</hi> In a word,
I am for a Christian Morality, neither too
severe, nor too indulgent.</p>

            <head>Of Friendship.</head>
            <byline>By another Hand.</byline>
            <p>THE first Friendship which arises
in the World, is that which is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in the Bosom of Families: The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
habitude of being always together,
and of considering our selves as being of
the same Blood; the same opinions in
which we are brought up; the conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
there is between us; the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of secrets of affairs, and interests: All
these things contribute as much to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
as Nature it self: They Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate
at least the Name of Brother, Sis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the rest, as much as the tye of the
same Blood. For whatever is affirmed
of certain Natural inclinations, which a
Man feels at the meeting of those Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
who are as yet unknown to him; it
is certain that the Examples thereof are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
aggravated, or extraordinary; and
that we should use them like meer Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
if we were not accustomed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
our near Relations, as our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves.
This therefore is the first conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:44397:89"/>
It were to be wished that this first
Friendship would continue during Life ni
the same condition, wherein we find it in
our first Years. But it decay's insensibly. In
the first place, by the great number of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
whereof a Family is compos'd: For
it is a certain Principle, that Friendship
cannot long subsist between several Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
Besides, a Man leaves his Family in
order to establish himself in the World.
He enters by Marriage into new alliances,
or by the profession of a particular Piety,
he goes out of his Family without having
the Pleasure of adopting another. Thus
he contracts on one side, in some sort, an
obligation to forget his Parents; and on
the other, a Duty of Loving new ones.
What shall <hi>I</hi> say of the interest which so
often divides Families? Admit a regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all these things, yet a single separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
lessens something of the first affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
During this absence, a Man insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
contracts particular manners, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the the Conduct of his Life, or for
his Fortune, or in Relation to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Family. The first Bond of
Friendship is scarce of any further use af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
than to express it self a little
more, than we would do, if they were our
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:44397:89"/>
Rrelations; to have a little more curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in their respect, and to behave our
selves with care enough not to appear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
in any point to others.</p>
            <p>Not but that when there happens any
essential occasion of being serviceable to
them, we take a pride in not being want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therein. Thus this first Friendship,
which is tender in the first Years, which
admitts some degrees of relaxation in the
succession of Life, appears notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
always strong, when any important
Interest is in agitatiou. And as for me, I
believe that of all sorts of Friendship this
ought to be managed with most Care.</p>
            <p>There is a Second kind of Friendship,
which has also its perfections and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections,
as well as the first we have
spoken of. It is that, which is between a
Husband and Wife, when they enter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
constraint into the State of Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and preserve a good <hi>intelligence</hi> on both
sides. It has somewhat of that Friendship
which is between a Superior and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior;
since the Laws have declared that
Women ought to consider their Husbands
as their Masters; and that the civility
of Men obliges them to receive marks of
respect from their Wives; only to quit
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:44397:90"/>
them immediatly, and to depend on
them by their own choice, as
they depend on their Husbands by the
Laws and Customs. When People live
together after this decent manner, they
maintain a continual commerce of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem;
they taste all the Delicacies of
Love; they have the Pleasure of Loving,
and of being belov'd, and even make a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of this Friendship. I am of opinion
that it is this mixture of tenderness,
this return of esteem, or, if you will, this
mutual ardour to prepossess one another
by obliging Testimonies, wherein consists
the Sweetness of this Second Friendship.
<hi>I</hi> speak not of other Pleasures, which are
not so much such in themselves, as in the
assurance which they afford us of the perfect
possession of those persons whom we Love.
Which appears to me so true, that I am
not afraid to affirm, that if a Man were
assured of meeting the perfect affection of
a Wife else where, he wou'd easily sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
himself under the loss of his Spouse
at home; and that they ought not to enter
into the order of Friendship, but as tokens
and proofs that it is without reserve. Few
Persons, 'tis true, are capable of the purity
of these Thoughts. Thus a perfect Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:44397:90"/>
is rerely observed in Marriages, at
least they seldom continue long. The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of gross Passions is not able to support
so noble a Commerce as Friendship. After
it has produced it, and maintain'd for some
time the shadow and resemblance of it,
Indifference, Contempt and other new
Passions, soon arise to efface it. Even the
constraint one is under, always to keep the
same Society, lessens somewhat the value
of perseverance. We lose by degrees, the
assurance we had of being loved: We en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into suspicions, Jealousies, and disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets,
and can hardly conceal them in the
necessity we lye under of living eternally
together. From thence arise Mistrusts,
Complaints and Quarrels. The Children
are at that time, the only Bonds which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Man and Wife in their duty. These
are the Pledges and <hi>Fruits</hi> of their first Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:
'Tis an Interest that binds them
at the very moment, when their Hearts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
to a separation. But when a Man
speaks of <hi>friendship,</hi> or hears it every day
mention'd; he is not to understand
it either of this first, or second kind.
It is of a Species altogether particular.
The World would have it only between
two Persons; that it requires whole years
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:44397:91"/>
to form it self; that Virtue alone is the
Foundation of it; that it continues for ever;
that it is a perfect communication of all
things: In a word, that there is made of
these two persons a <hi>Metamorphosis</hi> so general,
that they mutually transform themselves
into one another. Authors triumph upon
this Portraiture. They even give it finer
Colours than <hi>I</hi> do. Notwithstanding I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
I may without rashness assert, that
these ingenious Painters, who afford us
such Illustrious Coppies of Friendship, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
saw the Originals. In truth, 'tis natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
for us to take a pleasure in exaggerating
matters; and the first moment we begin
a Book, or a <hi>Discourse,</hi> we forget that our <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes</hi>
are but men, and that we speak to men.</p>
            <p>But a <hi>man</hi> must avoid likewise to take for
<hi>friendship I</hi> know not how many <hi>Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences</hi>
he meets in the <hi>course of life,</hi> which
certainly deserve not this <hi>glorious Title.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To partake together in some diversion,
to be engaged sometimes in the same Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations;
to meet often at Court, or in
the City; such kind of obligations cannot
assure one of a solid Friendship. All these
things generally happen by pure chance;
and 'tis <hi>Fortune</hi> that produces these diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
occassions. What share can the Heart
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:44397:91"/>
enjoy herein, but the interest of some plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure?
and can this Interest beget a truly
perfect Friendship? 'Tis true, we love
persons that may be useful to us, or such as
are pleasant and agreeable; we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
to be where they are, and give
them a favourable reception. We have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
more particular regards for those that
have the Reputation of having great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Friends; of being Men of Intrigue,
and of being able to serve us upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
For to speak agreeable things, and
to be capable of doing useful ones, are two
great steps towards an introduction into
the most inaccessible Hearts.</p>
            <p>But 'tis no less true, that those persons
whom we only know upon this bottom,
should not put that Friendship we enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
for them, to too strong proof. A Man
will hardly purchase the pleasure which
the Conversation of a Wit affords; and it
is ordinary enough to refer to others, the
care of serving a person, who doth nothing
but divert us.</p>
            <p>If we make but a little reflection upon
this, we shall observe that it is this sort of
Friendship, which as imperfect and as
common as it is, doth not cease to form a
Civility, by which our Conduct is regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:44397:92"/>
and which is as it were the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the publick Peace.</p>
            <p>'Tis that which instructs us how to
live; and this manner of living compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
an infinite number of small inferior
Duties, without which all things would
be in confusion.</p>
            <p>A friendship more exact is prodigious;
whose Examples are so rare, that a Man
may easily compute them.</p>

            <head>The Character of Madam, the Countess
of d'Olonne.</head>
            <byline>
               <hi>By Mr.</hi> BROWN.</byline>
            <p>I Don't expect to be more successful at
your Character, than our Painters
have been at your Portraiture, where I
may safely say, the best performers have
lost their Reputation. Till now, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
beheld any Beauties so finished, but
they were obliged to these Masters; either
for bestowing some new graces upon them,
or else for concealing some of their defects.
Only you, Madam, are above those Arts,
whose peculiar Character it is to flatter
and embellish. They never took the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
to copy you without a shameful foil
to their skill, and doing an infinite inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:44397:92"/>
to the Original; in short, without
making so accomplished a Person as your
self lose as many advantages, as they usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
give to those that possess them not.</p>
            <p>If you have not been much obliged to
the Painters, you are much less I am sure
to the curiosity of your Dress: You owe
nothing either to the skill of other People,
or to your own Industry: And may safely
rely upon Nature for the care she takes
of you. As there are very few Persons up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whom negligence sits well, <hi>I</hi> would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
them not to depend too much upon it.</p>
            <p>To say the truth, the generality of our
Ladies are not pleasing any farther than
their Habits make them so. Every thing
they employ to set them off, conceals some
defect. On the other hand, the more you
take from your Dress, the more Graces you
display; and it is as much your Interest to
return to the primitive simplicity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as it is for their advantage to keep
at a distance from it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> will not amuse my self with any gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Praises, that are several Ages old. The
Sun shall not furnish me with a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
for your Eyes; nor the Flowers for
your Complexion. <hi>I</hi> might speak of the
regularity and delicacy of your Face; of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:44397:93"/>
the Charms and agreeablenesses of your
Mouth; of that Neck so well turned and
polished; of those bewitching Breasts;
but after a Man has made the most cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
observations, there are a thousand
things may be thought of in you, which
cannot be well discribed, and a thousand
things better <hi>perceiv'd</hi> than <hi>comprehended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take my Advice, Madam, and don't
repose the care of your glory on any other
person; for certainly you are no where so
well as you are in your self. Appear in the
midst of your Portraitures and Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and you will defeat all the Images that
'tis possible to frame of you.</p>
            <p>After having well admired you, what <hi>I</hi>
find the most extraordinary is, that you
have as it were heap'd together in your
self, the several Charms of different Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
You are Mistress of those Graces that
surprize, that please, that flatter, that
forbid, and affect us.</p>
            <p>Your Character, properly speaking, is
not a particular Character; 'tis that of all
the rest of your Sex. One Man maintains
his Heart against an imperious, that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
himself to be Conquer'd by a delicate
Beauty: Delicacy gives disgust to another,
who was proud to surrender his Heart to
his imperious Mistress.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:44397:93"/>
You alone, Madam, are the <hi>Foible</hi> of all
the World. The ravished Lover finds in
you an unexhaustible Subject for his Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sports:
Passionate Souls find their tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and languishments. Different Spirits,
different Humours, contrary tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
all contribute to the <hi>largeness</hi> of your
Empire. In this confusion, you cause the
unhappiness of Persons between both
Ages; you trouble the Repose of the
most serene, and the Reason of the most
advised.</p>
            <p>Those persons that were born neither
to give nor to receive Love, preserve the
first of these Qualities, and unhappily lose
the other. From hence it proceeds, that
there is some resemblance between the
heat of your Friends, and the Passion of your
Lovers; that 'tis impossible to love you
without Interest, and that the judgment
of the most simple Spectators is never free.
From hence in short, it proceeds, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one commences a Lover that sees you,
except your self alone, who continue still
insensible.</p>
            <p>I beg your pardon, Madam. Something
wou'd be wanting to your glory, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
such an <hi>insensible</hi> all your life. Once,
and only once, you may quit this indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:44397:94"/>
But to make you quit your <hi>resolution</hi>
of never being in Love, we ought to find
out Subjects worthy of you. If there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such, Madam, I don't doubt but that
drawn by your Charms, and disgusted by
the defects of others, they will soon sigh
for you; and then you must remember that
<hi>cruelty</hi> has bounds, and that what ever goes
beyond them, is <hi>rudeness</hi> and <hi>insensibility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto I have paid one part of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
I owe your Beauty, and 'tis none of your
least praises, that I have been able to praise
you so long. At present, 'tis but just I should
have some consideration of my self; and
that in speaking of your Wit and Humour,
I should indulge my self to talk of my own.</p>
            <p>I will deliver nothing but Truths, and
least you should imagine them to be disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
to you, I will begin with the
Charms of your Conversation, which are
not in the least inferiour to those of your
Face.</p>
            <p>Yes, Madam, we are no less affected
with hearing you, than with seeing you.
You may inspire love even when you are
veiled; and may make <hi>France</hi> resemble
<hi>Spain,</hi> in being the Scene of the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the <hi>Fair invisible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Never was there more Politeness than
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:44397:94"/>
we find in your Discourse; and what is surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,
nothing is so lively and yet so just;
Things so happy and so well thought. And to
Crown all, a quick Understanding, and a viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of Sense equal that of your Wit.</p>
            <p>But let us conclude these Praises, the length
whereof is always tiresom, tho' they be never
so true; and now, Madam prepare to suffer pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
a recital of what I have found to blame
in you.</p>
            <p>If you cannot, without difficulty, hear your
defects: I am sure I could not without greater
difficulty discover them. To find out any faults
in you, I was obliged to make very profound
Enquiries, and after a long but narrow Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
behold what Faults I have remark'd.</p>
            <p>I have often beheld you too respectful, and
condescending to ordinary Persons; and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
your judgment to that of others who were
inferiour to you.</p>
            <p>I am likewise of Opinion, that you suffer your
self too much to make new acquaintances. That
which at first sight you have rightly judged to
be gross and dull, has after some time appeared
to you to be delicate without Reason; and
when you come to rectify these Errours, 'tis
rather by a return of your Humour, than by the
reflections of your Mind.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, Madam by a contrary Motion
you think too much, and pass by the truth in
Debate; so that the Opinions you form, are
rather more strongly imagin'd, than solidly
conceiv'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:44397:95"/>
As for your Actions, they are equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
and agreeable; but as you may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well neglect those little formalities, that
are in truth, but so many Fetters of Life,
you must expect to meet the calumnies of
Sots, and the ill Nature of those People
whom your merit has made your Enemies.</p>
            <p>Those Ladies, who are your professed
Enemies, have been constrained to own to
us that you have received a Thousand ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
from Nature. There are some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
occasions when we are obliged to own
to them, that they might be better mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and that you don't always make the
good use of them, as others in your Station
might do.</p>
            <p>I shall end all with the unequalities of
your temper, of which you your self have
made an agreeable representation. They
are afflicting to those that suffer undet
them; as for my self I always find some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
mortifying in this Scene; and I see
that when we most complain of any one's
Humour, 'tis then when we must interest
our selves in the Person.</p>
            <p>However it is, the more we are oblig'd
to take any advantage over you, we are
apt to take it without measure; we easily
disoblige you without thinking of it; nay
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:44397:95"/>
the very design to please you has more
than once made us so unfortunate as to
displease you.</p>
            <p>Believe me, Madam, a Man must be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
happy to find out your good moments,
and very just to make use of them.</p>
            <p>What we may truly say, after we have
well examined you, is, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so unfortunate as to fall in Love with
you, yet nothing so difficult as not to do it.</p>
            <p>Behold, Madam, the observations of a
Spectator, who to judge the more impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
of you, has endeavoured to continue
free. The means he took to keep himself
so, was to shun you as much as was possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for him. 'Tis not enough for one not to
see you, after he has once beheld you; and
this remedy which is elsewhere infallible,
does not carry an intire safety with it in
Relation to your self.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you will tell me that a Man,
whose Sentiments are somewhat tender,
is not generally Master of so rigorous a
Judgment. But altho' you shou'd give
your self the trouble to tell me what dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleases
you, I shall scarce take the Pains to
undeceive my self; a discernment which
does not seem advantagious to you, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
subsist but in your absence; for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:44397:96"/>
what I have already told you, do but
appear, Madam, in the midst of your Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traitures
and Characters, and you will soon
efface all the Images the most fruitful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination
can form of you.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="letter">
            <head>A Letter to Madam, the Countess of d' Olonne, and
sent with the foregoing Character.</head>
            <p>I Have here sent you your Character,
which tells you the general Sentiments
of the World concerning you; and
which will inform you, if you never knew
it before, that there is nothing so Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in all <hi>France</hi> as your self. Don't be so
rigorous to your own merits, as to deny
your self that justice which all the World
pays you. The greatest part of Ladies suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
themselves to be easily perswaded, and
receive these sweet errours with Pleasure;
and it wou'd be very strange indeed if you
cou'd not be prevailed upon to believe the
truth.</p>
            <p>Besides the Publick Opinion, you have
the Judgment of Madam <hi>d'Longueville</hi> on
your side. Submit to so authentic a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
without further scruple, and since
she believes it, believe your self to be the
most Charming Creature that was ever
beheld.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:44397:96"/>
From your Beauty, Madam, I pass to
the mischiefs it has occasioned, and to the
infinite numbers of those that daily lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
and dye for you. 'Tis not my design
to render you compassionate; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
if you will follow my advice, it
shall cost one of your unfortunate admirers
his Life. Our Poets and Authors of
<hi>Romances</hi> have too long entertained us
with false Deaths; I demand a true one of
you, which will be a new addition to your
other <hi>atchievements.</hi> To counsel you only to
Love Subjects that are worthy of you, is to
reduce you to an impossibility; and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to counsel you never to Love.</p>
            <p>Nothing now remains but to excuse my
hardiness in finding out your faults; and
indeed I cou'd hinder it, for otherwise I
had gone against the rules of Character,
whose perfection consists in well separat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the good and bad qualities.</p>
            <p>After all, I have infinitely more occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to complain, than you have; one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an hour is time sufficient for you to
read them over, but I passed whole Nights
to discover them. These were the first dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
of this Nature I ever met; and for
a mark of a very extraordinary merit one
of our nicest Criticks here in Town has
found my praises easie and natural.</p>

            <p>I Don't know why you should admire
my Verses, since I don't admire them
my self; for I must inform you that in the
opinion of a celebrated Master in Poetry,
a Poet is always the most affected with his

abundance of faults in mine,
which I might correct, is exactness were
not extreamly troublesome to my Humour,
and did not take up too much time for a
Person of my Age.</p>
            <p>Besides this, I have another excuse in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
which you'l admit too unless I am

the best Master-pieces; and my praises of
the King, being the first true and sincere
one I ever gave, you are not to admire if
my success was not extraordinary great.</p>
            <p>Your commendations of me are an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Irony, which figure I was so great
a Master of formerly, that the Marshal <hi>d'Clarambaut</hi>
thought no one but my self ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to dispute the merit of it with you.
You ought not to employ it against a Man
who has lost the use of it, and who is so

            <p>I Have undertaken to day a thing without
President; I have undertaken to make the
Funeral Oration of a Person, who is in better
Health than her Orator. This will surprize you
Gentlemen. But if we are permitted to take
care of our Tombs, to order Inscriptions for
them, to give a greater extent to our vanity
than Nature has been willing to give our Lives:
If those that are alive may appoint the Place
where they are to lye, when they shall be no

the Fifth caused his own Funerals to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:44397:98"/>
and for two Years assisted at them in
Person; can you think it strange, Gentlemen,
that a Beauty more illustrious by her Charms
than that Emperour was for his Conquests, is
willing to enjoy the happiness of her Memory,
and hear whilst she is alive, what may be said
of her after her Death.</p>
            <p>Let others endeavour to excite your sorrows
for one that is dead, I will command your Tears
for one who is Living, for a Person who is to

humane condition, and who ought to live for
ever for the sake of her admirable qualities.</p>
            <p>Weep Gentlemen, and not tarrying to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail
a Beauty till she is lost, afford your Tears to
the Melancholy consideration that we must once
lose her. Weep, weep. Whoever expects a
certain and unviolable Misfortune, may alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Stile himself unfortunate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hortensia</hi> will dye. That Miracle of the

            <p>Let us turn our imaginations from her Death

               <hi>HORTENSIA de MANCHINI</hi> was
born at <hi>ROME,</hi> of an Illustrious Family.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:44397:98"/>
Her Ancestors were always considerable,
but tho they had all of them governed
Empires, they had not brought her so
much Glory, as she reflects back upon
them.</p>
            <p>Heaven formed this great Masterpiece
by a Model unknown to the Age we
live in. To the shame of our time it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd
upon <hi>Hortensia</hi> the Beauty of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Greece,</hi> and the Virtue of old <hi>Rome;</hi>
Let us pass over her Infancy in silence,
without stopping our Discourse there.</p>
            <p>Her Infancy was attended with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pretty simplicities, but had nothing
of Importance enough for our Subject.
Gentlemen, I demand your Tears, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
your Admiration. To obtain them
I have both Misfortunes and Virtues to
represent to you.</p>
            <p>It was not long before Cardinal <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine</hi>
was sensible of the Advantages
of his beautiful Niece, and therefore to do
Justice of the Gifts of Nature, he destin'd
<hi>Hortensia</hi> to carry his Name, and to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
his Wealth.</p>
            <p>After his death, she had Charms that
might engage even Kings to court her
out of Love, and a fortune capable to
oblige them to do it out of interest. But
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:44397:99"/>
what occasion had you, Madam, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Sovereign? Do's not your Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
make you reign wherever you go?
There is no Nation that do's not pay
a voluntary Submission to the Power of
your Charms; there is no Queen that
has not a greater ambition for your Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
than you can possibly have for her
Grandeur.</p>
            <q>
               <l>All Climes and Countries do adore her,</l>
               <l>Fresh Triumphs on her Beauties wait.</l>
               <l>The World injustly calls her Rover,</l>
               <l>She only views the limits of her State.</l>
            </q>
            <p>In effect, what Country is there which
<hi>Hortensia</hi> has not seen? What Nation
has seen her that has not at the same time
admir'd her? <hi>Rome</hi> beheld her with as
great Admiration as <hi>Paris</hi> did. That
City, in all ages of the World so glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
boasts more upon giving her to the
World, than producing such a race
of Heroes. She believes that so extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
a Beauty is preferable to the

were to be gained by her eyes, than
by the Arms of her Citizens.</p>

from the tyranny of premeditated respects

itself.</p>
            <p>'Tis <hi>Hortensia</hi> who has banish'd all Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mace,
and all affectation from thence; who
has destroy'd that art of Trifles which
only regulates appearances; that Study
of exteriour things that only composes
mens Countenances.</p>
            <p>'Tis she who has rendred ridiculous a
stiff awkward Gravity, which supply'd
the place of Prudence; and who has tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph'd
over a politick Itch without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
and without interest, busied only to
conceal the defects a Man finds in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>'Tis she who has introduced a sweet
and innocent Liberty, who has rendred
Conversation more agreable, and made
Pleasure more pure and delicate.</p>
            <p>A Fatality caused her to come to <hi>Rome,</hi>
and a Fatality caus'd her to leave it.</p>

               <hi>Madam,</hi> the Constable <hi>Colonna</hi>'s Lady
had a mind to quit her Husband, and
imparted this resolution to her Sister.
Her Sister, as young as she was, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to her upon this occasion all that
a Mother could have done to hinder it.
But seeing her unalterably fixt to execute
her design, she follow'd her out of Love
and Affection, whom she could not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
by her Prudence; and shared with
her all the Danger of flight, the Fears, the
Inquietudes, and the Inconveniencies that
always attend such sort of Resolutions.</p>
            <p>Fortune who has a great Power in our
Enterprises, but a much greater in our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
made <hi>Madam</hi> the <hi>Constable</hi>'s La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
wander from Nation to Nation, and
threw her at last into a Convent at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Right Reason advised <hi>Hortensia</hi> to seek
her repose, and a desire of retirement
oblig'd her to settle her abode at <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery.</hi>
There she found in her self by her
Reflexions, by a Commerce with learned
Men, by Books, and by Observations,
all that solid Satisfaction which a Court
do's not give Courtiers, who are either
too much taken up with business, or
too much dissolved in Pleasures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:44397:100"/>
Three whole years did <hi>Hortensia</hi> live
at <hi>Chambery,</hi> always in a state of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity,
but never obscure. Whatever In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
she might have to conceal her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
her merit establish'd for her a small
Empire in spight of her, and made a
Court of a Retreat.</p>
            <p>In effect she commanded that City,
and all the Country about it. Every one
acknowledged with pleasure those Rights
which Nature had given her, even He
who had them over all the rest by virtue
of his Birth, forgot them freely, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the same subjection with his
People.</p>
            <p>Those of the greatest merit and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
quitted the Court, and neglected the
Service of their Prince, to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
particularly to that of <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia:</hi>
and considerable Persons of remote
Countries made a Voyage to <hi>Italy</hi> to
furnish themselves with a pretence to
see her.</p>
            <p>'Tis an extraordinary thing to be able
to establish a Court at <hi>Chambery.</hi> 'Tis as
it were a Prodigy that a Beauty, which
had a mind to conceal it self in places
almost inaccessible, should make a greater
noise in <hi>Europe,</hi> than all <hi>Europe</hi> together
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:44397:101"/>
The most beautiful Persons of every
Nation had the displeasure to hear a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
mention made of an absent Fair.
The most lovely Women had a secret E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
that ruined all the Impressions they
could make. It was the Idea of <hi>Hortensia;</hi>
which was pretiously preserved in those
places, where she had been seen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and was
formed with pleasure in those where she
had never been.</p>
            <p>Such was the Conduct of <hi>Hortensia,</hi>
such was her Condition, when the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chess
of <hi>York,</hi> her Relation, passed through
<hi>Chambery</hi> in the way to find the Duke
her <hi>Husband.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The singular merit of the Duchess,
her Beauty, her Wit, and her Virtue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd
<hi>Hortensia</hi> with a desire to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
her, but her Affairs would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
her. So she was obliged to delay
that Voyage till a more favourable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity;
the curiosity she had to see one
of the greatest Courts in the World, which
she had never beheld, fortified her in this
Resolution: the death of the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi>
determined it.</p>
            <p>This Prince had the same Sentiments
of her as all People that had the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to behold her. He had admired her at
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:44397:101"/>
               <hi>Turin,</hi> and this Admiration Madam of
<hi>Savoy</hi> interpreted to be Love. A jealous
black Impression produced a behaviour
very little obliging towards the person
who hád caused it.</p>
            <p>There needed no more than this to
oblige <hi>Hortensia</hi> to depart out of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
where the new Regent was in a
manner absolute. To separate herself
from the Duchess of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and approach
the Duchess of <hi>York</hi> was but one and the
same Resolution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hortensia</hi> acquainted her Friends with
this determination, who imployed all
their Arguments to disswade her from it,
but 'twas in vain; never was seen so great a
profusion of Tears. As for her own part,
she was not insensible of the general Grief
that was occasioned by the thoughts of
her departure. Persons so lively affected
as they were, knew how to affect her.
In the mean time this Resolution was
taken up, and in spight of all their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grets
she concludes to depart.</p>
            <p>What other courage but that of <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensia</hi>
would have undertaken so long,
so difficult, and so dangerous a Voyage?</p>
            <p>Before she could accomplish it she must
traverse savage Nations, and Nations
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:44397:102"/>
that were up in arms; she must sweeten
the one, and make herself be respected
by the other.</p>
            <p>She understood not the Language of any
of these People, but they understood her.
Her eyes speak an universal Language,
which causes her to be understood by all
mankind.</p>
            <p>What Mountains, what Forests, what
Rivers had she not to pass? What did she
not suffer from the wind, the snow, and
the rains? What Dissiculties of the
ways, what Rigour of the season, what
mighty Inconveniences had she not to
struggle with, which yet did but little
Injury to her Beauty.</p>
            <p>Never did <hi>Helen</hi> appear so charming
as <hi>Hortensia</hi> was. She had the air, the
habit, and the equipage of a Queen of
the <hi>Amazons!</hi> She seem'd equally fit to
charm, and to fight.</p>
            <p>It was said, she went to give Love to
all the Princes, whom she was to meet
in her Passage, and to command all the
Troops which they commanded.</p>
            <p>The first of these things she had in
her Power, but it was not her design.
she made some Essay of the second; for
the Troops received her Orders more
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:44397:102"/>
voluntarily than those of their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</p>
            <p>After she had travell'd more than three
hundred Leagues she arriv'd at last at
<hi>Holland.</hi> She made no longer a stay at
<hi>Amsterdam</hi> than was necessary to view
the Rarities of so remarkable and famous
a City. After she had satisfied her cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
she came to the <hi>Brill,</hi> where she
embarqued for <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An extraordinary Tempest happened
in this Voyage, which lasted five days.
The Storm was as as furious as it was
long; and made the Seamen lose all their
Conduct and Resolution, and the Passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
all their hopes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hortensia</hi> alone was exempt from La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation;
less importunate with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to preserve her, than submitting and
resigning herself to its Will; But it had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
she should visit <hi>England.</hi> She land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there, and in a short time came safe
to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All People had a great curiosity to see
her. But the Ladies had a greater Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm
at her Arrival.</p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> who were in possession of
the Empire of Beauty saw It lost, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great regret, to a stranger; and 'tis
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:44397:103"/>
natural to be sensibly concerned for the
loss of the sweetest of all Vanities.</p>
            <p>So considerable an interest was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thing in the World that could unite
them. Old Enemies were reconciled;
those that were indifferent now began
to visit one another, and Friends link'd
themselves more strictly together than
before. This was the first Conspiracy
I beheld in <hi>England.</hi> A Conspiracy as
fatal to the Beauty of <hi>Hortensia,</hi> as the
the latter was to the Arms of the King
of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Confederates very well foresaw
their Misfortune, but not being willing
to advance it, they prepared to defend
an Interest, which was dearer to them
than that of their Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hortensia</hi> had nothing to defend her
but her Charms, and her Virtues. This
was enough to make her apprehensive of
nothing.</p>
            <p>After she had kept her Chamber some
time, less to recover herself from the
Fatigues of her Journey, than to have
her habits made, she appear'd at <hi>Whitehall,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Fair Beauties of <hi>Whitehall</hi> give way,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Hortensia</hi> do's her Charms display.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:44397:103"/>
She comes, she comes! Resign the day,</l>
                  <l>She must reign, and you obey.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>From that day they never disputed the
Prize with her in publick: But they
carried on a secret War against her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
doors; where all ended either in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Injuries which never arrived to her
knowledge, or in vain Murmurs which
she despised.</p>
            <p>The World now beheld an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
turn. Those that were the most
violently transported against her were the
first that imitated her. They would dress
and apparel themselves like her: but this
was neither her dress nor habit. For
her Person gave a new Grace to every
thing she wore, and those that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to take up her Air and her
dress, wanted the principal thing, her
Person.</p>
            <p>One might say of her what was said
of the late <hi>Madam, All the World imitates
her, and no one resembles her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for what regarded the Men, she
made Subjects of all those judicious Persons
that beheld her. They were only Men
of ill Palates and worse wit, that could
defend the Remainder of their Liberty
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:44397:104"/>
against her; Happy in the Conquests she
made! more happy in those she did not
make!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hortensia</hi> no sooner arriv'd to any place
but she established a House there, which
caused the rest to be abandoned. The
greatest Freedom in the World was to
be seen there, and an equal Discretion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
every one was more commodiously treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there than at home, and more respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
than at Court.</p>
            <p>'Tis true they dispute often there, but
then it is with more Knowledge than
Heat; 'tis not done out of a Spirit of
Contradiction, but fully to discover the
Matters in agitation: rather to animate
Conversation than to exasperate it.</p>
            <p>The Playing there is very inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
'tis the Diversion only that makes
the Play. You can neither discover in
their faces the fear of losing, nor a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
for what is lost. Some of them
are so far disinterested, that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
with rejoicing at their own lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and afflicting themselves at their
winning.</p>
            <p>Play is follow'd by the best Repasts in
the World. One may there see every thing
that comes from <hi>France</hi> for-the delicate,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:44397:104"/>
and all that comes from the <hi>Indies</hi> for
the curious; and the Common Meats be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
rare by the exquisite Sawces which
are bestowed upon them.</p>
            <p>'Tis not a Plenty which may cause a
Dissipation to be feared; 'tis not Fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
that shews either Avarice or Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury.</p>
            <p>They do not here love an Oeconomy
niggard and sullen, that contents it self
merely with satisfying the necessities of
Life, and affords nothing to the Pleasure
of it. They love a good order that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes
every that can be desired, and
that wisely manages the use of it, so that
nothing may be wanting.</p>
            <p>There is certainly nothing so well
regulated as this Family. But <hi>Hortensia</hi>
diffuses throughout the whole I do not
know what sort of an easy air. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
free and natural that conceals the
administration of it. One would conclude
that things moved of themselves, so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
is the ordering of them, and so diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to be perceived.</p>
            <p>Let <hi>Hortensia</hi> change her Lodgings,
no Man can know whether she has chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them. The difference of places is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible.
Wherever she goes we see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:44397:105"/>
but her; and if we see her, we
see every thing. The Novelty, the Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is not to be perceived. She alone
attracts our Eyes, and employs them.</p>
            <p>Here no Visits are made, properly
speaking. These Devoirs and Respects
to any one but her are mere slavery.
The most regular Visitants secretly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
themselves for stealing from her
the time of looking after her Family.
They never come soon enough, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
depart late enough. They go to bed
with the Regret to have quitted her, and
they rise with the desire to behold her
afresh.</p>
            <p>But how great is the uncertainty of
our human condition! At the time when
<hi>Hortensia</hi> seemed to enjoy her Health
the best; at the time when she innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enjoy'd all the pleasure which Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
desires, and Reason does not prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit;
that she tasted the Sweetness to
see herself beloved and esteemed by all
the World; that those Ladies who had
opposed themselves to her establishment,
were charmed by her Conversation;
that she had as it were extinguished self-love
in the Soul of her Friends, every
one expressing the same kind Sentiments
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:44397:105"/>
for her, which it is natural to have for
ones self: At the time when the most
lovely of the fair Sex forbore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with her Beauty; that Envy had
concealed itself in the bottom of their
Hearts, that all repining against her was
private, or appeared ridiculous as soon as
she begun to appear. At this happy time
an extraordinary indisposition seizes her,
and we were upon the point to lose her,
in spight of all her Charms, in spight of
all our Admiration, and Love.</p>
            <p>You were just a perishing, <hi>Hortensia,</hi>
and so were we. You through the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
of your pains, we through that of
our affliction. But is was more than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
simply afflicted. We felt all that
you did, and were sick as you were. Your
unequal moments sometimes carried you
to the brink of Death; and sometimes
recalled you to life. We were subject to
all the Accidents of your Sickness, and
to know how it fared with you, it was
not at all necessary to enquire after your
Health. We needed only to observe in
what state we our selves were.</p>
            <p>Praised be that universal dispenser of
good and evil; praised be Heaven that
has restored you to our Vows, and given

living, and so are we; but we have not
as yet recovered the cruel fright that
this danger gave us, and a cruel Idea
still remains behind, which makes us more
lively conceive what must one day befall
you.</p>
            <p>Nature will destroy this beauteous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick,
which it has taken so much pains
to frame. Nothing can cxempt it from
that lamentable Law to which we are all
subject.</p>
            <p>She who was so visibly distinguished
from others during her life, will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
with the meanest at her death.</p>
            <p>And do you then complain, you that
have only an ordinary Genius, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Merit, or an indifferent Beauty, do
you complain that you must dy? Don't
murmur, injust as ye are, <hi>Hortensia</hi> will
dy like you. A time will come (Oh that
this infortunate time would never come)
when we may say of this Miracle.</p>
            <q>
               <l>She's now resolv'd to common Clay,</l>
               <l>She that did Beauty's Empire sway,</l>
               <l>Fate, cruel Fate would have it so,</l>

               <l>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:44397:107"/>
Now vulgar Souls learn to resign your Breath,</l>
               <l>And without murmuring submit to Death.</l>
            </q>
            <p>In my opinion a Funeral Oration ought
not to end without leaving some Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the Auditors. After we have
drawn their Tears for a Person who has
quitted the World, 'Tis usual to tell them
the party deceased is in heaven, that the
Idea of his Happiness may form in us
some Sentiments of Joy.</p>
            <p>Let us pass, let us pass from Grief to
Pleasure, we have already wept because
we saw <hi>Hortensia</hi> upon the point to dye.
Let us now rejoyce to behold her living.
Our Sovereign is well. What can be
greater? What can we desire more?</p>
            <p>There are but few Reigns which we
are not glad to see finished. The lightest
Chains are heavy to those that bear
them. They appear easie to none but
those that wear them not. Your Reign,
Madam, still continues, and we wish it
may continue for ever. Your Subjects find
themselves happy under your Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
There is not one of them but
looks upon his Liberty at the greatest
Misfortune.</p>
            <p>

Set us rejoyce, our Sovereign is living,
and we live. To live is the chief of
humane Blessings; and to live for her is
the chief of them. 'Tis the sweetest and
the best use we can make of our Life.</p>

            <head>REFLECTIONS
Upon the
DOCTRINE
OF
EPICURUS,</head>
            <byline>By Mr. <hi>Brown.</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>EVery one knows that the greatest
part of Men condemn <hi>Epicurus,</hi>
and reject his Doctrine, not only
as unworthy of a Philosopher, but what
is more severe, as dangerous to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth:
They solemnly declare that
a Man becomes vicious from the very
moment he declares himself one of his
Disciples; that his Opinions are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:44397:109"/>
contrary to good manners, and thus
they cover his Name with all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Scandal and Infamy.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding all this, the <hi>Stoicks,</hi>
who, were his greatest Enemies, never
treated him so ill: they combated his
Hypothesis, but never invaded his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
and the Books they have left
us plainly discover in abundance of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the singular Esteem and Respect they
had for him.</p>
            <p>From whence then proceeds this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
difference? and why don't we
rather follow the opinion of the wise?
It is an easie matter to give the true
Reason of it, which is, that we don't do
as they do. We don't vouchsafe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
our selves of any thing, but blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
adhere to what is told us: without
instructing our selves in the nature of
things we judge those to be the best that
have the most Examples, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Crowd of Admirers; we don't follow
Reason, but only the resemblances of it.
We stifly retain our Errors because they
are countenanced by those of other Men.
We rather chuse to believe implicitly than
to put our selves to the expence of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and are so strangely injust as to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:44397:109"/>
conclude, that the Antiquity of an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is a sufficient Title to authorise us
to defend it, even in defiance to reason it
self.</p>
            <p>This, in short, is one of the Causes
that has made <hi>Epicurus</hi> fall into the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Hatred, aud has prevail'd with almost
the generality of Mankind to discard
him out of the number of Philosophers.
We have condemn'd him without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descending
to know him, we have banish'd
him without hearing him speak for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
nay we have deny'd him the justice
to explain his own Sentiments.</p>
            <p>But after all, in my Opinion the chief
and indeed the most plausible Pretence
that Men have had to despise his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
has been the irregular Life of
some Libertines, who as they abused the
Name of this Philosopher, so they have
ruined the Reputation of his Sect.</p>
            <p>These People have recommended their
own Vices under the reputation of his
Wisdom; they have corrupted his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
by their ill Manners, and came
over in vast Numbers to his Party, only
because they understood that Pleasure
was mightily commended by them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:44397:110"/>
All the Mischief is, that they would
not know what this Pleasure was, and
what these Praises meant; that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
themselves with his Name in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral;
that they have made it serve as a
Veil to their Debaucheries; and that they
quoted the Authority of so great a Man
to support the Disorders of their Life.
So that instead of profiting by the sage
Counsels of this Philosopher, or corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
their vitious Inclinations in his
School, they have lost the only good
quality they had left them, and that is,
the shame of sinning.</p>
            <p>They have arrived to such a pitch as
to commend those very Actions they
blushed at formerly; they take a Pride
in those Vices they had the Discretion
to conceal before; and at last without the
least remorse or shame, they blindly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the Pleasure they brought along
with them, and not that which he would
have taught them.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the World has passed
judgment by these Appearances, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
that a sort of People who called
themselves Philosophers, were extremely
debauched, that they made a publick
Profession of their Crimes, that they ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:44397:110"/>
               <hi>Epicurus</hi> to authorise their Idleness,
their Impurity, and their Lewdness, they
made no difficulty to pronounce the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of this Philosopher to be pernicious,
and to compare his Disciples to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanest
Animals in nature.</p>
            <q>—Epicuri de grege porci.</q>
            <p>The Affairs of <hi>Epicurus</hi> had been in
a very ill condition of some disinterested
Persons had not taken care to do him ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice;
and freed themselves from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
of the Multitude, whose Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are generally opposite to those of the
wise.</p>
            <p>For some generous Persons have been
found, who have throughly informed
themselves of this Philosopher's way of
living; who scorning to be determined
by the common Belief, have penetrated
farther into the matter, and after a due
Inquiry have produced very authentick
Testimonies both of the Probity of his
Person, and the Purity of his Doctrine.</p>
            <p>These Gentlemen have published in the
face of the World, that his Pleasure was
as severe as the Virtue of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> and
that a Man who had a mind to be as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:44397:111"/>
bauched as <hi>Epicurus,</hi> must also for his
Comfort be as sober as <hi>Zeno.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to say the truth, it is highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
that a Man to whom his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
erected several Statues; whose Friends
inhabited all the Cities of <hi>Greece;</hi> who
loved the worship of the Gods, and the
Prosperity of his Country; who was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
for his Piety to his Parents, his
Liberality to his Brothers, and his sweet
Carriage to his Slaves; whose Modesty
hindred him from medling with State-Affairs,
and whose ordinary Sustenance was
nothing but Bread and Water: It is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
incredible, I say, that such a Man should
ever give Precepts of Debauchery, or teach
his Disciples the Practice of those Vices,
which he naturally abhorred.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, as if this excellent
Person had been apprehensive, that the
Title he gave his Philosophy might be
so far abused as to encourage wicked In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations;
and that Men in after Ages
might calumniate this Pleasure, wherein
he placed the Sovereign good: as if he
had foreseen the unjust Aversion of the
following Ages, and the Irregularities of
some Libertines that would abuse his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
he took care himself to make an
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:44397:111"/>
Apology for it, and satisfied the World,
that the Pleasure he speaks of was au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stere
and sober.</p>
            <p>I am not so vain as to believe that
my bare Word will be taken for this,
and therefore will produce one of his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
wherein any one may be able to read
his true Sentiments. It is addressed to
one <hi>Meneceus,</hi> and now pray observe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
what manner he explains himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Although, my dear</hi> Meneceus, <hi>we say
that Pleasure is the end of Man, we would
by no means be supposed to speak of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
lewd Pleasures that proceed from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance
and Sensuality. This ill Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
can only be made by those Persons who
are wholly ignorant of our Precepts, or else
combat them; who absolutely reject them, or
pervert the true meaning of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this single Fragment one may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how careful he was to preserve the
Innocence of his Doctrine against Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and Ignorance; that he well foresaw
that only these two things were capable
to decry it; and in effect, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
observed, they have ruined his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
with the greatest part of the
World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:44397:112"/>
His Life, as sober and innocent as it
was, could not escape censure, or free
him from an infinite number of Lies and
Invectives: But those that have written
it, after having recounted the several Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
of his Enemies, have immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
refuted them; and at the same time
that they published our Philosophers, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
have likewise published his Apology.</p>
            <p>As it is not my Design to entertain
you with a Narration of his Actions, but
only to defend his Pleasure, I shall send
you back to <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> for the
Account of his Life; and shall content my
self to Philosophize upon the nature of
this Pleasure, that has created him so
many Enemies; and examine whether it
is of such a hainous Character, that we
ought to cashier those Persons from the
number of honest Men that defend and
follow it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To live according to Nature, and not to
feel any Pain, is what</hi> Epicurus <hi>calls living
voluptuously.</hi> Now I am of opinion, that
there is nothing in this that deserves to
be condemned; that such a Life as this
does not merit censure; that no Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
in the World was ever so severe as
to disapprove it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:44397:112"/>
To live according to Nature is to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
right Reason. The bounds she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
us are those of Innocence. There
is nothing in her but what is equitable
and equal.</p>
            <p>'Tis not along of her that Avarice
came into the World. She industriously
conceal'd Gold in the entrails of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
Element, and we have dug it from
thence.</p>
            <p>She is not the cause of that Ambition
that torments us; she brings us all equal
into the World, and so she takes us out
of it.</p>
            <p>We don't differ one from another, any
farther than we corrupt her. Do you
think it is she that excites us to Pleasures?
The Poets themselves that have lodged
all manner of Extravagancies in Heaven,
that so they might sin with Authority,
and who have represented <hi>Iupiter</hi> weak
and vitious, out of a design to copy a
God in their own irregular Lives, were
never guilty of the Presumptien to do it.
They have preserved its Purity whole
and entire; and in describing her Age,
have not taken notice of the Luxury that
became so rampant in the following ones.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:44397:113"/>
Hear what they say, and they will
tell you, that Acorns were then the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
of Mankind, that Rivers quench'd
their Thirst, that they dwelt in Caves,
that they had no Apparel to defend them
from the Cold, and that they followed
Nature in all their Actions.</p>
            <p>I know very well, that things did not
pass after this manner, and that the first
Inhabitants of the earth never lived in
this strange simplicity, which is more
proper to the stupidity of Beasts, than
the politeness of Men. The Poets have
carried Matters too far, but their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was, that our Extravagancies don't
proceed from Nature, that she never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
them to us, that it is not
she which says;
<q>
                  <l>Ales Phasiacis petita Colchis,</l>
                  <l>Atque Afrae Volucres placent palato</l>
                  <l>Quod non sunt faciles.</l>
               </q>
That she did not invent vain gawdy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipages,
purple Habits, and a long train
of Lacqueys; and in fine, that it is we
who abuse the Gifts of Heaven, and the
Advantages we have over the rest of
the Creation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:44397:113"/>
What then can be the meaning of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
according to Nature? must we ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
from those things she has made us
Masters of? I don't pretend that, but am
rather inclin'd to believe, we ought to
make use of them, provided it be done
pursuant to the Dictates of Nature.</p>
            <p>We ought to use these things after
such a manner, that we may easily part
with them; we ought to be Masters of
them, and not Slaves to them; we ought
not impatiently desire to attain them,
not to abandon our selves to despair up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Loss of them. Let us quietly
enjoy them as occasion serves, but not
search after them with inquietude and
pain.</p>
            <p>There is no condition that does not
sit well upon a wise Man. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
I shall never quarrel with a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher
for living in a Palace, but shall
at the same time not excuse him if he
can't content himself with a Cottage. I
shall not be scandalized to behold him in
the apparel of Kings, provided he has not
their Ambition.</p>
            <p>Let <hi>Aristippus</hi> possess the riches of <hi>Croe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
it matters not; he will throw them
away as soon as they incommode him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:44397:114"/>
Let <hi>Plato</hi> sit down at the Table of
<hi>Dionysius</hi> the Tyrant. Sometimes he will
eat nothing but Olives.</p>
            <p>We don't at all blame the possession of
Riches; we only condemn those Persons
that are mere Slaves to their wealth.</p>
            <p>Poverty of it self will never make us
wise; it may indeed render us uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of committing certain Disorders, but
then there are others which it cannot
remedy.</p>
            <p>The sordid eating of the <hi>Cynics</hi> did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
contribute to their Tranquillity, nor
to their Modesty.</p>
            <p>Ambition follow'd <hi>Diogenes</hi> into his
Tub; and there it was he had the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
to command <hi>Alexander</hi> the
proudest of all Men.</p>
            <p>All external Accidents will become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
to us, if we have moderation of
Soul; that is, if we are wise, and follow
the Dictates of Nature.</p>
            <p>I own 'tis harder to follow them in
abundance than in necessity; and that
our Moderation has much less to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
from the miseries of Adversity, than
the snares of Plenty: But then 'tis infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
more glorious to surmount them,
and the loss of false Joys does only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:44397:114"/>
to us the Possession of solid ones.</p>
            <p>A Man does but faintly, if at all, relish
that Felicity which costs him nothing,
and for which he's obliged to mere
chance. It is necessary that Wisdom
should give it us: nay sometimes it is
necessary that Pain itself should lead us
to Pleasure.</p>
            <p>One that enters the Lists at the <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick</hi>
Games with a design to fight, in
case no body offers to appear against him,
may well enough be crowned, but for
this does not deserve the Title of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious.</p>
            <p>Storms and Tempests give Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Pilots. Had the Chastity of <hi>Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lope</hi>
been never put to the Proof, it might
have been said of her, that she wanted
Gallants to debauch her.</p>
            <p>Let us not therefore fly the World;
let us not abandon the Court; let us
not hide our selves in a Desart, from
whence Philosophy drew the first Men.
Let us possess Riches, let us not refuse to
enter upon publick Offices. If we are
wise, we shall enjoy these things without
the least danger; we shall steer safely by
these Rocks, we shall behold all these
Objects with an indifferent eye. And
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:44397:115"/>
if they are taken from us, we shall testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
to all the World, by our not casting
our Eyes back upon them, that we despise
them, and that we were never wedded to
them.</p>
            <p>It is scandalous for a wise Man to fly,
and to be subdued by his Desires, which
as they are not in reality according to
Nature, so they can boast of no other
Credit, than what the depraved Opinion
of Mankind bestows upon them.</p>
            <p>I have thus in part explained wherein
the Pleasure of the <hi>Epicureans</hi> consists,
what it is they mean by living up to
Nature, in short what their Doctrine and
true Sentiments are. Let us now consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whether this Opinion deserves the
hatred of Mankind, or whether we have
any reason to ridicule it. Let us examine
whether this Pleasure favours Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Excess, or whether any thing in
the World can be more sober and chast
than it.</p>
            <p>If you enquire of <hi>Epicurus</hi> what it is
to live voluptuously, he will answer that
it is to disengage our selves from too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
a pursuit of Riches, to resist and
suppress evil Desires, to contemn Honours,
to make our selves Masters of Fortune;
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:44397:115"/>
and in a Word, to enjoy an absolute and
uninterrupted Peace and repose of mind.</p>
            <p>All his Precepts centre here, true sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Pleasure in only to be found here;
and in effect we ought only to search
her here,; not in a brutal satisfaction of
the Senses, nor in any violent emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Appetites.</p>
            <p>It is too pure to depend wholly upon
the Body; Reason is both the Mistress
and Rule of it, the Senses are only its
Servants: and therefore whatever migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
delights we may expect to find in
good eating, or in the Pleasures of the
eye, or in Perfumes and Musick, yet if
we don't come to these things with a
Calmness and Tranquillity of Soul, we
shall find our selves miserably disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
we shall abuse our minds with a false
Joy, and embrace a Phantom, a mere ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Pleasure for Pleasure itself.</p>
            <p>Consume, if you are so minded, all
the odoriferous Wood of <hi>Arabia</hi> the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
revel in the arms of <hi>Venus,</hi> feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Nectar and Ambrosia, enjoy all the
Pleasures that the most fruitful Poet ever
formed in his Imagination. All this will
but create Vexation and Bitterness, if
we feel the least Inquietude within;
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:44397:116"/>
and our Melancholy will force us to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
in the midst of these sweet Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments.</p>
            <p>I will give you an Example of this,
that shall fully convince you how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
it is for a Man to relish Pleasure
when his Mind is disturbed.</p>
            <p>You have without question read of the
mighty Feast which <hi>Tigellinus</hi> made for
<hi>Nero,</hi> and therefore may recall this great
scene of Intemperance into your memory,
the Luxury and Fame of which make no
little noise even in our times. In all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
it was the greatest Effort that the
most excessive Prodigality, joyned to the
most exquisite Niceness, could make; in
short, it was impossible for sensuality to
advance a step beyond it. <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s
Pond was more chosen to be the Scene
of this extraordinary Feast it was kept
on board a most magnificent Vessel, which
being drawn by an infinite number of
others seem'd to move insensibly. All
these Vessels were curiously inriched with
Gold and Ivory; the Rowers were so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
beautiful Boys, or to speak better, so
many Cupids or Gods of Love. The
Ocean furnished this Entertainment with
Fish; and the several Provinces of the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:44397:116"/>
Empire with a prodigious variety of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Dishes. Not to be tedious, the great
Plenty of it was only to be matched with
the extreme choiceness of the Provisions.
I don't speak of the infamous Houses ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
on the banks of this Pond, that were all
fill'd with Ladies of Quality. I don't speak
of the Courtisans that were here beheld
naked. The Night itself contributed to
the Pleasure of this Debauch; its Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
was overcome by an infinite number
of Illuminations; and its Silence agreably
disturbed with the harmony of several
Consorts.</p>
            <p>Would you now know whether <hi>Nero</hi>
took pleasure in all these things, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he parted from the Banquet satisfied
and content? You need only consider with
your self that he carried the remembrance
of his Crimes, and the remorse of his
Conscience about him. Having done this,
you'll soon conclude that Despair accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
him, that he suffered as much as
the greatest Criminal, and that although
his outside carried the shew of a Triumph,
yet he was acting a terrible Tragedy in
his Soul.</p>
            <p>If he felt any Joy 'twas that of frantick
Persons; he owed his Pleasure to his Fury
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:44397:117"/>
or his Drunkenness, and was no longer
happy than he was abandoned by his
Reason.</p>
            <p>I say the same thing of those Sots that
accompanied him; for I cannot believe,
that either <hi>Seneca,</hi> or <hi>Thraseas Paetus,</hi> or
<hi>Bareas Soranus,</hi> who lived up to Nature
amidst the universal corruption of their
Age, were in the number of his Guests:
without doubt he had none but such
whom a Life full as irregular as his own
made him love; who advised him to all his
Crimes, who were the Executors of them,
and before whom he might not be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to blush.</p>
            <p>A Herd of such profligate Wretches
never aspired to true Happiness; there
was not one wise Man in the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
now Pleasure has no influence on
Minds that are corrupted and spoiled with
all sorts of Debauchery and Excess.</p>
            <q>
               <l>—Quemvis mediâ erue turbâ</l>
               <l>Aut ob avaritiam, aut miserâ ambitione
laborat.</l>
               <l>Hic nuptarum insanit amoribus, hic pue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorum.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:44397:117"/>
In short, they lay open to all those Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that disturb the Peace of the Soul,
and consequently were not in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to relish the Pleasure we speak of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I could wish that</hi> Fpicurus <hi>had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at this Assembly, and declared his
Opinion in the face of the World. I am
confident he would have spoke the truth
before</hi> Nero <hi>himself; that he would never
have dreaded Death, which was looked
upon by him to be a thing indifferent,
and am apt to imagine he would have
explained himself after this manner:</hi> Oh
unfortunate Prince! how strangely art thou
infatuated to believe, that Pleasure consists
in Intemperance, which is as far removed
from all Excess, as thou art from the true
felicity of Life. Thou draggest thy misery
about thee wherever thou goest, and in spight
of all thy endeavours, thou art not able to
purchase one moments repose from thy Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Load thy Tables with the most exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
Dainties that were ever eaten; drink
the most generos Wines that <hi>Greece</hi> and
<hi>Italy</hi> can afford; and after this wallow in
all the most abominable Varieties of Luxury
and Incontinence. Thou wilt find nothing
there that can satisfie thee, and when thy
body is surfeited with them, thy mind will
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:44397:118"/>
still be upon the search after Pleasure. These
are not the things that render Life happy;
it is Prudence only which causes the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
good; which will teach thee to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
thy desires according to Nature, and
in this regular state thou wilt find what thou
wilt never be able to find in these Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
If thou wantest any thing cast thy
eyes upon this common Mother, and she will
give thee wherewith to content thy self ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily.
Art thou thirsty? She has carefully
provided Rivers and Fountains in every
place to quench it. Art thou hungry? there
is no part of the Vniverse so barren, but
thou mayst meet with Fruits to relieve thy
self: if thou canst not be satisfied with these
things, much less shalt thou ever be satisfied
with excess. Pleasure is nothing but a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Pain. Consult thy hunger and
thirst, and they will make thee find Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in the simplicity of Nature; and Bread
and Water will supply the Place of the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest
Repast thou canst think of, when once
thou hast need of them. At present thou
art not in this Condition, thou dost not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
thy stomach time to digest thy Meat:
thy Intemperance daily lays in a new stock
of Crudities, and hastens that Death which
gives thee so many cruel Apprehensions.
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:44397:118"/>
Thus thou sittest down at Feasts without
finding any pleasure in them, because thou
dost commit a violence upon Nature, and force
her to obey thy desires: but know for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
truth, that they are contrary to her,
and that the Irregularities of thy Body dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the light of thy Reason. Don't imagine
therefore to find any relish in those Pleasures
thou proposest to thy self: it is only to be
found in those that are permitted by Nature.
The Ambition of servants carries them to a
fond longing after Crowns. If they were once
Kings, they would then desire to be the only
Monarchs of the World; and when arrived
to that heighth they would be calling out
for Incense and Sacrifices. The Fable of the
Giants instructs us, that Earth has presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to dispute the Pre-eminence with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
'Tis the same in all other wild disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
desires: No one is happy but the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that knows how to regulate them; and
as this can be done by no one but a wise
Man, whose peculiar Talent it is, so it only
belongs to him to command the Vniverse.
He, and only he, can extract Pleasure from
all things; he alone uses these delights with
sobriety, and despises them even while he
possesses them. As for thee, who dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
the race of <hi>Augustus,</hi> and who art the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:44397:119"/>
infamy of Mankind, over whom the Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Gods has placed thee: do what
thou wilt, thou wilt be always miserable,
thou wilt always carry thy Tormenters about
thee: thou wilt never free thy self one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
from the horrors of thy Conscience, and
in the midst of the Regale thou wilt not tast
one drop of Wine, which shall not represent
to thy Imagination the Blood of those Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents,
that thy Cruelty has shed.</p>
            <p>Behold, unless I am mistaken, what <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus</hi>
wonld have said upon this occasion.
Behold how he would have justified his
Philosophy; behold how he would have
reprimanded the Vices of the Emperour.</p>
            <p>But since it is utterly impossible that
the Mind, which is the Judge of Pleasure,
should perfectly relish it, if the Body,
whose Ministry it uses, does languish un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any torment; <hi>Epicurus</hi> teaches, that
all privation of bodily pain, as well as
that of the mind, is necessary towards
the consummation of that sovereign Good,
which he calls Pleasure.</p>
            <p>And to say the truth, there is so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
a Communication between the
Mind and the Flesh, that it is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to separate their Pleasures and their
Suffering. It is hard to comprehend how
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:44397:119"/>
the Soul can be perfectly happy, while
Diseases afflict its Companion the Body:
how it can think of Joy whilst the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of pain extorts Complaints from it,
or how it can be sensible of Pleasure, whilst
it is present at all those Places where the
Indisposition rages.</p>
            <p>Let the <hi>Stoicks</hi> boast as long as they
please of the insensibility of their wise
Man, and of this rigorous Virtue that
laughs at Pain. When they come once
to the suffering part, they'll find that
their Body is by no means of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and that although these Discourses
are really magnificent and lofty, yet for
all that they are neither to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to Nature, nor to Truth.</p>
            <p>I will not justifie this Proposition by the
Examples of the generality of their Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers.
I will not cite any name which
they may have the least Pretence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
nor urge any Man upon them whose
Virtue may be called in question: <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi>
alone shall assert the truth of what
I have delivered.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Hercules,</hi> who is reckoned amongst
the Gods, whom so many Exploits have
made immortal, and whom the Stoicks
have chose for a perfect model of their
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:44397:120"/>
Strength and Wisdom. Let us a little
reflect upon the dying behaviour of this
Heroe, and consider the last Actions of
his Life. Without doubt this invincible
Man will depart out of the World, as
he came into it, by doing something He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical
and great. To be sure he'll not
let a syllable drop from him that may
dishonour his mighty Exploits, or seem
unworthy of his former Character.</p>
            <p>We shall find our selves extremely mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
if we are of this Opinion. The
force of his Pain triumphs over his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
his Constancy yields to the rage
of the Poyson that burns him. He does
not only complain, but he weeps, he cries,
he stamps, he flings about
<q>
                  <l>—At circum gemunt petrae</l>
                  <l>Locrorum, &amp; alta Euboeae promontoria.</l>
               </q>
And by these his last effects of Rage and
Despair he quits his life to go and take
his place amongst the Gods.</p>
            <p>Let the Stoicks therefore come over
to our party; Let them amuse us no
more with their insensibility, let them not
pretend that their wise Man can be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
amidst his Tortures, and let them
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:44397:120"/>
not despise pain with their usual insolence
since they see <hi>Hercules</hi> himself could not
support himself under the Pressure of it.</p>
            <p>But if they answer, that the Poet has
been guilty of a great Solecism in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
<hi>Hercules</hi> after this manner,
and continue to give other Relations of
this Heroe contrary to the Authority of
Books, and the Consent of the Theatre,
<hi>Posidonius</hi> heretofore one of the Masters
of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and the greatest of all the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks,
(for so this celebrated Disciple of his
calls him) will furnish us with a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Example, and we shall see one of the
strongest Pillars of the <hi>Porch</hi> shaken by
a slight Indisposition.</p>
            <p>The Gout which at last attacqued this
Philosopher, proved to be the rock on
which his Constancy split. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of his pain with as much impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
as any ordinary man would have
done: and tho he reproached it by vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that all its Efforts should never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
him to own that it was an Evil,
yet he could not forbear to afflict himself
with it, to complain of it, and herein
he testified more Opiniatretè than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
and Reason.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:44397:121"/>
It seems that <hi>Cicero</hi> was scandalized
at weakness of this wise Man, or at least
that he was astonished at it. <hi>I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held,</hi>
says he, Possidonius <hi>the greatest Man
amongst the Stoicks suffer the pains of the
Gout with as little Resolution and Bravery
as my Landlord</hi> Nichomachus <hi>the</hi> Tyrian,
<hi>whom he esteemed but as an ordinary Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed I am so far from believing
that the Felicity of Humane Life is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible
with pain, that I am of Opinion
it would be the Action of a wise Man
to quit it, in case he were not able to set
such an uncomfortable Attendant as some
distance from him. And although I have
the memory of <hi>Maecenas</hi> in great Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and think that no one ought to
mention his Name but with the profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
respect; yet I could wish, if it were
possible to be done, that some Verses of
his were utterly lost, and that he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
inform'd us, that he was more fond
of a wretched Life than (I don't say a
Philosopher) but a Man of the meanest
Courage ought to be.</p>
            <p>You cannot offer him Life upon never
so disadvantageous Terms, but he readily
accepts it. Let him be deformed it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
nothing, let him be crooked he still
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:44397:121"/>
comforts himself that he is alive. Let
him endure all the united Torments of
the most violent Diseases, he is still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
if they are not mortal; and though
you should condemn him to the most
cruel Death imaginable, yet, by his good
will, he would not be brought to quit
his Life, provided he could still preserve
it amidst the most terrible Punishments.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Debilem facito manu,</l>
               <l>Debilem pede, coxâ,</l>
               <l>Tubber astrue gibberum,</l>
               <l>Lubricos quate dentes</l>
               <l>Vita dum superest, bene est.</l>
               <l>Hanc mihi vel acutâ</l>
               <l>Si sedeam cruce, sustine.</l>
            </q>
            <p>His effeminacy, no doubt on't, dictated
these Verses to him, whilst he tasted all
the pleasures of Life. He had never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally
known what pain was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and I dare boldly aver, That if he
had found himself in this lamentable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of his own chusing, he would have
earnestly desired Death to rid him of his
Torments.</p>
            <p>By this 'tis an easy matter to conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that <hi>Maecenus,</hi> was a Man of Pleasure,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:44397:122"/>
but not an <hi>Epicurean;</hi> since those Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
had too elevated a Soul to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend
to such ignominious Conditions.
They were less apprehensive of Death than
of Pain, and sometimes renounced Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
for the sake of Pain.</p>
            <p>And the reason is, That <hi>Epicurus</hi> very
well judging that the generality of Men,
corrupted by the enjoyment of Pleasures,
and suffering themselves blindly to be
hurried on by their Appetites, would not
be in a Condition to foresee the Griefs
and Afflictions, which would be the certain
consequences of their irregular Courses:
And on the other hand, fearing that the
love of Ease, and an effeminacy of Spirit,
join'd to the fear of Labour and Pain,
would oblige them to be deficient in
their respective Duties, and render them
inserviceable in the whole course of their
Life; he was of opinion that at some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
times, when a wise Man had full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to chuse for himself, and nothing
hindered him to pursue his full Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he might abandon himself to Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and entirely remove himself from
Pain: But then that there were certain
conjunctures, when the obligation of his
duty, and the necessity of affairs, ought to
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:44397:122"/>
incline him not to refuse Pain, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
Pleasure.</p>
            <p>It was this generous Maxim that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<hi>Cato Vticensis</hi> to dye. For although
he might have continued safe upon the
Ruins of his own Party, and <hi>Cesar</hi> would
have been proud to have given him his
Life: Nevertheless the Shame to survive
the loss of the publick Liberty, and the
Infamy of Servitude, would not permit
this generous Person to deliberate, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he ought to chuse the Pain of dying
gloriously, to avoid the Pleasure of living
after a manner, which to him seem'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of a Roman.</p>
            <p>It was this Maxim that obliged <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
to deliver himself into the hands of his
Enemies, where the cruelty of his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners
was less sensible to him, than
the remorse for having broke his word
would have been.</p>
            <p>It was this Maxim, which as it made
<hi>Fabricius</hi> despise the Treasures of the King
of <hi>Epirus,</hi> so it made him despise those
evil desires which attend the possession of
Riches, to preserve the repose of his
Mind, and the chief Pleasure.</p>
            <p>In fine, it was this Maxim which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
<hi>Cicero</hi> to declaim against <hi>Anthony,</hi>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:44397:123"/>
and to devote himself for the preservation
of the Republick, at a time when he
might have lived peaceably at his own
House, and enjoyed all the ease of Life,
and the diversions of Study.</p>
            <p>There is nothing commendable in the
World which cannot be reduced to this
Maxim; and whatever Heroick Actions
these great Men have done, you will find
that if they chose one Pain it was to avoid
a greater; and on the other hand, if they
have not practised certain Pleasures, it
was only to acquire by this abstinence
others that were more satisfactory and
solid.</p>
            <p>For to what other cause can you assign
their illustrious Actions? Do you imagine
that they parted out of this World with
so much Indifference? That they rejected
the possession of Gold? That they drew
dangerous Enemies upon their Heads, and
did not at the same time think that what
they did was either for their Profit or
Pleasure?</p>
            <p>Don't let us do them this Injustice.
Don't let us impute the effects of their
Wisdom to the efforts of their irregular
Minds. Let us believe that in all these
things they acted with Deliberation; and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:44397:123"/>
let us not represent them in a worse Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
than the most savage Animals;
which are never so strangely transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but that we may easily to conclude
whither the impetuosity of their Motion
tends.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cato</hi> parted with his Life; it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Burthen to him. He found much
less Pain to quit the World than to submit
to <hi>Cesar,</hi> whom he did not believe to be
an honest Man; and much more Pleasure
in not Living at all, than in Living un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
an ignominious Servitude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Regulus</hi> returned back to <hi>Carthage:</hi> had
he not done so, he had been accused of
Perfidiousness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fabricius</hi> could not be corrupted by
<hi>Pyrrhus:</hi> in this he testified his Integrity,
he served his Country; and with the bare
pleasure of refusing Riches, satisfied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
infinitely more, than if he accepted
them.</p>
            <p>In short, <hi>Cicero</hi> publickly reproached
<hi>Antony,</hi> and declared himself his capital
Enemy. If he had no reason to do so,
he deserves indeed to be blamed; but if
he designed to establish the tranquillity
of the Republick, though it were at the
expence of his own; if he endeavoured
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:44397:124"/>
to ruin <hi>Anthony</hi> that he might save <hi>Rome:</hi>
besides that by this Conduct he contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to the Safety of his Fellow Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
wherein his own was in a manner
wrapt up, so much more did he deserve
the praises of all the World, and the love
of the Roman People.</p>
            <p>These great Men, in Truth of History,
were not of the Family of <hi>Epicurus;</hi> nay
one of them, in some of his Writings, has
attempted to confute his Opinions; but
'tis sufficient that the Authority of their
Examples is to be found in the Doctrine
of this Philosopher; and that the World
should be informed that Virtue alone was
not their chief Motive, or at least that
what they call Virtue, ought to be named
Pleasure.</p>
            <p>Not but that several Persons of the
greatest Bravery have been bred up in
this School; who in a degenerate corrupt
Age have done Actions full as vigorous,
and noble, as those of the antient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
in the most Flourishing days of their
Republick.</p>
            <p>Under <hi>Nero</hi>'s Empire the World no less
admired the Death of <hi>Petronius,</hi> than they
had done that of <hi>Seneca.</hi> The Emperour's
Tutor did not purchase any Glory by
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:44397:124"/>
dying, which his Master of the Revels
did not afterwards acquire: And the
common opinion was, That this Stoick,
who had all along preached up a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Life, did not quit it more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerously,
than <hi>Petronius</hi> who studied all
the Pleasures of it.</p>
            <p>I am obliged for the honour of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carus</hi>
to enlarge somewhat upon the Life
and Death of this Courtier, who was one
of his greatest Disciples; and it will be
impossible for me to handle this Subject
without giving you a sensible Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Since you are not at this time of
day to be made acquainted with the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of illustrious Men, I am sure you
will not be unwilling to allow <hi>Petronius</hi>
a place in this number, and to observe,
<hi>en passant,</hi> the marks of his Generosity and
Wisdom.</p>
            <p>This famous <hi>Epicurean,</hi> far from resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
our modern Debauchees, that eat
and drink away their Estates, made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of a cultivated polite Luxury, and
minded nothing but refined Pleasures.
And as Industry and Diligence give a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
to the rest of Mankind, he was
the only Person in the World that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
it by his ease, and sitting still. His
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:44397:125"/>
Words and Actions were very free and
negligent; and as they show'd the candor
and sweetness of his Temper, and carried
an air of Simplicity, they were always
received with a great deal of Satisfaction
and Delight.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless this excellent Man, very
well knowing that there is a time when
a wise Man ought to quit the repose and
tranquillity of his Life to serve the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
abandon'd this happy way of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
when he was elected <hi>Proconsul of
Bithynia,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Consul;</hi> and by
acquitting himself worthily in these illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
Employs, he demonstrated by his
vigour, and by his conduct, that he was
capable of managing the greatest Affairs.</p>
            <p>At his leaving these Offices he betook
himself to his old way of Living, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
happening to become one of
<hi>Nero</hi>'s greatest Friends, although this
Prince had none but vitious Inclinations,
yet he was so strongly enchanted by his
merit, that he made him the Arbitrator
or Comptroller of all his Pleasures; and
believed that amidst all his Affluence and
Plenty, he ought not to esteem any
thing as sweet and agreeable, unless <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronius</hi>
first approved it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:44397:125"/>
I speak here only of Lawful Pleasures,
and Virtuous Delights for our <hi>Epicurean</hi>
was so far from having any Share in
<hi>Nero</hi>'s brutal Excesses, that this Prince
was in a strange Confusion when he knew
they were arrived to the knowledg of
<hi>Petronius,</hi> who reproached him with them
in some Writings; and caused <hi>Silia</hi> to be
punished, because he suspected that she
had revealed them to him.</p>
            <p>From that moment <hi>Tigellinus</hi> looked
upon him as his Competitor; and fearing
least by the means of this wise and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Pleasure, whereof he made Profession,
he might effect what <hi>Seneca</hi> could not by
the Authority of his Sect, that is, recal
<hi>Nero</hi> from the disorders of his Life; he
resolved to destroy him, imagining there
was no other way to establish himself
but by ruining him.</p>
            <p>To this end he awaked that Prince's
Cruelty, to which, as being his predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Passion, all his other Pleasures gave
way. He accuses <hi>Petronius</hi> with being
a Friend to <hi>Scevinus,</hi> who was in <hi>Piso</hi>'s
Conspiracy: he corrupts one of his Slaves
to impeach him, takes from him all means
of defending himself, and gets the greatest
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:44397:126"/>
part of his Domesticks to be chained and
imprisoned.</p>
            <p>In this condition, a Man of less Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity
would either have flatter'd himself
with the prospect of his Prince's Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
or at least have prolonged his Life to
the last extremity.</p>
            <p>As for him, he does quite otherwise: he
believ'd it was downright Weakness or
Shame to bear any longer the Torments
of Hope or Fear; and being resolved to
die, he searched a way to do it with
the same Tranquillity wherein he had
lived.</p>
            <p>So not being willing to quit life with
Precipitation, he ordered his Veins to
be opened, and afterwards to be bound
up again; and then taking the Ligatures
off as he pleased himself, he entertained
his Friends with agreable Conversations;
not affecting to make any serious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourses
before them, by which he might
pretend to the glory of Constancy.</p>
            <p>Nor would he employ the last Hours
of his Life in speaking of the Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Soul, nor of the Opinions of
the Philosophers; but having pitched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a more voluptuous and more natural
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:44397:126"/>
sort of Death, he rather chose to imitate
the Sweetness of a Swan; and therefore
caused some delightful moving Verses to
be repeated to him.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless he reserved a few moments
to dispose of his own Affairs; he reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
abundance of his Slaves, and some of
them he ordered to be punished. Then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the Hour of his Death approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
after he had used a little exercise he
laid himself peaceably down to sleep;
that his Death, which was violent, might
however resemble, as much as possible,
one that was fortuitous and natural.</p>
            <p>People, if they please, may still talk
of <hi>Socrates,</hi> and mightily commend the
Constancy, with which he drank the
Poison. <hi>Petronius</hi> is not at all inferiour
to him; nay he may justly pretend to
have the advantage over him; as having
abandoned a life infinitely more delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
than that of this wise <hi>Grecian,</hi> with
the same Tranquillity of mind, and the
same Equality of Soul.</p>
            <p>But that you may better comprehend
the great value of this Pleasure, which I
am here maintaining, I will give you
the Portraicture of a Man, who perfectly
possesses it, and by a Representation of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:44397:127"/>
his Counterpart, which I will afterwards
give you, put you out of all manner of
doubt, that <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s pleasure is to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
preferr'd.</p>
            <p>Imagine to your self a Man in perfect
health, plenty and affluence; innocently
enjoying the Delights of this World; his
Soul peaceable, serene and easie; possessing
always, and that in abundance, the most
agreable Pleasures of the Body and Mind;
being neither troubled with the presence,
nor threatned with the fear of any Grief
whatever.</p>
            <p>What Condition can you propose more
excellent, or more desirable than this? For
before a Person can arrive to this exalted
state, it is necessary that he possess a
Force of Soul proof against Death and
Pain; that his Mind be entirely disengaged
from all the false Opinions of the vulgar;
that it be not disturbed with impertinent
Fears; nay, that it suffer not the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
it has tasted to be lost; but always
entertain it self with a sweet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of them. This is to arrive to the
highest Period of Felicity; where the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of nothing can be pretended, as to
the full consummation of Humane Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:44397:127"/>
On the other hand let us represent to
our selves a Man o'erwhelmed with all
the Evils that can afflict Humane Nature;
deprived of all hopes to see them ever di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished;
neither feeling any present Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
nor having ever tasted any, nor da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to promise himself any for the time
to come: and after we have owned that
nothing can be imagined more miserable
than this Condition, let us at the same
time confess, that nothing can be more
happy than the voluptuous <hi>Epicurean.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if you think that this happy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
whose Picture I have drawn, is no
where to be found but only in my own
Imagination; and that so perfect a Scene
of Felicity cannot be among Men, any
otherwise than in Idea; I protest you have
wrong Sentiments both of Humane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and the goodness of Heaven; and
I am obliged to draw you out of this
Errour, that you may no longer mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
at our Misery, and the Injustice of
our Destiny.</p>
            <p>I find this Original done by the hand
of one of the greatest Masters, placed in
the Cabinet of one of the most curious
Authors that ever writ. It is Felicity it
self painted under the Character of <hi>Orata,</hi>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:44397:128"/>
for so do's <hi>Cicero</hi> call him, and here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
a faithful Translation of what he
recounts concerning his Happiness.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Nothing was wanting in <hi>Orata,</hi> (a
Man extremely rich, very polite, and
very delicate) of all that contributes to
make a Man live voluptuously, and to
make him be loved, and to enjoy a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and entire health. For he possessed
a very plentiful Fortune in the finest
Country in the World; he had always
store of Friends about him, serviceable,
pleasant and diverting; and he dexterously
managed every thing to the best Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of Life. And to comprehend all in
a few Words, his Designs met always
as happy a Success, and as favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
an Accomplishment as Man could
wish.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I don't believe that there is any thing
to be blamed in this condition, provided
no sudden Change befalls it. We must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conclude <hi>Orata</hi> to be perfectly happy, if
he can still continue in the fortunate state,
wherein we have shew'd him.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given you, unless I am
mistaken, a Portraicture that very well
resembles the first Design which I was
to lay before you; and which you mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stook
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:44397:128"/>
for a Work of Fancy, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of mere Imagination.</p>
            <p>Now let us turn the Tables<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and find
out some miserable Wretches to oppose
to this <hi>Orata.</hi> Let us compare to him,
if you please, some of those infortunate
Persons, whom we behold on the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Theatre; one of whom judges him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
too criminal to weild the Scepter of
the <hi>Greeks;</hi> who is afraid to dishonour
the race of <hi>Pelops,</hi> from whence he owns
himself descended; who dares not shew
himself before Men, who dares not enter
the Temples.</p>
            <p>Let us compare to him another of the
same rank, who making Signs to his Friends
not to approach him, looks upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be so unfortunate, that he is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive,
lest his very shadow should
prove contagious. Or rather let us think
no more of <hi>Atreus</hi> and <hi>Thyestes;</hi> let us
forget their Crimes, the remembrance of
which still inspires us with horrour; let
us not cast our eyes any longer upon a
Family which has forced the Sun to go
backward; and which has furnished Hell
with one of its most famous Punishments.

               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:44397:129"/>
Let us rather chuse Heroes, but Persons

Let the Son of <hi>Amphiareus</hi> make

               <l>Oh help me to put out this cruel Fire,</l>
               <l>In whose embraces I shall soon expire.</l>
               <l>At me their Whips the restless Furies
shake,</l>
               <l>Their angry Snakes a dreadful Consort

               <l>See, see, they come! I feel the pointed

            </q>
            <p>And after <hi>Alcmeon</hi> has made us see the
Tortures of Conscience, and Pressures of

                  <l>Who for the space of Nine revolving years</l>

                  <l>The Scene of all my Sorrows and Disgrace,</l>
                  <l>Where robb'd of Glory, to a Rock confin'd,</l>
                  <l>I bear all Plagues of Body and of Mind.</l>
                  <l>And my keen Arrows for the Birds pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare:</l>
                  <l>Their Plumes my raiment, and their

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>After this let him shew us the pains
of the Body; when his Ulcer being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
he despairs, he bemoans himself
in these following Lines:
<q>
                  <l>Alass! What Friend to ease me of my Pain,</l>
                  <l>Will kindly send me headlong to the Main.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="254" facs="tcp:44397:130"/>
Now, now, quick Shootings all my Sinews
tear,</l>
                  <l>What Racks, what Torments can with this
compare?</l>
                  <l>A raging Vlcer angry Heaven did send;</l>
                  <l>Which an eternal Feaver does attend.</l>
                  <l>Thus in Complaints the day, in Groans the
night I spend.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Or if these Misfortunes are not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
let us heap together, as <hi>Ovid</hi> has
done, all the Plagues, all the Calamities
that old Fables afford us; and wish they
may light upon one single Person, and
then judge whether his Condition is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
than that of <hi>Orata,</hi> or of the famous
<hi>Vatia,</hi> who merited heretofore this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
<hi>O</hi> Vatia, <hi>you alone know what
it is live;</hi> and conclude all with an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
of the like nature; <hi>O</hi> Epicurus,
<hi>you and only you know how to Philosophize.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From all these evident Truths it is an
easie matter to conclude, that Pleasure is
not only worthy the Commendations of
all Men; but that it is the sovereign Good,
and only end.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, since this first Proposition
makes the principal point in the Doctrine
of <hi>Epicurus;</hi> and as it is the truest, so it
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:44397:130"/>
is also the most contested; since I say
we have begun to undeceive the Enemies
of this Proposition, we ought to conclude
with Instructions, and leave the truth of
this Opinion so well established in their
minds, that they shall have no occasion to
question it, without being guilty of the
greatest Injustice.</p>
            <p>That they may therefore submit to so
Catholick a Truth, I only desire them to
turn their eyes on the side of Nature; the
Effects of which are reasonable, and the
Experiences certain.</p>
            <p>They will not only find that it autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises
what we have asserted; but it will
likewise give them such clear, such visible
Demonstrations of it, that unless they
hoodwink themselves on purpose, they
must be forced to submit to it.</p>
            <p>Let them consider what this Common
Mother does in the Birth of Animals;
that is to say, in its perfect Purity and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
its Corruption. They will soon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that it inspires them with the love
of Pleasure, and an aversion to Pain;
that it carries them towards what pleases
them, and teaches them to avoid what
would hurt them; that it instructs them
(if I may be allowed the Expression)
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:44397:131"/>
both in what is good and what is bad;
and when they attain the former, she
causes them to rejoice, and be satisfied
with it.</p>
            <p>This is the Reason why our Philosopher
following the Dictates of Nature, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces
a voluptuous Life to be the end
of Man; but does not give himself the
Trouble to prove so obvious a Proposition.</p>
            <p>As he imagined there was no necessity
of force of reason to perswade People that
Fire is hot, that Snow is white, and that
Hony is sweet, because they are all sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
things; so he believed, that to make
Men comprehend the Love of Pleasure,
which may easily be known by the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of Nature, there was occasion for
no more than a bare Observation of these
Effects, and an ordinary Reflection.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, though we have Nature
on our side, that is to say, an infallible
Decision; though we find in our Souls a
natural Inclination to avoid Evil, and to
follow Pleasure; though the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of our Desires, of our Disgusts, and
of all our Actions, derive their Original
from Pleasure and Pain; yet because some
Philosophers pretend that Pain ought not
to be reckoned amongst Evils, nor Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:44397:131"/>
amongst things that are good, and
that to establish this Opinion they bring
abundance of plausible Arguments, we
must not so strongly rely upon our own
Opinions, as we ought to keep up to the
simple Truth.</p>
            <p>We must therefore produce Reasons in
behalf of <hi>Epicurus's</hi> Doctrine, and show
that Reason as well as Nature is of his side.</p>
            <p>And in effect in those Philosophers that
have condemn'd this Pleasure had well
considered her before-hand; if they had
throughly known her before they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd
her, they would easily have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
that it was not she they meant;
that they were mistaken in their Invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
and only rejected her out of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of those Pains that sometimes
attend her; they would have perceived
that those Pains did not proceed from
her, but from the Irregularities of those
Persons that use her ill. And then they
had never decryed her after so furious a
manner.</p>
            <p>For they must be forced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
That there is not one single Person
in the World that hates Pleasure, as it is
Pleasure; or loves Pain, meerly as it is
Pain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:44397:132"/>
Now because those that abuse the most
innocent Pleasures, do afterwards feel
a great deal of Torment and Uneasiness,
and that on the other hand, there are
certain times when Labour and Pain
produce and prepare some sort of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures:
this hath been the reason, that these
Philosophers, who only considered the
consequences of an ill managed Pleasure,
and the Advantages of a profitable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Labour, have effaced the former out
of the number of good things, and then pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Pain amongst those that are desirable.</p>
            <p>But now it is high time to employ all
our Forces to carry our Enterprizes.
This is the hour we ought to Combat in
good earnest, that so we may obtain a
glorious Victory.</p>
            <p>It is not our business here to defend
Pleasure, nor to consider it as the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
good of humane Life: we must ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
her above the throne of Virtue it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
that disputes this Title with her; and
although we don't banish this Virtue from
it, whereof we make Profession, we must
nevertheless constrain her to resign the
first place to Pleasure.</p>
            <p>In short, as all the Philosophers in the
World are agreed, that the ultimate end
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:44397:132"/>
a Man ought to propose to himself here,
is a quiet and agreeable Life; several of
them have been mistaken in placing this
Life in Virtue, and not in Pleasure; and
Suffered themselves to be led aside by
the gaudy Splendor of a Name that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
upon them, without considering
a Truth which Nature it self forces them
to own.</p>
            <p>For certain it is, if they would but
consult and believe her, they would
confess that these same Virtues, which
they are used to call Magnificent and Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous,
are no farther to be esteem'd than
as they contribute to Pleasure; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
that not being courted for their
own sake, they ought not to be preferred
to the motive from which they receive all
their merit, and all their value.</p>
            <p>'Tis after the same manner that we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
Physick, not upon the account of
the Art, but because of our Health; and
the Skill of Pilots deserves Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for no other reason, but the great
utility of Navigation. After the same
manner we should not desire Wisdom,
which we may call the Art of Life, if it
were not serviceable to us, and did not
<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irectly lead us to the possession of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:44397:133"/>
There is no necessity to repeat in this
place what this Pleasure is; or to desire
you once more not to despise this Name,
which Men have corrupted.</p>
            <p>You know well enough how severe
<hi>Epicurus</hi> makes it; and you ought to own
to me that it is no disgrace for Wisdom
to yield to it, and to be respected only
for her sake.</p>
            <p>We will confess to you likewise on our
side, that unless a Man is a Philosopher
he cannot be happy, and that Wisdom is
the only way to arrive at Pleasure.</p>
            <p>In a word, the weakness of humane
of Nature labouring under the ignorance
Good and Evil; floating generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
these two things, without being
able to discern them, and often chusing
with Joy what it ought to have studiously
avoided; in so strange a Blindness it so
happens that Men instead of the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
they desire, get at a farther distance
from it; that they become miserable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of finding themselves satisfied; and
that in exchange of the Pleasures they
proposed to meet, they plunge themselves
in Sorrows that torment and trouble
them.</p>
            <p>It is necessary therefore that a right
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:44397:133"/>
application of Wisdom should draw them
out of so miserable a Condition, that its
light shou'd direct them in this wretched
darkness, that its force should deliver
them from the Servitude of wicked De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
unjust Terrours, and rash Opinions,
and in imitation of <hi>Hercules</hi> clear an
open passage for them through so many
Monsters, and safely conduct them to
Pleasure.</p>
            <p>Wisdom alone performs these great
things like a faithful, generous Guide;
she removes the difficulties of the way
where she leads us.</p>
            <p>'Tis not sufficient that we don't wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
what is more, we must march in
security with her; and while the Winds
and the Sea overwhelm those poor Vessels
that sail without her conduct, others that
are steer'd by her enter the Harbour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fearing the Tempest.</p>
            <p>'Tis in this Harbour that a wise Man
finds Pleasure. Here it is that he quietly
contemplates the Pains of other Men;
that he discovers all the impertinent Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
wherewith their weakness is perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted;
that he observes with what eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
they strive to satisfy their Passions;
that he sees them press forward in throngs
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:44397:134"/>
towards him, that shall advance himself
highest in Power, Riches, and Fortune.

            <p>Let us act like him, if we have a mind

of it: They are insatiable and dangerous;
they don't only ruin private Persons, they
destroy whole Families; they ravage King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
they occasion Hatred, Division,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:44397:134"/>
Discord, Sedition, and War; they tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
over those Souls that nourish them,
and if we carefully examine the Poets, we
shall find that by the Torments of the
Damned they had a mind to represent
those Persons whom these inward Plagues
afflict.

And thus, since by the only assistance of
Wisdom we are able to crush these Vipers;
since she alone instructs how to resist For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and that through her means we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
to obtain tranquillity, why should
we fear to conclude that she is not desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
but only as she creates Pleasure,
and secures us from Pain?</p>
            <p>We must say the same thing of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
and not desire her only for her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
but because she preserves that peace,
that serenity in our Souls, without which
we cannot be happy, and by the concord
she inspires appeases our Trouble, and
gives us Pleasure.</p>
            <p>'Tis this Virtue that always comes to
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:44397:135"/>
the relief of Wisdom: 'Tis she that puts
in execution what the other does only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve;
and as that shows us what we are
to avoid, and what we are to follow, this
stops us in our career when we go against
the Counsels of the other, and believe
our Senses rather than our Reason.</p>
            <p>'Tis the oridle that keeps us in, when
we are posting towards any unlawful
Pleasure; the hand that surely conducts
us to the way of truth. In short, 'tis
the Virtue without which we can neither
be happy nor wise.</p>
            <p>And in truth what advantage is it to
know what is Good, if we are too feeble
to put it in practice? To what purpose is
it to see a Precipice, if we suffer our
selves to tumble down it? To give Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
leave to speak, but not to permit
her to act?</p>
            <p>The generality of Men are reduced to
this pass. All of them conclude in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of Wisdom, but don't know how to
live up to what they have concluded.</p>
            <p>They know that there are Pleasures the
consequences of which are dangerous, and
severely prohibited by our <hi>Epicurus:</hi> but
they laugh at the prohibitions of this
Philosopher, and abandon themselves
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:44397:135"/>
to the tyranny of their disorderly Passions.</p>
            <p>They resemble the unfortunate <hi>Phaedria</hi>
in <hi>Terence,</hi> and his Character, as it is drawn
by that excellent Man, suits them all
from the highest to the lowest.</p>
            <p>This outrageous Lover is sensible that
he should do a foolish Action in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to set himself at rights with his
Mistress. He knows she's a Coquette, and
that himself is miserable. This gives him
disturbance; this makes him uneasie. But
to what purpose? he does not amend his
Condition. He still suffers his love to
controll him; and at that very instant
when he sees himself ready to perish, at
that very instant he perishes deliberately.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain that <hi>Phaedria</hi> does not want
Wisdom; he only want Temperance. He
knows well enough what measures he
ought to take to be at ease, but does not
put them in execution. He sees what is
best for himself, and approves it, but for
all that follows what is worse.</p>
            <p>Behold now the manners of those Men,
whom we describe, admirably well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest.
Behold an image of their Thoughts
and Infirmities. Behold how for want of
true Wisdom, it is impossible for them to
find Pleasure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:44397:136"/>
You loose your labour when you tell
them that the Pleasure they pursue is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable,
that it is not necessary, that
the privation of it does not cause any
pain: In vain do you represent to them
the Sicknesses, the Losses, the Infamy that
attend the enjoyment of it. In vain do
you threaten them with the punishments
of the Laws, and the severity of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates.
You can tell them nothing but
what they know, and what they are able
to say upon occasion. What are they the
better for all this? They are Slaves to that
very Folly they detest as well as you, and
resemble the Greek Philosophers who were
allowed the liberty to make a great Parade
of those very Virtues they never practised.</p>
            <p>Besides these, there is another race of
Men who in truth are not Philosophers,
but for all that manage their Cause with
a world of Spirit and Vivacity.</p>
            <p>These People, whom we may properly
call the Prophaners of the Pleasure of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus,</hi>
will by no means be perswaded to
acknowledg Temperance for a Virtue, but
after their imperious way pretend that all
happiness depends on mere fancy.</p>
            <p>It is not worth the while to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a solemn dispute with such unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:44397:136"/>
Creatures as they are. The severest
return one can make them is to leave
them at liberty to do as they desire.</p>
            <p>'Tis sufficient for us to know that their
Opinion is false, and that true felicity
consists only in those desires which flow
from Temperance.</p>
            <p>For 'tis not only a miserable thing to
desire what is dishonest, but 'tis infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more advantageous not to obtain what
we desire, than to obtain what we cannot
desire without shame. In this view 'tis
better to be of the Opinion of that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
who passing his Judgment of <hi>Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
that was banished out of <hi>Rome,</hi> while
<hi>Manlius</hi> was Master there, preferr'd the
Exile of the virtuous Refugee to the Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
of the dishonest Citizen.</p>
            <p>Now in truth those that study Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and manage the fruition of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
with that discretion that they find
no After-claps; those certainly may call
themselves happy, and deserve the title
of wise Men.</p>
            <p>Their Pleasures are durable, because
they are regular; and all their Life is calm
and serene, because it is innocent.</p>
            <p>They have no inclination to run af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
forbidden Pleasures; nay, their feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:44397:137"/>
consists in abstaining from them.
They sometimes embrace Pain, but then
'tis done with a design to avoid a greater.
The use they make of Wisdom is by her
means to attain to a state of Tranquillity;
and this makes it clear, that there is no
other way to enjoy this Pleasure, wherein
<hi>Epicurus</hi> supposes the sovereign Good to
consist, but by the means of Virtue.</p>
            <p>You would be amazed, and perhaps
angry, if examining the rest of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and bringing them to the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
of Pleasure, I should maintain that
Valour depends upon her no less than
Wisdom and Temperance; and that this
Virtue that dares encounter Lions, that
despises danger, and that without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
or emotion could behold the entire
ruin of the World, produces nothing
illustrious but only as it regards Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and flows from no other source
than it.</p>
            <p>For in the first place we ought to take
it for granted, that the Fatigues we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo,
and the Pains we sustain, have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in them to induce us to court them,
if we view them simply, and separate
them from other Considerations: That
Industry and Diligence, so much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:44397:137"/>
in affairs of Life, and that Valour it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
of which we are now talking, are
never put in execution but for some design
and motive.</p>
            <p>This is not all; we may affirm, that
these things have been introduced mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the ease of Life, and that the
only reason we follow them is, that we
may live without trouble and fear; that
we may free, as much as in us lies, our
body and our mind from those Maladies
and Vexations which may afflict it, and to
taste with greater serenity that indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
which makes one part of <hi>Epicurus's</hi>
Pleasure.</p>
            <p>And indeed how can you expect a Man
should live happy when he perpetually
fears death? How can you imagine the
famous <hi>Sicilian,</hi> whose Name is upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
should taste any Pleasure in the
midst of his Feasting and Musick, if he
everlastingly dreads the falling of the
Sword, that threatens his Head, and his
Diadem.</p>
            <p>Is it not an aggravation of misery to
faint under our Pains, and not to have
courage enough to suffer those Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
which 'tis not in our power to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:44397:138"/>
This weakness of mind has it not led
abundance of People to those Extremities
that are a disgrace and scandal to humane
Nature?</p>
            <p>What was it in your Opinion that gave
occasion to the Poets to turn <hi>Hecuba</hi> into
a mad Bitch, but the Grief that overcame
her, and constrained her to imitate the
fury of those Creatures?</p>
            <p>Had she supprest and conquered her
Grief, or had she at least endeavoured to
forget those subjects that occasioned it,
without question she had never passed from
tears to despair, and from despair to rage.</p>
            <p>Listen I pray to the Complaints she
makes. Observe how by representing to
herself the miserable Condition she finds
herself in at present, and from what a
heigth she is fallen; how by this conduct,
I say, she feeds her sorrow upon the
Stage, and of her own accord provokes
the motions of that Rage which is ready
to seize her.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Oh the severe Oppressions of my Grief!</l>
               <l>What Place can give me refuge or relief?</l>
               <l>To what far distant Region shall I run</l>
               <l>The wild disorders of my Soul to shun?</l>
               <l>Unhappy <hi>Troy,</hi> our late delight and pride,</l>
               <l>By <hi>Grecian</hi> fraud and malice lies destroyed.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:44397:138"/>
Tell me, ye Gods, where I my steps must bend?</l>
               <l>Who will a poor despairing Queen befriend?</l>
               <l>Prest by my Wants, wandring from place to
place,</l>
               <l>While meager Famine stares me in the Face.</l>
               <l>See how th' insulting <hi>Argive</hi> Flame devours</l>
               <l>Those Shrines that once receiv'd the heavenly
Powers.</l>
               <l>If the proud Flames their Temples will not spare,</l>
               <l>But sacred Piles the common Fate must share.</l>
            </q>
            <p>After this she remembers herself of the
Beauty of these Structures, and the Riches
of <hi>Asia,</hi> in order to raise her own Grief,
and that of the Spectators; for who is it
that can avoid being sensibly touched with
this Discourse?
<q>
                  <l>Must <hi>Ilium</hi> then, the Scene of all my Joys,</l>
                  <l>Must all this Wealth be made a <hi>Grecian</hi> prize.</l>
                  <l>The rich aspiring Mansions of the Gods,</l>
                  <l>Worthy their names, their presence, and abodes,</l>
                  <l>And glitt'ring Roofs—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Or what heart would she not inspire with
horror and pity, when she thus goes on?
<q>
                  <l>All this I saw consum'd by impious Fire,</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Priam</hi> by a barb'rous hand expire.</l>
                  <l>
                     <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

                  <l>And Hector's Blood by common dust prophan'd;
Nor was this all.</l>
                  <l>But my prevailing Miseries to Crown,</l>
                  <l>From a high Tower his Son thrown head-long
down.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:44397:139"/>
So that I don't at all wonder if the
people of <hi>Rome</hi> were strangely affected
when they heard these Verses repeated;
or if when I read them my self I cannot
forbear the Tribute of a few Tears.</p>
            <p>To say the Truth, <hi>Hecuba</hi> had great
reason to complain of her ill Destiny,
she had lost her Husband, her Son, her
Kingdom and her Liberty. If she had
beheld these Calamities without lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, she had been insensible; and we
should be inhumane, if after so many
Losses we should hinder her Tears.</p>
            <p>But then, after she had for some time
wept, we should not be at all unjust to
prescribe bounds to her Grief, to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
her Complaints and her Sorrow; and
lastly, to advise her to oppose strength of
Reason to that of Despair.</p>
            <p>Some Persons that are touched with her
Complaints may perhaps alledge in her
Justification, that those who would limit
her Grief, and not suffer it to exceed its
first Motions, would resign themselves
up to it till the very last Moments of their
Life, if they once shared with her those
Misfortunes the weight of which they
can only conjecture: and that our Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
which speaks of nothing less than
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:44397:139"/>
Conquests and Triumphs, would faint un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
such a pressure of Calamities, if it saw
them present and inevitable.</p>
            <p>Now, for my part I wish a perpetual
Sunshine of Prosperity to so tender, so
melting a Man as this is: for no doubt
on't, if any Disgrace happens to him, he
will discover his Infirmities very plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully:
on this condition that by way of
requital to me for my Wish he will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spense
with me for not believing what he
says, nor oblige me to judge of the
strength of Philosophy by the weakness
of his Reason.</p>
            <p>For without losing any time to refute
word by word this sort of Reasoning, which
can obtain credit no where but amongst
effeminate Men; I shall content my self
to convince those Persons that make use
of it by two known Examples that ought
to overwhelm them with confusion.</p>
            <p>These Examples are drawn from two
Persons, whom their Age and their Sex
ought to render extremely feeble; but who
notwithstanding all this weakness preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
such a presence of mind, that I shall
despair to find the like among the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:44397:140"/>
Let us consider <hi>Astianax</hi> and <hi>Polixena</hi>
as they are going to die: one is a Boy,
the other a young Maid. The <hi>Greeks</hi> had
condemned both of them to Death. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<hi>Vlysses,</hi> who advances first leading the
former by the hand, and marching hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to throw him down the Precipice. But
see the Child does not follow him with
less Assurance.</p>
            <q>
               <l>—Sublimi gradu</l>
               <l>Incedit Ithacus, parvulum dextrâ trahens</l>
               <l>Priami Nepotem, nec gradu segni puer</l>
               <l>Ad alta pergit moenia.—</l>
            </q>
            <p>Consider that amongst all those that
accompany him and weep for him, he is
the only Person whose eyes are dry, and
who refuses to pay Tears to his own death.</p>
            <p>Observe that whilst these barbarous
Executioners invoke the Gods to this
bloody Sacrifice, he throws himself head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
from the Tower, from the top of
which they were to cast him, and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
puts an end to that Life which he
had scarce begun.</p>
            <p>But now turn your eyes on the other
side; for by this time <hi>Polixena</hi> is placed
upon <hi>Achilles's</hi> Tomb, and only waits the
fatal Blow which is to appease the Anger
of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and to rejoyn her Soul to
that of her Parents.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:44397:140"/>
Admire her Beauty that still appears
so charming and so serene. Her Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
is not at all changed with the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of Death. On the other
Hand this Sun, which is going to set for
ever, seems to receive a new Splendor at
the last moments of its light.</p>
            <p>Nay there is something in her air more
bold and undaunted than her Sex, and her
present Circumstances ought to promise.</p>
            <p>And to do her right she is not content
to wait the Blow, for without avoiding
it she goes to meet it with an Heroick
Bravery.</p>
            <q>Conversa ad ictum stat truci vultu ferox.</q>
            <p>And when <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> has given her the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
stroke, it seems that her last Action is
an Action of Courage, that she does not
suffer herself to fall upon the Sepulchre
of <hi>Achilles,</hi> but with a design to make the
earth lie more heavy upon him, and to
revenge herself upon him even as she dies.</p>
            <p>Tell me now freely, is it not a shame
for <hi>Hecuba</hi> to see her Children more cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
than herself?</p>
            <p>Tell me whether it looks well for her
to shed so many Tears, when <hi>Astianax</hi>
and <hi>Polyxena</hi> die without shedding any?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:44397:141"/>
Tell me whether you don't think these
two Persons infinitely happy in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of this miserable Creature?</p>
            <p>Or if you have nothing to say for her,
confess at last with us, that she has too
little courage in her Misfortunes, and that
she wanted strength of Mind to resent
them less cruelly.</p>
            <p>Now if it be true that Weakness is the
only thing that renders our Misfortunes
insupportable to us, and which causing
us to abandon the Helm in the most vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
Tempests makes us suffer Shipwrack
in those places where we might have
rode securely; ought we not to search
after this strength of Mind to serve us
instead of an Anchor, to oppose it to the
fury of the Wind and Water, and preserve
us from the violence of the Storm?</p>
            <p>We ought to sustain our selves by this
Pillar, which serves as the Basis to Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and to joyn this Virtue to Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Wisdom; and that we may live
in repose and in a privation of Misery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that by her influence a couragious
persevering Spirit is above all Pain and
ill Fortune; since it despises Death, and
is so prepared for Pain that it always re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shembers
itself that Death is the remedy
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:44397:141"/>
of the most violent ones; that the lesser
have abundance of good Intervals, and
that it is the Master of the ordinary ones.</p>
            <p>Matters being thus, we ought to say
that we don't blame Cowardise and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as also that we don't practise Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance
and Valour for their own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
respect; but that we are to reject
the former, and desire the latter, because
those foment Griefs, but these preserve us
from them.</p>
            <p>It only remains now for us to examine
Justice, and then we shall have dispatched
the principal Virtues. But these things one
may say on this Chapter are almost the
same with the preceding ones, and Justice
is no less united to Pleasure, than Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
Temperance and Fortitude, which
cannot be separated from it.</p>
            <p>In effect this Virtue is so far from bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any uneasiness to our Mind, that by
its Influence and Power it perpetually
nourishes in them those Sentiments that
render them quiet, and never leaves us
without this hope, that we can want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that Nature desires, as long as she
is not corrupted. And after the same
manner that Folly, Intemperance, want of
Resolution incessantly torment, plague and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:44397:142"/>
afflict us; so Injustice no sooner enters the
Soul, but it throws her into Disorder and
Confusion, and makes her unfortunate
even when she does not make her criminal.</p>
            <p>For if an unjust Man suffers himself to
commit some wicked Action, although he
commits it after such a manner, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Sun nor Men can give any Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of it, yet he can never assure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
that it will be always kept private;
and for all the obscurity of the night that
covered it, he will still be under terrible
apprehensions that Truth will at last dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
it.</p>
            <p>Suspicion commonly follows the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the wicked; and though the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
should never concern themselves with
them, yet their own Conscience forces
them to betray themselves.</p>
            <p>But if any Person believes that their Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
their Power and Authority shall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them from the Injustice of Men, and
place them above the Laws, and out of
the reach of Punishment, yet they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
cover themselves from the Divine
Justice.</p>
            <p>They never lift up their eyes to Heaven,
but their Conscience alarms them with
horrour, and the cruel Inquietudes that
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:44397:142"/>
devour them without intermission, are the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Executioners of that punishment which the
Divinity makes them endure.</p>
            <p>For what Power, what Wealth, when they
are injustly obtain'd, can so far diminish the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of this Life, but at the same time remorse
of Conscience, fear of Punishment, the hatred
of Mankind augment them infinitely more?</p>
            <p>These ill, these unlawful Remedies don't they
often turn to Poyson? and what we have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
chose to extinguish our sorrow, has it not
made it burn with greater Fury and Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence?</p>
            <p>Are there not prodigious numbers of Persons
that don't know how to prescribe Limits to
their desire of being more rich, of having more
Honours, of reigning more absolutely, of living
more voluptuously, of feasting more deliciously,
and of carrying their evil Inclinations too far?</p>
            <p>And don't we see that the mighty heap
their Extortion and their Avarice has amassed
together, instead of satisfying their unreasonable
Appetites, does but inflame them still the more,
and that these People has more need to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by the Laws, than inflamed by Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances.</p>
            <p>Reason therefore invites all Men that have
their Judgment sound, to preserve Justice which
the Laws have established.</p>
            <p>Equity which derives its Original from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and which may properly be called the
knot of Civil Society, tells us plainly enough,
that an unjust Action ought never to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
neither by those that are weak, because
they would attempt it without success; nor by
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:44397:143"/>
the powerful, because after the business is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated,
they would not find repose, nor this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of their desires.</p>
            <p>In short, she forces us to own that Justice is
not desirable for it self, but because it gives us
a world of Satisfaction, makes our Life more
assured, and our Pleasure more accomplished.</p>
            <p>Now if the Praise of Virtue it self, on which
Subject principally the other Philosophers have
employed their most magnificent Discourses,
produces no other effect than Delight or Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
and if this Pleasure alone, which is the
end of all the Virtues, calls us to itself, and
attracts us by its proper Nature, we may fafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conclude, that she is the soveraign Good;
and the most perfect of all other, and no longer
doubt but that a happy Life is that which <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus</hi>
has taught us.</p>
            <p>Oh holy and severe Pleasure! O admirable
Philosophy! What Misfortune was it that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry'd
you amongst Men? Who is it that drew
upon you the aversion of so many virtuous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that knew you not? Who has hindered
them to see that their Virtues are owing to you,
and that they speak injuriously of you, at the
same time you contribute to their Felicity.</p>
            <p>But happy the Men who have been of the Sect
of that Wise Man that followed you: happy
those who have imitated him: happy even those
who being born in an Age, when many believe
that Vice and the Pleasure of <hi>Epicurus</hi> are but one
and the same thing, have had understanding
enough to discover the contrary, and have at
least force of Mind sufficient to defend it, if they
have not Courage enough to practise it.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Vse of LIFE.</head>
               <byline>By Mr. <hi>SAVAGE</hi> of the <hi>Inner-Temple.</hi>
               </byline>
               <head type="sub">That a Man ought to Apply himself to a
diligent search after Happiness, since it
is wholly in his power to augment his
Ioys, and diminish his Miseries.</head>
               <p>AFter having a long time Reflected
on the condition of Men, I have
found but two things that can reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
deserve the care of a Wise Man:
The first is the <hi>Study of Virtue,</hi> which
makes a Man <hi>Honest;</hi> and the second,
<hi>The Vse of Life,</hi> which renders him <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi>
If he can possibly become such;
or at least <hi>less unhappy,</hi> if he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
himself from his <hi>Troubles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true, that 'tis but folly to think of
<hi>Soveraign Good</hi> here below: All the Idea's
that <hi>Ancient Philosophers</hi> have given of it,
are but confused Images of that which
might fill the vast capacity of our desires;
and the uncertainty of their Opinions
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44397:144"/>
which varied so often on this Matter,
makes us easily see how doubtful this <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness</hi>
was which they promis'd us never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
with so great Pride and Ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>In effect, the perpetual Motion of
Things of this World, the continual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions
of our Minds, and the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
of our Passions, will not permit
us to establish a fixt repose and tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Life: And when I consider the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability
of Objects</hi> to content us, and the
<hi>weakness</hi> of our <hi>own Senses</hi> to receive their
<hi>Impressions,</hi> then I renounce all vain pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits
of this <hi>false Happiness;</hi> and I am
not very far from entring into a general
neglect of all things. For what <hi>sweets</hi>
are there in the World which are not mixt
with <hi>bitter?</hi> Are not our Senses often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terupted
in their functions by the disorder
of our Organs? And has not our Mind
its unsteadiness from the same disturbance?
A Disease, a Winter, a bad Day, and
sometimes less than any of these, changes
us, and all things relating to us: And
tho' there were no alteration in Us, or
any thing about us, In the most easie sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
our Soul can be plac'd in, and with
the best constitution that a Body can
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44397:144"/>
have, 'tis certain we are incapable of tast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a pure and true Content.</p>
               <p>Neither the Conversation of virtuous
Men, which gives us the most agreeable
satisfaction; nor the delicacies of a Feast,
nor the Charms of Musick, which create
the most sensible pleasures, have ever had
power to give me a greater relish of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
than my Imagination promis'd me:
And I may truly say, that amongst the
greatest liberties of my Senses, I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
the pleasure with so little confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that ordinarily I have Meditated
upon my most serious Affairs.</p>
               <p>The divertisement of the Theatre, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we see so many people flock dayly,
Has it created any true delights in its most
profest Followers? For my part, I could
never see the most part of them without
being tired; and the best Plays, which
seem'd to ravish all the Audience, have
had no other power over me, than to
make me grieve for the Misfortunes of a
<hi>Heroine</hi> who suffered no more, what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
me; or for those of some Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Heroe,</hi> whose <hi>false griefs</hi> drew from me
<hi>true Tears,</hi> and filled me with Indignation
against my self.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:44397:145"/>
Neither the beauty of the <hi>Tuilleries</hi>
which enchant all eyes, nor the Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences
of Courts, adorn'd with the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
confusion of haughty Equipages, nor
the most shining Assemblies of the fairest
Ladies, nor Shews, nor Balls, nor Art,
nor Riot, nor Riches, can give a full
satisfaction to any Man in this World.</p>
               <p>Those that frequent but seldom publick
Representations, are as it were forbid 'em,
and cannot digest the hurly burly of these
great divertisements; those that visit 'em
osten are insensible of 'em; and both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
through extasie or stupidity, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
peaceably enjoy their Charms. Those
who out of the abundance of all things
flatter their Minds with whatever is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
Do not they give us marks of their
Melancholly amidst their Pleasures, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
(as it were) that excess of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
rendered 'em odious.</p>
               <p>But if ever any Man desired to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
it must be granted 'twas that great
Prince who had Wisdom his Lot, without
ever burthening his Mind with Chimera's,
he carried himself to the search of solid
Good; His Abilities gain'd him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
possession. Every thing succeeded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his wishes; and the enjoyment
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44397:145"/>
always followed close his desires: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
he declared, That <hi>he found so much
vanity in Pleasures, that he could scarce
forbear to hate Life, and to have in abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
his very Being.</hi> Then we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
there is no <hi>perfect happiness</hi> for Man
here below; and ought rather to think of
defending our selves against the <hi>Mischiefs</hi>
that oppress us, than to sigh after a <hi>Bliss</hi>
that is out of our reach.</p>
               <p>But although it be true, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
find in this <hi>Life</hi> the <hi>Imaginary Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness</hi>
we look after, yet we ought not to
<hi>wish for death,</hi> nor abandon our selves, as
through <hi>despair,</hi> to our <hi>Miseries:</hi> For
thence springs our ordinary folly, to look
for <hi>Happiness</hi> where we cannot find it,
and to overlook it when it is under our
hands. Our <hi>Pleasures</hi> are short, 'tis true,
and they are not freed from <hi>Gall;</hi> but as
they are <hi>Pleasures</hi> they overweigh our
<hi>sorrows;</hi> and 'tis one of the greatest <hi>Vses
of Life,</hi> to manage 'em with Address.</p>
               <p>As we ought to be capable to support
the <hi>Ill,</hi> so we ought also to know how to
enjoy the <hi>Good;</hi> we ought to have it
equally in our power to lull asleep our sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
for <hi>Grief,</hi> as to awaken 'em for <hi>Pleasure;</hi>
for <hi>Temperance</hi> is far removed from all
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44397:146"/>
                  <hi>Excess:</hi> She is no less an enemy of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
Fasting,</hi> than <hi>excessive Debauchery;</hi>
and he that should suffer himself to die
with <hi>hunger,</hi> would as much offend her
Laws, as he that should choak himself
with <hi>too much eating.</hi> Madmen that we
are, always complaining of the rigours of
our Birth, the uncertainty of our Life,
and the misery of our Death; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we every day add new <hi>miseries</hi> to the
old; and it looks as if we were only ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
to Render our selves the more
wretched.</p>
               <p>This sort of <hi>Conduct</hi> is very
different from that of the <hi>Wiseman</hi> we
mention'd just before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He made, as it
were, an Essay of all things of this World,
for which we have the most ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
and presently knew the vanity of
them: But yet he did not suffer himself
to go to a general disgust of all things
that he had lookt after; but remaining
always in the same station, he enjoyed
peaceably his pleasures.</p>
               <p>But let's return to our Subject, and see
how we ought to manage the <hi>Good</hi> and
the <hi>Evil</hi> for the <hi>Vse of Life.</hi>

               <head type="sub">Of the Existence of GOD.</head>
               <p>WHen I make an exact Reflection
upon all my <hi>Life,</hi> I acknowledg
I have had <hi>sorrows</hi> and <hi>satisfactions</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the different Opinions I had a
mind to assume: My Thoughts have as well
created my <hi>Griefs</hi> as my <hi>Ioys;</hi> and I have
always found within my self the source of
my <hi>Miseries or Happiness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I'll not dissemble my Thoughts, The
Persuasion of a Deity, and the uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of our Condition after Death, have
many times very much intrench'd upon my
Repose; and in these moments of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
I consider'd that all our Watchings,
all our Knowledg, all our Employs, our
Profits, and our Honours, must end in
Death; and that none of those things
being <hi>eternal,</hi> we ought to search else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
for refuge. But I often suffered
my Soul to think licentiously of these
things; and not respecting enough the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44397:147"/>
first Truth, I met with nothing but doubts
and difficulties about the <hi>Immortality of
the Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as I always relied in this Affair,
upon the Reasons of other Men, so I could
never have certain Notions; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of the different Opinions of our
Authors, gave me Insupportable uneasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses;
never were my Mind and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of one Opinion. I was constrain'd to
suffer the shocks of these two Parties which
combated incessantly within me; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
equal'd my disquiet so much, as the
difficulty to resolve the Question which
was the Subject.</p>
               <p>At length finding my self foil'd by all
this Forreign Assistance, I was resolv'd
to rerire within my self, and consult my
own Thoughts; as those sick Men do,
who finding themselves abus'd by the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of their Physicians, undertake to
cure themselves. 'Twas here I cut off
Commerce with all Books, where I never
found any thing but difficulties and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties.
'Twas here I resolv'd to consider
with my self, and consult my own Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon the structure of the Universe,
and the Admirable Order and Symmetry
which Reigns in all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:44397:147"/>
And when I consider'd the <hi>Heavens,</hi>
the greatness of those wonderful <hi>Vaults</hi>
filled me with astonishment, and with I
know not how awful a respect! The <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of the <hi>Stars,</hi> the <hi>silence</hi> and the <hi>solitude</hi>
of the <hi>Night,</hi> pierc"d me with such a secret
horror as dispos'd me insensibly to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Can it be possible,</hi> said I to my self, <hi>that
the Motions of the Spheres, so just and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
should not have an Intelligent Being
for their Author? If these wonderful
Globes know and govern themselves, are they
not the Gods who command the World as
they please? And if they suffer the controul
of some Superior Power, who can sway these
fearful Machines but a supream Hand?
Who can move these Huge Bodies but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable
Force? Who can reconcile their
various Motions but an Infinite Wisdom?
This glorious Sun,</hi> continu'd I, <hi>which shines
equally upon all Men, could it ever give us
its light by chance? And that exquisite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
that we may observe in it, could it
ever proceed but from an eternal Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After these <hi>Meditations</hi> I consider'd the
perpetual Disagreement of <hi>the Elements;</hi>
and I could never enough admire that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44397:148"/>
                  <hi>Happy War</hi> which entertains the World
with so many wonderful Motions.</p>
               <p>But above all, I made my Reason give
place, and my whole Soul bend to that
Prodigy of <hi>the Flux</hi> and <hi>Reflux of the Sea.</hi>
The vast extent of Waters amaz'd me.
But when I came to consider, that the most
Threatning Billows broke against the
smallest Rocks, and that having no sooner
met 'em, but in despight of all their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness,
they were oblig'd to return with
Violence into themselves; 'twas here that
I cry'd out, transported with Wonder,
and seiz'd with Astonishment:
<q>
                     <l>The Sea eternally does roar,</l>
                     <l>Its angry Billows beat the passive shoar.</l>
                     <l>But Mounds of Sand their might restrain,</l>
                     <l>And force them to their watry Realms
again.</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Neptune</hi> with Indignation sees</l>
                     <l>His Waves ingloriously retreat:</l>
                     <l>Then from the conquering Cliffs he flies,</l>
                     <l>And murmurs at his shame, and sighs at his
Defeat.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>At last, when I had sufficiently consider'd
of these Objects, I took great pleasure to
descend into my self, and there to observe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44397:148"/>
the Structure of an Humane Body, and to
contemplate all the Springs that move this
admirable Machine. I reflected upon the
disposition of so many differing parts, and
yet all necessary to the composition and
conservation of our Bodies; as <hi>Bones,
Nerves, Muscles, Blood</hi> and <hi>Spirits.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
the marvellous Oeconomy of all
these parts, and cry'd out with Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Poor Man! who knowst not these things
but by means of thy senses; Nevertheless,
canst thou boast thy self Author of so excellent
a Work, Thou who understoodst it not till
after 'twas made? And must all the parts
be expos'd to thy Eyes to give thee the least
Insight? 'Tis certain, that the experience of
many Ages has made thee comprehend the
cause of thy Living, Digestion, Motion,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>and yet in despight of thy most exact Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
thou dost not know it but after a very
imperfect manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the other side, casting my Eyes on
the rest of Creatures, I examin'd, with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
<hi>the different Figures of Animals,
the Scales of Fish, the Feathers of Birds,
the Furs of Beasts,</hi> and all those Things
which regarded without attention, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
nothing distinctly to the mind, but
sensibly discovered to me the greatest
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44397:149"/>
Wonders in Nature: For, call that <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny,
Nature, Knowledge,</hi> or <hi>Divinity,</hi>
which creates and governs all below, yet
is it not always a <hi>Soveraign Power?</hi> Is it
not always an <hi>Infinite Wisdom?</hi> Then I
remain'd confounded, to think where I
had been; and I could never enough won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at <hi>the malice of the wicked,</hi> or <hi>the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the unbelieving:</hi> For a Man must
altogether forget himself, and lose the
knowledge of all things, before he loses
that of his Creator.</p>
               <p>On whatever part we cast our Eyes, we
presently perceive the Character of the
Divinity; and whoever studies Nature
throughly, shall find sensible Proofs of the
Power on which it depends.</p>
               <p>But we have some lazy <hi>would-be-wits</hi>
now a-days, always bent to the imitation
of others, who, without ever examining
themselves, or considering of the matter,
espouse the Cause of Impiety, only to
be thought Partners with some famous <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are also some men, who by an
extravagant reach of Soul, will in nothing
depend on their Maker; imagining, that
the Obedience which they should pay to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44397:149"/>
this Infinite Majesty, would take away the
Freedom of their Opinions.</p>
               <p>Not but that we see sometimes the best
and most knowing men in the world fall
under some sort of Incredulity or doubt.
But these do not give themselves the trouble
to discover an Eternal Intelligence by the
<hi>Order of the Vniverse.</hi> Their Curiosity drives
them to consider what is possible to be;
and after having stunn'd their Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with those Infinite Qualities which the
Soul of Man cannot comprehend, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
become incredulous, because they
cannot reconcile the Sentiments of their
<hi>Conceptions</hi> to those of their <hi>Conscience.</hi>
Now as we ought to laugh at <hi>Sots,</hi> and
abhor <hi>the Wicked,</hi> I think that we ought
to have compassion for the last, and to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
'em, only because they are miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>Some people are upon the rack to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
themselves to believe that which
they cannot comprehend. Others attack
Heaven it self, through a fearful Malice,
and blaspheme a God whose Power they
do not understand: So as they are always
in trouble and despair; and after having
been toss'd by the Fury of Impiety, they
find themselves torn by the Remorse of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44397:150"/>
their own Conscience, especially when the
Light forsakes 'em, and the Company
which upholds 'em, leaves 'em in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart
of Solitude. There is no passion so
tormenting but they feel the sting on't;
<hi>Fear, Trouble, Disquiet</hi> and <hi>Madness</hi> tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
'em by turns. It were better for their
Quiet, if they never thought, than to have
but the least Commerce with their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
for nothing equals the Torments of
the Wicked.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>If some lewd Blasphemies he pours,</l>
                  <l>In endless pains he spends the Conscious
Hours.</l>
                  <l>Hagg'd by the Ghastly Image of his sin,</l>
                  <l>No safe retreat without, no peace within.</l>
                  <l>He flyes the Day, he fears the Night,</l>
                  <l>He runs from Truth's all searching light.</l>
                  <l>His Conscience too would leave behind,</l>
                  <l>But in himself both Iudge and Torturer
does find.</l>
               </q>
               <p>The Unbelieving, though they are not
altogether so faulty, are not less Misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Tbey hunt after, with difficulty, a
thing they never find, and at every turn ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cufe
Nature of being cruel only in regard
of Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:44397:150"/>
Thence proceeded the Complaints of
that Great Man, who envy'd the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
which Beasts enjoy'd, of living in a
commodious Ignorance of all things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
disquieting themselves with a search af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
any Truth.</p>
               <p>Thence also proceeds the discontent of
those Men who cannot think, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying those of other Countries; Nor see
any Beast in the sweetness of his Repose,
without envying the Tranquility that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
has bestow'd on him.</p>
               <p>It is then certain, That <hi>the Belief of a God</hi>
makes the best foundation of all Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures;
and the Opinion we have of him,
never suffers a Man to be without satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
in his <hi>Prosperity,</hi> and comfort in
his <hi>Adversity.</hi> A Mind well ordered does
not only tast delights in the <hi>enjoyment of
a Good it receives,</hi> it also finds <hi>Dainties to
thank its Benefactor for;</hi> and every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
it makes upon 'em is a new <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

               </p>
               <p>'Tis to God we must have recourse in
Afflictions; and there is no Anguish so great,
but it may be sweetned by a total resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to His Providence.</p>
               <p>Then let every one judge how much
Religion imports us, How much it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages

us to acknowledg <hi>God,</hi> and to
submit our selves to his will, as well in

of our Repose.</p>

               <head type="sub">That we ought to restrain the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of our Appetites, by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the true Worth of those
things we desire.</head>
               <p>I Find nothing more profitable, and more
important to any one that has a mind
to taste true Content in this Life, than to
oppose his greatest Inclinations, and reduce
his desires to those simple Motions which
we call <hi>Wishes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheless, as there is no Man but has
some particular Inclination and Favourite
Passion, so it is not an easie thing to come
to an <hi>Indifference:</hi> But one may, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
weaken ones Chains; for there
are no Bonds so strong which Reason and
Experience cannot break in time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:44397:151"/>
In effect, as the sweetest Objects have
their Call, so there is no doubt but the
Heart looses much of the force of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
by some disgust. At such a time a Man
lifts himself insensibly up above the World,
the Pleasures that he was wont to hunt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with so much earnestness, then appear
Insipid to him. He then sees how much it
imports him to understand <hi>the True Price of
Glory;</hi> What pain, or what satisfaction
one finds in knowledg, that so we may
not attempt any thing we may repent of;
or expect any thing we cannot hope to
enjoy.</p>
               <p>With these prospects, Is there any Man
whose <hi>Reformation</hi> one ought to doubt of?
He that has been always us'd to <hi>Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
and <hi>Obedience,</hi> shall not he raise his
desires to <hi>the glory of Command?</hi> The
needy, shall not they establish their <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness</hi>
in abundance, tho' they have been
opprest with <hi>want?</hi> A Sluggard that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
the reward of his <hi>Idleness,</hi> and the
<hi>remorses of a bad Life,</hi> shall not he reckon
him happy whom he sees in the esteem of
all <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>good Men?</hi> Those that are
embarrass'd with a Crowd will they not
with for the quiet of the Private?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:44397:152"/>
The Court and its Pomp tires us; The
Woods and the Fields become uneasie to
us: But whoever has not tasted fully of
<hi>Vexation,</hi> cannot easily be persuaded of
its strange effects.</p>
               <p>In short, we may disgust our selves with
our condition, but not with those we
have never experienc'd. And see here
the manner we ought to make use of on
this occasion, to find the <hi>Vanity of all
things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although one has not all the Riches,
all the Merit, all the fair Qualities; yet
one may reflect on them who have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
them by <hi>Fortune</hi> or <hi>Virtue,</hi> and
discover the <hi>Anxiety</hi> they labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
We may see them then opprest with
the same <hi>Maladies</hi> subject as we to the
same <hi>Diseases</hi> that <hi>Nature afflicts us with.</hi>
We shall see a Wise Man not able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
himself from <hi>humour</hi> and <hi>folly:</hi> An
Heroe fe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ble, full of defects, and as much
a Man as they which are below him. And
the greatest Originals of <hi>Europe,</hi> as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to particular weaknesses as the lesser
Copies. We shall find in the end, that
'tis impossible to renounce Nature, and to
raise our selves above the condition that
God has plac'd us in. For in truth there
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44397:152"/>
are no great Men, if we compare 'em one
with another, but they are in themselves
weak, unequal, and deficient in some part
or other. Pomp and Splendor do not
satisfy all those whom they surround.
The excess of Delights palls our Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
oftner than it pleases; and all the
advantages of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> join'd
together, know not how to create a full
and entire <hi>Happiness.</hi> This confideration
moderates the fierceness of our desires,
and it may be will destroy those Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
we have to the most sensible and
pleasing Objects: And then we shall search
after our Content without disquiet, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
it without eagerness; and lose it
without regret.</p>

               <p>THere is no Passion which makes more
unhappy people than this, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all Men entertain for an Universal
esteem: For excepting some Persons of
truly <hi>Heroical Minds,</hi> who act only for
the satisfaction of their Conscience, and
perhaps too for the approbation of good
Men, all the rest do that for Noise, which
ought to be done for Virtue, and suffer
themselves to be inchanted with the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
and appearance of a Thing, whose real
Body doth not so much as affect them.</p>
               <p>They would have all their <hi>Actions</hi> be
esteemed <hi>Virtuous,</hi> but not that they should
indeed be so; They wish nothing more
than <hi>the applause of the people,</hi> tho' in the
midst of such a crowd and agitation 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44397:153"/>
impossible to discern the Truth; and
without considering the <hi>Opinion of the
Wise,</hi> they suppose that all things are to
be <hi>decided by Numbers;</hi> and that the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
of <hi>Learned Men,</hi> whom they are
pleased to call <hi>Fantastical Persons,</hi> cannot
eclipse their Fame.</p>
               <p>The most Ingenious demonstrate on
this occasion a sufficient <hi>siness</hi> in their
Conduct; for being satisfied with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and having had the luck to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
honest Men by some essential quality,
they accommodate themselves in a gross
manner to the humour of the People,
and gain the Vulgar by outward shew and
appearance.</p>
               <p>They commit voluntary Fopperies to
agree with real Fops: They appear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
parts to the Stupid; Subile with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triguzing
Persons; Generous with Men of
Honour; and in a word adapt themselves
to all sorts of Characters with so dextrous
a compliance, that one would say, Their
humour is that of all others.</p>
               <p>But besides that, in this way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
we betray our proper sentiments,
and that we oppose ourselves to the design
of Nature, which has made us more for
our selves than for other Men; I don't
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44397:154"/>
observe that these persons with all their
<hi>good-humour</hi> and <hi>complaisance,</hi> with all
their <hi>feints</hi> and their <hi>dissimulations,</hi> ever
arrive at the point which they propose to
themselves. On the other side, I have
known it a Thousand times by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
That those Men who are so greedy
of <hi>Reputation,</hi> almost always lose it by
that very <hi>irregularity</hi> and <hi>greediness</hi> with
which they seek it; and that nothing so
much interrupts their design, as their <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
Passion</hi> to obtain it.</p>
               <p>In effect, shew me the Man who has at
anytime had <hi>merit</hi> and <hi>good fortune</hi> suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to acquire an esteem <hi>truly general?</hi>
Who is he that was ever <hi>powerful</hi> enough
to <hi>suppress</hi> the <hi>calumnies</hi> of all his <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies?</hi>
And who is he that has been able,
hitherto, to <hi>stop the mouth of Envy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I can certify, that I have known some
Persons so very <hi>agreeable,</hi> and so <hi>virtuous,</hi>
that a Man could not <hi>converse</hi> with
them without <hi>admiration,</hi> and <hi>love.</hi>
They made <hi>Partisans</hi> even of their <hi>own
Enemies;</hi> and one must have been <hi>brutal</hi>
even to <hi>excess,</hi> either to withstand the
<hi>Charms of their Conversation,</hi> or not to be
won by the <hi>Goodness of their Nature.</hi> Yet
for all this, I have seen some envious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44397:154"/>
oppose their <hi>malice</hi> to so <hi>conspicuous a
Virtue;</hi> and according as they had either
<hi>address</hi> or <hi>power,</hi> stop the course of an
<hi>esteem</hi> so just, and so well established.</p>
               <p>Now, since it is impossible to ca<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ch this
<hi>flying Vapour,</hi> after which I see the whole
World runs, What folly is it to labour to
obtain it with so much application, and
pains so ill rewarded!</p>
               <p>Besides this, a <hi>Fop</hi> that desires this <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem</hi>
with <hi>passion,</hi> and does not deserve
it, cannot long enjoy it. A <hi>good Man</hi>
on the otherhand, soon makes <hi>reflections</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>weakness</hi> and <hi>frailty</hi> of this <hi>little
Good;</hi> and feeling his <hi>miseries</hi> even through
the <hi>applauses</hi> which are given to his <hi>felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
he suffers <hi>disquiets</hi> and <hi>uneasinesses,</hi> when
the World cries up his <hi>advantages</hi> and his
<hi>happiness. Verae gloriae cupidi nullâ ratione
quiescere possunt, cum non inveniant unde
possint aliquatenus gloriari.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In effect, Have not we seen a <hi>Vespasian,</hi>
who amongst all his <hi>magnificence</hi> and <hi>splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi>
tired with the tediousness of the
<hi>Triumph,</hi> and sensible of the <hi>vanity</hi> of that
<hi>glory</hi> for which the People <hi>flatter</hi> him, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<hi>melancholly</hi> and <hi>sad;</hi> nay, in the very
<hi>festivals</hi> that were celebrated to thank the
Gods for his <hi>Fortune</hi> and <hi>Prosperity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:44397:155"/>
Have not we seen that great and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
King of <hi>Sweden</hi> despise the accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
of the People? and reject the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyricks
of Orators?</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> whom we lately
lost, regretted by all good Men, Had not
he as great an aversion for this kind of
<hi>esteem,</hi> as our ordinary Courtiers express a
zeal to procure it?</p>
               <p>It is then undeniably true, That 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to acquire it, and that tho' we
should obtain, yet the possession of it
wou'd be absolutely unserviceable; That as
it depends less upon our selves, than upon
<hi>Fortune,</hi> it is found liable to her <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancies;</hi>
That it is a <hi>noise</hi> which strikes
nothing but the <hi>Ear,</hi> and which cannot
form a <hi>sensible impression</hi> upon a <hi>Noble
Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we have a mind then to labour for
our <hi>happiness,</hi> let us endeavour to satisfy
the <hi>Minds</hi> of the <hi>Wise,</hi> who are, 'tis true,
but few in number, but from whom we
may receive <hi>real Approbations.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Hatilius</hi> would not have a <hi>wise Man</hi>
hazard his <hi>Life</hi> for the repose of <hi>Fools:</hi>
But since we owe our Services and our
selves to the advantage of our Countrey,
and the good of our Friends, we ought
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44397:155"/>
always to do <hi>Actions worthy of publick Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause,</hi>
and to despise that very <hi>renown,</hi>
after we have once perform'd them.</p>
               <p>I would not, at the same time, advise
such a sort of <hi>disinteressedness</hi> as should
extend to the finding no <hi>satisfaction</hi> in the
<hi>esteem we deserve;</hi> but as <hi>Censures</hi> follow
<hi>Approbations</hi> close at the heels, let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
the edge of <hi>Malice,</hi> by withstanding
those <hi>false praises</hi> which render it the more
sensible to us; let us take advantage of a
good <hi>Reputation,</hi> and not to be so sottish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stiff, as to forbid our selves all sort of
<hi>complaisance</hi> relating to our own <hi>Merits:</hi>
And if the <hi>Publick</hi> has <hi>unjust Thoughts</hi> of
us, let us appear from their <hi>Opinion</hi> to the

               <byline>By the same Hand.</byline>
               <p>TIS one of the greatest Secrets of
<hi>Life</hi> to know how to <hi>sweeten our
Troubles,</hi> and if we cannot get rid of our
<hi>Afflictions,</hi> at least to weaken the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of them. Without this we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to be often miserable; for being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to an infinite number of Misfortunes,
there hardly passes a day but presents us
with a tast of some new unhappiness.</p>
               <p>Now, I don't know any Remedy so
effectual for this purpose as <hi>foresight;</hi> and
whoever makes an exact reflection upon
the <hi>disappointments</hi> and <hi>crosses</hi> of <hi>humane
Life,</hi> will find himself <hi>consolable</hi> at least
in his <hi>severest disgraces.</hi> For, as 'tis natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
for us to make a <hi>vigorous defence</hi> against
a <hi>premeditated assault,</hi> the Soul which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44397:156"/>
it self for <hi>resistance,</hi> through the
<hi>consideration of danger,</hi> is much less sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and concern'd at it.</p>
               <p>I would have every one then so to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see
and expect all kinds of <hi>Misfortunes,</hi>
that they may not be surprised at whatever
happens.</p>
               <p>Let a happy Courtier enjoy the favour
of his Prince, and possess, as long as it
shall please him, the delights of his good
Fortune; but let the example of so many
Falls dispose him to mistrust the firmness of
his scituation; Let him not always raise
his Eyes, because he is at the top of the
Wheel, but humble them sometimes; let
him regard the place from whence he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to rise, and consider the <hi>first degree of
his Fortune,</hi> as a Precipice, to which he
may every moment fall again.</p>
               <p>Let not a General of an Army be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
secure of Victory, nor be puffed up
with the Glory he has won, as much by
the assistance of his Troops, as by his own
Valour. One single day may determine
his Fortune; but then after the loss of a
Battel, let not him, who was before en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed
with so many people, suppose
himself to be destroyed with them: He
must be unconcerned, he must return to
himself, and enjoy himself again.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:44397:157"/>
Let not a Prince confide in his Empire
without Reason, nor let the <hi>obedience</hi> of so
many people rashly flatter his <hi>Self-Love:</hi>
In Four and twenty hours we have seen
Kings in the <hi>Throne,</hi> and following a <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot.</hi>
In the course of a few days, we
have seen a Prince <hi>Triumph,</hi> and led in
<hi>Triumph.</hi> The <hi>Revolt of the People,</hi> or the
<hi>loss of a Battel,</hi> may dispossess him of the
<hi>Crown,</hi> and put his <hi>Scepter</hi> into a Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
hand.</p>
               <p>And here I cannot forbear to make an
open confession: I adore the <hi>Romans,</hi> and
believe they were something more than
Men. I cannot without a sensible emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
consider <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> who
knowing the frailty of <hi>humane greatness,</hi>
agreed before the Battel began how to
<hi>dispose of their Lives,</hi> and considering the
uncertainty of the event embrac'd one
another as if they were never to meet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
Methinks I see them giving their
<hi>last Adieus</hi> with these noble sentiments of
<hi>Affection</hi> and <hi>Courage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Vulgar</hi> imagine there is a timorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in <hi>foresight,</hi> and as they are unable to
conceive any sort of <hi>danger</hi> without <hi>fear,</hi>
persuade themselves that a <hi>Man cannot fall
into it without blindness.</hi> But as 'tis the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44397:157"/>
fault of such <hi>weak Reasoners,</hi> to venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
many things they don't understand, and
to renounce them as soon as they come
to know them; so it belongs only to
Men of sense to <hi>foresee the dangers that
threaten them,</hi> and to sustain with the same
equality of mind, <hi>the favours and disgraces
of Fortune.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But 'tis not sufficient for us to prepare
our selves only against the loss of the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperities
of Life,</hi> for there are many other
proofs of our Constancy: The death of
our Friends, and even our own, much
more sensibly affect us; and therefore we
ought to expect it with a more solemn
preparation, than a bare simple privation
of extrinsic things, which ought to be
indifferent to wise Men.</p>
               <p>I am thinking every day how many
things are dear to me, and after I have
considered them as <hi>temporary</hi> and <hi>perisha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
I then prepare my self to undergo the
loss of them without <hi>weakness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Sun begins to shine, I don't
rely upon seeing the Evening. The day
and the moment wherein I shall die, will
it not resemble that which I spend to day?
A Man shall equally hear the hurry of the
World, shall enjoy the light, and live af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44397:158"/>
the same manner. Now, since we must
all die, and are in so great uncertainties
as to the time of death, let us prepare our
selves, from this day, to leave one another.
There doth not pass an hour but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body
loses a Friend, I may then likewise
reasonably expect every moment to lose
one of mine; and whenever such a thing
happens, the circumstances of his death
will not encrease my sorrow nor my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.
Perhaps he will shed his Blood
upon a Scaffold; perhaps a Fire will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
him to Ashes, or he shall be swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up in the Sea: But don't imagine that the
circumstances of his death should redouble
my grief, and that I should complain of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so much at his <hi>Funeral,</hi> as the manner
of his loss; 'Tis he that I find wanting,
and it is of no imortance whether he was
taken from me by Water, Sword, or Fire,</p>
               <p>Not that I would be here so wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
misunderstood, as if I would have a
Man become a Barbarian in order to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
himself to Constancy; or that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or Friendship have not a right to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
tears from us, I am so far from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
so <hi>Brutal</hi> an <hi>insensibility,</hi> that I
maintain on the other side, it would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human
to refuse them on certain occasions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:44397:158"/>
We <hi>sigh</hi> and <hi>weep</hi> justly enough in the
first motions of our <hi>Grief,</hi> but a strong,
vigorous Soul ought soon after to retire
within it self, and return to that happy
scituation from whence the disorders of its
Passion had removed it. For can a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Man consider the <hi>unprofitableness
of his Tears,</hi> and the <hi>vanity of his regret,</hi>
but he must of necessity blush at a long
and <hi>violent Affliction?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed in those cases where we are able
to <hi>repair our ill Successes,</hi> I am wholly of
opinion that we ought to employ all sorts
of <hi>Remedies:</hi> But in a <hi>fatal Accident</hi>
which is never to be retrieved, pray tell
me what is the service of a <hi>ridiculous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,</hi>
and <hi>paying Tears</hi> which are at best
<hi>troublesome</hi> to those who shed them, and
<hi>unserviceable</hi> to those for whom they are
shed?
<q>
                     <l>Why do we sigh, or why complain?</l>
                     <l>All these Tears are shed in vain;</l>
                     <l>Deaf to our sorrows and our grief,</l>
                     <l>The Dead receive not this relief.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Besides this, we are to consider, that
the most sensible persons in the World at
length forget their tenderness; and the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44397:159"/>
Soul which at first is afflicted to excess, soon
makes a relaxation of this violence, and
is not long in exhausting the whole stock
of its sorrow.</p>
               <p>Our Complaints wear with our Years,
and as the Object begins to remove it self
from our imagination, our displeasure for
its loss is insensibly removed from our
mind.</p>
               <p>If we were wise then, Should we not
without reluctance resign up those senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Grief to our Reason, which
Weakness at last is constrain'd to resign
to the length of Years?</p>
               <p>A Father who died but two or three
hours ago, is as effectually dead as any of
our Ancestors; and that which is no more
for us, ought no longer to affect us.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Your Father, summon'd by his Fate,</l>
                  <l>Now mixes with his Brother-shades below.</l>
                  <l>Not the least tittle of your State,</l>
                  <l>Your Grief, or Sorrow does he know.</l>
                  <l>Tho' but last night he lost his breath,</l>
                  <l>Yet since He's in the hands of Death,</l>
                  <l>He's full as dead as <hi>Caesar,</hi> who we know</l>
                  <l>Died so many years ago.</l>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:44397:159"/>
This Reason alone is capable of sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
our bitterness, and appeasing all the
motions of our Greif: He whom I lost
but now, feels nothing, has no further
share in the day, and enjoys no more Life
than those who were swallowed up in the
Deluge; Why then should I torment my
self in vain after a shadow, that has nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Voice</hi> nor <hi>Thought?</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Wisely your vain complaints give o're,</l>
                     <l>This foolish Tribute pay no more.</l>
                     <l>For empty shadows why should Tears be shed?</l>
                     <l>Let's bury even the memory of the Dead.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>We ought further to consider, That in
this rigorous separation of Soul and Body,
nature commits no more violence, and
shows no more ill usage to us than she does
to the rest of the World: Of all these
prodigious swarms of Men which fill the
Earth, shew me one single person who
is exempted from the cruelty of her Laws.</p>
               <p>I very well know that every one has a
sense of his <hi>affliction,</hi> and that those whose
example I alledge here, relent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
as well as we: For as we don't for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to tast our own <hi>happiness,</hi> when we
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44397:160"/>
know the <hi>felicity</hi> of others; so the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
we have of the <hi>miseries</hi> of our equals,
deprive not us of the sense of our own
<hi>misfortunes:</hi> And since <hi>private Persons</hi>
partake in the <hi>Publick Rejoycings,</hi> How
should they otherwise than share in the
<hi>General Sorrow?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are some <hi>common misfortunes</hi>
which have a relation to all Men, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Man has his particular sentiments of
them, and so endures, in that sense, the
whole weight of his <hi>affliction</hi> singly.</p>
               <p>Let us confess the Truth: That which
affects us most in our <hi>disgraces,</hi> is to see no
body bear a <hi>resemblance</hi> to us. We cannot
with any patience behold our selves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stined
to suffer an <hi>unhappiness</hi> alone, which
all the World may be affected with as well
as we. And to speak soberly, nothing so
much augments the <hi>sharpness of our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
as the <hi>fierceness</hi> and <hi>pride</hi> of those
who seem to brave and despise them.</p>
               <p>Now it is not mankind alone that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
us to death; all Animals, of what <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
soever, arrive to the same end, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
the same Law. That strength, dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
and foresight which Nature has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon them for the <hi>conservation</hi> of
their <hi>Life,</hi> is of no <hi>use</hi> and <hi>service</hi> to them
at their <hi>death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:44397:160"/>
The most insensible things have their
end, which is a sort of death to them.
Those very <hi>Ramparts</hi> that were proof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all the <hi>batteries of the Cannon,</hi> and
the <hi>violence of Men,</hi> will sooner or later
have their share in this <hi>universal ruine.</hi>
The Elements themselves, which compose
all things, will be at last destroyed.
The Heavens will be turned topsy-turvy;
The Sun and Stars will lose their light;
and all the Mass of the World will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
in a general ruine: Can we then
demand with justice <hi>the everlasting Health
of our Friends,</hi> or of <hi>our selves?</hi> And since
we must dye of necessity, Is it not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
for us to know, that all the things we
have seen will perish, and suffer the same
<hi>destiny</hi> with us?

But behold now an <hi>Affliction,</hi> of which
I am so sensible, that no <hi>Arguments,</hi> no <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
drawn from Philosophy,</hi> can make me
support it: 'Tis that Concern which <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Calamities</hi> inspire me with, in which
my Senses interest me in spite of my self.</p>
               <p>I am not able to hear the <hi>Groans of the
People;</hi> I cannot understand <hi>their Cries,</hi>
nor behold <hi>their Tears,</hi> without feeling
my self affected with a real Compassion.</p>
               <p>I cannot be a spectator of the <hi>disorders
of my Countrey,</hi> nor consider the <hi>ambition
of its Oppressors,</hi> without conceiving an
<hi>invincible aversion for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We likewise experience another sort of
<hi>Vexation,</hi> which invades us in the midst
of <hi>Pleasure it self:</hi> It is nothing else of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
but a <hi>disgust of abundance;</hi> for
our Soul having not strength enough to
digest it, suffers a mighty remission in the
vigour of its <hi>faculties,</hi> and yields at length
to the violence of these <hi>excesses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for this, I find no better, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
no other remedy, than to moderate
our <hi>Passions,</hi> and to manage our <hi>Pleasures</hi>
with a prudent and wise Oeconomy.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Epicurus</hi> revived his <hi>Appetite</hi> by
<hi>abstinence,</hi> and avoided all <hi>excesses</hi> to shun
the <hi>inconvenience of Debauchery;</hi> and as
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44397:161"/>
the continual society even of the best Men,
becomes at length tiresom or insensible,
those persons that have a delicate appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of <hi>Pleasure</hi> will voluntarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
themselves from one another, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the <hi>disquiet that threatens them,</hi> and
to have a better tast of <hi>the charms of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,</hi>
by a new vigour which they
bestow upon their Thoughts.</p>
               <p>There remains nothing more for me to
speak of but another sort of <hi>Vexation,</hi>
whose Cause I am not able to divine; and
as 'tis extreamly difficult to know the real
subject of it; I find that it is hard to sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
it, or to withstand it: It is a <hi>Secret
Displeasure</hi> which hides it self in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Soul, and which we <hi>feel</hi> much
better than we can <hi>discover.</hi> 'Tis that
which goes to Bed with us, which awakes
and rises with us, which attends us at our
Repasts, which follows us in our Walks,
which we carry along with us, as well in
a Crowd, as in Retirement, and which doth
not forsake those whom it has once seized,
till it has exhausted all its power upon
them.</p>
               <p>I have had a wearisome experience of
this Malady, and have often felt the whole
bitterness of it: I have gone with it to the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44397:162"/>
                  <hi>Play-house,</hi> and have come out with
the same. I have carried it into the best
Conversations without any relief; I have,
during its excesses, used the most agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Diversions, but was insensible to them
all the while; and in the midst of the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Ioy,</hi> have been constrained to shew
my <hi>ill humour,</hi> and to appear <hi>disgusted
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> the sweetest contentments of Life;</hi> and
at last have found no other Remedy to
Charm it, but the <hi>pleasure of good Eating
and good Drinking.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Good Cheer with our Friends is the
Soveraign Remedy against this sort of <hi>Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;</hi>
for besides that <hi>Conversation,</hi> which
then becomes more <hi>free</hi> and <hi>pleasant,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly
<hi>sweetens</hi> it, 'tis certain that <hi>Wine
revives the forces of Nature,</hi> and gives our
Soul <hi>vigour sufficient to exclude all sorts of
Melancholly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know some morose, unsociable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
will, at least in outward shew and
appearance, declare a great aversion for
this Remedy, whose Delights notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
they do not contemn. But let us
banish all <hi>grimaces</hi> here; I am little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed
at their <hi>mistaken severities,</hi> since
the most <hi>rigid Philosopher of the World</hi> has
prescribed us this very Remedy; since the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44397:162"/>
severest of our Illustrious Men have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
if I may so express my self, their
<hi>most austere Virtues</hi> to the <hi>charms of this
agreeable pleasure;</hi> and since the best sort
of Persons <hi>disown not the Use of it;</hi> but
are only content to <hi>condemn the Excess.</hi>

               <p>AFter having discoursed of our <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusts,</hi>
and the means of qualifying
the <hi>bitterness of them,</hi> it is not improper
to entertain our selves about the <hi>Pleasures
of Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although, to speak the Truth, extrinsic
things contribute much to our Pleasures,
and 'tis not enough to have Senses, unless
we have Objects to content them; yet the
multitude of them being almost infinite,
as in effect we find; it seems that our <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:44397:163"/>
depends in some measure upon our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and that our greatest <hi>diversions</hi> are
<hi>unpleasant</hi> to us, if our <hi>Senses</hi> are not in a
disposition to receive them.</p>
               <p>As for my self, I am of opinion that we
should never debar our minds of those
<hi>innocent pleasures which occurr,</hi> but live
free from all those <hi>disquietudes</hi> that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of what is past uses to infuse,
as from the <hi>disturbance</hi> we conceive for
what's to come.</p>
               <p>The present time only is ours, and if we
were wise, we should manage every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as it were the last; but nothing is more
ordinary, than the evil use we make of
that time which Nature has allowed us.</p>
               <p>There are few Men but would live long
enough, if they knew how to live well;
but it happens for the most part, that when
we are a dying, we complain of not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
lived as yet.</p>
               <p>If we are destined to a long Life, we
disturb it by the fear of not arriving to
it; and when we are come to our limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we have nothing else left us but the
concern of having manag'd it very ill.</p>
               <p>This Pleasure which now presents it self,
is perhaps the last I shall be sensible of; an
infinite number of pains may overwhelm
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44397:163"/>
me a moment after, Who then shall hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
me from enjoying my self innocently,
whilst I may? Must the difference of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or the inequality of Objects, keep
me always in disorder, when I have power
to live contented in all parts of the Earth?</p>
               <p>I grant that indeed certain Persons are
<hi>dearer to us,</hi> and more <hi>agreeable</hi> than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
that as there are <hi>different Subjects</hi>
to divert us, so there are <hi>delights</hi> more and
less affecting; But for the sake of a <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi>
which I earnestly hoped, am I to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
all others?</p>
               <p>That Life which slides away in the
Countrey, is no less mine than that I pass
at <hi>Paris.</hi> The days wherein I am wholly
<hi>buried in Grief,</hi> will be reckoned to me as
well as my most <hi>joyful Festivals;</hi> and will
contribute as much as they to make up the
number which must confine my years.</p>
               <p>Why then should the <hi>charms of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi>
be troubled here by the <hi>remembrance
of those Pleasures I should have tasted,</hi> or
by the <hi>imagination of those which I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to enjoy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis an imprudence to be desirous thus
to return to those places we had forsaken;
and to endeavour to be present in those,
where we cannot be so soon.</p>

If the <hi>Pleasures</hi> we find in the <hi>Countrey</hi>
are different from those of the <hi>Court,</hi> let
us endeavour to adapt our minds to them:
For who can hinder us from <hi>exalting</hi> and
<hi>humbling</hi> our selves in this manner? We
have here neither <hi>Musick-meetings,</hi> nor
Balls, nor <hi>Play-house;</hi> but then we have
no <hi>disgraces,</hi> no <hi>servitude</hi> to fear or undergo.</p>
               <p>Conversation is not so agreeable here.
Admit it is not, a Man may have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
with himself, and with Persons that
however are not troublesome.</p>

                  <hi>Cato</hi> entertain'd himself with <hi>Children,</hi>

our best <hi>Wits</hi> in <hi>France</hi> disdain not to hear

the most <hi>serious Discourses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Man must endeavour to live easily in
all places, and tast those <hi>Pleasures</hi> which
his respective abode can furnish him with.</p>
               <p>Let us not play the Philosophers so
much, as to condemn by our <hi>austerity</hi> the
<hi>Magnificence of the Court.</hi> I wish we
could imitate the <hi>Virtue</hi> of the Ancient
<hi>Romans.</hi> Let us be Just, let us be Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:44397:164"/>
If we have not wherewith to be splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did,
let us not accuse others of an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
splendor; for certainly one cannot
condemn so much <hi>fine Workmanship</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by <hi>human Industry,</hi> without being
<hi>fantastically severe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One may admire the <hi>Pomp of a glorious
City,</hi> very innocently; one may partake
of the <hi>delights of Perfumes,</hi> and the <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions
of Musick;</hi> In short, one may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
with pleasure the <hi>delicacy of Painting,</hi>
and yet not <hi>infringe the Laws of Temperance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If, by <hi>constraint,</hi> or <hi>inclination,</hi> we have
established our <hi>residence in the Countrey,</hi>
let us there leave off admiring the Labours
of Man, in order to Contemplate the
Works of the Creator, and the Wonders
of Nature: Let us remove our thoughts
from the <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Glories of the Court,</hi>
and innocently tast the <hi>sweets</hi> which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
in <hi>solitary places.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Heavens,</hi> the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Stars,</hi> the

                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:44397:165"/>
In a word, we may live contented in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
part of the World, and we only change
our pleasure, when we change the place of
our abode.</p>
               <p>Here the mind finds its satisfaction in the
study of Nature; Here our Senses meet
with their delights; and whoever is capable
of moderation, may find in all places but
too fertile a scene for his contentment.
Neither the limits of Solitude, nor the
little space of a Prison, can hinder a wise
Man from finding his tranquillity: He
may meditate there, and with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
reflect on the good Actions he has
done, and comfort himself by the pleasing
thoughts of his Innocence.</p>
               <p>A Man does not always lie under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
to enjoy the full extent of the Fields
in order to be happy. Our <hi>happiness</hi> for
the general part lies in our selves; and as
we sometimes find our selves uneasy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the full enjoyment of our Liberty, so
it may very well happen, that we may be
satisfied even in those Prisons in which we
are confined.</p>
               <p>The most cruel Tyrants in the Universe
could never yet find Dungeons for our
Souls; they cannot become Masters of it,
unless we are willing to enslave it our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44397:166"/>
Their Chains cannot bind it, and
let the Body be enclos'd in what place it
will, it changes neither place nor habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>Thus we may find contentments every
where; Let us endeavour only to enjoy
them with moderation; and rest persuaded
that it is an error to condemn <hi>Pleasures as
Pleasures,</hi> and not as they are <hi>unjust and
unlawful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In truth, let them be never so inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
the <hi>excess is always criminal,</hi> and
tends not only to our <hi>disgrace,</hi> but to
our <hi>dissatisfaction.</hi> A Man that loseth his
<hi>Reputation by Debauchery,</hi> very often loses
his <hi>Health</hi> too, and hurts his <hi>Constitution</hi>
no less than his <hi>Honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we are insensible to <hi>the Charms of
Pleasure,</hi> let us excite our <hi>Tast</hi> and <hi>our
Appetite</hi> by a just consideration of those
<hi>pains</hi> which are their contraries.</p>
               <p>Let those who find themselves abound
in the conveniencies of Life, tast their
happiness by the opposition of the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
of others; and let the thought of
<hi>misfortunes</hi> make them deliciously enjoy
that felicity which they possess.</p>
               <p>Let a good Man make reflections upon
the state of his Conscience, and rejoyce
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44397:166"/>
that he finds neither <hi>remorse</hi> nor <hi>anguish</hi> in
the bottom of his heart.</p>
               <p>Let <hi>Health,</hi> which we ordinarily tast
after the same manner as we do an <hi>insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Good;</hi> let this <hi>rich present</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi>
I say be felt more lively by the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Diseases and Infirmities, to which
so many others are liable.</p>
               <p>Let a Man of good Health, esteem him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
happy, not only in the enjoyment of
his felicity, but let the thought of endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
nothing amongst so many troublesom
Objects that encompass him, render him
still more undisturbed; Let him rejoyce
not only for the <hi>good fortune</hi> which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys,
but likewise for the <hi>unhappiness</hi> he
has not: Let the <hi>Pleasure</hi> which he tasts,
and the <hi>Pain</hi> which he suffers not, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
equally to give him new satisfactions.</p>
               <p>As to what remains, let us banish that
disorderly passion of <hi>Envy,</hi> that vile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
passion which corrupts all
our <hi>Pleasures.</hi> Let not our Eyes or Ears
become in the least concerned for posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
that don't belong to us; but let us
partake, without Covetousness, of all the
Charms of those places which we go to
see. Every thing that is made for the
pleasure of sight, Doth it not belong to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44397:167"/>
me, so long as it is exposed before mine?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Louvre, Luxembourg</hi> House, and
the <hi>Tuilleries,</hi> as much belong to me, when
I am gazing upon their Beauty, as to those
whose legally they are. For, to speak
properly, nothing can be ours, but by an
actual enjoyment. The conclusion which
I infer from all these Discourses, is, that
we ought to rejoyce with Moderation.
To apprehend this Assertion rightly, all
that is done in the World, is done only
for pleasure; and tho we take different
ways, yet we see all mankind incline to
the same end.</p>
               <p>He that searches for Reputation in the
Field, and breaks through all the dangers
of Fire and Bullets to obtain Honour,
would not expose himself to the least
Danger, if he did not expect that satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one finds in himself, or that which is
derived from Fame.</p>
               <p>He that grows old in his Closet, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
a parcel of Mouldy, Moth-eaten
Books, would not employ the least pains
in the acquisition of Sciences, if he did
not receive some pleasure in the pursuit:
All our Actions have no real object, but
Pleasure; without that the most Labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Persons would Live languishing and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44397:167"/>
idle. 'Tis that alone which makes us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
'tis that which stirs all bodies; 'tis
that which gives motion to all the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse:
Let every one then follow that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
which suits best with his <hi>innocent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,</hi>
and enjoy all <hi>Delights</hi> that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
themselves to him, when they are not
repugnant to the true Sentiments of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
or <hi>Conscience.</hi>

            <head>To Mademoiselle L.…A
Consolatory Discourse upon
the Death of Monsieur M…</head>
            <byline>By Mr. MANNING.</byline>
            <p>I Hear, <hi>Madam,</hi> that you lament the
death of Monsieur M… and am sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that it is your Duty to lament it: He
was a person of <hi>extraordinary Merit;</hi> he
Lov'd you tenderly; he had done you
great Services: How cruel, how unjust,
nay, how ungrateful would you be, if
you did not bewail his loss! I am so well
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44397:168"/>
perswaded of the greatness of it, that I
am even in pain to know if you have been
able to preserve your Senses all this while;
I wish the abandoning of your Eyes and
Mouth to sorrow may be the utmost of your
<hi>affliction:</hi> What way soever you escape,
you will give the World sufficient proofs
of your <hi>Wisdom,</hi> if you don't <hi>run Mad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let others shed Tears by measure, and
proportion their sadness to the occasion of
it, I shall not be surprised; but it would
be an amazing thing to see you afflict your
self by Rules; you, who may so justly
mourn, you, who have no other way to
signalize your gratitude than by your <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps it may be represented to you,
that you ought to weep with more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and that your Sex, your Age, and
your Condition, exempt you from aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
your self intirely to your Grief:
But believe me <hi>Madam,</hi> don't for all that
deprive your self of the satisfaction of
Weeping; Answer the Duties of a just
Friendship to the full: Mourn without
constraint for a Man, whose chast delights
you were; and without shame lament a
Man, who could not be but the delights
of the Chast. In dying he has set all your
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44397:168"/>
Sentiments at Liberty; and his death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
you from those scruples, which tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
you during his Life.</p>
            <p>It would be in vain for <hi>Slander</hi> to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpret
your complaints: The Relation
that was betwixt him and you doth but
too highly justify you. 'Tis apparent, as
you were so nearly joyn'd in blood, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a lawful correspondence could
be established between you.</p>
            <p>You could find nothing in him but <hi>Wit,
Honour</hi> and <hi>Wisdom:</hi> These Qualities,
generally speaking, are not overmuch the
favourites of our Senses. They are fitter to
raise Friendship than Love; and to serve
as a support for Virtue, than to afford
matter for Passion.</p>
            <p>You could not be tempted, either with
Youth, Beauty, Riches or Splendor: He
had neither wherewith to purchase, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
you; and Nature and Fortune e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
conspired to deny him what might
engage a Lady of your merit to Love, and
what might engage himself to miscarry.
Alas! who is ignorant that if you had been
inclined to one of the two, either your
Love might have chosen Demy-Gods for its
Objects, or your Wants might have found
Treasures for their Recompense?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:44397:169"/>
Let them alone then, let them talk who
have not the gift of silence: <hi>Innocence</hi>
and <hi>Virtue</hi> are not a sufficient sanctuary
against <hi>Calumny. Sanctity</hi> it self has not
defended the <hi>Pauls,</hi> the <hi>Melanius's;</hi> and
if <hi>Canonized Friendships</hi> have been <hi>suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
why should not yours, as untainted
as it is, be brought into <hi>question?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, Where's the advantage of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining
your self?</hi> you run an equal ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
both by <hi>dissimulation,</hi> and by <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulging
your Grief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you <hi>divulge</hi> it, you will perhaps a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken
the Reproach; but if you <hi>dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
you will undoubtedly encrease it:
And as it is always sooner fastened upon
<hi>concealed Actions,</hi> than those that are <hi>above-board,</hi>
it will impute your <hi>moderation to
your Artifice,</hi> and the <hi>serenity of your Face</hi>
to the easie <hi>submission of your mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, <hi>Madam,</hi> I would have your <hi>Grief</hi>
keep to appearances, and take a <hi>superficial
Calm</hi> for a <hi>profound Tranquillity.</hi> What
will you advance by this Conduct? If it
doth not find you too tender, it will find
you too ungrateful. I leave it to you to
judge, whether it is better to be accused
of a <hi>Vice,</hi> or of a <hi>Passion?</hi> And if it is
more shameful to appear <hi>susceptible of Love,</hi>
than <hi>capable of ingratitude?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:44397:169"/>
But why should I seek Reasons to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
your <hi>affliction?</hi> Can it be possible
that you should fear to hazard your Tears
upon the death of your Friends, and that
you must be heartned against the attempts
of <hi>Calumny,</hi> to dispose you to pay the last
offices to <hi>Friendship?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, what can my design
be here? and who obliges me to wish that
your <hi>Grief</hi> may be <hi>free and violent,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of being <hi>moderate and constrained?</hi>
I would have it <hi>free,</hi> lest it should prove
dangerous; I would have it <hi>violent,</hi> for
fear it should be of continuance: It might
attempt some violence upon you, if you
should keep it captive: It would be last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
if you should let it be moderate. I
consent to have it make your tenderness
appear; but I pretend likewise to have it
demonstrate your force of Mind; you will
acquit your self of the Duty of a <hi>good
Friend,</hi> in lamenting your <hi>Friend;</hi> As you
will perform the duty of an <hi>Heroic Woman,</hi>
in not lamenting too long.</p>
            <p>Manage your self then in such a manner,
that your <hi>Grief</hi> may not be unworthy of
him, and that it may be worthy of your
self: Lament then, if you please, as a <hi>Heroe;</hi>
but lament him in the quality of a <hi>Heroine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:44397:170"/>
I allow you more than this; abandon
your self for some time to your <hi>affliction;</hi>
but take care to see it so well satisfied in
that time, that it may require no farther
a Tribute from you.</p>
            <p>Entertain it as long as you think fit,
with the <hi>Idea</hi> you conceive of your <hi>Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
Deceased;</hi> Represent to your self
that <hi>Noble Countenance,</hi> that <hi>severe Air,</hi>
those <hi>venerable Wrinkles;</hi> in a word, that
Head of <hi>Socrates,</hi> which denoted so well
both the <hi>Soldier</hi> and <hi>Philosopher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then proceed to the qualities of his
Mind: Reflect upon that natural eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which rendred things of the greatest
moment entirely familiar to him. Consider
with what clearness he pierced into the
obscurest matters; with what subtilty he
examined the most curious; with what fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundity
he handled the most barren; and
with what solidity he made choice of the
most important.</p>
            <p>From thence proceed, if you will, to
the equality of his Soul: Consider what
an absolute Command he had over his
Senses; and his Moderation, that made him
renounce all Pleasures.</p>
            <p>Then after you have considered the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity
of his Manners, consider also how
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44397:170"/>
easie they sate upon him: What indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
had he not for all those defects that
might be supportable in a <hi>civil Life?</hi> Did
he not seem to believe that he singly was
obliged to be <hi>Wise?</hi> And (directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to the rest of Men) did he not more
easily dispense with the greatest <hi>infirmities
of his Friends,</hi> than the meanest of his own
<hi>imperfections?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can you imagine any person to be more
<hi>Virtuous?</hi> Yes, without doubt, <hi>Madam,</hi>
his <hi>Virtue</hi> went yet further, since he made
it no less a scruple to <hi>discover the Vices of
his Enemies,</hi> than to <hi>publish his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You know, <hi>Madam,</hi> that one of the
most powerful Men of <hi>Europe</hi> was his
Enemy, and proved the instrument of his
ruine; and yet you know, <hi>Madam,</hi> that
your Friend never failed to pay the <hi>respect
due to his Quality,</hi> nor the <hi>discretion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
his defects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No doubt on 't but he was perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted,
and consummate in this <hi>Wisdom</hi> of
condemning no body, since he preserved
it even in favour of those who oppressed
him.</p>
            <p>How many Thousands, in his Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
would have exclaim'd against the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44397:171"/>
Times and Manners! How many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
would at least have reveng'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of the injustice done them, by speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Truth! and in a word, <hi>sharpened
their Tongues to destroy their Enemy,</hi> to
discover the <hi>Vices of his Mind,</hi> and the
<hi>disorders of his Soul;</hi> the <hi>baseness of his
Designs,</hi> and the <hi>iniquity of his Actions;</hi>
the <hi>evil use of his Authority,</hi> and the <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>employment
of his Riches;</hi> the <hi>indiscretion
of his Conduct,</hi> and the <hi>indignity of his
Person!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Friend was Master of a Soul too
generous, as well as strong to evaporate
his <hi>Grief</hi> in <hi>Complaints</hi> and <hi>Invectives.</hi>
He was convinced that nothing more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credits
the <hi>violence of wicked Men,</hi> than
the <hi>moderation of the good.</hi> He knew well
that <hi>Persecutors never become more odious,</hi>
than by the <hi>Wisdom of those whom they
Persecute.</hi> He was contented to let his
<hi>silence</hi> and <hi>reservedness</hi> declare him worthy
of a better Age.</p>
            <p>He would not say a Word that might
deserve his disgrace. He would not do
an Action, that might acquit the Authors
of it. In a word, He would oppose no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to their <hi>Ambition,</hi> but his <hi>Modesty;</hi>
to their <hi>Violence</hi> but his <hi>Constancy;</hi> to their
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44397:171"/>
               <hi>Authority,</hi> but his <hi>Prudence:</hi> And without
doubt the Conduct which he preserved in
his <hi>Disgrace,</hi> was a perpetual exercise of
these <hi>Virtues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am perswaded that he practised
all the rest in Prosperity: But although
great Souls are always great in both For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
I ever took more care to observe
them in the bad, than in the good. I look
upon them in the good, as in a carreer of
Exercises and Sports; I regard them in
the bad, as in a Field of Hardships and
Battels.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Virtues</hi> of a <hi>happy Man</hi> are agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and easie; the <hi>Virtues</hi> of the <hi>unhappy</hi>
are difficult and troublesome. In a word,
the <hi>happy Man</hi> has nothing else to do,
but to give himself up to his <hi>Virtues;</hi> and
the <hi>unhappy</hi> must even sacrifice himself to
his.</p>
            <p>I look upon your Friend then through
the finest part of his Life, when I consider
him in his Adversity: Nevertheless I leave
you the liberty to recall the most agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ideas, that ever his good Fortune fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
you with.</p>
            <p>You may still do more, and you will
undoubtedly: You will recollect all the
Marks of Friendship which he gave you;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44397:172"/>
you will recall all his tenderness, and all
his Services. Grief is too ingenious not
to make an exact search after all: things
that may be of advantage to it: It is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
to live at the expence of the
memory, and as long as it can find any
subsistence, I question not, but it will rake
up all its corners, and put all the subservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
faculties in agitation.</p>
            <p>But after all, there must be a time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
to this <hi>Passion;</hi> and indeed time
it self will prescribe limits to it.</p>
            <p>I know there are some obstinate people
in the World, who have swore an Oath of
Fidelity to their Grief, and contracted with
it for their whole Life. But what offence
has Nature done them, that they should
thus throw themselves into the party of her
Adversary? It is true, she has deprived
them of what they loved. But what, if
she makes us die without our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
can we take it amiss that she destroys
others without our permission? Are not
other people of less value to us, than our
selves? And since we must learn to dye
without repugnance, should we not learn
to see others dye without despair?</p>
            <p>Let us refer then, both our own <hi>Death,</hi>
and that of our <hi>Friends,</hi> to the <hi>order</hi> of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44397:172"/>
               <hi>Vniverse.</hi> Let us consider our <hi>Friends,</hi>
whilst they live, as <hi>good things</hi> we are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged
to part with. Let us consider
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they are <hi>dead,</hi> as <hi>good things,</hi>
which we were to enjoy but for a short
space. Thus we shall enjoy them without
too much <hi>inquietude;</hi> and shall lose them
without too much <hi>concern.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You will alledg to me perhaps, that
<hi>Precepts</hi> are of no <hi>service;</hi> that <hi>enjoyment</hi>
has always afforded <hi>pleasure,</hi> and that <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
will always cause <hi>pain.</hi> But exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
well, <hi>Madam,</hi> whether you are not
mistaken in some manner upon the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The greatest part of the World believes
that the <hi>privation</hi> of a great happiness, is
a great <hi>misfortune:</hi> The most <hi>judicious
part</hi> believes the contrary; great Men, 'tis
true, have <hi>established this Errour,</hi> but great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
have opposed it. I make you the <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trator.</hi>
Is it not certain that there is no
<hi>medium</hi> between <hi>enjoyment</hi> and <hi>privation;</hi>
but that there is one between <hi>pleasure</hi> and
<hi>pain,</hi> which is <hi>indolence?</hi> How then can
you pretend we are obliged to fall from
<hi>pleasure</hi> into <hi>pain,</hi> just as we fall from <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment</hi>
into <hi>privation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:44397:173"/>
The <hi>Philosophers</hi> that have received no
grief by their Losses, and the <hi>Saints,</hi> who
have even extracted <hi>Ioy</hi> from them, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
justify, that <hi>privation</hi> is not a natural
cause of <hi>Pain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Blind,</hi> the <hi>Cripples,</hi> and the <hi>Infirm,</hi>
whom neither their <hi>Reason</hi> nor <hi>Holiness</hi>
has raised above <hi>Sensibility,</hi> justify it yet
more. We see them rejoyce like other men,
yet they endure the most cruel of all <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</hi>
But we need not admire at it. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
teaches them to support themselves
for the Pleasures they have lost, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
upon those which remain to them;
and they have always enough, provided
their mind is not distracted with <hi>pain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Observe then, if you please, that in
<hi>Privations</hi> the <hi>Pain</hi> doth not always di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract
our Mind; that the cutting off of
a hand, doth not hinder us from being
<hi>Voluptuous:</hi> But that a <hi>Gouty-hand</hi> makes
us insensible of all <hi>Pleasures.</hi> For there
needs no more to prove that <hi>Pain</hi> must
have a real cause, and by consequence
cannot be the effect of <hi>Privation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I don't disown, but that the loss of what
has afforded us <hi>Pleasure,</hi> does furnish
us with an occasion of <hi>Grief;</hi> the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of all Mankind would contradict so
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44397:173"/>
Fantastical an Opinion. I should have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me the Tears of all <hi>Widows,</hi> the
Cries of all <hi>Orphans,</hi> the Mourning of all
<hi>Relations,</hi> and the Voice of all the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But must be granted also, that <hi>privation</hi>
is not a cause of <hi>Pain;</hi> otherwise <hi>Pain</hi>
would be Eternal, as <hi>Privation</hi> is.</p>
            <p>You know, <hi>Madam,</hi> that there is no
<hi>Privation,</hi> but what is <hi>Eternal;</hi> and that
there is no <hi>Grief</hi> but what is <hi>Transitory.</hi>
So that if to prove <hi>Privation</hi> to be a
cause of <hi>Grief,</hi> you alledg the Example
of all those, who <hi>Mourn;</hi> to prove that
<hi>privation</hi> is but an occasion of <hi>Grief,</hi> I can
use for my own justification, the example
of all those who are Comforted. Is it not
true, that those who are comforted are in
a state of <hi>Privation,</hi> as well as those who
are Afflicted? 'Tis therefore probable that
<hi>Privation</hi> is not precisely a cause of <hi>pain;</hi>
and that we must admit some other, which
suffers degrees and variations.</p>
            <p>I am of opinion <hi>Madam,</hi> it would not
be improper here to discover to you this
<hi>Cause,</hi> and to let you see why it doth not
act upon some particular minds: Why it
acts upon others: Why it ceases or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
to act; and in a word, why it acts
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44397:174"/>
with more or less <hi>Violence:</hi> But as this
Discussion would engage me in too large
a Field, so it would put you to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of too intense an Application, which
perhaps in your present condition you
are not capable of making.</p>
            <p>I would treat you as a Lady of <hi>Resolution</hi>
and <hi>Learning,</hi> and also as a <hi>languishing</hi> or
a <hi>curious Person;</hi> I am for leaving to your
She-Friends the care of sweetning your
Affliction by their Tears, and for reserving
to my self the employment of engaging
it with my Reasons. But as I pretend to
consine my self to useful things, I will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
my self only to what may be proper
for your cure.</p>
            <p>To which end, <hi>Madam,</hi> you need only
make a short Reflection upon the Causes
of Grief: You know that all Grief im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
proceeds from Separation, and
that there are two kinds of Separation:
(For one relates to things continued, and
t'other to things united,) But you are
perhaps still to be informed that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of continued things occasions the
pain of the Body; and that the Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of things united, causes the pain in the
Mind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:44397:174"/>
In the mean time, 'tis of no great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
to dwell longer upon this cause,
by reason it is not possible to hinder Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
from producing Pain, and that
it is even impossible to hinder <hi>Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We must ascend somewhat higher, and in
that imitate the Conduct of the <hi>Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
who seldom have any regard to the
nearest Cause, but always apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to that which is remote, because 'tis
that which seeds the Distemper, and is the
cause of ill Humours; and 'tis chiefly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this that their Remedies exert their
Vertue.</p>
            <p>The remote cause of the <hi>pain in the
Mind,</hi> is <hi>Opinion.</hi> But what is this <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?</hi>
Some say that it is an <hi>undertermined
Iudgment.</hi> As for my self, I take it to be
<hi>the evil Choice of our Iudgment.</hi> At least
I don't apprehend how <hi>indetermination</hi>
agrees with what one ordinarily calls <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi>
There is nothing less indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
than that: For does it not princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
proceed from the force of <hi>Opinion</hi>
that we expose our selves to <hi>Dangers,</hi> to
<hi>Vexations,</hi> and to <hi>Death it self?</hi> Wou'd we
incur so many <hi>Hazards for real Benefits?</hi>
What likelihood then is there that <hi>Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:44397:175"/>
would engage us so far, if it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but an <hi>undetermined Iudgment?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have here great <hi>Discoveries</hi> to make
to you, did I rather <hi>propose</hi> to my self to
satisfy your Mind, than to calm your
Heart. I would then endeavour to shew
you after what manner <hi>Opinion is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
and how it <hi>moves the Mind and the
Body:</hi> But when you have well <hi>consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
that <hi>Opinion</hi> is the <hi>remote cause of Grief,</hi>
you will have almost all the <hi>Knowledg,</hi>
which is necessary for <hi>your Cure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Pain</hi> are the Sentiments
which <hi>our Soul</hi> has of what is agreeable
or offensive to us: But because nothing
can feel, if it doth not touch, nor be felt
if it is not touched, it follows of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
that what produces <hi>pleasure</hi> and <hi>pain
must touch the Soul;</hi> it is certain then
that all <hi>sensible Beings</hi> necessarily touch it:
But all <hi>Beings</hi> are not <hi>necessarily sensible:</hi>
There are none but those, which are <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful</hi>
or <hi>prejudicial</hi> to us in themselves,
that are so; and these are <hi>the Goods</hi> or
<hi>Evils</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The rest, which are called <hi>indifferent,</hi>
are not so but when they lose <hi>their indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;</hi>
and they never lose it, but when
<hi>Opinion</hi> fastens to them the Idea of <hi>Good</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:44397:175"/>
or <hi>Evil,</hi> and then they become the <hi>Goods</hi>
or <hi>Evils</hi> of <hi>Opinion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Idea of <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil</hi> is no
sooner fix'd to an <hi>Object,</hi> but the Soul
unites it self with it, or separates from it.
This <hi>Vnion</hi> is made by a kind of touch,
which gives <hi>pleasure to the Soul;</hi> and this
<hi>Separation</hi> is made by a motion which gives
<hi>pain</hi> to it, and which cannot be better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
than by the word <hi>Divulsion,</hi> which
Physick has appropriated to its own use.</p>
            <p>You see then, <hi>Madam,</hi> that the <hi>separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Soul from its Objects,</hi> is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<hi>Cause of Pain;</hi> and that <hi>Opinion</hi>
must be the remote <hi>Cause</hi> of it, since it is
the <hi>cause</hi> of this <hi>separation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Principle being once established,
it is easie to explain all the degrees and
differences of <hi>Pain,</hi> by the greater or
lesser violence which the Soul endures, in
disengaging it self from those objects to
which it was fastened.</p>
            <p>But we must pass to a more useful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
and observe after what
manner <hi>Opinion</hi> acts against us, that we
may know how to act against <hi>Opinion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I find then that <hi>Opinion</hi> cheats us three
ways; Sometimes it gives us an Idea of <hi>Good</hi>
and <hi>Evil</hi> altogether false; oftentimes it gives
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44397:176"/>
us one that is false in part, and almost al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
misapplies their real Idea to <hi>objects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It gives us an Idea of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
false, when it makes them pass
with us for what they are not: It gives us
an Idea partly false, when it makes us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them to be less, or greater than they
really are. It misapplies their real Idea to
Objects, either when it applies it to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
from which it disagrees; or to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
with which it agrees less than with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
or to an object with which it agrees
no more than all other objects of the like
nature.</p>
            <p>Thus, although <hi>Existence</hi> and <hi>Nothing,
Life</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> are neither <hi>Goods</hi> not
<hi>Evils,</hi> yet <hi>Opinion</hi> has made them pass
for the greatest <hi>Goods</hi> and the greatest
<hi>Evils</hi> in the World.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding <hi>Health</hi> is the most va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
Gift of <hi>Nature,</hi> yet the Covetous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Gifts of Fortune to it; and fear less to
become indisposed, than to become poor.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Opinion</hi> has given us these
Ideas, either absolutely false, or false in part,
or misapplied as to the Objects, it wholly
puts the Soul upon possessing the <hi>Good,</hi> or
avoiding the <hi>Evil,</hi> which it presents to it.
It prepossesses it so much, that it hinders
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44397:176"/>
it from disposing it self to the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and enjoyment of other <hi>Goods;</hi> and
leaves it no leisure to beware of other
<hi>Evils,</hi> and to avoid them: Insomuch that
it seems the Soul knows but one <hi>Single Good,</hi>
and one <hi>single Evil;</hi> or at least but one
<hi>great Good,</hi> and one <hi>great Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This state of <hi>prepossession</hi> is a kind of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce</hi>
that the Soul makes from all other
<hi>Goods,</hi> in order to unite it self more strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the <hi>Good</hi> it espouses.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Good</hi> which proceeds from its
choice, appears to be solely made for it,
and reduces it to the necessity of being no
longer happy, than by its possession.</p>
            <p>'Tis for this Reason, that too <hi>passionate
Lovers</hi> cannot partake of other <hi>pleasures</hi>
than those which they receive from <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithstanding this <hi>Good of Opinion,</hi>
the <hi>Good</hi> of the <hi>choice of the Soul,</hi> is not
more solid, or more durable than the rest;
and as soon as it comes to fail, the Soul
which knew nothing else for the <hi>object of
its felicity,</hi> no longer knows where to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
it self.</p>
            <p>It sees nothing that can make amends
for what it has lost; and till such time
as it has formed another Idea full as strong
and as agreeable, it remains fixed in the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44397:177"/>
contemplation of the change it finds in
its <hi>object,</hi> or else it acts in the search of
other <hi>objects.</hi> When it was fixed, its
<hi>pain</hi> is stupid and dumb: when it moves,
its <hi>pain</hi> is restless and complaining.</p>
            <p>To cure our selves of <hi>Opinion,</hi> and
consequently of the <hi>pain</hi> it occasions to
us, we must do against it, the contrary of
what it doth against us; We must frame
to our selves a true Idea of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil:</hi>
and either correct what is false in the
Idea we have; or if we conceive a just
one, to apply it well to <hi>objects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to frame a true Idea of <hi>Good</hi>
and <hi>Evil,</hi> a Man has nothing else to do
but to consult <hi>Nature;</hi> what it avoids is
really <hi>bad;</hi> what it searches after is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionably<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we must take care, that there are
things which it avoids or desires merely
for themselves; and likewise that there
are other things which it avoids or desires
to shun or obtain others.</p>
            <p>The first are <hi>pleasure</hi> and <hi>pain;</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
are those which may afford us <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi>
and <hi>pain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We must also remark, that the things
which <hi>Nature</hi> desires for themselves, are
those one may call <hi>good</hi> of themselves;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44397:177"/>
and that all others have but a borrowed
<hi>goodness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Examine, as long as you please, all the
<hi>Goods</hi> of the World, and you will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
find them much more desirable than
really they are, till you have enjoy'd them.
Examine likewise all the <hi>Evils,</hi> and you
will always, find them to be feared beyond
what they ought to be, till you have made
the experiment your self.</p>
            <p>You may demand of me here why <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>
opposes <hi>Pleasure,</hi> if <hi>Pleasure</hi> is the <hi>good
of Nature?</hi> And you may likewise add,
That <hi>Virtue</hi> ought not to be called a <hi>Good,</hi>
if it is contrary to the essence of <hi>Good.</hi>
But if you regard <hi>Virtue</hi> near at hand,
you will observe that it is not <hi>Pleasure</hi>
which it opposes, but only the species and
excess of <hi>Pleasure.</hi> You will also see,
that when it opposes either the <hi>species</hi> or
the <hi>excess</hi> of it, 'tis only done in its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
to render it greater, or more secure.</p>
            <p>All moral <hi>Virtues</hi> are but means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
both <hi>Pleasure</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
in <hi>Pleasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Might I assume the freedom here to make
a little digression, I would make you sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
that the <hi>severest Virtues</hi> are but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Mediators between <hi>pleasure</hi> and <hi>pain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:44397:178"/>
But what should we say of those <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Virtues</hi> which have no other <hi>object,</hi> or
at least no other allurement but <hi>Pleasure;</hi>
and which conduct us to God no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than as He is the source of <hi>Eternal
pleasures?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What shall we say of those Expressions
used by the Prophets, who say that <hi>God
will o'rewhelm us with a torrent of pleasure?</hi>
In a word, what shall not we say of the
<hi>opinion</hi> of the greatest Doctors, and the
greatest Saints, who believed. That <hi>the
joy of seeing God, would make up the essence
of our Eternal felicity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All these advantages would be of migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
use to establish <hi>pleasure</hi> for the <hi>single
good</hi> of <hi>Nature:</hi> But let us keep to the
most simple and most evident Reasons:
and agree, That since there is nothing
<hi>good</hi> but what affords <hi>pleasure,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<hi>bad</hi> but what affords <hi>pain,</hi> it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that <hi>pleasure</hi> and <hi>pain,</hi> are really the
<hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this being well understood, would you
believe, <hi>Madam,</hi> that a pretended Prince
of Philosophers, has affirmed that <hi>Nothing</hi>
was the greatest of all <hi>evils;</hi> and that <hi>Death</hi>
was the most formidable? Will not you
maintain against him, That they are not
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44397:178"/>
               <hi>evils,</hi> since they represent no Idea of <hi>pain?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can <hi>Nothing</hi> do an injury to what is
not? And can <hi>Death</hi> prejudice what is no
more? <hi>Nothing</hi> takes away the subject of
<hi>pain; Death</hi> destroys it; and neither of
them can be the principle of it, since
they are both <hi>Nothing,</hi> and that to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
there must be <hi>existence</hi> in the Case.</p>
            <p>You see theu, that by forming to your
self a just and natural Idea of <hi>evil,</hi> you
exterminate presently the two most formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
Monsters, that <hi>opinion</hi> ever brought
forth.</p>
            <p>I own there is an infinite number of
things which we call <hi>evils.</hi> Shall we then
give the Lie to Mankind, or shall we force
it to change its Language? No, <hi>Madam,</hi>
I know that the publick Voice has right
to impose Names; But have not we also
a right to interpret the names which it
imposes?</p>
            <p>We may say then, that this name of
<hi>Evil,</hi> which properly belongs to <hi>pain,</hi> has
been transferred to all things that may
produce it. We have divided them into
<hi>Evils,</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> of <hi>Opinion,</hi> and of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>evils</hi> of <hi>Fortune</hi> and of <hi>Opinion</hi>
only differ in this, That all the <hi>evils</hi> of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44397:179"/>
               <hi>Fortune,</hi> are <hi>evils</hi> of <hi>Opinion;</hi> and that all
the <hi>evils</hi> of <hi>Opinion</hi> are not evils of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:</hi>
Wheresore we may reduce all <hi>evils</hi>
to those of <hi>Opinion</hi> and <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under this term of <hi>evils of Nature,</hi> we
understand all kinds of <hi>Pains</hi> and <hi>Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi>
and all natural inconveniencies.</p>
            <p>And we use to comprehend them in
three conditions of Life, in which it is as
it were impossible to be without <hi>pain:</hi>
And they are. <hi>Indisposition of Body, Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,</hi>
and <hi>Poverty.</hi> But these three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
sometimes leave us so much indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and tranquillity, that one cannot so
much call them the <hi>evils of Nature,</hi> as
<hi>evils of Opinion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not enough for us to have a just
Idea of <hi>evil</hi> in general, we must also have
a just one in particular; and after having
known that all <hi>evils</hi> are <hi>pains,</hi> we must
know what are those <hi>pains</hi> which are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>evils of Nature;</hi> and what are those,
the World calls <hi>evils of Opinion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will likewise be of great service to
learn how to regulate and put them in
order; to the end that we may not only
avoid running the risk of taking <hi>Evils</hi> for
what they are not; but also that we may
be exempt from the danger of apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44397:179"/>
them for greater than they are.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Evils of Nature</hi> are those which,
without our thinking of them, excite in us
the sentiment of <hi>Pain;</hi> The <hi>Evils of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion</hi>
are those which excite it only,
when we think upon them.</p>
            <p>We may also say, That the <hi>evils of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
are those, which not only make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
felt without our thinking of them;
but which make us even think of them,
because we feel them: And that the <hi>evils
of Opinion,</hi> are those which we don't feel,
but when we think of them, and because
we think of them.</p>
            <p>Upon this Rule, it will be judged that
<hi>Hunger</hi> and <hi>Thirst</hi> are <hi>evils of Nature;</hi> and
that the <hi>death</hi> of a <hi>Father</hi> or a <hi>Husband,</hi>
are <hi>evils of Opinion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may derive from thence four con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences,
which will serve you to assign
a difference and order amongst all <hi>evils;</hi>
to judge rightly of their greatness, and in
a word, to regulate your sense of them.</p>
            <p>The first is, That the <hi>evils of Nature,</hi>
are but the <hi>evils of the Body;</hi> and that the
<hi>evils of Opinion,</hi> are no more than the
<hi>evils of the Mind:</hi> For they are only the
<hi>evils of the Body,</hi> that depend not upon
our <hi>Thoughts;</hi> and <hi>evils of the Mind,</hi> that
depend thereon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:44397:180"/>
The second is, That the <hi>evils of Nature</hi>
are in some sort the <hi>Masters of our Mind,</hi>
since they compell it to be present at all
their actions, and fall upon us, as it were,
with full right; but that our <hi>Mind is
Master of the evils of Opinion,</hi> since to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
our selves from them, we need only
remove them from us; and that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
act upon us but by a borrowed Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>The Third, That the more the <hi>evils of
Nature</hi> are <hi>Masters of our Mind,</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
they are; and that the more our <hi>Mind</hi>
can be <hi>Master</hi> of the <hi>evils of Opinion,</hi> the
lighter they are.</p>
            <p>The Fourth, That the <hi>evils of Nature</hi>
are sometimes so small, that they cannot
Rule over our Mind, and then they are
but as <hi>evils of Opinion;</hi> but that the <hi>evils
of Opinion</hi> are sometimes so great, that our
Mind cannot be absolutely Master of them;
and then they hold the place of <hi>evils of
Nature:</hi> For which Reason 'tis said to be
natural to bemoan ones Father; and when
any one is too much possessed with the
thought of a small indisposition, he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
with being sick of Fancy.</p>
            <p>After having thus established an Order
between <hi>the evils of Nature,</hi> Is it not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44397:180"/>
possible to establish one between the
<hi>evils of Opinion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But who can regulate what proceeds
from so disorderly a Cause? Is it not too
adventurous a design to prescribe limits
to the Caprices of Men; and to endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to make out how far our Grief should
extend, when it goes beyond the <hi>evils of
Nature?</hi> No, undoubtedly: And since
our Mind can be Master only of the <hi>evils
of Opinion,</hi> 'tis against them alone that it
is not amiss to afford Instructions.</p>
            <p>How is it, <hi>Madam,</hi> that one comforts
the Afflicted? Don't we diminish the
idea of their misfortunes in order to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish
their Grief? Can that be done in
the <hi>evils of Nature?</hi> Can one deceive the
sense of a Man <hi>Tormented with the Cholick?</hi>
Is it possible to make him believe that his
Gripings are but illusions? Can one even
propose to render him attentive to such a
Discourse? And if he could be capable of
hearkning, what effects would remonstran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
have, except it were to add <hi>anger</hi> to
<hi>pain,</hi> and joyn a <hi>great passion</hi> to a <hi>great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The best method we can take in the
<hi>evils of Nature,</hi> is to cry out upon the
greatness of the <hi>Distemper,</hi> and the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44397:181"/>
of the indisposed; and 'tis exactly
the contrary of what's done in the <hi>evils of
opinion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, there are some <hi>conmforters</hi> in
the World who begin by the <hi>aggravation</hi>
of <hi>evils;</hi> but that's only to obtain a free
<hi>admittance</hi> in the mind of the <hi>afflicted,</hi>
and to surprise their belief.</p>
            <p>Thus we may <hi>artificially</hi> oppose the
<hi>Grief of feeble Minds:</hi> But we openly
and sincerely oppose that of Stronger
ones. We consider what is the <hi>source,</hi> the
<hi>principle</hi> of their <hi>affliction,</hi> and attack it
immediately.</p>
            <p>But which way soever we proceed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the strong, or with the weak,
either we don't <hi>comfort</hi> at all, or else we
<hi>effect</hi> it by lessening the idea of the <hi>evils,</hi>
and this is no where possible but in the
<hi>evils of Opinion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that 'tis no rashness to endeavour to
establish some Order amongst <hi>evils;</hi> and
to give certain Precepts how to combat
them.</p>
            <p>The Order of the <hi>evils</hi> of <hi>Opinion</hi> is
not harder to find than the <hi>Order of the
evils of Nature.</hi> For, if the greatest <hi>evils
of Nature</hi> are those which expose us most
to <hi>pain,</hi> the greatest <hi>evils of Opinion</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:44397:181"/>
should be those which expose us most to
the <hi>evils of Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I see but two kinds of the <hi>evils of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi>
that expose us to the <hi>evils of Nature.</hi>
One is the loss of Persons that are dear
to us: The other is the loss of Estates.</p>
            <p>I understand by these words of <hi>dear
Persons,</hi> both those whom we Cherish,
and those that Cherish us. For the loss
of those whom we Cherish, and who
don't Cherish us, is not an evil of much
consequence; and therefore no great
strength of Reasoning is necessary to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
us upon this Article.</p>
            <p>In the first of these losses we compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the Death of <hi>Relations,</hi> of <hi>Lovers,</hi>
and of <hi>Friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the second we comprehend the loss
of <hi>Law-Suits, Storms, Barrenness, Fires,
Pillages,</hi> and all things that bring a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution
to our fortune.</p>
            <p>The last of these <hi>evils</hi> exposes us to
<hi>Poverty,</hi> but the first exposes us to all the
<hi>evils of Nature.</hi> Wherefore we may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it the first rank amongst the <hi>evils of
Opinion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we happen to be sick, by whom
are we relieved but by Persons that are
dear to us? What are the cares of our
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44397:182"/>
               <hi>Physitians,</hi> and our <hi>Chirurgions?</hi> These
Mercenary Cares are seldom confined to
above a quarter of an hours useless pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
or hazardous Operation; blind
Advice, or frivolous Conference.</p>
            <p>Of what consideration, of what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
can these Cares be, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Charitable Offices, the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Assiduities, and the kind Disquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of our Friends and our Relations?
How often are we delivered by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable
Zeal from that quickness of
of Pain, wherein the insensibility or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
of <hi>Physitians</hi> often leaves us?</p>
            <p>If we become <hi>Slaves,</hi> by whom are we
redeemed, but by persons that are dear to
us? Do ordinary Friends contributed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
our Ransom? Do they undertake
great journeys for our Deliverance?</p>
            <p>If we are reduced to Poverty, who
shares his Fortune with us, but those dear
persons? The rest either abandon us to
our Misery, or assist us but sorrily, or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
serve us out of Vanity; and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
kindness they do us, it always costs
us both some repugnance to demand it,
and shame to receive it.</p>
            <p>A true Friend, a passionate Lover,
prevents our necessities. They will not
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44397:182"/>
suffer us to perceive that we are Misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
They employ all their Addresses to
avert our Misfortune, all their force to
oppose it, all their Power to Alleviate
it, and all their Discretion to conceal
it.</p>
            <p>What have we then that defends us
better from the <hi>evils of Nature,</hi> than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that are dear to us: And consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what have we that can pass for a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
evil, in the <hi>Order of Evils of Opinion,</hi>
than the Death of those Persons?</p>
            <p>But as indisposition of Body, altho it
is the first <hi>evil of Nature,</hi> is no great <hi>evil,</hi>
if it doth not expose us much to <hi>pain;</hi> the
Death of Persons dear to us, altho it is
the <hi>first evil of Opinion,</hi> is no great evil,
if it doth not expose us much to the
<hi>evils of Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us examine then at present what
consequences the <hi>Death</hi> of your Friend
draws after it: Whether it abandons you
to an indisposition of Body: Whether
it gives you over to Servitude: Whether
it reduces you to Poverty. And I believe
we shall soon discover that it draws down
upon you none of the <hi>evils of Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How should it abandon you to an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition
of Body?</hi> Your Friend was Old,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44397:183"/>
and you are Young. He could not have
dispensed with your cares, tho you could
have been without his assistance.
He reached the end of his Race, before
you arrived to the middle of yours; and
the time of his <hi>Death</hi> had much got the
start of your <hi>Infirmities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, if it was not impossible for
you to have an <hi>infirm Youth.</hi> But all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
evils are not formidable. Human
Prudence doth not look upon Objects
that are too wandring and too remote.
We should not fear <hi>evils</hi> that threaten not,
and we should not much fear even those
that threaten at a distance.</p>
            <p>How should it give you over to <hi>Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude?</hi>
Thanks to our <hi>Religion,</hi> our <hi>Laws,</hi>
and our <hi>Manners,</hi> we are free; and if we
except those whom the <hi>Service of God</hi> and
the <hi>State</hi> engage to cross the Seas, there
are scarce any but <hi>Vagabonds</hi> that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>Slaves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tho by the <hi>Revolution of Human
Affairs, Servitude</hi> should come and seek
after you from one end of the World to
the other, or should meet with you upon
its own Lands, would you not enjoy <hi>Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory
means</hi> enough in all your great Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities?
Would you not easily attract the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44397:183"/>
veneration of your Masters? And would
not your Masters employ all their Power
to hinder you from depriving them of
your presence?</p>
            <p>Yes, <hi>Madam,</hi> you might always ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your condition supportable to your
self. But in case it should appear uneasy
to you your Friend would never be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of changing it. Your Ransom would
exceed his Power. Your <hi>Merit</hi> would
obstruct your <hi>Liberty;</hi> and if they should
exact your <hi>real value,</hi> it would be impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for you to find <hi>Redeemers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, how should it reduce you to
poverty? Your <hi>Friend</hi> was not rich; and
it is hard that you should be poor. One
cannot be so with the <hi>Graces,</hi> the <hi>Vertues,</hi>
the <hi>Sciences,</hi> and <hi>Arts</hi> which you possess;
and the world is not yet become so insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of <hi>merit,</hi> as to give you leave fo fear
extremities which would dishonour your
Age.</p>
            <p>Don't apprehend then, <hi>Madam,</hi> any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
<hi>consequences</hi> from the <hi>Death</hi> of
<hi>your Friend.</hi> Nothing will be wanting to
you in life, not even such <hi>Friends</hi> as he,
you have lately lost. There will arise some
from the <hi>dust</hi> of him you lament; and there
is no Man of equal honour and wit with
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44397:184"/>
him, but will love you as he did, and like
him, will be devoted to your <hi>service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you are in pain perhaps whether
there are still such <hi>perfect friends</hi> to be
found. Make no question of it, <hi>Madam.
Vertue</hi> loses nothing, no more than <hi>Nature.</hi>
The <hi>seeds</hi> of goodness circulate eternally,
and pass without intermission from one
<hi>subject</hi> to another, and the principles
which contribute to the production of the
<hi>wise,</hi> no more annihilate than those, which
concur to the <hi>generation of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your <hi>Friend</hi> has made room for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
number of others to succeed him;
and 'tis only your <hi>province</hi> to elect him a
<hi>successour</hi> in the most <hi>numerous Court,</hi> that
ever <hi>Sacrificed</hi> to the <hi>Graces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You will find, that <hi>Heaven</hi> will restore
you full as much, as it has' taken from you.
How do you know but it will give you
even more? You will discover in him, you
shall make choice off, all that was in him
you have lost, and perhaps something more:
possibly more youth, and a better meen:
possibly a <hi>vertue</hi> less severe, and a
<hi>friendship</hi> more agreeable. Let the things
we lose be of never so great, yet we must
not abandon our selves to <hi>immoderate grief,</hi>
when we only <hi>lose</hi> what we are able to
recover.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:44397:184"/>
You need only <hi>defend your self</hi> from this
<hi>popular mistake;</hi> which makes us appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
in <hi>second friendships,</hi> either the <hi>jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy
of the dead,</hi> or the <hi>censure of the living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>dead are offended</hi> at nothing, and
the <hi>living are affronted</hi> at all things. But
the <hi>living are of</hi> a very <hi>scurvy humour,</hi>
when they <hi>oblige</hi> us to <hi>sacrifice</hi> our selves
<hi>to the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the <hi>dead loved Sacrifices,</hi> they would
take the pains <hi>to demand them of us.</hi> They
must needs have lost the tast of the things
<hi>of this World,</hi> since they entertain no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
with us. And if they are so <hi>unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of us,</hi> why should we be reduced <hi>to
live only for them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Assure your self, <hi>Madam,</hi> that their
<hi>state</hi> is a <hi>state of Insensibility,</hi> or a <hi>state of
Repose;</hi> and that we can <hi>do nothing</hi> to
make them either <hi>happy or miserable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is it, <hi>in your oppinion,</hi> that has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
to us the <hi>duty of preserving fidelity
to the Dead,</hi> but the <hi>weakness</hi> and <hi>tyranny
of the Living?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every one would flatter himself with
the thought <hi>of fixing another to himself,</hi>
when he is no longer fixed to any one.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Vanity</hi> is so great, that it exacts <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
for our Ashes,</hi> and endeavours to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44397:185"/>
make <hi>our shadows triumph over our Rivals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not just, <hi>Madam,</hi> to have regard
to this <hi>fancy.</hi> At the moment we are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
the world is quit of all <hi>obligations</hi>
in relation to us.</p>
            <p>The duties of <hi>interment</hi> are called the
last duties; and beyond the <hi>Funeral,</hi> all
that is given to the <hi>Dead,</hi> is taken from
the <hi>Living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lamentations, that are too long, not
only hurt <hi>Nature,</hi> but <hi>Society</hi> likewise.
They render us incapable of the <hi>duties of a
civi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Life:</hi> And one may say that out of
complaisance to those Friends we have lost,
they make us wanting to those whom we
still retain:</p>
            <p>Observe all those people that indulge
their <hi>sorrow,</hi> and seek to get <hi>reputation</hi> by
their <hi>Grief.</hi> Is it not certain that their
<hi>affliction</hi> seems to suspend their <hi>Friendship,</hi>
or at least that it dispenses them <hi>from act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in favour of the Friends.</hi> Nay, one may
say that 'tis an Incivility <hi>to offer a petition to
them, and request a service of them:</hi> So much
doth <hi>Grief</hi> devote them to the <hi>Dead,</hi> and
render them unuseful to the <hi>Living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what, must there be <hi>no lamenting for
the death of our friends?</hi> No, <hi>Madam,</hi> there
must be none, if it were possible. This pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44397:185"/>
is absolutely pernicious; and if it
were good in any respect, it would only
be in demonstrating <hi>that we knew how to
Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if tears were certain marks of <hi>love,</hi>
the greatest weepers would be the firmest
Lovers; and we are sensible of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Weak Women cry more than those
of stronger courages; and the latter love
more than the former.</p>
            <p>I am not surprised to find. Tears were
in so great <hi>reputation</hi> with the <hi>Poets,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
by the <hi>Philosophers: Poetry</hi> borrows
its fineness from the <hi>Passions,</hi> and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity
of <hi>Nature:</hi> And <hi>Philosophy</hi> derives
what it has <hi>Noble</hi> from the <hi>Virtues</hi> and
<hi>force of the Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Poet</hi> represents to us a <hi>Niobe,</hi> who
melts into <hi>Tears</hi> for the <hi>Death</hi> of her <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:</hi>
A <hi>Philosopher</hi> represents to us a
<hi>Cornelia,</hi> who beholds with <hi>dry Eyes</hi> the
<hi>Death</hi> of all <hi>her Family:</hi> The one is very
tender, the other is very couragious: both
are very Mothers. Whose part do you
take? Without doubt you have an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for <hi>Cornelia,</hi> and compassion for
<hi>Niobe.</hi> You pity <hi>Niobe,</hi> and you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<hi>Cornelia.</hi> You have reason, <hi>Madam.
Niobe</hi> submits to <hi>Grief: Grief</hi> submits to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44397:186"/>
               <hi>Cornelia.</hi> We should pity those, whom
Grief overcomes: But commend those,
who overcome Grief.</p>
            <p>But if it is not possible for us to <hi>live
without Grief,</hi> is it possible for us to have
as much of it, and as long as we please?
You put a great question to me, <hi>Madam,</hi>
But to excuse my self from returning such
an Answer as it deserves, I must tell you,
that if we are not able to get rid of our
Grief, when we please; we may however
chuse whether we will retain it: It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves
of it self, when we let it loose.</p>
            <p>I can tell you more than this, <hi>Madam,</hi>
we have the power of removing our selves
from it, since we can transport our
thoughts from impertinent Objects, to
those that are agreeable; and all our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
depend upon the Application of
our Thoughts.</p>
            <p>But in fine, is it decent to think no more
<hi>of our friends,</hi> when they are interred? I
could tell you, 'tis wholly indifferent to
think, or not to think <hi>of them:</hi> However,
not to <hi>sirike too severely</hi> against the senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all the <hi>World,</hi> I will affirm to you,
<hi>That at least it is not decent to maintain
and feed our Weakness by our Thoughts.</hi>

               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:44397:186"/>
We decently remember the <hi>Dead,</hi> when

and whatever is not <hi>Wise,</hi> is not <hi>Decent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Till such time then as one is accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>reflect</hi> with easiness <hi>upon the Death of
his Friends, it is good to avert his mind from
it,</hi> and to amuse it else where. Wherefore
'tis no consequence, that because there
is a <hi>Decency in Loving,</hi> there is also in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
what one has Loved;</hi> since <hi>friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
is a vertue that cannot be but <hi>Decent,</hi>
whereas <hi>Grief</hi> is a passion, that at most can
be but excusable.</p>
            <p>Why then, say you, are we told that
it is <hi>becoming to be Afflicted;</hi> and why did
the <hi>Romans</hi> appoint a time <hi>for Women to
Mourn?</hi> Hearken to one of your <hi>good
Friends of Antiquity.</hi> Our <hi>Ancestors,</hi> says
he, have given <hi>Women a year to Mourn in;</hi>
not that they should <hi>Mourn all this time,</hi>
but that they should <hi>Mourn no longer.</hi> He
adds, that they prescribed no time for
<hi>Men to mourn,</hi> because they can never
<hi>mourn with decency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you see the <hi>Wise men</hi> and <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers
of Antiquity</hi> have not set <hi>too great a
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44397:187"/>
value upon Tears:</hi> That they have in some
sort <hi>prohibited them to men;</hi> and that they
only <hi>permitted them to Women</hi> through a
sort of <hi>precaution</hi> against their <hi>Obstinacy,</hi>
and through a kind of <hi>indulgence</hi> to their
<hi>weakness.</hi> I leave it to your consideration
whether this difference makes for the <hi>hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of Women,</hi> and whether a resolute <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
ought to make use of such a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</p>
            <p>A Lady that has a true strength of Soul
afflicts her self like a discreet Man: She
lets fighs escape from her, rather than sends
them forth: She suffers her Tears to slide
away, rather than pours them down: She
gives something to Nature, without
taking any thing from Reason. In a
word, she employs the first days after the
loss of her Friends, so as to make it appear
she is a <hi>Woman:</hi> but she employs all the
rest of her life, so as to make it appear she
above these weaknesses.</p>
            <p>Bohold, <hi>Madam,</hi> how a Lady of your
condition ought to be afflicted. It is not
possible but you must be concerned for the
Death of your Friend: but then 'tis possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for you not to resent it too long.</p>
            <p>You ought to consider, that you will do
no kindness either to your self, or to him,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44397:187"/>
if you consume all your days in lamenting
his loss; He is depriv'd of his sensibility,
and no longer has a sense of yours.</p>
            <p>In spite of all <hi>Romantick expressions,</hi>
and all <hi>Poetical Fictions,</hi> there is no <hi>Loving
after death;</hi> and we don't <hi>preserve Fire
under Ashes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>M</hi> … is no more, or at least
is no more your Friend. What Service
then do you propose to your self by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severing
in a Grief, which he is not obliged
to you for? What advantage will you gain
by losing your best days, for which he
will make you no compensation?</p>
            <p>Would you follow the example of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Women, who being unable to advance
themselves by <hi>eminent Virtues,</hi> would signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
themselves by <hi>vehement Passions?</hi> Leave
them to contrive <hi>Snares</hi> for their <hi>Lovers:</hi>
Leave them to <hi>bemoan the dead,</hi> in order to
<hi>Mollify the living:</hi> Leave them to insinuate
their <hi>Friendship</hi> into those, whom they
first convince of their <hi>Grief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An amiable Person, like you, is above
their Artifices; She doth not <hi>weep</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Love;</hi> She will not owe to the <hi>repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of her tenderness,</hi> what she can o're<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by the <hi>force of her merit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:44397:188"/>
It is then of no service to you, <hi>Madam,</hi>
to be <hi>afflicted,</hi> but it is not easie to be not
so; <hi>Grief</hi> is entred into you with a strong
hand; <hi>Acknowledgment</hi> and <hi>Friendship</hi> have
introduced it into your Heart; you have
not been able to dispense with your self
from admitting it there.</p>
            <p>Well! Act your part, give up to <hi>Grief</hi> all
<hi>the Tribute</hi> that <hi>acknowledgment</hi> and <hi>friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
require you to give: But act so, that
<hi>Reason</hi> may regulate what <hi>Acknowledgment</hi>
and <hi>Friendship</hi> ought to require.</p>
            <p>Take care, <hi>Madam:</hi> they are often indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>screet;
and they will be so, if they suffer
<hi>Grief</hi> to reside too long in your Soul: 'Tis
enough they have had the credit of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
it, they should leave you that of
driving it out; They have shewn you hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
their power; do you shew yours
in your turn.</p>
            <p>It is near a Month since your Friend died,
and it is near a Month since you have been
dying. What would <hi>Acknowledgment</hi> and
<hi>Friendship</hi> demand of you? Would they
encourage you to follow him? Reason will
not.</p>
            <p>Don't you observe, that Heaven has not
design'd to unite your destinies? It is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
shown by the interval, which it
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44397:188"/>
has put between your births. It gave you a
a Friend, already advanced in years, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
you how to live, and not to engage
you to die; and it was pleased to let you
enjoy his conversation for some time, that
we might enjoy your Wisdom long.</p>
            <p>Dispose your self then to follow the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
of Heaven; Put your self in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to improve the instructions you have
received: Honour your Friend by your
constancy, after having paid homage to
him with your Grief.</p>
            <p>Imagine that you are to bemoan him in
his presence, and don't force him to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own
your Tears; hitherto they have been
becoming, but presently they will not be
so. Your Grief appears somewhat long.
The Earth, which covers the Ashes of your
Friend, is almost stiff.</p>
            <p>Think upon recalling your firmness;
Reason and Decency do now oppose your
Grief: Your Friend opposes it himself;
and if you make use of his Precepts, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
you shall be only free to extol his
<hi>Merit,</hi> to consider his <hi>Relations,</hi> to cherish
his <hi>Friends,</hi> and to respect his <hi>Memory.</hi>

               <p>IF the Idea which all Men have naturally
of the <hi>True Beauty of Works of the Mind,</hi>
were not effac'd by the great Number of
<hi>false Iudgments,</hi> there would not be so m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny
<hi>various Opinions</hi> about their <hi>Merit.</hi> For
this Idea would be a certain Rule which
every one would be obliged to follow;
unless one would expose himself to the
Universal Censure of Readers, who would
easily discover when they were out of the
way.</p>
               <p>I will not here take notice of the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
that have created in the greatest part of
our Writers, the common custom of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
so many wrongful Opinions. Some
of them are general, which have so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguisht
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44397:189"/>
the light of the Soul upon all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
which are not exposed to our Senses,
that there are Infinite Errors in all Sciences,
and even reach to the distinguishing of
<hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are some other particular Causes
which are apt tohinder, of themselves, the
knowing the <hi>true or false Beauty of the
Works of the Mind,</hi> when <hi>Reason</hi> would
be otherwise Just, Exact and Clear.</p>
               <p>That which is must common is <hi>Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:</hi>
For every one flatters himself that
he is capable to judge, either through Pride,
not to be thought Ignorant; or through Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and Hate, according as one is
engaged in any Party; or through Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
neither judging for or against, but only
as one has heard the World talk; or in fine,
through Caprice, Chance, Elevatition and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
of Humour, as happens oftentimes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Quality, who pretend that their
Rank gives 'em all the necessary illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to know the <hi>Price</hi> and <hi>worth</hi> of the
<hi>Gifts of the Mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whatever these Causes are, General
or Particular, the <hi>variety of Opinions</hi> is too
evident, to doubt the certainty of this truth,
<hi>viz,</hi> that we don't judge upon the same I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,
or by the same Rule, tho' it be not
certain there is one.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:44397:190"/>
'Tis to form it in the Mind, that Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
and Poetry, and the Art of writing Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
has been employ'd: But the more rules
are invented, the more they seem to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.
And 'tis a wonder that the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
Masters of the World, as <hi>Aristotle, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,
Horace, Quintilian,</hi> &amp;c. should have so
few perfect Followers.</p>
               <p>It seems then, that we ought to forsake
the way of Precepts, and search elsewhere
for sure and immutable Guides, either to
<hi>Write Well,</hi> or to <hi>Iudge well of the Merit of
Authors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To give ones self a just and exact Idea,
I think it would be necessary chiefly to
examine any Book, with some other which
has acquired an Universal Approbation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Malherbe</hi> in the late Reign, excelled in
the beauty of his <hi>Odes,</hi> and they have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to this day the same Charms to
their Intelligent and Judicious Readers.
Wherefore when you read any <hi>Ode</hi> to the
Glory of this King, compare the Stile with
that of <hi>Malherbe,</hi> and according as you find
'em agree, so you may venture to decide.</p>
               <p>But then the Piece you compare it to
must be of establish'd reputation, and which
you must be sure is like to continue such; we
have seen several Authors who have had very
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:44397:190"/>
great Applause, but it only continued for
a very few years: during which the <hi>buzzing
of the Readers,</hi> and the <hi>suffrage of their
Friends,</hi> gave 'em their <hi>short-liv'd worth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are but very few true Modells:
<hi>Voiture</hi> himself is none, and much less <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zac.</hi>
The pretty Conceits of <hi>Voiture,</hi> and
the Flights of <hi>Balzac,</hi> have both an <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation</hi>
which naturally displeases; The
one endeavours to be agreeable, and make
us laugh in whatever humour we are; The
other would be admir'd and esteem'd by
the number of his Words, and the excess
of Amplifications. The two Letters writ to
<note n="*" place="margin">By Monsieur <hi>Boileau,</hi> where they are to be found at the end of his Satyrs.</note>Monsieur <hi>de Vivonne,</hi> imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
both their manners of
Writing are an excellent Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr
on their Stile, and easily
discover the ridiculousness
of these two Authors, who were not long
since so famous.</p>
               <p>It were easie to foretell that such will be
the Fate of a certain Author, who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
his Works upon the Memoirs of the
Streets, and Female Fooleries; who believes
that all the beauty of a Book, when the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is the Life of a <hi>Saint,</hi> consists in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in some new term, or smart expression;
and is very well satisfied with himself, when
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44397:191"/>
the Period, which has neither <hi>depth</hi> nor
<hi>solidity,</hi> rowls agreeably to the Point.</p>
               <p>But not to make any further offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Predictions, we know that <hi>Seneca</hi> writ
no otherwise, than scattering through all
his Works, Points, Antithesis's and Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes.
He surprized his Times with the
Arrogance of his Decisions; and there are
some yet alive who hold him for a Model
of Eloquence: But they must write very
ill that imitate him, and they may be assur'd
to tire those Readers that have any taste or
relish.</p>
               <p>'Tis not with these extraordinary flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
that Nature explains her self: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
requires a continual attention displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
because the greatest part of Men are
not capable of it. There is a force and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in all Writers whatever. This Fantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
mixture makes us naturally conclude
those Works to be disagreeable, where we
must have too intense a thought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive 'em;
or at least are so much below
one, that they deserve not the least regard.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless there are but few good
Writings, where the Author excell'd
so far as to stand for a Model. We
have <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> for Heroick
Poetry. <hi>Horace</hi> is a perfect Original of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44397:191"/>
Satyrs, Epistles, and Familiar Discourses.
I dont say the same thing of his <hi>Odes,</hi> and I
would explain my self farther, if the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of some of 'em did not oblige
me to a respectful silence of
the rest. If the<note n="*" place="margin">I suppose he means Monsieur <hi>Dacier.</hi>
                  </note> Author of
the long Comments upon
him disapproves my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I will add, what may perhaps appease
him: That those of <hi>Anacreon</hi> are more live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
more sweet, more engaging; and by
consequence more perfect.</p>
               <p>Let's return to the Authors of our own
Language: <hi>Corneille</hi> and <hi>Racine</hi> are admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in Tragedies; nevertheless it were to
be wisht, that the cleanness of Expression in
<hi>Corneille</hi> suited with the variety, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
fertility of his Thoughts. Few Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
can arrive to represent so many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Characters; To invent so many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues;
To make so many Persons Reason
with so much <hi>connexion</hi> and <hi>solidity.</hi> We
assist at the very Action, whilst he does but
represent it, and pass immediatly from
the figure to the reality.</p>
               <p>'Tis <hi>Augustus</hi> that we hear speak in <hi>Cinna.</hi>
'Tis the <hi>Cid</hi> that we see in his first work,
who Cause so much talk in the Court and
the City, and was as it were the signal of the
course, where he carryed away the Prize.
Not but that the copiousness of his Subject,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:44397:192"/>
                  <hi>the whole exttent whereof he penetrates his vast ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,</hi>
and his Inexhaustible Genius, <hi>sometimes</hi>
has left in his Expressions too much confusion,
as if it were impossible to be profound and
solid, and yet clear enough at the same time
to be understood. But these Faults hinder not,
but Authors of this Reputation may pass for
excellent Models. If I were obligd to speak
precisely, which of the two I would choose
for a Model, when I were to write for the
Theatre; I would answer, <hi>That it were more
difficult to follow the former, and that 't would be
more sure to imitate the latter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So much shall suffice upon this Subject;
and I do not think it necessary to tarry any
longer upon the first Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>At present I will make bold to add;</hi> That
instead of asking your self, Would <hi>Virgil</hi> have
writ after this manner? Did <hi>Malherb</hi> sing his
excellent Odes in such a tone? Or, if you please, Is
it thus that <hi>Corneille,</hi> or <hi>Moliere</hi> drew to their
Theatres, both the Court and the whole Kingdom?
Ask you your self, Is there any Method more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd,
than that of this Work? Is there any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
less ingenious? The Expressions, could they
ever be more imperfect? Is there any Imitation
more low and servile than that of this Book?</p>
               <p>This is a fault very common, and it oftentimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
that one becomes a very bad Copier of a very
good Original. We ought also to take a great deal of
care not to fall into the Whimsical design of that Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
who being to draw an extravagant Picture of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena,</hi>
which he design'd to represent perfectly beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
advis'd with himself to give her all the Graces
that he had heard commended in the fairest persons. In
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44397:192"/>
effect changing her Lips into Coral, her Cheeks into
Roses, and her Eyes into Suns, and unskilfully join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'em
together, he made a Figure like to that which
<hi>Horace</hi> describes in his Epistle to the <hi>Piso's.</hi> 'Tis
certain he had a mind to laugh. But Authors are
serious people, they are careful <hi>of their Reputation,</hi>
and copy with gravity.</p>
               <p>But in short, whatever good a opinion an
Author may have of himself, <hi>'Tis an easy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to mortify his self-pride,</hi> which these people can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
forbear shewing to their Friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by defying
them to write worse upon the same Subject. In
such a case we ought to show our sincerity in
the utmost degree, and to explain our selves
with the greatest freedom, against the ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Opinionatrate of those Scriblers, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
read, but to court your applause, and not
your Critiscism, how reasonable and just soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it may be.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, we ought to take care that we
don't mistake implicity as where it is admirable
for downright meanness. 'Tis the perfection of
every Work, and if I dare say so, the embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishment
of Beauty it self. <hi>Horace</hi> has given us
this advice, when he would have the manner
of explaining our selves appear so natural, that
thereupon an ordinary Reader might judge it
would be very easy to speak the same things,
tho is nothing but a reflection upon all that
is fine and delicate, discovers the difficulty
to express our selves with the same good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p>Truth has nothing changeable in it. Falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
imitates Truth in all sorts of ways: We al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
find out the last, if we have recourse to the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:44397:193"/>
first, but are often cheated if we are not very
diligent to discover the Imposture. When we
follow Reason with steadiness, and arrive at
thinking aptly, and expressing truly our
thoughts, 'tis impossible that the Reader should
not be mov'd, because there is in all men a
natural propensity to Truth So that what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
false, cannot please any longer than we are
dazled with the appearance of Truth, under
which only it shews it self.</p>
               <p>Upon this score, if the Expression be mean,
it will present without trouble, a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the like to your mind: But if it be sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
do what you will, it will please you, and
you will think it the finest thing you ever saw,
If your Wit is not much superior to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's,
and your Experience in the Art of Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much more advanc'd than his. For this sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
has different degrees of perfection as all
other Objects have, that present themselves to
us. But it we have a mind to profit by the two
Rules we have already propos'd, we must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
have some knowledge of the defects that
are to be found in the most perfect Authors:
For it is not my design here to instruct ordinary
persons, but make some Remarks for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of the Curious.</p>
               <p>The first is, That one ought not to make use of
Metaphors too often, nor too longe: We are
very much wean'd from it in <hi>this age;</hi> and since the
<hi>world</hi> has taken a new measure of the taste of true
Eloquence, all this pompous heap of glittering
falsities has disappear'd. The Learned men of
the last Age, who were fill'd with it by reading
some of the Antients, be liev'd their Stile was
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:44397:193"/>
adorn'd and set out by Metaphors; there was
then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as strange a caprice in Eloquence, as in
their other Opinions.</p>
               <p>At the vanishing of that profound Darkness,
wherein the foregoing Ages were as it were
lull'd asleep, we wak'd suddenly, and then knew
not distinctly enough which was the better side.</p>
               <p>The use of Figurative and Metaphorical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
was first abolish'd from that minute,
when we begun to discern more clearly what
we ought to say.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Genius, which is lively, natural,
and sincere, cannot endure these Languishing,
Artificial and Embarras'd Discourses. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,
we have some Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors
still left; and it does not
displease us to see<note n="*" place="margin">That is, where Metaphors are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and the Ideas obvious; they may be safely employ'd in our Author's Opinion.</note> Flames in
Anger and Love; but these
Expressions are become pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and literal, and can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
no body.</p>
               <p>The second Remark is; That 'tis an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable
fault to pass from one Metaphor, by
which we have begun, to a new one, and so to
<hi>connect Images</hi> which have no <hi>agreement</hi> amongst
themselves. When a man is careful to write
well, he knows how to continue, and support
the same Idea; <hi>I pitty him,</hi> says the Author
of the Characters, <hi>I give him for lost, he is cast
away. It is not thus that we ought to make use of
the Wind, to arrive at the delightsome Port of Fortune.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You see he takes care to mix nothing that is
foreign with the first Image he gave us to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
what the <hi>Rich</hi> think of the conduct of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy.</hi>
This person is represented as it were
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44397:194"/>
upon the Sea. The Rich Man saw he would
be Ship-wrackt. He saw him out of the road.
He judged that 'twas not so, that he ought to
make use of the Wind, and that he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
arrive at the <hi>Port of Fortune.</hi> There is not
here one term which is not Ally'd with the rest.</p>
               <p>But the Author had committed an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable
Solecism, If after all these expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
taken from <hi>Navigation,</hi> he had hapned to

whereas all being united, the discourse becomes
clear and easy.</p>
               <p>The third remark resembles this, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consists in advising that we ought never to
pass from one person to another in the same
Period. The same we may also say of the
Numbers, and of all that the Grammarians
term <hi>Moods</hi> and <hi>Tenses</hi> of <hi>Verbs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will give an Example of this fault, taken
from an Author who is extraordinarily regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
in his Subject and Stile. <hi>All that is here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi>
says this excellent Writer, <hi>has no long dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
He should have stopt here, but he was
resolved to carry on his Period. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he adds, <hi>And this perpetual Motion of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
(you may take notice already that he
passes from a subject indefinite, <hi>all that is here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi>
to one which is determin'd; <hi>And this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Motion of Creatures,</hi> which have no other
apparent connexion but by the Conjunction,
and none at all in the Sence. He continues,
<hi>which succeed one another.</hi> (This adds an Image
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:44397:194"/>
altogether unnecessary, since it was sufficiently
remarkt by the defect of Duration, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Motion) <hi>render as it were a continual Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to the Immutability of God, who alone is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the same.</hi> I say, That these <hi>Tailes</hi> of Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods
render 'em Intricate, Confused, and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous;
and that this is truly the Stile, not of
an Orator, but a Declamer.</p>
               <p>One might have expressed the same thing
after this manner: <hi>All that is here below, has no
duration, and renders as it were a continual homage
to the Immutability of God.</hi> I know there are
some People so extreamly exact that they will
not permit one to joyn an <hi>Affirmative</hi> propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with a <hi>Negative</hi> so close together.</p>
               <p>I say nothing of this Homage that <hi>Motion</hi>
renders to <hi>Immutability.</hi> It is a point which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
nothing to my design.</p>
               <p>But to quit this <hi>Digression;</hi> If Authors of the
most accomplisht exactness fall under these sort
of Faults, what must Vulgar Authors do? these
remarks will appear to them <hi>too severe,</hi> because
they are sensible, it may be, that they are not
in a condition to practise 'em.</p>
               <p>All that I can do at present in their Favour,
is to propose no more of 'em. Our general dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
is about <hi>Observations</hi> upon our <hi>Tongue.</hi> And
we go no farther than barely to examine, If a
term be well us'd, and how long it has been in
Vogue. Tell me, I beseech you, may not your
Discussion go farther. Can a Work be said to
be perfect, when 'tis only compos'd of <hi>choice
words?</hi> If this is your Opinion, you are easie to
be contented; but there are a great many Men
more difficult, because they are more delicate.</p>

               <p>I Was formerly too indulgent, and perhaps am
now become too nice and severe. In the
heat of Youth, and those first ardours of Passion,
a Man is not acquainted with the discreet cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a Life somewhat more advanced; We
observe with pleasure, that Authors who have
been admired both by the Ancients and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns,
have embraced the same follies, which
our inclinations recommend to us.</p>
               <p>The Licentiousness and Debaucheries of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronius</hi>'s
Stile, have nothing then that shocks our
Nature: It is without any disturbance to our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
that we still represent its irregularities; and
as if there was not obscenity enough in his Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
we regret the loss of what is wanting
with as lively a concern, as if we had lost the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Discourse that could preserve Decency and
Manners amongst Men.</p>
               <p>I bethink my self, too late perhaps, to make
these Reflections; but it usually happens,
when we have arrived at our Journeys end, and
are talking of our Travels, and the Road we
followed, that then and only then we perceive
our going a stray.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:44397:195"/>
This is one sort of going astray, and I don't
know if there be a grosser, than to Address ones
self to all ones Contemporaries, nay, to all
those who shall come after us, without having
any thing but what is highly undecent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemly
to tell them: And this proceeds from Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.
They don't know, at least they don't
consider that there is a secret Pride in the bottom
of the Soul, which obliges us to take exceptions
against too licentious a conversation, as a want
of respect. To this Pride we are obliged, that
those splendid names of Glory, Decency, and
publick Civility are still preserved.</p>
               <p>But tho <hi>Pride</hi> were silent, and somebody had
found out a Mystery to make it hold its peace,
which I confess is a very difficult task, yet <hi>Virtue</hi>
would not be silent; She has not as yet so utterly
abandoned Man-kind, but that they still pay a
great respect and veneration to her. The <hi>Modesty</hi>
of one whole Sex will be always armed for her
defence; and the greatest part of the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Men are only taken up for her sake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pleasure</hi> it self, I speak of lawful and indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>Pleasure,</hi> dishonours whosoever seeks it with
affectation, or who procures it for another.
Thus, I know no Satyr, included in one word,
more stabbing than that of being call'd the <hi>Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller
of</hi> Nero's <hi>Pleasures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since I declare so freely against my self, by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning
the Praises I have given to <hi>Petronius,</hi> no
one will expect that I should spare the Raillery
of <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Oration for <hi>Coelius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I freely own, that he was brought up in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
and knew the World; that he raised him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by his Merit, much above his Birth; that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:44397:196"/>
he was equal in dignity to <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caesar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But certainly he forgot himself, when indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
his natural propensity to Raillery, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,
in full Senate, <hi>Clodia,</hi> for making her
younger Brother lie with her, <hi>Propter nocturnos
quosdam metus.</hi> A Man may easily find out the
equivocation; but I wonder that so great a Man
should tax <hi>Caelius</hi> with so great a Crime only by
way of <hi>Irony,</hi> if he believed it to be true; or
that he should give himself the liberty to accuse
him of it, if he believed it not.</p>
               <p>It were to be wished, that what has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of Orators, were likewise required of all
Authors, and even Poets.</p>
               <q>Virum bonum Oratorem esse oportet.</q>
               <p>We have mightily neglected this Precept in
our Language. Our old <hi>French</hi> Poets were almost
all guilty of writing obscenely. <hi>Desportes</hi> is the
Man that fell into this vein, with the greatest
<hi>affecta<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion</hi> and <hi>impudence</hi> imaginable.</p>
               <p>But since <hi>Voiture,</hi> who had a refined Genius, and
who conversed with the politest Company care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
shun'd this sordid, this ungentleman like
way of Writing; the Theatre it self has no
longer suffered our Authors to write any thing
too licentious. Thus all this liberty is no more
supported even in the most familiar Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and if our Age is not more chast than
the preceding ones; at least it knows how to
manage the outside, and to set it self off with
the appearance of <hi>Virtue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our niceness goes yet further; and we cannot
<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>dure now adays to see the description of any
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44397:196"/>
object that is apt to leave a bad <hi>Idea</hi> behind it.
All that we can suffer a sick Man to do, is to tell
his Distemper: we give some ease to his indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in hearkning to him with some little atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
But this complaisance which we express to
his infirmity, is no excuse for it; especially if he
descends into too long a relation of particulars.</p>
               <p>But, except this occasion, 'tis not possible to
make a description of things, for which we have
naturally an aversion, without offending the
Company; notwithstanding this has been the
defect of many Authors. <hi>Buchanan</hi> has described a
Dream with all the luscious figures of Rhetoric.
St. <hi>Amant</hi> has discovered a World of Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
with all the plainness peculiar to his Stile;
but upon such subjects, both Rhetorick and
plainness are unseasonably lost.</p>
               <p>Let us return to <hi>Cicero.</hi> Now ought this Consul,
when he was declaiming against <hi>Piso,</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Senate, to have made use of terms,
which in so lively a manner represent the most
beastly circumstances of Drunkenness? His di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
is charged with particulars, which
must needs be very nauseous and disagreeable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catullus</hi> also might have given to the Annals
of <hi>Volusius</hi> another term, than that of <hi>Cacata
charta.</hi> This Poet, who pretended to a purity
of Stile, should have abstained from an Epithet
so gross and so licentious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Martial</hi> found out a by-way to commend the
cleanliness of his Mistresses Lap-Dog, yet for
all that he has faln into a very unseasonable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Gutta pallia nec fefellit ulia.</l>
               </q>
               <p>It had been more proper to have said nothing
of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:44397:197"/>
Without doubt these Authors were corrupted by
their bad Morals. There was in their times, how
fine soever we may represent them, so total an
ignorance of what the Laws of true decency re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
from us, that they have not produced one
Author who has observed them with exactness.</p>
               <p>But, in endeavouring to avoid this fault, be
cautious least you fall into another, very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in our days. <hi>Passions</hi> and <hi>Vices</hi> are described
to us in such pretty colours, even in the Pulpit,
that a Man can hardly perceive what deformity
they have in them. There are those persons that
know how to conceal the impieties and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies
of the most pernicious manners, in
order to hide what conformity they maintain to
the weakness and frailty of our Hearts.</p>
               <p>We should be too much startled to know the
<hi>impiety</hi> thereof. No body would draw down upon
himself the vengeance of Heaven. We are too
much humbled in a severe examination of our
<hi>extravagancies</hi> and no one has a mind to be ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
But to be frail, to be subject to infirmities,
this is no more than being born Man; and no one
thinks he ought to be ashamed of his <hi>birth,</hi> or of
his <hi>destiny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I should therefore rather chuse a description
which would faithfully represent things, than
those flattering Pictures which fortify Men in
their false <hi>opinions,</hi> or in their usual <hi>disorders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, don't follow <hi>Iuvenal</hi>'s footsteps, or
assume the liberty to make the grossest repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations
of the greatest irregularities: In vain
doth an Author so abominably licentious and
impudent persuade me to hate the excesses of
<hi>Messalina,</hi> I hate <hi>him</hi> even more than I do <hi>her; and</hi>
the lewdnesses of his wit that are sufficiently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:44397:197"/>
in the boldness of his Stile, scandalize
me infinitely more than those of the most aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
Women, who are blindly transported by
the fury of their <hi>Passions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I love his Translator better than him: He
took great care to preserve the cleanness of his
Stile in such ill Company. He has omitted noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Satyrs of his Author, but what might
hinder the secure reading of them. His fine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
at the <hi>Vices of Rome, his</hi> Fire, his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity,
even to the tone of <hi>Declame,</hi> which was
the true Character of <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> he has preserved
entire. And let it never be said that Satyr divest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of these excesses, is less agreeable; for 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that nothing but the Salt of acute Raillery
makes up the whole entertainment in that sort
of Poetry; and that on the other side, grossness of
<hi>expression</hi> and <hi>thought,</hi> cannot fail to displease those
Gentlemen that have the least delicacy. Which
is easily justified by the example of
Monsieur<note n="*" place="margin">We know him better in <hi>England</hi> under the name of <hi>Boileau.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Despreaux;</hi> For do we
read any of the Ancients with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
satisfaction? And yet can one car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
further, than he has done, <hi>discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>reservedness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Muse always <hi>chast,</hi> always <hi>modest,</hi> knows
how to pursue <hi>Vice,</hi> and to condemn it, as <hi>Virtue</hi> it
self uses to do, by its light, and by its vehemence:
For we should overstretch things, and push them
to the utmost rigour, should we say, he had done
better if he had afforded no room for the <hi>la Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veu</hi>
in his Works. What he says in that respect is
so short, that he deserves to be excused, if it be a
fault; and if not, we must acknowledg that he
has taught us, that a Man may speak sometimes
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44397:198"/>
of such a Person, provided he observes the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraments
of this Author, in one or two words,
and yet never infringe the Rules of Decency.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Lucretius</hi> neglects this conduct at the end
of one of his Books: <hi>A Man must certainly have his
Veins kindled with the flame of Love, a Burning</hi> Aetna
<hi>in the bottom of his Soul;</hi> or, to leave these great
expressions, A Man must be a Madman, as in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
he was, to tire his Reader with a long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
and that in the most extravagant and
nasty circumstances, of the Dreams and Illusions
of a young Man.</p>
               <p>The more I consider of this passage, the less I
discover those Reasons which make People ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
so fond of so violent, so imperious an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor:
When he would act the Serious Man, and
the Reasoner, 'tis then he's utterly lost, and knows
not what he says: witness that verse which I
have often heard so impertinently quoted.</p>
               <q>Primus in orbe Deos fecit timor.</q>
               <p>That is to say, <hi>Fear induced Men to believe, that
there were Gods.</hi> For if one should ask him, <hi>Who
is it that produced this Fear?</hi> Would not he have
been obliged to Answer, <hi>That it is the natural Idea
which Men conceive of a Divinity?</hi> For Fear, and
other Passions, are no otherwise raised in us than
by the Objects which excite them by the means
of the <hi>Imagination</hi> or <hi>Thought.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if I find in my self the <hi>Idea of a Divinity,</hi>
before I find that <hi>fear</hi> which I ought to have for
it, this <hi>fear</hi> then is the <hi>effect,</hi> and not the <hi>cause</hi> of
the <hi>thought</hi> I conceive of it. A man needs but
very little penetration, and extent of mind to
make so obvious a discovery?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:44397:198"/>
If he has a Mind to descend from this State,
which doth not suit with his Talent, Why must
he go throw away fine expressions, to represent
impertinent things, to insist upon them so long,
and not to leave, till he had exhausted it, so ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
a Subject, as that of the <hi>Dreams of an
Age,</hi> which performs nothing, even in the day
time, that deserves our attention?</p>
               <p>If this is <hi>Beauty,</hi> or <hi>Delicacy,</hi> or <hi>Learning,</hi> I
heartily congratulate the grossness of our days,
which certainly would near bear so irregular a
freedom in any Author whatsoever.</p>
               <p>I wish with all my heart I could excuse <hi>Auso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
that illustrious Consul of <hi>Gaul;</hi> but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of this remark carries me in spite of my
self, to speak of him, nay, and to speak ill of him,
What can be finer than his <hi>Thanksgiving to the
Emperor</hi> upon the subject of his <hi>Consulship?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pliny</hi> the 2d, would have envied him this
work. What can be more ingenious, than the
<hi>Punishment of Cupid in the Elisian Fields,</hi> and those
<hi>sufferings</hi> and <hi>reproaches</hi> which the Heroines made
him undergo, who had all of them some cause
to make their complaints of him?</p>
               <p>He must, for the misfortune of his Reputation,
amuse himself in that employment, which of all
things in the World is most unworthy of a
Learned Man: Judge what time he lost in busy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself to pick up sometimes a beginning
of a verse in <hi>Virgil,</hi> sometimes an end; and tack
all these different parts together, in order to
compose a poor wretched <hi>Cento.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What shall I say of those expressions of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi>
which tho they were innocent as they lay in
him, yet as <hi>Ausonius</hi> has managed and sorted them,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:44397:199"/>
they are conscious of all the indecencies that
imagination can possibly form to it self?</p>
               <p>Behold now a strange <hi>description</hi> of this
Man. He that was Author of a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Work, which he Addresses to a great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
who has Wit and Learning, as we may
sufficiently see in many other places of his <hi>Books,</hi>
is notwithstanding the same that prostitutes his
Muse, and composes an infamous Poem
out of several pieces of Poetry very harmless
in themselves.</p>
               <p>To condemn all these insolences, doth not
argue too great a <hi>sowrness of Spirit;</hi> many persons
would be pleased to see even <hi>Virgil</hi> himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for the interview of <hi>Eneas</hi> and <hi>Dido</hi> in
that cave of the 4th of the <hi>Eneids.</hi>

               <q>
                  <l>Speluncam, Dido, Dux &amp; Trojanus, eandew,</l>

               </q>
               <p>Nor would they be less willing to condemn
<hi>Homer</hi> for what passed between <hi>Iuno</hi> and <hi>Iupiter,</hi>
upon the <hi>Mount Olympus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These two great and <hi>illustrious Authors</hi> have
avoided a thousand occasions, wherein any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
person would have lost himself. If <hi>Paris</hi>
and <hi>Helena</hi> converse together in the <hi>Iliad,</hi> 'tis
only to reproach one another. <hi>Calypso, Circe,</hi> the
<hi>Syrens</hi> of the <hi>Odysses,</hi> contain nothing that offends
Modesty. <hi>Vlysses</hi> doth not abuse the Favours of
the Princess <hi>Nausicaa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Man who has a truly great Soul, Elevated
and Noble; a vast genius, and an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
clear and well disposed, will never
stoop and descend to that meanness which I

to me upon this Subject.</p>
            <p>The first step that a Man makes into
the World, generally determines all the
rest, and is the Foundation of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
and best Presage of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
and, from the first Marches that he
makes, those that have had Experience,
will tell you how far he will advance.
'Tis then very necessary to make this first
step with a great deal of caution, and to
signalize ones Entry by something that is
glorious and great.</p>
            <p>There is a great deal of Art in gaining
the publick Esteem, and to make ones Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
appear so to advantage, that the
World shall never disgust, or be glutted
with 'em.</p>
            <p>The means to preserve ones Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is to produce something more and
more excellent, and to provide a fresh
Nutriment for the general Admiration,
which seems always to grow up equal
with our Merit. The great Actions we
do, promise something greater; and the
good ought to be follow'd by better.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:44397:200"/>
A Great man ought not then to suffer
the depth of his Capacity to be sounded,
if he will be always esteem'd by the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar:
He ought, on the contrary, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
himself after such a manner, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to discover all that he knows, and that
no man may have it in his power to assign
Limits to his Learning. For, let a Man
be never so learned the Opinion we
have of him, when we know him but by
halves, goes always farther than the Idea
we conceive of him, when we are wholly
acquainted with him.</p>
            <p>Therefore let him take care not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
his Ability all at once, but make an
absolute use of his Cunning. He should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to manage himself with caution,
that he may be able to disengage himself
from the Inconveniencies he may fall
into; and, to have a hidden Reserve,
where he may command suitable Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours,
to repair his greatest Mistakes, and
to retrieve him from his greatest Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sights.</p>
            <p>As the Success of the most Judicious
Undertakings depends upon the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a multitude of Conjunctures, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of which Chance can only recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile;
an excellent man ought not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44397:200"/>
to commit his Reputation to the risque
of a Conversation, a Dispute, or an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview;
for, if it does not succeed with
him, he never recovers it: And no man
can be sure not to fail in an Essay or
a Tryal; since nothing is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
than to find ones first Projects dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed.
He ought then to expose his
Reputation to the hazard of the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
whatever Advantage he may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
himself from its Success.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, the great Art of all
consists in not discovering all one knows
at once, but to unfold it (if I may speak
so) by degrees, and always to nourish
and excite Curiosity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Magazine</hi> should always answer
the <hi>Occasions;</hi> and the <hi>Piece</hi> should not
belie the <hi>Pattern:</hi> In fine, a <hi>Man</hi> ought
always to keep exactly to what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</p>
            <p>'Tis upon this consideration only, that
great Masters never discover the whole
Mystery of their Art in their Lessons to
their Schollars, and by that means they
remain always the Masters; the Source
of their Instructions never dries away,
and as 'tis not communicated but by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
and measure, they never exhaust
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:44397:201"/>
that Fund of Knowledge, whence they
draw continually both to satisfie the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of others, and to keep up their
own reputation.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more that I would
recommend to an ingenious Man, and
that is, To be seen as seldom as may be;
for as his presence diminishes the Esteem
one has of him, so his absence and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
augments it. Fame every day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases
Objects, and the Imagination goes
much beyond the Sight.</p>
            <p>We ought not then to be lavish of our
selves; we ought to make ourselves expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to be truly welcome. The desire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one has for us, is commonly the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the Esteem they have of us: Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
is better tasted when it has been a
long time expected; and the Pleasure that
costs one something, is much more ardent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sought after, than that which is easie:
so the nicest People find in Hunger a sauce
that all the ragouts could not give to their
Victuals; and 'tis a refining of <hi>Epicurism</hi>
not to satisfie our senses and Appetites but
by halves.</p>
            <p>A Man should never make himself fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
with the Vulgar, least he lose that
Air of Dignity, which a Retreat and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:44397:201"/>
Life bestows on those that shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
but seldom: for presence brings to
light those Defects which absence would
conceal. The most pretious things lose
their worth as soon as they become com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
Those great inclinations we have
for Rarities are chang'd into scorn, when
we find 'em to be had every-where; and
the mind is much more delicate and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to satisfie than the senses, which are
glutted with the most delicious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
Viands, when they are made their
daily food.</p>
            <p>Thus we may see the farther a learned
Man is from us, the more we wish for his
company; the more he absconds the more
we look after him: not that he ought
to render himself inaccessible; nothing
but a mean Genius ought to be difficult to
come at, being conscious that his Merit
would not bear too near a Scrutiny; there
is in this a Medium that consists between
a Haughtiness that despises others, and a
Familiarity which makes ourselves cheap.</p>
            <p>There are many other things might be
said upon this matter, and the more I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to measure the extent of 'em, the
less I discover their bounds. Let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
then step by step: Let us clear, if we
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:44397:202"/>
can, this confusion of <hi>Idaeas,</hi> which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
themselves in crowds to the Mind,
and follow some sort of Order, which may
hinder us from fruitless wandering.</p>
            <p>The first thing, in my opinion, that a
Young Man ought to do, who has a mind
to settle himself with Success in the World
is, to know his Planet, for there is no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
but has one, and 'tis want of being
acquainted with it, that an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of People have not made their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
as they might have done in the
World.</p>
            <p>How many men do we see in Favour,
who have not thought it possible they
should be known by Great men, yet they
have been so by the effect of their Destiny?
And as soon as they have made an entry,
and are setled in their Posts, they need
but ordinary Capacities to maintain 'em.
Therefore we ought to search with care
our predominant Destiny.</p>
            <p>He that fails at the Court, perhaps, may
succeed in the City: And, he that finds
himself the Jest of the Town, may set up
for a Wit, and be admir'd in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
In a word, No man is a Prophet in
his own Country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:44397:202"/>
'Tis necessary then to know how to
transplant onesself. Many Great men
had never been known, if they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
tarried in the place of their Birth.
Some men must stand in a good Light, to
appear in their true lustre.</p>
            <p>We see every day several persons that
would have been the Scandal of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
if they had continued in it, yet forsak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, they have become the Honour of
another.</p>
            <p>Men succeed oftentimes better in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
than in another, altho' they have not
a better <hi>Genius</hi> for that which they have
undertaken, than that which they leave.</p>
            <p>'Tis to nothing but their Fate that we
ought to attribute the Rise or Fall of most
Great persons: Wherefore every one
ought to look into his Lot, to content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with it, and follow it; for, to think
to make ones Fortune by any other means,
is, to have a mind to sail against Wind
and Tide.</p>
            <p>The second thing that is necessary for a
Young Man to do, is to know his good
and ill Qualities; for every thing in the
World is mixt with Good and Evil. There
is no man but has something good in him,
which may become excellent, if it be cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:44397:203"/>
Such a one would have become a Great
man, if he had known his Strength, and
perfected his best Talents. But the most
part force their <hi>Genius,</hi> and lose the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of their Course, because they drive
beyond the Posts that should bound their
Career.</p>
            <p>He ought also to know his predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Defect, for every body has one,
which counterballances in a manner his
excelling good Quality; and if one takes
a Resolution to destroy it, one may infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
succeed. But one ought to take it
in good time, and to labour with a great
deal of Courage and Perseverance; for
'tis not a small matter to destroy a Vice
that is born, and has grown up with us.</p>
            <p>When a Young Man is arriv'd so far,
he ought not to think, that he must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
enter upon upon the World, and
embark in some Employ; he must reflect
upon it a long time first; he must consider
his Abilities, provide himself of Patrons,
and measure the height of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
he pretends to: He ought, if I
may be allow'd the expression, to feel
the Pulse of his Affairs, and to wait a long
time, if it be necessary; for it belongs
only to Wise men never to precipitate,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:44397:203"/>
and be impatient for any thing. He that
never grieves, or puts himself in a Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
shews that he is an absolute Master of
himself; and when once a Man is Master
of himself, he is not long after of others
also.</p>
            <p>There is a certain term to bring great
Designs to maturity; those that can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
it, are commonly paid with Usury
for their Patience; for, in many things
Delay does more than Force.</p>
            <p>Precipitation ruins the best-laid Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes;
whereas Patience ripens the most
difficult Designs, and renders the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them easie.</p>
            <p>Not but that it becomes a Young Man,
to tempt Fortune by some bold and
couragious Action; for, on the contrary,
this way seldom fails of Success, and the
Character of Attempting is almost a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Pledge or Security for the Success
of any Enterprize whatsoever. Nothing
more resembles Sottishness than Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise;
whereas a little Bravery supplys of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
the want of Ability.</p>
            <p>We ought not then to be afraid so
much of the Merit of others, nor suffer
any Idea we may have of it to give us
any disturbance before 'em; for, how
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:44397:204"/>
much soever one is possess'd in Favour of
a man of great Reputation, he shall not
have a long time convers'd with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he finds a great deal to be abated of
the excess of his Reputation; and that
every one has his Weaknesses, which level
him with the Vulgar, as much as he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from 'em by his Merit.</p>
            <p>A man that is upon the Rise dazles us
if we regard him at any distance; but let
us come near him, and his Personal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
will immediately moderate the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Gloss that he but borrow'd from
his Rank and Dignity.</p>
            <p>Let us then be upon the guard, against
a Power that an Imagination too favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
byass'd usurps over our Reason. It
no more becomes a learned man to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
than an ignorant to be bold.</p>
            <p>We ought to know how to undertake
seasonably: 'tis not enough to begin, we
ought to know how to proceed in an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.
There are a great many Men
who are only good to broach an Affair,
but are absolutely unfit to finish it: 'Tis
from this Default that many great Battels
have been gained without any great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
to the Conquerors, because they
tarried behind to reap the Fruit of the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:44397:204"/>
Victory, when they should pursue the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.
And 'tis from the same Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
that a Statesman, in Publick Affairs,
commits the same Solecisms, as a private
Man does in those of his Family.</p>
            <p>If a Man after having taken his Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
on all sides, happens to succeed in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing, let him take a great deal of
care not to suffer himself to be overcome
with the flattering Design, which Self-love
inspires those with, who have too much
Satisfaction in any happy Success: for
there is need of as much Moderation not
to be corrupted by one's good Fortune,
as Patience not to be cast down at the
bad: Besides, one ought to have the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to stop one's self in the middle of one's
most favourable Enterprizes: The Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of Prosperity ought not to carry us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
against our Wills. 'Tis often times
necessary not to desire one's Victory as far
as one might; a wise Retreat is no less
glorious than a couragious Attack; 'tis
by retiring from the World in good time,
that we can secure the Glory we have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in it; and 'tis the Character of a
consumated Merit, to be able to live in a
Retreat with Honour, after having liv'd
in the Publick with Lustre.</p>

See here, <hi>my Lord,</hi> in what manner it
seems to me, that a young Man who
would maintain an illustrious Figure in
the World, ought to begin, proceed, and
finish his Actions. I am very well assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
there are many other things might be
said upon this Subject, but in the little I
have writ upon this Occasion, there is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to make me understood to one, that

and whose Thoughts are so much

adverse indeed, that one cannot draw

and give ourselves abundance of trouble
for something that in a little time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
of itself easie to us.</p>
            <p>2. Satyr may give us a great deal of
pleasure, whether we write it our selves
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:44397:205"/>
or hear it from another; but this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
should not inspire us with a kind
of Melancholy, that is to be seen in the
Conversation of some People who are
seriously concerned at the Follies or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies
of other Men; who are not
pleased with the Condition they find the
World in, and do not consider disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
Objects, but to be displeased
with 'em. What good did it do <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitus</hi>
to sigh and grieve? Did he by those
means reform the Abuses of the Age?
The wisest side is to take care of one's self,
and to leave to others the managing
their own Persons: Has not every one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to do with his own Affairs?</p>
            <p>3. When a Man is in trouble, he ought
to remember that he has had some fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
minutes, and impute to his good
Fortune all his former happiness; in short,
one is less Unhappy when one can charm
one's Sorrows either by a remembrance,
or an hope of a Condition more Happy.</p>
            <p>4. The greatest part of Mankind look
upon the Honours, Riches, and Pleasures of
others, as Adulterers do upon other Mens
Wives, in despising those they enjoy: Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
a Man make use of Life with pleasure
without possessing all that may belong to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:44397:206"/>
it? Why should we make a Necessity of
an hundred things without which we may
live content enough, providing we be but
a little reasonable.</p>
            <p>5. Although Ambition oppose this, yet
we are more at quiet when we consider
those that are below us: she would have
us aspire to the first Rank, and despise
this petty sort of Tranquillity; but had she
any better recompense to put in its place?</p>
            <p>6. The measure of our Happiness ought
to be taken from that of our Passions: he
that has the fewest desires, hopes, or such
like other motions of the Mind, without
doubt will be the most content.</p>
            <p>7. There is nothing except the desire
of Vertue, which ought to be limited, if
one would live happy: For in fine, how
many Vertues are there incompatible?
How many Undertakings which are not
proper to all sorts of People? it ought to
suffice us that acquit ourselves in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
wherein we are, and there to bound
all our Duty.</p>
            <p>8. That Man's truly miserable who
goes to search for Sorrows in Futurity;
'tis an Abiss so profound that the prospect
from above is enough to fright one. To
make use of the present good is a very rare
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:44397:206"/>
Secret: but not that a Man ought to be
prepar'd for the different Accidents of
Life. This may shield us from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults
of Fortune. No Misfortune can
happen to us when one has a sufficient
Fund of Patience and Reason to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
it.</p>
            <p>9. 'Tis very much to misunderstand
one's self, to be troubled and frighted
when one has done amiss. A man must
have a great deal of Vanity, not to know
his Weakness. But if he knows it, at
least he may gain this Advantage by
it, to remain in a calm Condition after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Frailty whatsoever.</p>
            <p>10. There is nothing more frights the
World than Death, as if it were not a
passage to a better Life. Live well, and
the thoughts of Death will but create in
you an excess of Joy.</p>
            <p>11. Let not your Soul, prevented by
any austere Maxims, hinder you from
taking the innocent pleasure of Life.
There are some Men that build them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
up a Merit, by refusing the smallest,
and most natural Sweets that Heaven has

12. Solid Content proceeds from a
good Conscience; without that, there is
no Pleasure which does not become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie,
for there is no body that receives
more Satisfaction or Uneasiness, than either
to be in good or bad Circumstances with
himself. Now 'tis the thought that we
have performed our Duty, that makes us
be content at Home; and on the other
hand, nothing gives us more Pain and
Inquietude, than the mortifying Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
we make on the ill Disposition of our
Hearts.</p>
            <p>13. Happy is the Man who knows to
make a right Judgment of what is truly
Good, and truly Evil; for there are a
thousand false Scruples, that nevertheless
give us true Vexations: And therefore,
if we desire to regulate them, we must
by no means reject the Natural Instincts
we have of all that is really Good. The
Quiet of those Persons who have lost their
Conscience, is a lamentable Lethargy,
that leads to Infallible Destruction.</p>

of which the Logick we learn at the
College is wholly compos'd, and which are
for the most part, either Unprofitable, or
too Intricate; it seems to me, that these
four only may suffice to all those, who
have a mind to conduct their Reason sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in their Search after Truth.</p>
            <p>1. We ought not to determine, That a
thing is, or is not, without having a
Reason for it, that is explain'd in so clear
terms that it may naturally convince the
Mind.</p>
            <p>2. For fear of suffering one's self to be
carry'd away by a Precipitancy of Mind,
or Prejudice, to which we are so obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
we ought to examine all the terms in
which any Reason is laid down, dividing
it into as many parts as we can: For it is
not possible for us, having our Minds so
confin'd, to judge well of a thing, unless
we examine it peice-meal.</p>
            <p>3. Moreover, we ought to establish an
Order in all the Thoughts that a Subject
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:44397:208"/>
is fill'd with. That which is the most
simple, most general, and most easie to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
ought to precede that which is
most confus'd; because there is nothing
which is a greater help than this Order,
to know if one be not deceiv'd in Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
that is to say, in making one thing
follow another.</p>
            <p>4. In fine, we ought to take a great
deal of care, to make so exact an Enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
that we may be assur'd, that nothing
is omitted. If but one thing be forgot,
'tis impossible there should not be some
defect or other in what we propose.</p>

we know nothing of the Matter. Of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

known; but for want of this Knowledge,
there is a multitude of groundless Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures.</p>

            <p>So then, that of the College is not truly
<hi>Moral Philosophy;</hi> for 'tis certainly true,
that it only proposes some unprofitable
Questions, concerning the Idea that
one ought to have of the Order of Things
that create our Happiness, of the number
of our Passions, and other Metaphysical
Points which serve for nothing else but
Matter for a Dispute.</p>

                  <head>The true <hi>Moral Philosophy</hi> ought to
teach us,</head>
                  <item>1. What it is truly to act like reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Creatures, that is to say, with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
It therefore first treats of Humane
Actions, that is to say, rational, or free.</item>
                  <item>2. After having suppos'd, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but free Actions are Good, or
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:44397:209"/>
Evil, it inquires what this Goodness, or
Evilness of our Actions is; or if there can
be any indifferent.</item>
                  <item>3. For this reason as the goodness of our
Actions depends upon their Rule, and their
End, it inquires what is the certain Rule,
and the certain End.</item>
                  <item>4. Then it teaches us, That we have
not her Rule but the Law of God, which
it considers two ways: 1. As it is written
in the Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> &amp;c. and the Gospel,
interpreted according to the Fathers of
the Church. And, 2. In every Man's
Conscience.</item>
                  <item>5. As to what concerns the End, it
shows that it consists not in Vertue only,
which the <hi>Pagans</hi> sought after with so
great a Passion, but that God only ought
to be the Object, upon which all our Love
is employ'd, of which it discovers to us the
absolute Necessity.</item>
                  <item>6. Next, considering that the Passions
are a certain Obstacle to it, it does not so
much teach us to know them, as how to
tame them.</item>
                  <item>7. In fine, because Men are obliged by
the Necessities of Life, to live together,
it speaks of the Duties of Justice, which
we owe to one another, whatever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:44397:210"/>
we are in. It seems to me, that,
if every one followed these Rules in the
Study of Morality, one might make a
much greater Progress, and find more
Pleasure, than in the insipid Systems of
the Phylosophy of the Schools.</item>

            <head>Maxims of Morality</head>
            <p>REason, which obliges us to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
irresolute in our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
because the greatest part of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
do not present themselves to our
Minds with proof enough to make them
well understood, obliges us not to be so
in our Actions; for being to live with
one another, 'tis necessary to chuse at last
some sort of Conduct, which we should
constantly observe, till we can find a
better.</p>
            <p>For in the same manner, as a Man who
pulls down one House to build up another,
makes choice, by way of Provision, of some
place where to stand while he builds it; so
when a Man would examine with care
his Thoughts, and reform his Soul from
the Prejudices it may have imbid'd, he
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:44397:210"/>
ought to provide himself, after the same
manner, of a Morality which may serve
him for a Rule. This Morality may be
reduc'd to four Maxims:</p>
            <p>1. To obey the Laws and Customs of
the Country where one is born, and to
follow in all things, the most moderate
Opinions, without disapproving, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
any Person.</p>
            <p>2. To be so constant in this Conduct,
that one has chosen, as not to have any
regard to whatever may be said, to put us
out of conceit with it: Like in this to
Travellers, who finding themselves in a
Forrest, ought not to wander this way,
or that way, but go as directly as they can
in the same path, and not to change it,
for idle Reasons; for at last they must
come to some end, wherein all probability,
they will be better than in the middle of
the Wood.</p>
            <p>3. To deliver themselves from all those
Disquiets, which are wont to move those
feeble and staggering Spirits, which suffer
themselves to be turned inconstantly by
all sorts of Examples: For these Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and these unprofitable, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
Reflections amuse the Mind; and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44397:211"/>
take away from it all the force it should
have.</p>
            <p>4. Of all the kinds of Morality, we ought
rather to make use of that which teaches
us to vanquish ourselves, than that which
has no other end, but to triumph over
Fortune, and to change our Desires, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
pretending to change any thing in
the Order of the World. I believe this
was the Secret of thosej Philosophers,
who, inspite of the Incommodities of
Life, were able to dispute Happiness with
their Gods: But it is impossible to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
this Secret, unless one be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perswaded, that there is nothing tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in our Power, but our Thoughts, and
our Desires.</p>
            <p>With these few Maxims one may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
a regular Conduct, till one has form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
another from long Experience, if it be
possible to find a better; Life being short,
and the occasions of improving it very rare.</p>

            <head>To the Earl of Ormond</head>
            <p>ALL Men have a mind to be Happy.
This Desire leaves us not, during
the course of our Lives; 'tis a Truth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
all the World are of one Opinion.</p>
            <p>But to render our selves Happy with
less trouble, and to be so with Security,
without fearing to be disturb'd in one's
Happiness, we ought to act in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<hi>My Lord,</hi> that others may be so
with us; for, if one pretends to take care
only of himself, he will find continual Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions:
And when we will not be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
but upon condition, that others may be
so likewife, all Obstacles are removed,
and all the World agrees with us.</p>
            <p>'Tis this management of Happiness
for our selves and others, which we ought
to call Honesty, and which properly speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is nothing but Self-love well manag'd.</p>
            <p>Honesty ought then to be consider'd,
as the desire of being Happy, but after a
manner, that others may be so too. Let
us look into, let us examine all Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Actions, and we shall find they are
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:44397:212"/>
all of this Nature, and that they all move
upon the same Principle.</p>
            <p>To possess this Honesty in the highest
Degree, we ought to have a sound Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
and our Hearts honest, and
both to agree together.</p>
            <p>By the power of our Understanding, we
know what is most Just, and most Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to say and do; and by the Honesty of
the Heart, we never fail to be willing to
do, and say the same.</p>
            <p>When a Man has but one of these two,
he cannot pretend to compleat Honesty;
for the power of the former does vainly
comprehend Reason and Justice: if the
integrity of the Heart ben't on its side, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is executed, nothing is done. And in
like manner, if the integrity of the Heart
be alone, and the Assistance of the Soul be
wanting to guide it, it will blindly feell
out its way, without ever knowing exactly
the road it ought to take.</p>
            <p>These two things are Essential to make
an honest Man; and since 'tis so rare a
matter to see them separately, how much
ought it to be more rare, to see them
together? But, <hi>My Lord,</hi> when they
meet in the same Person, What Greatness
do they not show, what Justice, what
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:44397:212"/>
Charms, and what Reason? A Man of
this Character compleats equally all his
Duties, however extended, or different
they may be.</p>
            <p>He is a good Subject, a good Father, a
good Friend, a good Citizen, a good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster:
He is Indulgent, Humane, Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Charitable, and Sensible of the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
of another.</p>
            <p>He is Circumspect, he is Modest, he
doth not act the Man of Censure, or
Pride; he takes notice of another's Faults,
but never talks of them, nor does seem
to have seen them.</p>
            <p>He is not in the least interess'd, but, as
he knows the Necessities of Life; his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
is always regulated, and he never
lives in Disorder.</p>
            <p>He is not mov'd, but by true Merit.
That which is call'd Grandeur, Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Fortune, Riches; all these do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
him, and 'tis this which hinders
him from taking sometimes the way to
Fortune.</p>
            <p>Although he be agreeable, and of good
Converse, yet he is enough retir'd, and
loves not a Crowd: So we may see
he seldom endeavours to show himself up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Theatre of the World: but if his
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:44397:213"/>
Birth or Fortune are pleas'd to place him
there, as he has a vast Wit, as he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiously
Apprehensive, Penetrating, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert,
and what not, he performs his Part
esxceedingly well.</p>
            <p>The honest Man makes a great account
of Wit, but yet he makes a greater of
Reason. He loves Truth in all things; he
would willingly know all things, but is
not vext, if he knows nothing. He takes
care of all, examines all, knows the
Worth, Force, and Weakness of all. He
esteems nothing, but according to its true
Value. The nicest Errors and Disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments
do not impose upon him, nor
make any Impression upon his <hi>Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The honest Man, in short, says no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and does nothing, which is not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable,
Just, Reasonable, and which
does not lead to the making all Men Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.</p>
            <p>'Tis then evident, <hi>My Lord,</hi> That to
make the World Happy, 'tis necessary
to establish Honesty in it. But to bring
this about, 'twould not suffice to know in
what Condition it is at present in; 'tis
necessary also, to know how it ought
to be, and how it would be in effect, if
all Men were <hi>Reasonable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:44397:213"/>
In the present Estate of the World, every
thing is almost out of Order: Honesty has
no place in it, and honest Men live in it,
as it were a strange Country.</p>
            <p>The Re-establishment of Honesty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Men, would be easie for Kings;
and to accomplish this great Work, they
would have nothing else to do, but to
prefer good Men, and punish the bad.</p>
            <p>If all Men were reasonable, there
would be nothing among us, but our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Infirmities, as Sickness, Old Age, and
Death.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, we have a thousand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as Prevention, Madness, Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Perfidiousness, Ignorance, and the
Contempt of Knowledge.</p>
            <p>There is nothing else in the World that
attracts the eyes and esteem of all Men,
but great Birth, and the Glory of War;
all other Deserts, if I may speak so, are
sad and languishing, and not taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of.</p>
            <p>'Tis very just that the Merits of War
should be consider'd; the Fatigues,
Wounds, and Death itself, to which the
Brave are so often expos'd, ought yet to
be more taken notice of then they are:
Nevertheless, if one compares the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:44397:214"/>
that are bestowed upon 'em, with
those of Persons dignify'd in other Arts,
we shall find that they are enough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.
There is this unhappiness in the
Merit of the Mind, that few People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it, and that even in this small
number there are some who have no great
esteem for it.</p>
            <p>It is not the same with Riches; all the
World esteems them, the Poor as well as
the Rich: The other Gifts of Fortune have
the same advantages; the Men of the
lowest birth aim at Greatness, and do
what they can to raise themselves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>MEN never commend freely, and
without interest: Some advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
must come to 'em, or it must cost him
something considerable that has a mind

            <p>Those that are of high Birth are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually

               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:44397:214"/>
The Conditions of the most Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
are the most despised; their Miseries
alone are not enough, but there must be
added to 'em Shame and Scorn; Men are
in truth very cruel.</p>
            <p>One must never say, Citizen, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
Boor, and such like. All these names
are injurious, and words of contempt;
one must endeavour to avoid 'em, for
they do but create malice amongst Men:
but we must preserve the names of Knave,
Traytor, Ungrateful Fellow, and others
of such nature, on purpose to cast a shame
on those that deserve it.</p>
            <p>We ought not to despise those that are
in want, but rather on the contrary give
'em some marks of our Esteem: And as
Contempt is, it may be, one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
misfortunes of Poverty, we may sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
in some manner their troubles, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring,
without affectation, that we do not
esteem 'em less, however unhappy they be.</p>
            <p>One must be affable and courteous to
one's Domesticks, and by this behaviour
comfort 'em in their conditions. 'Tis the
work of Fortune that they are so low, and
that we are above'em.</p>
            <p>We must not be rigorous in what regards
our own interests: Nothing becomes a Man
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:44397:215"/>
better than to release a little of his priviledge.
One must avoid great Play, 'tis a Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement
too dangerous; Anger, Heat and
Quarrels accompany it always; it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
a Man often times bad nights, and at
long run it perpetually incommodes him:
Nor is this all, he must be always upon his
gard; lest he be cheated, and 'tis but an
uneasie condition to be always as in an
Enemy's Country.</p>
            <p>A Man ought not to have any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
or too gay in his Habit, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
or Manners: It seems to me that
the modest Air becomes one better than
that which they call the <hi>Bel-air;</hi> 'tis good
to have in one's Countenance something
great, that procures both Esteem and
Respect; but the Courteous, and Honest
Air does not create less good Effects; 'tis
from thence that we make our selves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd:
For the fierce Air that is so much
esteem'd, in my Opinion, is only proper
for War.</p>
            <p>We ought to learn not to disquiet our
selves, and to study well this Lesson.</p>
            <p>The Court, if I may say so, is an <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome</hi>
of the whole Kingdom; whatever is
most Exquisite and Pure, is there met
with. The manner of speaking, the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:44397:215"/>
the Modes, the Air, and the Customs are
there excellent. The greatest part of these
things are not learnt, but by the Success,
as Physick is not well understood, but by
Experience: However, it seems to me, that
one ought to endeavour to know them by
their Causes, which would be the best and
surest way. And to this end, we ought to
know the nature of those things which
please, and be skill'd in the Hearts of Men.</p>
            <p>There is no other Study, but how to
please in the Courts of Princes, because
there a Man makes his Fortune by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
himself agreeable. Hence it comes,
that Courtiers are so Polisht. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
in Towns and Republicks where
Men manage their Affairs by Labour, the
the last of their Cares is to Please, and 'tis
that which renders them so Clownish.</p>
            <p>That which we call the <hi>Last</hi> in a Figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
Sence, is a very rare thing, and is
found but in very few People. One can
scarce learn it, or teach it, but it must be
born with us. Exquisite Knowledge seems
to be above it, and carries a greater Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;
but in truth, for the Commerce of
the World, and most affairs of Life, a
true Judgment equals its Worth, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesses
its place. When we have got this
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:44397:216"/>
Advantage, we ought not to despise those
which have it not.</p>
            <p>To be agreeable, and good Company,
a Man ought to think discreetly, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
upon all that is said in Conversation;
and this cannot be, if one has not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Wit, a great deal of Memory, and
an Imagination suitable. One ought also
to be Master of one's Language, by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the Niceties, Beauties, and Delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of it.</p>
            <p>We ought to suit ourselves to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
of those we converse with, and
to take in some manner, the Heighth, and
the Degree of their Wit. We ought to
take a great deal of care not to affect the
Vanity to be the head of the Company.
One makes himself more agreeable, when
one hears willingly, and without Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie;
and susters others to have Wit as well
as himself.</p>
            <p>There is no Subject so barren, upon
which there may not be something well
said; but even when the Subject affords
nothing, a Man of sense has always in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
some agreeable manner of speaking,
of which he is an absolute Master, and
which can never fail him: Apt Words are
rare, and depend upon Time and Chance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:44397:216"/>
Narratives and Stories do not always
succeed; we ought not to make use of them
often; but when we find ourselves enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in them, we must take care that they
be not long, and that there be always
something particular and diverting, to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
the Company. One must avoid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions.
We care not to hear what
we know already, and we can reap no
more benefit by,</p>
            <p>Things that are New, Great, Universal,
and those which have the Air of great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
are always pleasing, because Men
are Curious; because they despise those
things that are limited, and of small conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
and are commonly very much
affected with Grandeur.</p>
            <p>'Tis for this Reason, that what comes
from the Country, from little Towns, and
private Quarters, is but indifferently receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
We are apt to imagine, that Politeness,
and a good Tast is not to be found there.</p>
            <p>The same Reason occasions also, that
Figures d<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>wn from War, Hunting, and
the Sea, are so well receiv'd; and that
we cannot endure those that are taken
from mean Professions; of which the
World makes but small account.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:44397:217"/>
One must not expect, that Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
should be always equal; they depend
upon Chance, as well as other things.</p>
            <p>A Man can't become Learn'd, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable,
if he does not love Reading;
without it the best natural Parts are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
dry and barren.</p>
            <p>He ought to behave himself so, that
in his Actions, Discourse, and Manners
there may be always a certain Air of
Politeness, that never forsakes him: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more shameful than to be Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.</p>
            <p>Politeness is a mixture of Discretion,
Civility, Complaisance, and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection;
accompanied with an agreeable
Air scatter'd throughout, whatever one
says, or does. And as so many things
are Essentially necessary to acquire this
Politeness, it is no wonder if it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common.</p>
            <p>Whether it is, that Women are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
more Polite, or that to please them,
the Spirit raises, and embellishes itself;
'tis principally from them, that this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteness

their <hi>Jerusalem</hi> upon the Banks of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates.</hi>
Either live happy in <hi>England,</hi>
in an entire Liberty of Conscience, or
accommodate your self to the Catholick
Religion in your own Country, to enjoy
the advantages you thirst after.</p>
            <p>Is it possible, that Images, Ornaments,
Ceremonies, and other such like things,
upon which you establish so many ill
grounded Disputations, and which you
make so unreasonably the Subject of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration;
should trouble the Quiet of
Nations, and be the cause of so many
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:44397:218"/>
great Misfortunes which happen to Men.</p>
            <p>I confess, 'tis a good thing, to search
God in Spirit and Truth. This first Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
this soveraign Intelligence deserves
our most purifi'd Speculations. But when
we have a mind to disengage our Soul
from all commerce with our Sense, are
we assur'd, that an abstracted Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is not lost in wandring Thoughts,
and does not create more Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
than it discovers Truths? Whence,
think you, comes the Absurdity of so
many Sects scatter'd through the World,
but from deep Meditations, where the
Mind, as it were in a Dream, meets
with nothing but its own proper Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies?</p>
            <p>Forget Sir, this melancholy Disgust you
have to our Images. Images stop in a
manner, this Spirit so difficult to be fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Moreover, there is nothingmore na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
to Man than Imitation; and of all
Imitations, there is nothing so lawful as
that of a Picture, which represents to us
only what we ought to Worship.</p>
            <p>The Idea of vertuous Persons creates in
us a love of Vertue; and produces a just
desire to attain that Perfection which they
have arrived to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:44397:218"/>
There are Emulations of Holiness, as
well as Jealousies of Glory; and if the
Picture of <hi>Alexander</hi> animated the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of <hi>Caesar</hi> to a Conquest of the
World, the Image of our Saints may well
excite in us the ardour of their Zeal, and
inspire us with that happy Violence which
ravishes Heaven.</p>
            <p>I allow you, that the Old Testament did
not permit us to form any thing that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
like the resemblance of God. This
God painted himself in the great Work
of the Universe. The Heavens, the Sun,
the Stars, the Elements were the Images
of his Immensity and Power. The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Order of Nature exprest his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to us. Our Reason, which would
know all, finds in her self a kind of Idea of
this Infinite Being; and this was all that
could be figur'd of a God, who did no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
discover himself to Men, but by
his Works.</p>
            <p>But it is not thus in the New Alliance.
Since that a God is become Man for our
Salvation, we may well make to our selves
Images of him, to stir us up to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his Goodness and Love: And in
effect, if those are condemn'd as Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
that deny'd his Humanity, is not
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:44397:219"/>
it a strange Absurdity to call us Idolaters
for loving to see it represented? You are
commanded to think always of his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
to meditate always upon his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
and it yet is made a crime in us, to
have Figures that should support the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of them.</p>
            <p>They would have the Image of his
Death always presented to our Souls,
but won't allow of any before our Eyes.</p>
            <p>Your Aversion for the Ornaments of
our Priests has no better Foundation. Do
not you know, Sir, that God took the
pains himself, to ordain even the Fringe
of the Habit of the High Priest? And
do you find that our Pontifical Habits are
very different from those under the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Oeconomy?</p>
            <p>You are not less forward to deny us our
Musick, than to condemn our Images.
You ought to have remembred, Sir, that
<hi>David</hi> recommended nothing frequenter
to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> than to sing the Praises
of the Lord, with all sorts of Instruments.</p>
            <p>The Musick of our Churches exalts the
Soul, purifies the Spirit, inspires the Heart,
and rectifies, or augments the Devotion.
When a Mistery, or a Miracle is treated
of, you understand nothing but Sense and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:44397:219"/>
Reason. In Natural things, which lead
to Purity, Sense and Reason are your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
There you give all to Nature,
here to Grace; there one can alledge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
supernatural but you laugh at it:
Here one says nothing of Humane to you,
but you think it Prophane, and Impious.</p>
            <p>Contrarieties have lasted but too long.
Agree with us about the lawful establisht
Customs, and we will write with you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Abuses that have been introduc'd.</p>
            <p>As to the Doctrine of our Church,
touching the real Presence of the Body of
Jesus Christ, in the Sacrament of our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
you have no more reason to dispute
it. You say, that it is difficult to agree
with us about a Body without Figure and
Extension; But is it more easie for us to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with you about your Spiritual eating
it? After this manner, who eats really
the Substance of this same Body? The
difficulty of comprehending the Mistery,
is it less great on your side? And is not a
Miracle as necessary to your Opinion, as
ours?</p>
            <p>So that, if in spite of all this, the love
of a Separation still possesses you, and
that you cannot disengage your self from
the prejudice of your Sentiments; do not
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:44397:220"/>
complain of that which is taken from
you as an Injustice, but rather be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for that which you have left as a Grace.
Melancholly Muttering, and Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
will rather hurt than serve you.
Whereas a Conduct more respectful,
and an Interest more discreetly manag'd,
than violently maintain'd, might hinder
the design of your Ruine, if it were
thought on.</p>
            <p>One of the chiefest points of Discretion,
and the oftenest recommended, is to respect
in all Countries the Religion of the Prince.
To condemn the Belief of the Soveraign,
is to condemn the Soveraign himself at
the same time. A Protestant, who in
his Discourse, or Writings, taxes the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Religion of Idolatry, accuses the
King by a necessary Consequence to be
an Idolater; and makes an assault upon
him in his own Dominions; which the
Emperours of <hi>Rome</hi> would never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</p>
            <p>I know well, that I exhort you to no
purpose, in the humour you are at present.
A Sentiment as it were natural, which is
form'd in our first Impressions; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
one has for ancient Customs; the
difficulty that one suffers to quit a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:44397:220"/>
one has been born in, to embrace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
which one has always oppos'd;
a delicacy of Scruple, a false opinion of
Constancy, are bonds which will not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be broken. But then at least leave to
your Children the liberty of chusing
that which your long Engagements will
not suffer you to do.</p>
            <p>You complain of the Edict, that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
them to choose a Religion at se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
years old; Now this is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
favour could have been done them;
by that they are restor'd to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
which you robb'd them of; It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
them into the Bosom of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
whence you drag'd them;
It makes them capable of Honours and
Dignities, that you had excluded them
from.</p>
            <p>Do not envy them Sir, those Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
that you will not benefit by; and
keeping your Opinions and Misfortunes
to your self, remit the care of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to Divine Providence, which shews
itself so visible in such a conduct.</p>
            <p>Where is the Father who does not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
the Zeal of his Party, as well as his
Religion, into his Children? And what
does any one know what may happen
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:44397:221"/>
from this Zeal? whether it will proceed to
Fury or Piety? if it will produce Crimes
or Vertues? In this Uncertainty, Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
all things to the disposition of a Law,
which has no other end, then the Publick
Good, and the particular Interest of your
Family.</p>

            <head>A Letter to Monsieur the Count de C.
By the same Hand.</head>
            <p>AS I interest my self infinitely in all
that concerns you, the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of your gallant Actions have created
in me a sincere pleasure. Persons that
have been perfectly acquainted with 'em,
have taken the pains to send me an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of 'em; and I should be ready to
complain to you, for concealing them as a
Secret, if I did not fear to disturb a Joy
so great as yours, by reproaches of
Friendship.</p>
            <p>How truly Glorions are you, Sir, after
having so often given proofs of your Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
against the Enemies of the State, to
have vanquish'd, amidst the Delights of
the City, the most merciless Creature,
in the World, and who had defy'd all the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:44397:221"/>
Earth? I know that charming Person in
whom Beauty, Wit, and Manners seem
to dispute which shall gain her the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Esteem: lovely, delicious, and now,
for you only becomes a Lover. In truth,
Sir, I enter into those very Transports
which have made you forget all the World,
to imprint in your Soul only the Idea of a
Person so accomplisht: I pardon your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning
yourself wholly to her; and I
conceive it is difficult for you to have any
Kindness left for Madam de <hi>L.</hi> who is so
much below her in Charms of Body.</p>
            <p>But at length, Sir, your forgetting and
abandoning, excusable in the beginnings of
so great a Fortune, would be so no longer
if they should last always: You know that
Madam de <hi>L.</hi> has a Merit very much
distinguisht: you know all that you owe
her. She loves you as much as ever any
lov'd: Ought not her Love then to take
place of Beauty? And this Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
with which you were smitten so
much heretofore, does it not oblige you
to some manner of Return?</p>
            <p>For my part, I confess to you, that the
Description she makes of your Insensibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and of her Griefs, is so lively and
touching in the Letter she writ to me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:44397:222"/>
this Subject, that I cannot avoid en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into her Interests: Suffer then, Sir, I
beseech you, my Remonstrances; you owe
this to our Friendship, and I owe them to
the Confidence that an Unhappy Lady
has repos'd in me.</p>
            <p>I do not mean here that you should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
in favour of her, this. Beauty that so
bewitches you: you have nothing more
to do than to give yourself the trouble to
deceive Madam <hi>L.</hi> You will do it easily
because she'll assist you herself. And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
you will not pretend to so squeamish a
conscience as to make a scruple of it.</p>
            <p>You are not ignorant that your new
love will be mixt with some Confusions
and Coldnesses: you may allow those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals
to Madam <hi>L.</hi> and she'll be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with 'em; and you may make use of
her to re-inflame the fires of t'other, that
unlucky Accidents or a meer Cessation
may extinguish.</p>
            <p>Yet once more, Sir, do not despise a
Woman that a great many others would
be glad of: permit her to think that she
has yet some place in your breast. <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades</hi>
did not disdain to eat course Bread
and black Porridge with the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
after he had tasted the Delights of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens;</hi>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:44397:222"/>
he came out of the arms of the
lovely <hi>Aspasia,</hi> the most charming Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of all <hi>Greece,</hi> where he enjoyed all
the Spirit and Delicacy of a tender Love,
and yet submitted himself to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
of the Queen of <hi>Sparta,</hi> whose Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
were fulsom, and who was very far
from having the Charms of <hi>Aspasia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See here, Sir, an Example to follow;
consider also with a little attention, the
Character of <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> and you may
find it throughout to have much resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
with yours; which I presume will
not be thought disadvantageous.</p>

         <div type="letter">
            <head>A Letter to Madam D. D. B. C.
By the same Hand.</head>
            <p>FRom what I understand, Madam,
you've a mind to become a Religious;
I thank God for it with all my heart; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
more need in your Conversation of
the Purity of Sentiments, you are about
to have, then all those you may be inspired
with from the Conversation of Men.</p>
            <p>I conjure you, then in the name of
Heaven, to take up a sincere Devotion;
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:44397:223"/>
and to render it such as it ought to be, take
care to avoid the Defects which that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
People is so often accompanied with.</p>
            <p>There are some Men who think they
have the ardour of a lively Zeal. There
are some who enjoy themselves in a good
and solid Piety. There are others who
could be able to die for God, through the
Sentiments of a couragious Faith. But
in truth there are very few who can live
according to the Laws of the Gospel and
Religion.</p>
            <p>You may expect all from their Heat,
where there is occasion to employ it: but
you must hope almost nothing from 'em
where there is need of Constancy and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</p>
            <p>Let us see how they behave themselves
in things which God requires from their
Submission: and when they show a Rule
in their Manners, a Modesty in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
a Patience in Injuries, then will
I be convinc'd of their Devotion by their
Conduct.</p>
            <p>Govern yourself, Madam, by the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of others; and having a mind to give
yourself to God, let that less enter into
your Devotion which you love, than that
which pleases him. If you do not take
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:44397:223"/>
care in this, your heart may bear its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
to him without receiving the
impressions of his Grace, and you will be
altogether your own, when you think you
are altogether his.</p>
            <p>Not but that there may be an holy and
happy Agreement between his will and
yours: you may love what he loves; you
may desire what he desires; but we do
commonly by a pleasing and secret Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
that which we desire of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and 'tis this which ought to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
us more attentive and inclin'd to do
nothing but by a consideration of what he
enjoyns.</p>
            <p>You need not nevertheless for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
subject yourself wholly to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of those Directers, who make use
in their Maxims of a certain Spiritual
niceness which you do not understand, nor
perhaps they themselves. The Will of
God is not so conceal'd but it may be
discover'd by those who have a mind to
follow it; and generally speaking you'll
have less need of Inspiration than Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Those things which have relation
to your desires, are easily understood, and
easily follow'd: Those which encounter
your inclinations explain themselves e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:44397:224"/>
but Nature resists, and an indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
Soul defends its self from their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.
I should desire then, Madam,
two things of you, in the Devotion you
are about to engage your self in: the first
is, That you would take care not to raise
your Heart to God, because you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it more proper for the Passions of
Men. The second is, That you would not
disguise your Animosities under an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Zeal, or prosecute those you
with ill to, under a false pretence of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

            <head>A Relation of a Dispute between the
Mareschal of Hocquincourt, and
Father Canaye, a Iesuite. By
M. D. S. E.</head>
            <p>AS I din'd t'other day, with the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal
d' Hocquincourt,</hi> Father <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naye,</hi>
who din'd there also, let fall the
Discourse insensibly, upon the Submission
of the Spirit that Religion requires of
us; and having related to us many new
Miracles, and some modern Revolations,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:44397:224"/>
he concluded, that we ought to avoid
more than the Plague, those head-strong
Spirits, who would examine all things by
Reason.</p>
            <p>To whom do you talk of head-strong
Spirits, says the <hi>Mareschal?</hi> And who has
known them better than me? <hi>Bardouville</hi>
and St. <hi>Thibal</hi> were the best of my
Friends; 'twas they that engag'd me on
the side of Monsieur <hi>le Comte,</hi> against
Cardinal <hi>Richelieu.</hi> If I were acquainted
with many more of these head-strong
Wits, I would write a Book of all they have
said. <hi>Bardouville</hi> being dead, and St. <hi>Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
retir'd into <hi>Holland,</hi> I entertain'd a
Friendship with <hi>Lafrete,</hi> and <hi>Sauve Beuf;</hi>
these were not head-strong Wits, but
brave Men. <hi>Lafrete</hi> was a gallant Man,
and my very good Friend, and I think
that I have sufficiently testifi'd my self to
have been his, in the Distemper that he
dy'd of. I saw him die of a small Feaver,
which would have scarce killed a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
and was enrag'd to see <hi>Lafrete,</hi> that
<hi>Lafrete</hi> who fought <hi>Bouteville,</hi> go out,
neither better nor worse, than a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
Candle. We were concern'd, <hi>Sauve
Beuf</hi> and I, to preserve the Honour of our
Friend, which made me take a resolution
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:44397:225"/>
to kill him with a Pistol-bullet, that he
might dye like a Man of Courage. I
clapt the Pistol to his Head, when a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Bougre of a Jesuit pusht my Arm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
and hinder'd my Design. This put
me in so great a rage, that presently I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to become a <hi>Iansenist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take notice, <hi>my Lord,</hi> says the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
take notice how Satan is always ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in wait for us. <hi>Circuit Quaerens quem
Devoret;</hi> You conceive a kind of Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
against our Order, which he takes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of to surprize and devour you;
nay, worse than devour you, to make
you turn <hi>Iansenist: Vigilate, Vigilate;</hi>
One cannot be too much upon his
guard against the common Enemy of
Mankind.</p>
            <p>The Father's in the right, says the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal;</hi>
I have heard, that the Devil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
sleeps. We must have a good Guard,
a good Foot, and a good Eye upon him.
But let's leave the Devil and discourse of
the things I love. I have lov'd War above
all things, Madam <hi>de Monbazon</hi> next to
War, and such as you see me, Philosophy
after Madam <hi>de Monbazon.</hi> You have
reason to love War, replys the Father,
and War also loves you; she has crown'd
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:44397:225"/>
you likewise with Honour. Don't you know
that I am also a Warrior? The King has
given me the Direction of the Hospital of
his Army in <hi>Flanders:</hi> Is not this enough
to be a Warrier? Who would ever have
believ'd that Father <hi>Canaye</hi> should ever
have become a Soldier? I am such, <hi>my
Lord,</hi> and do not render less Service
to God in the Camp, than I did in the
College of <hi>Clermont.</hi> You may then love
War innocently; to go to War, is to
love one's Prince; and to serve one's
Prince, is to serve God.</p>
            <p>But as for what concerns Madam <hi>de
Monbazon;</hi> if you have lusted after her,
you must permit me to tell you, that your
Desires were criminal. You should not
lust after her, <hi>my Lord,</hi> but love her with
an innocent Friendship.</p>
            <p>What, says the <hi>Mareschal,</hi> would you
have me love like a Sot? The <hi>Mareschal</hi>
of <hi>Hocquincourt</hi> has not learnt in Ladies
Chambers, to do nothing but Sigh. I
would, my Father, I would—you
understand me well. I would—Oh
how many I would? In truth, <hi>my Lord,</hi>
you rally with a good Grace. Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of St. <hi>Louis</hi> would be astonisht at
these <hi>I woulds:</hi> When one has been a
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:44397:226"/>
great while in the Army, one learns to
bear all. No more, no more, you speak
this, <hi>my Lord,</hi> I suppose to divert your self.</p>
            <p>There is no such Divertisement in't, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
Do you know for what design I
lov'd her? <hi>Vsque ad Aras,</hi> My Lord: No,
<hi>Aras,</hi> my Father. <hi>Look here,</hi> says the
Marshal, taking a Knife, and grasping the
Haft fast in his hand, <hi>look here, if she had
commanded me to kill you, I would have bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
the Blade in your Heart.</hi> Father
<hi>Canaye</hi> surprised at this Discourse, and
more frighted at the Transport, had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
recourse to his Mental Devotion,
and prayed God secretly, that he would
deliver him from the danger wherein he
found himself. But not trusting alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to Prayer, he leap'd insensibly
out of the Marshal's reach, by an unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
motion of his Buttocks. The
Marshal followed him in the like manner;
and one that had seen his Knife always
lifted up, would have sworn, that he was
going to put his Order into Execution.</p>
            <p>My ill Nature made me take pleasure a
while in the fears of our Reverend Spark;
but fearing at length that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal
in his Transports, might render
that Scene melancholy which was before
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:44397:226"/>
only pleasant, I caus'd him to remember,
that Madam <hi>de Monbazon</hi> was dead; and
told him, That fortunately the Father <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naye</hi>
had nothing to fear from a Person
that was no more.</p>
            <p>God does all for the best, replies the
Marshal: The fairest Woman in the
World began to play the fool with me
when she dy'd. There was always near
her a certain <hi>Abbot de Rauce,</hi> who talkt to

her with other things in private.
This made me forsake the <hi>Iansenists;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I never miss'd a Sermon of Father
<hi>Desmarez,</hi> and never swore, but by the
Gentlemen of <hi>Port-Royal.</hi> I have always
been at Confession with the Jesuits since
that time: And if my Son has ever any
Children, I am resolv'd they shall study
at the Colledge of <hi>Clermont,</hi> upon pain
of being disinherited. Oh, how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
are the Ways of God! crys out
Father <hi>Canaye:</hi> How profound is the
Mystery of his Justice! A little Weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock
of a <hi>Iansenist,</hi> to follow a Lady
whom my Lord wisht well to. The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
God made use of Jealousie to put the
Conscience of my Lord into our hands;
<hi>Mirabilia Iudicia tua Domine;</hi> Wonderful
are thy Judgments, O Lord!</p>

After the good Father had finisht his
pious Reflections, I thought it might be
permitted me to enter into the Discourse;
and I askt the Marshal, If the Love of
Philosophy had not succeeded his Passion
for Madam <hi>de Monbazon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have lov'd Philosophy but too well,
said the Marshal, I have lov'd it but too
well; but I have at length left it, and will
trouble my head with it not more. A Dog
of a Philosopher had so puzzled my Brain
about our first Parents, the Apple, the
Serpent, Terrestrial Paradise, and the
Cherubins, that I was about to believe
nothing of the matter. The Devil take
me, if I believ'd any thing then; but
from that time, I would have crucify'd
myself for my Religion. 'Tis not that I
see more reason in it now, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
less than ever: But I cannot help
telling you, I would nevertheless have
sacrific'd myself without knowing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>So much the better, my Lord, replies
the Father, with a tone of Nose very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout,
so much the better; that shews they
are not Humane Motions, but that they
proceed from God. No reason! that is
the true Religion which has no reason.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:44397:227"/>
What an extraordinary Grace, <hi>my Lord,</hi>
has Heaven bestow'd upon you? <hi>Estote
sunt Infantes;</hi> be as Infants. Infants have
yet their Innocence, and why? because
they have no reason, <hi>Beati pauperes Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu,</hi>
Blessed are the Poor in Spirit: they sin
not; the reason is, that they have no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
<hi>No Reason, I cannot help telling you
wherefore.</hi> Oh excellent Words! they
ought to be writ in Letters of Gold: <hi>'Tis
not that I see more Reason in it, but on the
contrary less than ever.</hi> In truth, this is
Divine for them that have any tast of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Things: <hi>No Reason,</hi> what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Grace, <hi>my Lord,</hi> has God
bestow'd upon you?</p>
            <p>The Father had gone on farther with
his Invectives against Reason, but that
Letters were brought from Court to the
Marshal, which interrupted so Pious an
Entertainment. The Marshal read them
softly to himself, and afterwards he was
pleas'd to tell the Company what they
contain'd: If I had a mind to seem a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician,
as others do, I should retire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my Closet, to read Dispatches from
the Court; but I always act and speak
with an open Heart. The Cardinal sends
me word, <hi>That Stenay</hi>'s taken, that the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:44397:228"/>
Court will be here in eight days; and the
Command of the Army, which made the
Siege, is given me, to go and relieve
<hi>Arras</hi> with <hi>Turenne</hi> and <hi>La Ferte.</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
well that <hi>Turenne</hi> suffer'd me to
be beaten by Monsieur the Prince, when
the Court was at <hi>Gien;</hi> perhaps I may
find an occasion to do him the like favour.
If <hi>Arras</hi> were reliev'd, and <hi>Turenne</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
I should be content; I'll do what I
can; but I say no more.</p>
            <p>He related to us all the particulars
of his Combat, and the subject of his
Complaint, that he thought he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Monsieur <hi>Turenne:</hi> But we were
advertised, that the Convoy was already
far enough from the Town, which made
us take leave sooner than we meant to
have done.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Canaye</hi> finding himself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an Horse, desir'd one to carry him
to the Camp: <hi>And what Horse will
you have, Father?</hi> says the Marshal. <hi>I
will answer you, my Lord,</hi> says the Father,
as the good Father <hi>Suarez</hi> did the Duke of
<hi>Medina Sidonia,</hi> upon the like occasion,
<hi>Qualem me decet esse, Mansuetum.</hi> Such an
one as I ought to be, <hi>gentle</hi> and <hi>tractable,
Qualem me decet esse Mansuetum; I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:44397:228"/>
a little Latine,</hi> says the Marshal;
<hi>Mansuetum</hi> would be fitter for Sheep than
Horses. Let my Horse be given to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
I love the whole Order, and am his
Friend, therefore let them give him my
best Horse. Here I went to dispatch a
few Affairs, but staid not long, before I
rejoyned the Convoy. We jogg'd on
prosperously, but not without some fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue.
As for the poor Father <hi>Canaye,</hi> I
met him upon the prance, on one of the
best Horses of Monsieur <hi>d' Hocquincourt;</hi>
'twas a mettlesome fiery Horse, restless and
always in action; he chew'd his Bit eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
always went on one side, neigh'd
every minute, and that which shockt
most the Modesty of the Father, he very
indecently mistook all the Horses he met
for Mares. <hi>And, what do I see my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi>
said I, coming up to him. <hi>What
Horse have they given you? Where is Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
Suarez'<hi>s Nag that you askt so earnestly
for?</hi> Ah Sir, <hi>says he,</hi> I can sit him no longer.
He was about to continue his Complaints,
when a Hare cross'd the Road, and an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Horse immediately hurried away in
confusion after the <hi>Course,</hi> and we heard pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
more discharges of Pistols, than at a
Skirmish. The Father's Horse being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custom'd
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:44397:229"/>
to fire under the Marshal, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
a way his Man, and made him charge
instantly through their confus'd Ranks.
'Twas a thing very pleasant, to see a Jesuit
at the head of all this Company, against his
Will. Happily the Hare was kill'd, and I
found the Father in the middle of thirty
Horse men, who all gave him the Honour
of a Chase, which one might have better
call'd Chance. The Father receiv'd their
Commendations with apparent Modesty;
but in his Mind he despis'd very much the
<hi>Mansuetum</hi> of good Father <hi>Suarez,</hi> and
was rais'd to the best humour in the
World, in reflecting on the Miracles that
he fancied he had done on the Marshal's
Courser: Yet he was not long without
remembring that good saying of <hi>Solomon,
Vanitas vanitatum, &amp; omnia Vanitas.</hi> He
was no sooner grown cool, but he felt an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easiness
which the heat had conceal'd from
him, and false Glory giving place to true
Grief; he wish'd for the repose of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
and the content of a peaceable
Life, which he had quitted. But all these
Reflections signified nothing, he must go
to the Camp, and he was so tir'd with his
Horse, that I saw him ready to abandon
his <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> and walk a foot at the
Head of the Infantry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:44397:229"/>
I comforted him for his past Fatigue, and
exempted him from any future Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences,
in bestowing on him the easiest
Nag he could have wisht for. He gave
me a thousand thanks, and was so sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of my civility, that forgetting all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of his Profession, he convers'd with
me more like an honest sincere Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traveller
than a Jesuit. I askt him what
opinion he had of Monsieur <hi>d' Hocquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court?</hi>
'Tis a good Lord, says he, 'tis a
good Soul: He has quitted the <hi>Iansenists;</hi>
our Order is oblig'd to him: but for my
part, I think I shall never eat at his Table
again, or borrow Horse of him.</p>
            <p>Being much pleas'd with this first free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
I had a mind to try him farther.
Whence comes, continu'd I, the great
Animosities between the <hi>Iansenists</hi> and
your Fathers? Does it proceed from the
difference in Opinion about the Doctrine
of Grace? What folly, what folly, says
he, is it to think that we hate one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for not having the same Opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Grace! 'Tis neither Grace nor the
five Propositions that have raised these
Animosities between us. The jealousie
of governing Consciences, is the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
The <hi>Iansenists</hi> found us in poses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:44397:230"/>
of the Government, and they have a
mind to dispossess us.</p>
            <p>Now to effect their ends, they have
made use of Methods quite contrary to
ours. We employ Gentleness and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and they affect Austerity and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour.
We comfort Souls by the Examples
of the Mercies of God, and they frighten
them by those of Justice. They make use
of Fear, where we make use of Hopes.
They would ride those that we would
have to be our Subjects. Not but that both
of us have a mind to save Men, and each
has a mind to have the credit on't. And
to speak freely to you, the interest of the
Director goes almost always before the
salvation of him who is under the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
I speak to you after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
than I did to the Marshal; I was pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Jesuite with him, but with you I use
the freedom of a Soldier. I commended
very much the new Liberty which his last
Profession had made him take, and it
seem'd to me that the commendation
pleas'd him. I had continu'd it longer, but
as Night began to approach, we were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to separate; the Father being as much
contented with my proceeding, as I was
satisfied with the confidence he reposed in
me.</p>

            <head>Motives for a general Peace in the
Year 1678.</head>
            <p>IF it be a difficult matter to discover
the Origine of Winds and Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean
Fires, 'tis no less very often to dive
into the hidden Causes of the greatest part
of our Wars; sometimes Ambition and
Avarice keep those designs long conceal'd,
that the least pretence discovers.</p>
            <p>The Declarations of the pretended
Cause, for the most part, are only calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to amuse the People; and oftentimes
so dexterously, that the true Reasons of
State and Policy are covered with some
appearance of Justice. They never scruple
to ruin the Foundation, and violate the
most Sacred Rights of Nature.</p>
            <p>Don't let us look for any fresh Instances
of this in the unhappy War which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
oppresses all Countries of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
let us conceive for the Princes who
are the cause of it, a Respect which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
Posterity will not subscribe to; let
us suppose, that they do all out of a good
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:44397:231"/>
meaning, and that Justice is the rule of
so many destructive Actions. It seems at
least, that they have not forgot all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of Equity, since they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
to chuse Mediators to decide their
Differences; and that those who are chiefly
concerned seem willing to accept his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention,
whom the God of Peace hath
made his Lieutenant upon Earth.</p>
            <p>But as it may happen, that these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are not all equally dispos'd to accept
of a speedy Peace, 'twill be necessary to
remember them, that they are obliged to
it by the Motives of Glory, Interest and a
good Conscience.</p>
            <p>Glory is nothing else but an high Esteem
which is acquired amongst Men, and
which passes down to Posterity. We may
say, that there is nothing more glorious
for a Prince, than to make his People hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.
<note n="*" place="margin">Nulla Major Principis Gloria, quam fecisse feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem &amp; satisfecisse Inopi.</note>The glory of storm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Towns and acquiring
Victories is common even to
Barbarians. But to conquer
one's self, and renounce one's
own Interest; to give Repose and Peace
to the World, is the proper Character of
an Hero. The People of <hi>France</hi> will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
cease to give a thousand Benedictions
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:44397:231"/>
and a thousand Praises to the Memory
of <hi>Philip the Good</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy;</hi> his
Hate and his Vengeance appeared just,
since he armed against the Murtherer of
his Father: Glory and the Reasons of
State seemed to forbid him to think of a
Peace, since he might promise himself assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Conquests by the Union which he had
made with a puissant Monarch. Yet for all
this, out of a pious Consideration of the
Publick Calamities, he stifled his Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and by one so great a Mercy, he
rendred himself a thousand times more
glorious than his Son, who was so terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and who fought so many Battels. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Conquerours have thought to gain
immortal Glory by their Arms, who in
the next Age have been
treated as<note n="*" place="margin">As <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> has been by <hi>Seneca, Lucan,</hi> and <hi>Quintus Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi>
               </note> Robbers and
Pyrates. War is never tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
glorious, but when it is
founded upon Justice; which
also ceases when one may have a reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Satisfaction without it, and when
the Interest of the State demands a
Peace.</p>
            <p>It would be no difficult matter to prove
that even those Princes who are at present
most concern'd in this War, will find
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:44397:232"/>
their truest Interest in a Peace, if they
have any regard to that of their own
Subjects, which is the only
<note n="a" place="margin">Salus po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli superma lex esto.</note>true Interest of State.
Misery is general, we are a
alike ruin'd by Friends and
Enemies: To take any Place you must
shed the Bloud, as it were, of all the
People, who being seduc'd to the last
Extremities, mourn secretly amidst the
Songs of Triumph that are publickly
commanded.</p>
            <p>In effect, they are so far from being the
better for the Conquests of their Prince,
that they are more burthen'd with Taxes,
and Imposts, than ever. The Towns
and conquer'd Provinces do not afford for
the most part half the necessary Expence
to fortifie, and desend them. They must
pay Contributions to their Enemy, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
free Passage and Quarter to Souldiers,
who almost every-where live like Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Robbers. The present posture of
Affairs seems to give us some indications of
the approach of the day of Judgment,
whose knowledge God hath reserved
wholly to himself; that it will be the last
War of the World, foretold us by the
Scripture, and which will for ever take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:44397:232"/>
the Power from Princes and People,
of Insuring and Supporting each other.
Yet this is not all, they must either receive
Souldiers, or pay Winter-Quarters, which
destroys all they saved from the Pillage of
the Campaign; perhaps they commit all
these Excesses, to teach the People not to
fear Death, in robbing them of all they
have to keep them alive. But it is to be
feared, that this Despair in
the end may produce some<note n="b" place="margin">Maxime metuenda despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantium auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, tanquam a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerrimi morien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium belluarum Morsus.</note>
ill effects; that it may set the
People upon looking for ease
from their Burthens else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where;
or at least that in
this Conjuncture, when the
Pope labours for a Peace, they will se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
his good Intentions in spite of
their Masters who would oppose them.
When the Popes heretofore made use of
the Ecclesiastical Thunder for their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Interest, the greatest part of the
World never heeded it, because their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ought to be employed to edifie, and not
to destroy: But if at this day the Holy
Father would make use of the Church
Censures against the most obstinate Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers
of Peace, which is the Source of all
Impieties, 'tis to be presumed, that so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:44397:233"/>
an Action would draw down the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of Heaven, and procure the Applause
of all Mankind.</p>
            <p>It may be objected, perhaps, That the
Interest of State, and Prudence does make
Princes defer Peace, in order to weaken
a growing Enemy, whose Power, unless
prevented, may occasion a common Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage:
As for example, the <hi>Allies</hi>
seem to have some reason not to accord so
soon with <hi>France,</hi> hoping that time
may give them some Advantages, to
reduce her to such a condition, that she
may not be in a capacity to hurt them.
But this reason alone is not sufficient to
continue the War, no more than it would
be to begin it; 'tis from Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and not from Violence, we must
expect a Remedy against the
fear of an uncertain Evil<note n="c" place="margin">

that have written about Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiks, obliges him to make
a Reparation. 'Tis but too
often seen, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part of Soldiers pretend
a License for want of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
paid; and that all parts
are much embarras'd at
present, to furnish their
Troops with Subsistence,
and that they will be more for the future.
2. When a Prince suffers, or permits Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines,
and the Violence of Soldiers, he isob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to make'em good: We may alledge
here, what heretofore<note n="b" place="margin">Tom. 4. cap. 13.</note>
               <hi>Gerson</hi> said in the presence of
the King of <hi>France, Tu ea
non agis mala, verum est sed ea fieri per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittis
&amp; suffers. Sic Deus judicabit <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
&amp; dicet, non te alii, sed infernales Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aboli
te cruciabunt.</hi> How then can these
Soveraigns that make this present War
dispence with these Obligations, or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments?
they know well enough, that
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:44397:235"/>
where-ever their Troops pass, nay, tho'
it be in a Friend's Country, that they leave
nothing behind them, that they can carry
away; that they mow the Corn when it
is green, and plunder both Women and
Children, and commit oftentimes Crimes
yet more enormous. Perhaps it may be
objected, That all these Disorders do not
come to the knowledge of the Prince;
but yet he is not less guilty before God
because he ought to inform himself exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and remedy the same by his presence.
With what hopes can a Prince offer his
Prayers to God, when he knows, that in
quitting a point of Chimerical Honour,
he might prevent Pillage, Violence, Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Sacriledge; that he might put
all Christendom in a state of Peace, and
defend her from the Assaults wherewith
the common Enemy threatens her; that
he might establish the Glory and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, so much prophan'd by the
Violations of War; and that he might
hinder an infinite number of innocent
People from being expos'd to the last Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
and insupportable Outrages.</p>
            <p>It is not possible but that such preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Reasons must move the Christian
Princes to search after Peace. But 'tis not
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:44397:235"/>
enough to have bare Inclinations towards
it; Piety obliges them to establish it with
Industry, and to take the most proper and
ready Measures for so great and good a
Work.</p>
            <p>The best and most assured Method
that can be found on both sides, is to
speak freely their Grievances and Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
without losing the time in the
discussion of Preliminaries and Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
and not pretend an Indisposition on
purpose, or some default of the Equipage
of a Plenipotentiary, to retard the Effect
of his Commission. Every one ought to
do himself Justice in the Tribunal of his
own Conscience, as well as his Enemy,
and offer him a Reparation of the Wrong
he has done him; after the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of that holy Prince,<note place="margin">Heze'iah, 2 Kings. <hi>ch</hi> 18, 19.</note> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
broken an Alliance which
he had made with an idolatrous
King, was not asham'd to condemn and
submit himself to render a just Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Which was the cause that God, who
had punish'd him for this Breach, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
heap'd upon him infinite Prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>After the rate that the Ministers assist
at the Assembly of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> they seem
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:44397:236"/>
to be very far from entertaining so pious
an Intention. They are so slow in coming
thither, that in all probability they will
not be slower in moving Questions, and
yet they may be more slow in resolving
them. They may make it last, if they
please till the Diet of <hi>Ratisbonne;</hi> and
perhaps amidst these Delays there may
happen some Accidents that will exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
their Spirits so much, that they'll
break it as they did the Treaty of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whenever there is sincere Inclination
to treat of Peace, the Points are always
propos'd before, by a secret and private
Mediation, and concluded in the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
of Princes: The sending of Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
and Plenipotentiaries, and Publick
Conferences serve for nothing else but
show. This appears by the most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Treaties of this Age, and particularly
that of the <hi>Pyrenees;</hi> so that we may easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
see that <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> where they know
not yet what they mean to propose, will
cause us a long time to expect a Peace;
during which every Party endeavours to
make the best Advantage of the present
Conjuncture, and flatter themselves with
Successes they think to find over the rest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:44397:236"/>
The Allies imagine perhaps, That <hi>France</hi>
in the end will be distress'd by the vast
Numbers of its Officers and Soldiers; and
that the poverty or natural inconstancy of
the People will cause a speedy Reverse of
its Prosperity. On the other side, <hi>France</hi>
confides in the Union of its Forces, in the
good Fortune she has always hitherto had,
and in the Dissention she endeavours to
spread among her Enemies; and in fine,
trusts to the Revolution of Affairs, that
the <hi>Port</hi> or <hi>Poland</hi> may produce in the
North and the Empire itself.</p>
            <p>All these Conjectures are very ill ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
both on one side and t'other, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
through the ill Conduct of one Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
These three Years they have been
framing them to no purpose, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the judgment of the best Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
each side has more reason to fear
than to hope. In the mean time, for these
uncertain Hopes, all Christendom under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes
infinite Devastations, which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
cease, but by the end of the War. We
must expect Peace from God only, and
believe; that at last he will move the
Hearts of these Princes to hearken to his
Voice and the Groans of the People.</p>
