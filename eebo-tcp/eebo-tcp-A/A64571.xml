            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

greatest grace where it is, and too much for the best nature where it is not.</p>
            <p>This difficulty, and the excellency of walking with approbation in the works and offices belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all and every one, in their particular place and calling, I am the more willing to note, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I have heard divers Godly persons complain, that having had in the Single estate much liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

for sweet and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refreshing conversings with God, being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards maried, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Family to look to, they have been so forced from them, as to find a great losse in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with God, in regard of that frequent enlarged and un-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted communion with him which they formerly enjoyed. But let not such who would fain be

<pb facs="tcp:98815:6"/>
than the <hi>Using</hi> of them: They therefore that shew forth the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of their former religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous performances, do not lose, but make a gainfull exchange, They do but come from the <hi>exercises</hi> of Religion, to the <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,</hi> which is the end, ornament, perfection, and complement of all Exercises.</p>
            <p>Its true as the Apostle saith, <hi>He that is Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maried</hi>

               <hi>careth for the things belonging to the Lord, how he may please the Lord,</hi> that is, having not other things to care for, he is more free for it; He doth not say that every one that is maried taketh that care, or that if a man be once maried, he taketh it not, but onely that the Un-maried have an advantage, and may do it more and more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:98815:7"/>
Again, <hi>He that is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried</hi> careth for the things that are of the World, how he may please his wife, <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 32, 33, 34.</note> but then this is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that he performs a good office in it, his Care is not his Sin but his Duty; and every Duty hath its comfort and reward; Yea that care and sorrow which women are called to in the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed estate, hath this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort assured to it, that
<pb facs="tcp:98815:8"/>
(their continuance in Faith, Charity, Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and Sobriety being supposed) <hi>they shall be saved in Childe-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note n="b" place="margin">1 Tim, 2. 15.</note>
               </hi> that is, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious and patient performance of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and undergoing the afflictions of Child-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing women, is their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per way to Heaven; for that's the work which God hath committed to them to do, <note n="c" place="margin">Mark 13, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>4.</note> and the
<pb facs="tcp:98815:8"/>
thing wherein the reality of their Religion is to discover it self.</p>
            <p>Yet here there is need to annex a Caution, to wit, that though the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal duties of religion be <hi>lessened</hi> by mariage (I mean to some, for divers that had lesse li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty before mariage have more by it,) I say, though religious duties be lessened by mariage, yet they must not be <hi>left;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98815:9"/>
Christians, whether ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried or unmaried must still <hi>acquaint their hearts with wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Eccles. 2. 2.</note> and be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to preserve their Fellowship with God; They that can be content with an Husband, with a Wife and Children (and all Worldly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations) without God, never knew what it was to enjoy God. Nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, They that have
<pb facs="tcp:98815:9"/>
Wives must be <hi>as if they had none,</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 29.</note> that is, in regard of their readinesse for the service of God. A Husband must not say, <hi>I have maried a Wife, and therefore I cannot come,</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Luke 14. 20.</note> Nor the Wife, I have a Husband, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God cannot have me; but though they be not able to take (as some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maried may) every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, yet they must
<pb facs="tcp:98815:10"/>
not neglect those they may take, nor make themselves lyable to that most sad Charge of <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king light</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 22. 5.</note> of Gods Ordinances and gracious invitations.</p>
            <p>But the Gate growes wide for so little an House (although it may be reckoned a part of the House, I shall hasten therefore; If any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire why I publish this at this time, it might be
<pb facs="tcp:98815:10"/>
enough for me so aged) to answer, Because every man should do what good he can while he hath time; yet something more may be said in regard of the present time, wherein the great God (whose Works are like Himself) by rare providences, I say, rare and admirable providences, both because so <hi>high</hi> and so <hi>dry,</hi> hath in such sort altered and bettered the state of
<pb facs="tcp:98815:11"/>
things amongst us, that our rightfull, gracious and accomplished King is returned unto us, which, if our high sins, our broad and spreading prophaness, and deep secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity do not hinder, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth unto us an happy Settlement. Now, as times of trouble and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution detain and deter from mariage, so times of peace (albeit mariage should have some further
<pb facs="tcp:98815:11"/>
and greater reason than National rest) I say, times of peace and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment, give encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently make these and the like Scripture-dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions seasonable for the rendring of it more holy, and thereby more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.</p>
            <p>And to say all, though this advice reflect on the maried estate, yet it is not so appropriated to it,
<pb facs="tcp:98815:12"/>
but that there is use of it, as there is of that godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and regular Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it perswades unto, in every estate: It is <hi>Christian</hi> as well as <hi>Conjugal</hi> counsell, and though it be composed for, and contrived into the maried condition, yet (that estate being so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive) much of it may serve indifferently for Christians in every Condition.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:98815:12"/>Desiring thy prayers (Christian Reader) that the Author of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell (or rather the weak Instrument) may be Himself the Observer; I rest,</p>

               <note n="a" place="margin">Hebr. 13. 4.</note> And they fall below the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and worth of <hi>men,</hi> (and much more of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>) who quarrell that

            <p n="2">2. The honour of the maried estate is preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while the bed is kept without being defiled either by <hi>falseness or fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness.</hi>
