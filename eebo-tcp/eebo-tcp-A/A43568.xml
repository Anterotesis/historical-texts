            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Worthy SIR, MADAM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Presume to affix your Venerable Names in the Frontispiece of this Treatise, not upon my own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, or upon any such interest I can challenge in your Worships, being much unknown to you; but as acting the part of the deceased Author, who had upon great reason conceived a very high estimation of you, as I doubt not but your respects to him were reciprocal, being grounded both upon long acquaintance and experience of each other, his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of you with grateful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb facs="tcp:34951:3"/>
of your multiplied kindness to his person and family in my hearing, and his affectionate prayers for you, were clear testimonies that you were engraven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his heart; and if his unparallel'd mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty had permitted him to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any thing to the Press, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less his cordial affection would have issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it self in such an Epistolary inscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But since I am necessitated to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his place in handing these Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to the World, I prostrate this expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Orphan at your feet, and question not your candid reception, and resolute protection of what was the genuine product of his mind and mouth, which I will confidently assure you these Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises are, both for matter, method, words, without the least addition, substraction, or alteration, being taken out of his own notes as he preacht them, writ at large with his own hand.</p>
            <p>The matter of these Sermons is of greatest moment and importance; fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental truths they are [of the gift of God in our blessed Redeemer, and Christs Lordship and Soveraignty] which are
<pb facs="tcp:34951:3"/>
truths of the first magnitude, most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, like wool and corn, the staple-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of this Kingdom; like bread and salt that must be set upon the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; like ground-Cells upon which lyes the weight of the fabrick; these are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive and extensive truths; without this gift sinners had not been pardoned, accepted; without this Lordship souls would wander and rebel; the former brings us into favour with God, the latter conquers rebellious wills, subdues enemies, regulates Saints, and crowns them with glory. The manner of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling these subjects is plain, exact, nervous, and very pathetical, which took great impression on the hearers vvhen first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered with the lively voice of that fair spokesman for Christ, whose heart was much taken with this lovely and beloved Lord, and took great delight to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to poor sinners. which he did with great advantage and success, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he became a spiritual father of many children, whom he begot in the bonds of the Gospel. Indeed he excelled others
<pb facs="tcp:34951:4"/>
in other subjects, but in this he excelled himself, especially in this swan-like song, which savours of Heaven, and seems to be calculated for the height of <hi>Sion,</hi> to be sung by that heavenly host in the praises of our dear Redeemer.</p>
            <p>But neither do these weighty subjects, nor the lively colours wherein they are set off, need my recommendation; nor yet the Authors gifts, graces, industry, fidelity, and other imitable properties, well known to you and all that were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him, need at all be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by me, at least at this season, his singular accomplishments and conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shine too bright to be darkened by any black-mouth'd <hi>Momus</hi>; as his soul and body are beyond the reach of Satan and Sorrow, so his name is above any just censures and calumnies.</p>
            <p>I make bold to put these <hi>Posthumous</hi> works into your hands; may your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships in the first place reap the benefit, and by your experiments thereof in your souls, and conformity thereto in your lives, incourage others to come and see
<pb facs="tcp:34951:4"/>
how good our Lord Jesus is; this is a lovely Song of one that could play well on an instrument; may your hearts eccho to this Gospel-tune; here's solid food well cookt, rendred delectable with the sweet sauce of acceptable words; may your stomacks be keen and sharp, and nourisht by it to eternal life. These are goads and nails fastened by this master of assemblies (now rewarded by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster) given out by one shepherd; may Gods Spirit fasten them as a nail in a sure place upon many consciences; I have then attained my ends in this underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; may God be thereby glorified, and souls edified, we have enough. The Lord bless you both, and make you rich bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings to your Country in your publick, domestical and personal station and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Lord drop down this choice gift into your laps and hearts, that you may give up your selves to him again as his bored, devoted servants for ever. God Almighty, that hath been the stay of your Youth, be also the staff of your old age, and maintain you as choice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
<pb facs="tcp:34951:5"/>
of his glory in the land of the living, and in a good old age conduct you through the valley of the shadow of death, into the land of life; so prayeth</p>

            <p>IT is an astonishing Providence that in such a day of Epidemical sinning, general fears of approaching Iudgments, and great necessity in most places, God should thus weaken our strength, undermine the fabrick, by cutting off so many faithful Shepherds in so short a space, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in seeming as if he would make a way to his wrath. But as your dark parts have more need of such faithful Watchmen; so you are most emptied, God having of late renewed his witnesses against you, and broken you with breach upon breach; before your eyes were fully wiped for one loss, another follows at the heels, like <hi>Job</hi>'s messengers, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the sad tidings of the death of another gracious Minister, and this last is not the least, under which you lye bleeding. It is true, on his account that's gone, you have no reason to lament, God hath put a blessed end to his torturing pains of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, perplexing thoughts of heart, and indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble labours in the Ministry, and crown'd him with glory; the sharper was his passage, the sweeter is
<pb facs="tcp:34951:6"/>
his present repose; he finds himself abundantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded. God made great use of him here, and hath now taken him home to himself. His afflictions, temptations, oppositions, were above the ordinary rate, which as they assimilated him to his Master, so they promoted his greater usefulness here, and fittednes for heaven; the lintel-stones and pillars of the new Ierusalem, suffer more knocks of Gods hammer and tool, than the common side-wall stones; God wearied him out of this world, and made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven welcome; wish him not here again, but labour to improve this dreadful breach, by remembring his Doctrine, imitating his exemplary practice; and understanding Gods design in this so amazing stroke, search out that <hi>Achan</hi> that hath troubled your camp; lay to heart sin, reform your lives, live up to the Doctrines you have been taught; and do these in particular which are here presented to your view, and I am confident will be acceptable to you, though wanting the warming-accent of his lively voice, which was full of sparkling spirits; you must see his face, hear his voice no more in your solemn assemblies; but yet this <hi>Elijah</hi> as he mounted up to heaven in a chariot of fire, dropped down this paper-mantle amongst us, which by the spirit of grace concurring, may divide the swelling-waves of <hi>Jordan;</hi> I mean, separate betwixt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious souls and those abominations which at this day overflow all banks and bounds. Oh that Gods Spirit may by these conduits convey spiritual life and marrow into your souls, that you may live, though Ministers die; they die civilly, naturally,
<pb facs="tcp:34951:6"/>
may you live spiritually, eternally. This servant of God spent himself as a candle to give you light; if ever it might be said of a mortal man, as of our Saviour, <hi>The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up,</hi> it may be said so of this choice servant of God, who spent and was spent for souls; who counted not his life dear unto him, that he might finish his course with joy; in labours more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant. But I purposely wave what concerns his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son at present, leaving a rough draught of his smooth life to a fitter season.</p>
            <p>All I shall add is, to give a brief account of these ensuing Treatises: As to the printing of them, though <hi>Solomon</hi> caution his Son against making and reading many Books, <hi>Eccles. 12.12.</hi> yet that only sounds a retreat to luxuriant wits in a scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling age, as to writing upon some subjects, or for vain glory, but doth not simply condemn writing Books, which hath been the key of discipline, an Herauld of the Gospel, and a notable mean to propagate true Religion. As for these discourses upon common subjects, I pickt them out of a vast bundle of variety of excellent discourses, upon such accounts as these.</p>

               </note> Christ preacht much in Parables, and this way sweetly instills Truths with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and clearness into the mind and affection; so that <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s caution be well regarded, that they be not stretcht too far: He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanceth in leaven; I may instance in this gift of God: Iesus Christ is not so a gift, but that he is also a Lord, not to be ruled by us, but to rule us: <hi>To us a Son is given,</hi> Isa. <hi>9.6.</hi> but how? <hi>that yet the government might be upon his shoulder.</hi> As he is the Lords Christ, so he is Christ the Lord, who will rule where he rests, and reign where ever he is received; he will be Lord as well as Life; a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster as well as a Treasure; he will sway his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous scepter over us, as well as vouchsafe his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

benefits to us; he expects we should be his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants as well as his friends; we must be the Lords <hi>Nethinims,</hi> given to God; yea by our selves, as we expect this blessed Donative from God; he that will not be ruled by his golden scepter, shall be crush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his iron rod. And as Iesus Christ is a gift, so he is food, bread of life, heavenly manna; yet this must not be stretcht too far; for in this he is contrary to ordinary corporal food, for though he feed souls, he turns them (not they him) into his holy, heavenly nature. Christ as the gift of God is the matter of this feast; Christ as Lord is the master and maker of this feast. All this must be understood suitable to the majesty of the Son of God, and according to the nature of Metaphors; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise saith <hi>Cyprian, If they were the same, they were not examples, but the things rather which they illustrate.</hi> But all these similitudes fall infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely short of the perfection of him who is above finite excellencies, <hi>[Nec similitudinem substantiae in facturis suis habere potest ille, qui factor est omnium.]</hi> All I shall add further on this account is that caution of his in a like case, <hi>[Et jam hoc loco mundior auditus requiritur &amp; purior sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,]</hi> Let your senses be raised to spiritual objects.</p>

Have you stifled all those convictions you have had under his Ministry? And have you not reason to fear that Gods Spirit will strive with you no more?

Did you look about you as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons unconcerned in Prayer, Sermons, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate workings of his soul for you? God knows, and you shall know, there hath been a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet amongst you; he hath washt his hands from the guilt of your blood by faithful warnings, your blood be upon your own heads: yea, may not his blood come to be upon your heads? Yea, may not the guilt of the blood of the Son of God be required at your hands? And have you worn out man? are you not content to weary men, but will you weary out God also? Shall Christ weep over you as over <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and say as <hi>Luk. 19.42. If thou hadst known, even thou at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now

Thus he that was rich and Lord of all, became so poor in the days of his flesh, as to ask a cup of cold water, and that of a stranger, and one that denies him with scorn and disdain. The woman answers him readily and roughly, <hi>How is it that thou being a Iew ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est water of me which am a Samaritan?</hi> (and the reason is annexed either by the woman or Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist) <hi>for the Iews have no dealings with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans.</hi> He doth not mean no commerce at all (for the Disciples were gone to buy meat) but not to ask or receive courtesies.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34951:16"/>
in imitation of that at <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; therefore they were excommunicated by the <hi>Iews,</hi> who accounted them wicked and profane: Likewise the <hi>Samaritans</hi> thought themselves polluted if they touched a <hi>Iew,</hi> so they mutually hated and despised each other. Christ in the Text is not moved to anger with these terms of hostility; but proceeds to preach the Grace of God, and power of his Spirit, <hi>If thou knewest the gift of God, &amp;c.</hi> The woman still persists in contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and first chargeth him with promising more than he was able to perform, <hi>The well is deep, and thou hast nothing to draw with</hi>; for the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Samaritans</hi> held it a pollution to use each others vessels.</p>

O what contradictions of sinners did he endure! how long is it ere Christ can make men willing to imbrace Gospel-offers and terms of mercy! He proves himself to be greater than <hi>Iacob,</hi> by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the difference between this Mystical and Spiritual water springing and refreshing to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity (which <hi>Iacob</hi> could not give) and that which <hi>Iacob</hi> gave his Sons, which could only quench a present thirst.

Questionless the woman knew well enough that Christ speaks of spiritual water; but because she despised him, she esteemed all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises as good as nothing. 'Tis high time Christ should now bid go call her husband, having born with her perverse answers all this while; he now smites her with the sense of her own sin, and his divine Majesty, before whom she had deported her self so securely and audaciously; so are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident sinners to be wounded that they may be healed, and that the only way to deal with such as are obstinate and dally with heavenly things, is to convince them thorowly, and to awake them from their security and carelesness in so great an interest as their own salvation: She knew that she lived in sin, yet her conscience could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake till a Divine hand seemed to touch the wounds thereof: Here also the tender mercy of Christ is to be observed; he said not, Go thou Adultress and call thy partner in sin, thy preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded husband, that you may hear your dooms; (as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10.) but he mildly stileth him husband whom he knew to be an adulterer, that she might neither presume any longer to contest with the searcher of hearts, nor despair of his mercy, whose lenity in repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving spake him merciful to cure and amend, not busie and malicious to find fault and accuse. Hereupon she gave him some more reverence,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34951:17"/>
calling him a Prophet, and he fully reveals him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to her, to the conversion of her and many other <hi>Samaritans.</hi>

            <p>One general Doctrine ariseth from the whole Text, as it stands related to the Context: <hi>That Iesus Christ is meek and gracious, slow to anger, and full of compassion, bearing with the ignorance and folly, perverseness, and resistance of them he intends to save.</hi>

            <p>How often did this woman provoke him? how long did she withstand him? what femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine artifices doth she use to elude, breaking jests, making captious fallacies, as one disposed to slight and jeer whatever he spake, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet he would take no denial from her, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented his gracious design, as one that heard not. O the unutterable treasure of Grace in Christ which all her provocations could not overcome!

We must be touched with the knowledg and sense of our maladies and poverty, before we will seek the remedy. Therefore the Lord inviteth not the drunken but the dry; not the full but the hungry, that they may eat and drink. To what end should Christ be sent unto us with the fulness of the spirit, unless we were empty? and 'tis not enough to feel our wants, so as to see our need of help from another, unless the hope of present or near help be added thereunto; because if we only see and feel our wants, we should do nothing else but groan under our miseries, and pine away with sorrow; but this is true and profitable know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Grace of God, when we know that the same is offered to us in Christ, and that it is reached unto us by his hand, and so our hearts are inflamed with vehement pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passions and desires after it.</p>

            </p>
            <p>All I purpose to do in the prosecution of this Doctrine, is to shew the excellency of this gift, and then make Application.

that fair tree of life, the branches whereof cannot for the narrowness of the place have room to grow within the huge and capacious borders of the Heaven of heavens!

I cannot better express what he is, than by telling you I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press him. Yet something I shall endeavour to speak of his inexpressible worth under the notion of a Gift in these particulars. Christ and Heaven cannot be praised Hyperbolically. No danger of excess, speak I as much, think you as much as we can of Christ.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Christ is a most free gift; we use to say <hi>what's freer than gift</hi>? I may well add, What gift freer than Christ? whether we respect the giver, or look on the receiver, 'tis easie to judg that this gift is absolutely free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deserved.

love; there is a wonderful and astonishing <hi>Philanthropy,</hi> kindness and love of God towards man appearing in his giving Christ, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. It is not the gift many times, but the love and good will of the giver that makes it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in the eye of the receiver.</p>
            <p>Now Christ is a most excellent incomparable gift, flowing out of a bottomless boundless foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of pure and dear love, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He so loved,</hi> that is, so admirable was his love, that it cannot be expressed, nay it far exceeds our highest conceptions. Gods love was herein as himself, infinite, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible and everlasting; in the womb of this love Christ was conceived, and thence brought forth. When God made the world, he intended to give an evidence of his Power in ordering and governing all Creatures (even the most ungovernable): He manifests his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wisdom, he appointed the Lake of fire and brimstone to declare the severity of his Justice; but he gave his Son to be by his own death the Redeemer of lost sinners; and herein his purpose was to demonstrate to the world the transcendency of his love. This is the highest expression and fullest demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his love to the Creature, not only that ever was, but that ever can be; for in this love God only acts to the uttermost; he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shewed so much of his Power, Wisdom and Wrath, but he could have shewed more.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34951:24"/>
But he hath no greater instance of his love than Christ, to give such a Son for such sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners! O the superlative, matchless, unlimited love and grace of God, transcending the reach of the highest finite capacity! He had done exceeding well for man as he made him at first, for he put him into a very good estate, stampt his own Image upon him, made him above all other Creatures to be his favourite; but he foolishly sinned and fell, and lost all his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness. Well, what did God now do, did he let man alone, shut up his bowels against him, fall upon him with his utmost wrath? Did he say, Nay since it is thus, let him even rise as he hath fallen; since he would be so foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish as for a trifle to break with me, let him die and rot, and perish for ever, I'le do no more for him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O no! not such a word or thought did pass from the gracious God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his miserable Creature. But will he pardon him without satisfaction? no, sin shall be punished, but the punishment shall be laid on his Son; O the height of Justice! and so the sinner shall be acquitted; O the depth of mercy! There is more of mercy in pardoning this way, than in absolute pardoning. Meer pardon and salvation it self had not so much of mercy and love in them, as what was in giving Christ. 'Tis more for a King to put his Son in the Traytors stead, and take the Malefactors chains and suffer, than just to pardon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God might have redeemed us
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34951:24"/>
another way, but he could not shew so much love another way.</p>
            <p>God gives many rich gifts and royal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to his people, together with Christ, as so many tokens and pledges of his love: But herein is the very top and <hi>zenith</hi> of love, the greatest evidence imaginable of Gods bounty and goodness. <hi>God commendeth his love towards us</hi> (as unparallel'd) <hi>in that when we were sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Christ died for us, Rom.</hi> 5.8. Herein he lays open and naked to us the tenderest bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of mercy and love; infinite goodness here makes free love swell without it self, like a boundless River impatient of its banks; 'tis a love that could not flow within its own chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel; O! the boundless breadth, the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less depth of the love of God in Christ! a Sea of love is nothing, it hath a bottom; a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of love is nothing, it hath a brim; but infinite love hath no bounds, 'tis unfathom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, unsearchable, and incomprehensible.</p>

grace and love to all his elect. He must needs be rich, who sets up and enriches so many thousand Bankrupts, that had not only wasted their goods, but sold themselves into slavery and bondage; he pays their ransoms, buys out their liberty, and purchases Crowns and Kingdoms for them. It would beggar all the Angels in Heaven to pay down the ransom of one soul, yea to purchase the pardon of one sin: The redemption of the soul is precious, the soul of the meanest man alive, is of more worth than a world, as he himself tells us, who went to the price of souls: What then shall we think of Christ who saves so many millions of souls? Hence in Scripture, the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est things on earth are made use of, to sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow out the riches of Christ. Under the title of wisdom, he saith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.18, 19, <hi>Riches and honour are with me, yea, durable riches and righteousness.

            <p>Could we give you a particular view and account (but that's impossible) of every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and all the high perfections that are in Christ, you would find him precious in all the parts of his Mediatorship, in his person, in his natures, in his offices, in all his gifts and graces. Look on him as Mediator, and there he shines forth most gloriously, and appears to be the most peerless and precious thing in the world; as Prophet, he is most precious. <hi>Enoch, Noah, Moses, Elisha, David,</hi> &amp;c. were excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and precious men in their times, but were types of Christ; he as far excels them, as the substance doth the shadow: He is Prophet, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, by way of eminency and exellency above all other Prophets; they spake to the ear, he to the heart; they searched out the mind of God, he came out of his bosome, and saith, <hi>Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom, I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi> Prov. 8.14.</p>
            <p>So as Priest he is most precious; this office is the most excellent part of his mediation; he could never have opened our eyes as Prophet,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34951:26"/>
nor ruled our hearts as King, had he not died for us: O, the death and blood of Christ this Lamb of God! how precious! of what infinite value! The death of a Man is more precious than of a Beast, of a King than of many Men; of Christ more than a thousand Kings. Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of Rams, and ten thousand Rivers of Oyl had been nothing to the price Christ paid. See in the <hi>Hebrews</hi> how far Christs Priesthood excels all that went before him: He alone is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Priest, offering but once, sufficient for all, gone to Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he is Sacrifice, Priest, Temple, Altar, and all in one; <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>How precious is grace! one dram of it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than all the treasures in the world. Now he is the fountain of it, full of grace and truth; so Truths, Ordinances; so Comforts, Promises, all that belongs unto him, very precious.</p>

To say nothing of his bodily features, though Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians report Christ to be very beautiful as man: As God, he is the perfection of beauty; 'tis true, beauty is not formally in God, yet it is in him eminently and by way of Analogy; for if beauty be good, and a desirable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the creature, it must needs be in the infinite God, as the perfection of the effect is in the cause. If Roses and Lillies be fair, he must be fair that created them: but in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind, if the Sun, Moon and Stars be beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, the lovely Lord that made them must contain their beauty in the highest measure; beauty in God is the amiableness and loveliness of his nature, and all his infinite perfections; as this pleasantness offers it self to his own understanding, and the understanding of men and Angels. So that as bodily beauty satisfies the eye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so acts on the heart to win love: So the Truth of the Lords nature, and all his Attributes offered to the understanding and mind, drawing from them admiration and love, is the beauty of God. The Prophet speaks of it with admiration, <hi>How great is thy beauty!</hi> Zech. 9.17. <hi>David</hi> makes it his one thing,

When <hi>Moses</hi> was to behold God, he was hid in the Rock while his glory passed by, and that Rock was Christ. You sometimes see beauty that ravishes the heart of the beholder in the children of men; O! but Christ is fairer than the Sons of men, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45.2, on which place <hi>Austin</hi> thus descants. <hi>To us Believers the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bridegroom seems to be most fair every way; fair in Heaven, fair on Earth, fair in the Womb, fair in the Cradle, fair in his Miracles, fair in his Doctrine, fair in his Stripes, fair on the Cross, fair in his very Grave.</hi>

But this gift of God is so admirable good for our use, that he seems to be fitted and dressed, and made all for our use; in regard of his Mediatorship, that office is wholly for us and our benefit. He was born, lived, died, rose again, sits on Gods right hand as Advocate, and comes to judgment for our sakes and for our good. He is God and Man, Prophet, Priest, and King. A Saviour, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, a Surety, an Advocate, a Mediator, Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all for use to us lost and perishing sinners. He is a jewel indeed, but not locked up in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to be made use of by none. Christ is shadowed forth in Scripture by Head, Vine, Milk, Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> now what more necessary
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:34951:29"/>
and useful to men than these? Who could reconcile us to God when we were enemies, but Christ in his blood? <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. Who could justifie us in the sight of God, when we were sinners, but Christ by his righteousness? <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26. Who could repair the Image of God in us, and restore the life of Grace when we were dead, but Christ by his Spirit? How could we ever put off the old man, and put on the new, die to sin, and live unto God, were it not for Christs death and resurrection? Had not he sanctified himself for our sakes, we had never been holy; had he not born the punishment we deserved, we had never been hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: was not he given, that whosoever believed on him might not perish, but have everlasting life?</p>
            <p>Tell me, you that think Christ is a person that may be well spared, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who could ever have opened the eyes of the blind, the ears of the deaf, or healed a wounded spirit? Who could have bound up a broken heart, opened the Prison-dores, broken off the chains of bondage, and proclaimed liberty to the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives? Who could have satisfied infinite justice, born the weight of Gods Wrath, removed the curse of the Law, made reconciliation for ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and brought in everlasting righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? certainly none but Christ.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Christ is a most gainful gift. He is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute and universal gain; Christ is the most profitable gift to the soul that can be injoyed, yea that can be imagined; nothing more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34951:30"/>
nothing more enriching than Christ is to them that have him. There is no man rich without Christ, neither is there any poor that have him; a man without Christ is a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly bankrupt; but one that hath Christ is a wealthy King: He that hath Christ, hath all; he that hath not him, hath nothing. Christ is not gain as worldly things are profitable in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to their ends, as wealth is good to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply want, food to maintain life, clothes to keep off cold air, a bed to rest weary limbs; but Christ is a rich and inestimable treasure to the soul, without reference to any further end than himself; he is to be desired even for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, his merchandise is better than silver, and his gain than fine gold, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.14. Man knows not the price of wisdom, of this wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.18. It cannot be valued with the gold of <hi>Ophir,</hi> with the precious <hi>Onyx</hi> and <hi>Saphire</hi>; there is no talking nor bidding in this Market, so precious is this corner-stone. <hi>No mention shall be made of corral, or of pearls, for the price of wisdom is above rubies: The to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold,</hi> &amp;c. Job 28.18, 19. What the Apostle saith of godliness, is very true of Christ, he is profitable for all things, and he is gainful at all times, and to all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, both for soul and body, for the life that now is, and the life that is to come, and for ever. The salvation of the soul, is better than the gaining of a whole world; <hi>What is a man
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34951:30"/>
profited if he gain the world and lose his soul?</hi> How much more gain then is he by whom a world of souls are saved!</p>
            <p n="9">9. Christ is a most suitable gift. He suits all persons, and all conditions, whether a man be poor or rich, young or old, noble or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble, learned or unlearned, bond or free, high or low; the richest have need of him, as well as the poorest, and the meanest may have him as well as the greatest; be in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or relation soever, he is suitable to all. And O! how suitable is Christ to the lost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of all men by nature! man is an enemy to God, Christ is the Peace-maker; he is a Captive, Christ is a Redeemer; he is lost, Christ a Saviour; he is sick, Christ a Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian; he is dead, Christ gives life; he is poor, Christ gives riches; he is weak, Christ is strength; he is guilty, Christ hath righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; he is filthy, Christ hath blood to wash him in; he is naked, Christ hath a Garment to cloath him; he is hungry, Christ is the Bread of Life; he is thirsty, Christ gives li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving waters. O! how suitable, how accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is Christ to poor sinners! He that hath Christ may say, here's strength to support me, Wisdom to direct me, Power to protect me, Gold to inrich me, Cordial to comfort me, and Fulness to supply all my wants: He is made all things to all men, eyes to the blind, feet to the lame, and a Father to the poor. Christ is for every turn, and fitted for every
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:34951:31"/>
condition; be it what it will or can, he hath a sufficiency relative and suitable to it; there's no disease but this Physician can cure it; no Case but this Counsellor can resolve it; no Enemy but this Champion can conquer; no difficulty but this mighty Saviour can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Christ is a most seasonable gift. Every thing is beautiful in its season: all other things have their several seasons; as food is good, but 'tis when a man is hungry; so cloaths when a man is naked, Physick when a man is not well; Musick when a man is merry: now Christ is never out of season. A gift bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the nick of time is most valued; <hi>Bis dat, qui cito dat,</hi> 'tis a double favour when done in time: the right timing of things, is a high point of practical wisdom, and puts a beauty and value upon all things. Now considering the state of man (as lapsed) Christ was the most seasonable gift that ever the world heard of. This is set forth in the Parable, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.30, <hi>A certain man went down from Ierusalem to Iericho, and fell among thieves, which strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him, wounded him, and left him half dead, &amp;c.</hi> The man that travelled was our first Parent <hi>Adam,</hi> the Thieves were the Divels, who deprived him of all, wounded him, and left him not half, but wholly dead: the Priest and Levite came by and looked on, but passed away, neither would nor could help him; but the good <hi>Samaritan</hi> (so esteemed by the <hi>Iews</hi>)
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:34951:31"/>
Christ he comes, had compassion on him, went to him, bound up his wounds with his own soft hands, poured in Wine and Oyl, and brought him to an Inn, and took care for him that he should want nothing towards his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; takes the whole charge of it to himself. What can be imagined more seasonable, than for such a compassionate Physitian to come by, look on and undertake when a man lyes bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dying in the high way? <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 16, beginning, doth excellently express the season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of his coming to us; Christ is sent to us, when we are at an utter loss, can neither help our selves, nor all the world do us any good, give the least relief: When he comes into the world, it is said, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hadst no pleasure:</hi> all the world was at a loss to please God; What shall man do, and whither will he fly for help? <hi>Then, even then, said I, lo I come (in the volume of thy book it is written of me) to do thy will, O God.</hi> Christ comes in the very nick of time, when all mankind was ready to perish, that goodly tribe of the Creation was almost utterly lost; <hi>I looked and there was none to help, then my own arm brought salvation,</hi> Isa. 63.5. The year of my Redeemed is come, now is the accepted time, now is the day of salvation: So when a poor convinced sinner is at a loss, and knows not what to do, crys, I am cut off for my part, my hope and my
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34951:32"/>
strength is perished, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> even despairs of help from all other, then comes Christ, then ariseth the Sun of Righteousness with healing in his wings; in the thickest darkness day breaks forth; when the Bricks are doubled, then comes <hi>Moses: In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. Christ is a most satisfying gift. He that creates the heart, can fill and satisfie it: in worldly things the more a man enjoys, the more he desires. If God heap temporal gifts on men till there be no room for more, give them never so many left-hand blessings, still mans heart is like the grave, that never saith it is enough; or the daughters of the Horsleech unsatisfiedly crying, Give, give. But there is this excellency in this gift, that he that hath received it, hath enough; and no wonder, for he hath all. <hi>Esau</hi> saith, <hi>I have enough, my Brother</hi>; and <hi>Iacob</hi> said, <hi>I have enough,</hi> Gen. 33.9, 11. Interpreters observe, that word which <hi>Esau</hi> useth (translated <hi>enough,</hi> signifies <hi>much</hi>) and the word for <hi>Iacob</hi>'s <hi>enough,</hi> signifies <hi>all. Esau</hi> had much, but <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> had all. And the reason he renders is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God hath dealt graciously with me, <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet omnia qui habet habentem omnia,</hi> in Christ is a full store house, and well-spring of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to make up whatever defects are in other things. The Sun can make day without the Stars; such as have Christ can say (as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10.) <hi>We are, as poor, yet rich; as having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:34951:32"/>
yet possessing all things:</hi> in respect of the world we are poor and contemptible; but in respect of our incomes, and havings in Christ, we are rich and honourable, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. <hi>All things are yours, whether Paul or Apollo, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, things present and things to come, all are yours, for Christ is yours, and ye are Christs.</hi> O this sweetens every relation, this suffices in every condition, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Whosoever drinks of the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst</hi>; which must not be understood of feeling the necessity; but of falling into the intire priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods grace; not as spoken against de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, but against driness; or rather it's exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive (not of desires after more of Christ, but) of all inordinate desires after all other things: As <hi>Bernard</hi> says, <hi>Nihil ita temperat si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, that abundant plenty, which observed, will not suffer him to envy the most prosperous sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: he may answer Satan when he offers worldly glory and preferments, as that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man did the Prophet, <hi>I live among mine own people, I have enough.

            <p n="12">12. Christ is a most lasting gift; yea, he is everlasting. This is the flower, top and bound of all the forementioned Excellencies, without which they would be scattered and lost. He is a most free, full and kind gift; a most rich, precious, and lovely gift; most necessary, useful and gainful gift; most suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, seasonable, and satisfying. Add this one more, and it compleats all, He is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the same for ever.</p>
            <p>They that once have him, shall never lose him; none shall ever be able to pluck them out of his hands, nor him out of their hearts; the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and propriety is inseparable, and insuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; other things (like flowers) decay and wither in our hands, and the excellency that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:34951:33"/>
is in them goes away, but Christ is always fresh and precious, and always ours. 'Twas a just complaint that was made long ago a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Heathen gods, <hi>O faciles dare sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma deos, eadem<expan>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us be perswaded to receive and embrace this transcendently excellent gift. O that we may be enticed and allured by what hath been said of the incomparable worth of this gift of God, to a hearty reception and particular application of it to our selves; we can hardly see an excellent person, but we are wishing him for our friend and companion; nor hear of a precious Jewel, or fair estate, but we are secretly coveting it were ours; and can we hear of him who is Excellency it self, originally, the spring and standard of all excellency in others, whose name alone is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and not wish, O that it were mine? O that this blessed Christ were my friend, my father, my head, my husband, my lot, my portion? Who will give me to drink of this Well of water springing up to eternal life; this fountain of living waters, this pure river that flows from the Throne, from the heart of God. Canst thou hear so much (though infinitely short) of his worth, and not desire him? Dost thou indeed believe that all this is true, and yet thy soul not hunger and thirst after him? Are these faithful sayings, and is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34951:34"/>
not he worthy of all acceptation? Is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a rational creature to hear of such a bottomless treasure, of such a boundless plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and not covet the enjoyment of it? O man! where are thy wits? What's become of thy reason? Art thou a man or a bruit? If thou knewest the gift of God, and what it is that is offered thee, thou wouldest scorn the highest honours, the sweetest pleasures, the greatest riches, yea trample upon all the Crowns and Kingdoms of this world for it. It's an inestimable priviledg that thou art a creature capable of so vast a happiness; it's the astonishing wonder of Heaven and Earth, that God would give a Son, such a Son to be thy Saviour! what could he give more or better? and it's a special favour that the Gospel hath been sent to thee, to reveal this great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, to offer this excellent gift to thee; and now when it is tendered, wilt thou refuse it? Wilt thou neglect and undervalue Christ? or wilt thou not rather give it all humble and thankful acceptance? Reflect upon those twelve incomparable properties and characters of this gift, methinks though I have spoken but little, yet I have said enough to one that will let his reason judg, to draw out thy most vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment desires after this gift. Yet I will add these Considerations more.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Consider who it is that offers this gift to thee. Christ is the gift of God, in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:34951:35"/>
and eminent manner so; therefore were there no other reason, thou must take it.</p>
            <p>The worth, greatness and excellency of the Donor, is an argument to move us to take the gift; we regard not so much what it is, as from whom it is: If thy Father or thy Prince offer a gift to thee, would'st thou, durst thou deny it? If thy dearest Friend should send thee a token, wouldest thou slight it? Now look on the best of men, in all his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in himself, relations to thee, and thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on him; consider in him all that faithfulness, goodness, greatness, or any thing else that would most move thee to take a gift from his hands; and there is infinitely more cause to accept this gift at the hands of God. The great and glorious God, the King of kings, Lord of lords, and God of gods, the blessed Majesty of Heaven, the first Cause, the original Being, self-sufficient, all-sufficient, absolutely, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, uncapable of any addition, or diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, humbles himself to offer this gift to thee. 'Tis the high and lofty One that inhabits E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, to whom millions of ages are but as one day; who is boundless in his Being, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent in his Power, unsearchable in his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, unconceivable in his Grace, and infinite in all his Perfections. He who dwells in that light inaccessible, before whom the Angels the highest of Creatures vail their faces; to whom the whole Creation is nothing, less than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and vanity. This God is he that made
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34951:35"/>
thee and all things of nothing; supports all things, influences all things, and is all things, and infinitely more than all things. He is the God in whose hands thy life is, and who is acquainted with all thy ways; who is of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite holiness, and perfectly hates all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; of unlimited power, able to avenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self on thee every moment, and turn thy soul and body into Hell. Of infinite justice, a jealous God, who will by no means clear the guilty; against whom thou hast sinned and been an offence and provocation to him all thy days, and is thine enemy according to strict justice; 'tis he whose favour is life, and whose frown is death and hell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The height of a person that bestows a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and the meanness and unworthiness of the object on whom it is bestowed, as it doth exceedingly advance and heighten the Grace and goodness of him that doth it; so it migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily aggravates the sin and danger of him that despiseth and refuseth it. <hi>See that ye refuse not him that speaketh from heaven, for if they escaped not, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 12.25.</p>
            <p>O what infinite grace and goodness is it for this great God to take so much notice of man, and do so much for him! What admirable, wonderful condescension is it, for the most High, the God of Heaven and Earth, that God whom the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain, to manifest such respect to vile pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted dust and ashes, yea to them that are
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:34951:36"/>
rebels and traytors against his Majesty, and thereby worthy of hell, as once to offer his blessed only begotten Son to us as a Saviour: Well may we with <hi>David</hi> be amazed at it, and cry with admiration, <hi>Psal.</hi> 8.14. <hi>O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth, who hast set thy glory above the heavens.</hi> And adds, <hi>What is man that thou art mindful of him, and the son of man that thou visitest him?</hi> That so glorious a Lord should mind poor, silly, weak, frail, dying man, sinful, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, polluted, wretched, miserable man, could not but affect his heart with admiration and astonishment! If a friend or neighbour, thy equal, do offer thee a kindness (though but small) how ill does he take it, if thou accept it not! O what horrid indignity dost thou offer to God, what dishonour is it to all his Attributes if thou refuse this transcendent gift!</p>
            <p n="2">2. Consider what it is that is offered to thee, when this gift of God Jesus Christ is offered to thee. To explain this fully would require the tongue, nay exceed the skill of an Angel; none can tell what Christ is, but Christ himself; all those particulars I mentioned, speak somewhat of him, but not the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand thousandth part of that excellency that is in him. This let me tell thee, when Christ is offered to thee, the greatest good that ever was, that ever will be, that ever can be, is offered thee. There never was, nor can be
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34951:36"/>
the like offered thee; 'tis the best gift that ever was received or given in the world; more than Heaven and Earth, more than the whole world, more than millions of worlds is offered thee. He who is offered to thee, is the Well of Salvation, the Lord of Life, the Author of all Consolation; an Hive of sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, a Paradise of pleasure, an Heaven of joy. He is the richest grace, the dearest love, the surest friend, the highest honour, the vastest treasure, the exactest beauty, the chiefest good, the fullest felicity. He is a compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive and universal good, not one but all good, riches, honours, pleasures, friends, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, health, life, earth, heaven, the world, the other world, all the good of both worlds, and infinitely more. He is so needful a good, that thou art undone without him; that's the misery of hell, yea the very hell of hell. He is so plentiful a good, that thou art per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly happy in him, thou needest no more; he is the Heaven of heavens; he is the only sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table satisfying good, which suits the nature and fits and fills the desires of the rational creature; he can enlarge and suit all thy facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, answer and relieve all thy necessities, fill up all the capacities of thy heaven-born soul. He is an everlasting good, who will stay with thee, and stand by thee, when all other good things shall fail thee. Wilt thou not now say, <hi>Lord whom have I in heaven but thee, and there is none on earth that I desire in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:34951:37"/>
of thee?</hi> I'm sure he is such a gift as thou wouldest have if thou knew what thou dost; as thou shouldst have if thou understood thy self, and answeredst the ends of the Gospel; as thou must have, if thou be not eternally mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable. O what dost thou think of having this gift as thine own? sure by this time, thy heart may melt into astonishment, and thy bowels be moved within thee; and thy soul cry with the Martyr in the flames, <hi>None but Christ, none but Christ:</hi> Well, what saist thou to him? is not Christ worthy to be accepted and embraced? Is it not worth the while to have him for thine own? Whatever thou thinkest now, when death shall close thy eyes, thou wilt be of this mind when thy soul stands quivering on thy lips, ready to take its flight into the unknown regions of the other world; when Devils will be waiting to seize upon it, (as soon as ever it leaves the body) to hale it to the unquenchable flames of Hell; when thy friends, relations, shall be weeping and wailing by thee, but unable to afford thy dying body the least cordial, or thy departing soul the least comfort: Ah, what wilt thou do in such an hour which is hasting on thee! Without Christ, on whom wilt thou call, to whom wilt thou flee? where wilt thou rest or hide thy self from the wrath of the Lamb of God? Believe it, though thou maist live without him, thou canst not die without him, without infinite horrour and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34951:37"/>
confusion. Is it not thy greatest concern to have him for thine, to whom thou must stand or fall for ever? from whose mouth thy sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of eternal absolution or condemnation must come? and who shall judg thee to thine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable state of life or death, of salvation or damnation; though thou maist think thou canst do well enough without him at this day, having what heart can wish in the world, yet what wilt thou do at that day when the world shall be on a flame, if Christ be not thine?</p>
            <p>Once more; let me intreat thee to answer, Art thou willing or not to have this gift? What say'st thou, canst thou find in thine heart to deprive thy precious soul of such an inestimable treasure, and to leave it naked in the other world, to the cruelty of Devils, and the dreadful curses of the Law, and intoler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able wrath of God?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Consider on what terms thou maist have this gift for thine; thou maist possibly think that so boundless and bottomless a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure must cost thee very dear, and the price must be exceeding great of a pearl so match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and incomparable; much will be expected from me, and I shall never be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass this gift. But know (sinner) to thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, all that God requireth of thee, is only to accept Christ heartily and thankfully; canst thou desire any thing cheaper? wouldest thou
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34951:38"/>
desire him, to fall lower in his terms? Nay, is it possible to do so, and make thee happy? How can he be thine, unless thou receive him for thine? that is a poor favour, a vile gift, that is not worth acceptance; what more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, take him for thine, and he shall be thine? canst thou both deny him and enjoy him? refuse the gift, and have it too? Our emptiness is the best plea, and self-denial our best price; thou givest more for thy bread, thy clothes, thy house, and for the needful comforts that are for the support of thy frail body, than thou needest to give for this great and glorious Christ; thou payest money for them, but thou maist have him without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and without price. One would think that the equity of the condition should both amaze thee and allure thee; God doth not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ell, but give his Son; he knows thou hast nothing, and he would only have thee to know that too, and be humbled under the sense of thy spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual poverty; thou maist lose a gift by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to buy it, <hi>Thy money perish with thee,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis said indeed, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Come buy, &amp;c.</hi> for the word is used here improperly, for to get, attain, receive, procure, furnish your selves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.8. and elsewhere; something must indeed be done by those that partake of Christ, they must come and accept of him. And something parted with, but of no valuable consideration in gain to God; and what would be prejudicial to us and inconsistent with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:34951:38"/>
this gift. But God requires not of thee things impossible; he doth not say, If thou wilt remove mountains, dry up oceans, stop the course of nature, create worlds, and Christ shall be thine; as great, as good as he is, he doth not say, If thou satisfie my justice, answer the demands of my Law, merit my love and favour, then shall he be thine: No, he himself hath done all this for thee; all that he desires is, that thou wouldest receive him that hath done so.</p>
            <p>Neither doth he require any thing of thee that is barbarous and cruel, as the Heathen Deities did of their worshippers; he says not, if thou wilt lance and mangle thy body as <hi>Baal</hi>'s Priests did; or if thou wilt go bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot in sackcloth long and tedious Pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as the <hi>Papists</hi> do: If you will offer your Children in the fire, and give the fruit of your bodies for the sin of your souls, as some did; then he is yours. Nor doth he require of thee chargeable and costly, as to offer the best and chiefest of thy flock in sacrifice to him; nor as he once did of the young man, to sell all that thou hast and give it to the poor: Nor as Idolaters, lay down such a part of thy estate for thy pardon. But he only requires that thou first thirst, and then buy; be sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of thy want, and poverty, and nothingness, and then open an empty hand and take Christ as thy Saviour and Lord; and wilt thou not do it? Canst thou deny him and thy poor

soul so reasonable, so equitable a request? as the Servant said to <hi>Naaman, If the prophet had commanded thee some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much more then, when he only saith, wash and be clean?</hi> So say I to thee, If God had commanded the greatest things imaginable, wouldest thou not to thy power have done them, that thou maist injoy the blessed Son of God for thine? How much more then, when he only saith, Take Jesus Christ as thy Lord and Saviour, prize and love him as thy Saviour, obey and honour him as thy Lord, and he shall be thine for ever? do but as much for him, as the covetous man does for his wealth, as the ambitious man for his honour, as the voluptuous man for his belly; they give their highest esteem, their choicest affections, and their greatest service, to that which they take for their God, their chief good: And surely Christ is more worthy hereof, and will requite thee best for them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Consider how God offers this gift to thee; his manner of dealing with thee in this is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful; he offers Christ most really, means what he speaks, and most tenderly and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately: He not only offers Christ to thee, but invites thee to him; what canst thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire more in a gift or benefit, than to have it heartily offered, and be invited to take it? He offers Christ without grudging, falshood, or
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:34951:39"/>
equivocation; with an open heart, that he may shew how willing and cordial he is to part with this gift. He invites us to take him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17, <hi>Let him that is a thirst come, and whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will let him take the water of life freely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Nay, he shouts and calls aloud, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.1, <hi>Ho every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money, come ye, buy and eat, yea come buy wine and milk, without money, and without price.</hi> Had he once tendered Christ, it had been infinite mercy; but to entreat us to accept him, to perswade and move us, as one that would not be denied, that's admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. 2 Cor. 5.20, <hi>We are embassadors for Christ; as though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christs stead, be ye reconciled to God.</hi> And he commands us to receive Christ his Son, and makes this the chief, and (as it were) the only thing he requires of us, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.23; and inforceth his just command with most severe threatnings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.25, <hi>See that ye refuse not him that speaketh; for if they esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he expostulateth with men, <hi>Wherefore do you spend your money for that which is not bread? Isa.</hi> 55.2, and adds protestations of his loathness that any soul should perish, <hi>Why will you dye? anger is not in me: why should the flame consume the stubble? what could I do more? what iniquity have ye found in me, &amp;c</hi>?
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:34951:40"/>
He complains and laments most sadly, when men neglect and slight this offered gift, <hi>Why will ye not come to me, that ye may have life? He came to his own and they received him not,</hi> John 1.11. <hi>O Ierusalem, Ierusalem, thou that killest the Prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! Matt.</hi> 23.37. Yea, with very vehement pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions he bewails and weeps over them that pity not themselves, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.42, <hi>If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong to thy peace, &amp;c.</hi> Those tears and mournings over <hi>Ierusalem</hi> for her hard heart and contempt, have been, and are still over thee. He upbraids men with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so much as this, and threatens no such woes in all the Scripture, as against such as refuse Christ, <hi>Matt.</hi> 11.20, <hi>Wo unto thee Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razin, wo unto thee Bethsaida, &amp;c.</hi> Jer. 13.17, <hi>Wo unto thee, O Ierusalem, wilt thou not be made clean? when shall it once be</hi>? He is never so angry with any, as with them that despise this love, and refuse this offer, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.21. <hi>Matt.</hi> 22.7. He was very wroth when the invited guests would not come. So <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.40, with those Husbandmen that took his Son and killed him; and those Citizens (<hi>Luke</hi> 19.27.) that would not have him reign over them, are destroyed as enemies. And when all this will do no good, men will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded

nor allured, but hang off and keep at a distance; he goes away (as it were troubled) and wishing it had been better. He swears and pawns his life on it, that he would not have them perish, has no pleasure in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. <hi>O that they had hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to my commandments, then had their peace been as a river, and their righteousness as the waves of the sea.</hi> Isa. 48.18 Psal. 81.11. <hi>But my people would not hearken to my voice, Israel would none of me. O that my people had hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways, I would soon have subdued their enemies, I would have fed them with the finest of the wheat, with honey out of the rock would I have satisfied them.</hi> O the compassionate pangs of Gods bowels of infinite mercy towards poor sinners! <hi>O quam stupenda pieatas! quam mira Dei dignatio! quem regare debuimus, ut nos recipere dignaretur: ab ipso rogamur, ut ad eum venire dignemur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were (one would think) enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with us to accept this gift with joy and thankfulness to consider how incomparably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent the gift it self is.— But God adds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable benefits with him to draw us to this acceptance; as life and favour with God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.35. <hi>Whoso findeth me, findeth life, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth favour of the Lord.</hi> Recovery of Gods image, freedom from bondage, communion with God, liberty of will, pardon of sin, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er against sin, deliverance from Satan, peace

            <p n="5">5. Consider, why God offereth Christ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee; for what end is he thus sollicitous about thine acceptance of this gift; do not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake me, nor deceive thy self by thinking that because God out of his infinite pity to his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable creatures, is instant and urgent with them to accept of Christ, therefore he hath any need of thee, or seeketh his own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness therein. I tell thee, if thou hadst no more need of Christ than he hath of thee, thou maist let him alone. No, it's purely for thy good, for thy real and eternal good that he offers his Son to thee. He needs thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice no more than he doth the service of the Damned, or of the Devils; and he knows how to make use of thee for his own glory as he doth of them, if thou foolishly reject this offer of his Son to save thee. Had he a work to do, he needs not thy help; he might have made nobler creatures than the present race of mankind to glorifie his Grace, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute his will, and have left thee and all <hi>Adam</hi>'s posterity to glorifie his Justice. <hi>Thy righteousness will not help him,</hi> Job 22.2, 3. <hi>Nor thy wickedness hurt him,</hi> Job 35.2. He

expects no gain by thee, looks for no requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; he offers this gift to thee, not that he may be blessed by thee, but that he may be bountiful to thee; it's thy good, not his own that he looks at: The felicity of accepting is thine own, and the misery of neglecting is thine own. <hi>Prov</hi> 9.12, <hi>If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thy self; but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.</hi> Men call Customers to them, and press them with many arguments and entreaties to buy, that they may inrich themselves by their Customers; but God calls men to buy of him, not to inrich himself (he is as rich, and perfect, and happy as he can be) but to inrich themselves. <hi>I counsel thee</hi> (saith Christ to his lukewarm Church) <hi>

Now Brethren ponder it seriously, it is wholly for your own good, that you may escape wrath and death, that you may attain Heaven and life, that God is pleased once more to offer Christ to you. He gives his Son to this end, that you may be saved, to bring you into the state of Sons, and into a right to Heaven and Glory. Had he given Christ only to rule over you with his Scepter of righteousness, it would have been an excellent gift, and no small pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg to be Subjects to such a Prince, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for such as were bondslaves of Satan by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;

but he gives Christ to save and redeem us. Something, yea very much of God is in the Creation, much of God in his common provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; but most of all, yea whole God in the redemption of man. If a Physitian should come to us who would heal us of all our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases (suppose we were an Hospital of unsound persons) would he not be most acceptable to us? What more acceptable to a poor man than wealth? or a naked man than clothes? or to an hungry man than bread? a slave than freedom? all this and infinitely more is Christ to us. Now all that is required of us in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the obtaining of all these benefits, is to believe in Christ; and what is believing, but receiving Christ, as he is offered to us in the Gospel? <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.12. What is thy mind now about this offer? what dost thou resolve on? wilt thou have Christ this Gift of God, or not? Is there any thing unreasonable in his demands? any thing defective in this offer, or in the gift? is not Christ fair, or good enough? is he not rich and honourable enough? is there any want of love or loveliness in Christ for thee? What hath been said of him, will silence all these and the like objections. What canst thou say? is it an indifferent matter whether thou take this or not? doth not thy eternal felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty depend on thine acceptance of him? what sayest thou? shall Christ be thy Lord, or the Devil?

            <p>I know not what other answer you can ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally make to all that hath been said, to perswade your acceptance of this gift of God, but that either you have it already, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to know how you may make it your own; I shall therefore, to prevent mistakes in the one, and to give assistance to the other, first direct you to try your selves, whether Christ be yours or not, and then how to attain propriety in this excellent gift, whereby
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34951:43"/>
you may be happy to all eternity.</p>
            <p>Let this be your most serious inquiry, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have indeed received this gift of God or not. Is Christ yours? can you truly say with the Spouse (<hi>Cant.</hi> 2.16.) <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his</hi>? If you can but once say, and speak true, <hi>I am my beloveds</hi> (as <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.3) you may with the same breath conclude, <hi>my beloved is mine.</hi> Have you ever made a full, intire, affectionate, deliberate and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served resignation of your selves unto him? have you given up your heart, head and hands, all you are, all you have, unto Jesus Christ, and that constantly? Then he is wholly yours. For God never gave his Son to any, but such gave themselves to the Lord, and are new creatures, and sound believers. But more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly:
<list>
                  <item>1. If you have received this gift of God, you do very highly esteem of him, and prefer him above all other things in the world. To them that believe, Christ is precious, they have a good opinion of his worth and excellency, have him in greatest honour and estimation, as <hi>Hinsius</hi> saith the word <gap reason="foreign">

Do you truly in judgment and affections, account it your chief happiness to enjoy the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ? is he the chiefest of Ten thousand in your eyes, altogether lovely?

                  <item>2. Are you willing to receive Christ as Lord as well as Saviour? submit to him as King, as well as accept of him as Redeemer? and come not only for ease and rest, but to take his yoke upon you, and become his Servants? Is Christ your Lord and Master to guide and govern your hearts, and thoughts, and lives, by his Laws and Statutes? and is it your ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary purpose, desire, and endeavour to obey him, even when he commands the hardest du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and those which most cross the desire and interest of the flesh, and 'tis your sorrow when you break your resolutions herein? then Christ is yours: But if you are only content to be saved by him from Hell when you dye, in the mean time, he shall command you no further than will stand with your credit, or pleasure, or worldly estate and ends, and did never heartily consent that he should rule over you,

nor resign up your souls and bodies to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned and disposed by him, nor took his Word for a Law and Rule of your thoughts and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but if he would give you leave, you had rather live after the world and flesh, than after the Word and Spirit: he is not yet yours: though you may in words call him Lord and Master, yet in your works you deny him. He is his Friend and Disciple that keeps his commandments, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.7, 14, but they that would not hearken to his voice, would none of him, he gave them up to their own hearts lusts, <hi>Psal.</hi> 8.11.</item>
                  <item>3. Have you received the Spirit of Christ?

If you have this talent, this pearl of great price, you will be far from laying it up in a napkin, or locking it up in a cabinet, but be much in commending him to others; 'tis their delight to be speaking of the beauties, excellencies and perfections of their beloved: as the Spouse whose whole language is all love, and her heart is so full, that her lips overflow with the mention of the Excellencies of Christ, <hi>My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest of ten thousand, &amp;c.</hi> This is my friend, and this is my beloved, <hi>O ye daughters of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> Cant 5.19.</p>

Some define faith a most affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate accepting of Christ as Saviour and Lord: It is (say others) a saving-grace wrought in the heart of a sinner by the Spirit and Word of God, whereby he being convinced of his sin and misery, and of the disability in himself, and all other creatures to recover him out of his lost condition, not only assents to the truth of

the promise of the Gospel, but receives and rests upon Christ and his Righteousness therein held forth for pardon of sin, and for the accepting and accounting of his person righteous in the sight of God for salvation. I'm sure the Scripture makes this to be our accepting of Christ, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believed on him might not perish, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Joh. 1.12. <hi>But as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as received him, to them he gave power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.</hi> We come to him and feed on him by faith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.35. And he dwells in our hearts by faith, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.17. The Woman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to take the man for her Husband, upon that the Matrimonial union follows, he is hers, and she his; so the sinner consenting to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and obeying of Christ (which is one main act of faith upon which he is made his): This is one of faiths royal excellencies, nothing puts a greater worth and glory upon it than this great effect.

with an idle inoperative faith; have such a faith as purifies the heart, works by love, overcomes the world; you must heartily close with whole Christ, according to the Gospel-offer; let your trust, relyance, confidence for pardon, life and salvation, be grounded upon him, and him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. You must cast your selves upon his alone me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, renouncing every thing in your selves; holding forth the two hands of faith, with the one to lay hold on Christ, and with the other to resign up your selves to Christ.

            <p>I shall add a word of admonition and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous warning, to them who have not yet, nor are now resolved to accept this incomparable gift of God; and that in the words of the Apostle, <hi>See that ye refuse not him that speaks from heav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now that Christ is freely offered to you by the Gospel, if you set at nought his counsel, and make light of his invitations, and receive the Grace of God in vain, it had been better for you, that you had never been born, or never heard the Gospel. Now that God hath proclaimed terms of peace, and shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so unwilling that ye should perish, that he gave his only begotten Son for you, and to you, and exacted nothing from you but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, that ye might have in him eternal life: If you still refuse this gift, and reject this counsel, remaining under unbelief, it doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly aggravate your sin and judgment, it makes your sin above measure sinful; your sin is inexcusable, your condemnation unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and your punishment will be intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Consider what you do, and be wise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be too late; you exceedingly dishonour God, undervalue Christ, gratifie Satan, Sin most inexcusably, and undo your selves utterly.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:34951:53"/>1. If you do not receive and improve this gift when offered in the Gospel, you do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly dishonour God; What greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach is there amongst men, than to refuse a gift offered freely out of love, without any ground, motive, or occasion, from the party that is to have it? or deny to accept of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation to a great feast, or fair estate, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated and solicited to take it? 'Tis a sowr un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerliness, and sawcy proud presumption, to prescribe on what terms they will have, or when they will not be beholding to their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors. 'Tis a great dishonour to God, that vile sinful dust and ashes, will not accept of his gracious offer of his Son. If a King should come to a Prisoner condemned by the Law to death, and lying in Chains, and offer to set him free, or put his Son in his stead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but he so loves his bondage, and hugs his chains that he will not be delivered.

               </gap>ious Attributes of God,</p>
            <p>His Truth; He that receives Christ, gives as much glory to the Truth of God as possibly he can; he sets to his seal that God is true, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.33. But he that receives not this gift, believes not God, and so makes him (who is truth it self) a lyar, because he believes not the record which God gave of his Son, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.10. O what horrid indignity is this to the most faithful God!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:34951:54"/>His Mercy, wherein he delights, which as it is above all his works; so this of bestowing Christ on men is above all his mercies. It is no less than spurning at bowels of mercy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4, and despising of riches of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>His Power; 'Tis a sad diminution of the glory of his Power and Soveraignty; as if he could not do what he hath promised, if we accept his offers: or what he hath threatned if we refuse it. <hi>Abraham</hi> on the contrary, was strong in faith, giving glory to God, being fully perswaded, that what he had promised, he was able to perform, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20.</p>
            <p>His Wisdom; It's a rejecting the counsel of Heaven, and contemning that unconceivable depth of wisdom, that contrived a way for Mercy and Justice to meet, that his Glory might be advanced, and sinning and perishing man might be saved.</p>
            <p>His Justice, How great is the affront that sinners offer to his Justice, that sinners go on to provoke him with their unbelief and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness; and as it were dare him to punish them.</p>
            <p>In a word, his Infallibleness and Unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness are called in question: when his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promises are not believed and embraced, men judg him a person not fit to be credited: The giving of the lye is accounted the greatest injury and disgrace amongst men; but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is a great injury to God, because he
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:34951:54"/>
stands more upon his word than upon any other part of his name, <hi>Psal.</hi> 138.2. <hi>He hath magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his word above all his name.</hi> And we have more experience of God making good his word, than in any other thing. Thus not receiving Christ doth rob God of his declarative glory, it rifles his cabinet, and takes away his chiefest jewel, even that glory which he saith he will not give unto another.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You do very unworthily slight and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value Jesus Christ. When a gift is offered, if you deny to accept it, you not only dishonour him that offers it, but you disparage the gift it self, you disesteem it as not worthy your acceptance; and is Jesus Christ so worthless and inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a gift, as that thou wilt not take him at the hands of God? O horrible ingratitude! <hi>Be ye astonished O ye heavens, for my people have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted two evils,</hi> (ah these two are thousands and millions) <hi>they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, &amp;c.</hi> Is it not the voice of Christ in the Gospel, Who will have me? Who will receive me? and is it not the Gospel-quarrel, <hi>Ye will not come to me that ye may have life,</hi> Joh. 5.40. 'Tis the greatest folly to set so low a rate on Christ, for he is the sum and substance, marrow and worth of the whole word, and all the works of God, the most excellent glory of all persons and things in the world.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Survey the Word of God from end to end, and you shall find that there is nothing of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency but what is derived from, or reduced unto
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:34951:55"/>
Christ; he is called by one <hi>verbum abbreviatum,</hi> the contracted Word, into which all words are reduced, as the rivers into the Sea; from this word they came, unto this word they tend, and within this word they are all contained. 'Tis observed by <hi>Ierome,</hi> that the sum of all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg is Divinity, the sum of all Divinity is the Scripture; for that is sufficient to make the man of God perfect, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, 17 and every Christian wise unto Salvation. The sum of the Scripture is the Gospel, for <hi>that is the power of God for the salvation of them that believe,</hi> Rom. 1.16. and the sum of the Gospel is Christ. <hi>For these things</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Gospel) <hi>were written that you might believe, that Iesus Christ is the Son of God, and that in believing you might have eternal life,</hi> Joh. 20.31.</p>
            <p>If you consider the Old Testament, it is nothing else but the vail, shadow and promise of Christ; observe all the Types, the Tree of Life, the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> the Ladder of <hi>Iacob,</hi> the Mercy-seat, the brazen Serpent, and all such Mystical Types and Typical figures we read of, what are they else but Christ? take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the substance, and what is the shadow? And not only so, but even all the men of note, <hi>Noah, Isaac, Ioseph, Moses, Aaron, Ioshua, Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, David, Solomon,</hi> Kings, Priests, Prophets, Titles of Dignity, Names of Honour, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever else was ascribed to them, to express their Dignity and Soveraignty, they were only used <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o express those transcendent Excellencies which
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:34951:55"/>
these personal Types did adumbrate, and appear most properly to belong unto this Prince of Peace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. So for the New Testament, he is almost ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, but always intended and implied in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry chapter, verse, line, and word thereof: Take away Christ out of the Gospel, and there remains nothing but empty words: Take Christ out of the History, and it is but a meer Fable; and remove him from the Doctrine thereof, and it falls to the ground, being without a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Take Christ out of the Precepts, and they are not of force, or a yoke too heavy for us to bear. Take him out of the Promises and they are not <hi>Yea and Amen.</hi> The Promises without Christ, are Wells sealed up, bones without marrow. In the Epistles, if Christ be absent, there is no <hi>Grace, Mercy, or Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He is the prime and marrow of all things as well as of words, as <hi>Austin</hi> tells us, having gone through all Creatures, and enquired of them for God, each one of them did answer, I am not he. <hi>Sed per ipsum sum, quem quaeris in me,</hi> but I have my being from him, whom thou seekest in me. So if we view the whole Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and note the particular excellencies of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Creature, we should find that all these are derived from Christ; he is the pearl of the word and of the world. Is there any thing praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and excellent (even in our estimation) which we may not find Christ comprehend the same eminently in himself as the vertue and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:34951:56"/>
perfection of the effect is in the cause. If riches be desirable and excellent, Christ is rich and Lord of all, in him are unsearchable riches, treasures of wisdom and knowledg. If you talk of honours, as riches so honours are his. <hi>We behold his glory as of the only begotten Son of God.</hi> When man was at first created, he was created with honour and glory, <hi>Psal.</hi> 8.5. but Christ is better than man in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive purity and original splendour, not men only but Angels also worship him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.9. <hi>God hath highly exalted him</hi>; he saith not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, God hath highted him, but hath <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, over-high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or super-exalted him, <hi>and hath given him <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a name above all names,</hi> that is real honour above all names, all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, and above all thoughts, and above all excellencies, not only in this world, but in the world to come. <hi>O how excellent is his name in all the earth,</hi> Psal. 8.1.</p>
            <p>If there be any worth in pleasures, as many conceive, here then is an object altogether lovely and delightful; here is beauty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the eye, sweetest musick in his voice to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish the ear, and that which pleases all the senses of the inward man.</p>
            <p>Another esteemed excellency is Wisdom, which <hi>Solomon</hi> saith <hi>exceedeth folly, as far as light exceedeth darkness,</hi> Eccles 2.13. Now herein doth the excellency of Christ chiefly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, for he was <hi>filled with wisdom,</hi> Luk. 2.40.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34951:56"/>
In him were hid treasures of wisdom, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.3. He is the Wisdom of God, and saith, <hi>Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom, I am understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word; there is one excellency more, and but one in this world, far transcending all these, that is, Grace, for that makes a man excellent, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.2, <hi>The righteous is more excellent, more honourable than his neighbour,</hi> Prov. 12.26. and procures a name <hi>better than of sons and daughters, even an everlasting name that cannot be cut off,</hi> Isa. 56.5. But the grace of any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, is but as the drop to the Ocean, in regard of the grace of Christ, who is full of grace and truth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.14. Grace is poured into his lips, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45.2. yea such uncreated grace hath no one.</p>
            <p>Christ is better than health, than wealth, than peace, than pleasure, than wisdom or grace: Christ made ours by his Fathers gift and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, hath all the sweetness, comfort, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of all these in him, and infinitely more, All these are but streams that lead us to the fountain, but beams that guide our eyes to that Father of lights, to that Son of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, God reconciled, God incarnate.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Christ is the first and chiefest of all persons which raises him one degree higher in his super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative excellency. 'Tis reported of <hi>Apelles,</hi> that at his drawing of his rare pictures of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> (among the Heathens stiled <hi>the Goddess of beauty</hi>) that he assembled together the most

beautiful Women of the Island of <hi>Coos,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending in that his own work, their divided perfections: so to conclude this Encomium of Christ, I shall collect the Eminencies of all things, and persons, and beings, and shew that he is the chiefest of all chieftains, the choicest of all choice persons, in Heaven and Earth, God, Angels, and Men; of gods so called, he is the chiefest, nay he stands alone, he is the only true and wise God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. Of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels he is the chief, the Angel of the Lords substantial presence, <hi>Isa.</hi> 63.9. he is the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.16. the Prince an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:34951:57"/>Among relations he is the chief, among shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, he is the chief shepherd of our souls, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4. the good shepherd, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.11. Among Sons, he is the first-begotten Son, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. the first-born of every creature, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15. the first-born among many brethren, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 29. still he hath the preheminence.</p>
            <p>Among Prophets, Priest and Kings, he is the most excellent, and far transcends all others; he is in every respect absolutely perfect; and a superlatively excellent Saviour, so that there is none such, no Saviour besides him; this is the person whom you undervalue and make light of.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By refusing this gift of God, you do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly gratifie Satan, the great enemy of your souls. If a man had conference with the Prince of Darkness, and should make this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him, wherein he might most serve and gratifie him; I am confident it would be his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wish to such a soul, above any thing in the world, that he would keep at distance from Christ, neither come near Him, nor his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, have nothing to do with him. Now will any be so stupid as to gratifie his greatest adversary to his own unspeakable prejudice? Is it not horrible indignity to Christ, monstrous cruelty to the soul to refuse Christ, who hath done and suffered so much for him, and to be led by Satan captive and blindfold into misery? to slight Christs sweet invitations; and yield to Satans malicious temptations? Satan is that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:34951:58"/>
strong man that hath power over all men in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he keeps his goods in peace in the palace of our hearts, and there sports himself in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the design of the souls ruin; sometimes by policy, sometimes by force, he keeps posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.21, 22. And wherein can a man more designedly gratifie Satan, further his wicked designs, and establish his kingdom, yea enlarge his dominion, than by siding with him against Christ, who besiegeth the soul with Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Providences? for Satan knows well enough, that Christs rise will be his fall; Christs scepter will be his destruction; that when Christ a stronger than he comes, he will overcome him, and take from him all his armour wherein he trusted, pull down his strong holds, divide the spoils, and deliver poor captive man out of prison and slavery. O then do not so much gratifie Satan.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If you refuse Jesus Christ offered in the Gospel, you are guilty of the greatest sin and folly that can be. Though for most part, men think not so of it, and accordingly lay it not to heart, yet it is the greatest sin, the sin of sins, and in some sort the only sin of the world. Men commonly think murder, adultery, theft, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness to be very hainous sins, and so indeed they be, but unbelief far worse; for it is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these, and all other evils. Take all the sins that ever were committed against any of Gods just laws, and none is like to this, no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sin can be laid to ones charge than to refuse
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:34951:58"/>
wilfully, and trample under foot the Son of God. Christ promises <hi>to send his Spirit, the Comforter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, and he shall convince the world of sin, because they believe not on him,</hi> Joh. 16.9. he means this sin alone (saith <hi>Austin</hi>) as if not believing in the Son of God were the only sin: Indeed it is the main and master-sin. O beloved, little do you think, who daily sit under the Ministry, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought on by the Word of God, what a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and fearful sin you commit, and dreadful guilt you carry home with you, in neglecting from day to day so great Salvation, in forsaking your own mercy, and in judging your selves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of everlasting life, when Jesus Christ this most precious gift is offered to you, by chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing rather to cleave to a lust, than to Christ bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for ever; and rather to wallow in the mire and mud of earthly riches and swinish plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, than to receive this most pleasant and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent gift; rather to cast away your time in idleness, pride, worldliness and sensuality, than in seeking after this transcendent favour; rather make choice of a life made up of drunkenness, whoredoms, railing at godliness.</p>
            <p>The greatness of this sin appears in this, that it is most directly and diametrically opposite to the most fundamental Doctrine and command of the Gospel; the primary and principal command of Christ, is to believe in Jesus Christ, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.23. When the Jaylor being sadly convinced, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to the Apostles, <hi>Sirs, what shall I do to be saved?</hi> they answered him, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.31<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            </p>
            <p>'Tis a sin against light and much knowledg, a sin against love and special mercies, it binds all a mans other sins upon him, it puts and keeps him under the guilt of all his sins: <hi>Infidelitate manente maneat peccatum omne</hi>; he that lives in unbelief dies in his sins; it makes a mans actions though moral, and spiritual, be sinful, be a man
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:34951:59"/>
never so holy and devout, do or suffer never so much, none of these, nor all, nor whatever can be named or imagined, God will not be pleased with them; for without faith 'tis impossible to please God; yea, 'tis a sin that defiles all a mans outward enjoyments, and temporal good things. To them that are unbelieving, nothing is pure, wife, children, house: In a word, 'tis the height and perfection of madness to refuse Christ; <hi>Quis nisi mentis inops, &amp;c.</hi> Heaven and earth may be astonished, Angels and all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may justly stand amazed at this prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sottishness, and monstrous madness.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If you refuse Christ, you utterly undo your own souls for ever; if ye miss of this gift, ye must expect nothing but misery here, and eternal damnation hereafter: For there is no name under heaven, by which you can be saved. Whatever your formalities be, how fair soever ye carry in the eye of the world, let your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession be never so plausible, 'tis Christ alone that can save you. If you will accept of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, you are in the suburbs of Heaven, there is but a thin wall between you and the land of Praises, ye are within an hours sailing of the shore of the new <hi>Canaan</hi>; when death digs a little hole in the wall, and takes down the sails, you have no more to do, but set your foot down in the fairest of created Paradises; but if you will not accept of Christ, let me tell you the truth, you are in the suburbs of Hell, there is but the cutting of a small thred, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:34951:60"/>
you have your portion with hypocrites and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By refusing Christ, you do no less than put and fix your selves in the state of condemnation. Let not this be accounted as a harsh censure of my own head, for 'tis the Scipture, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that believeth on him, is not condemned: but he that believeth not, is condemned already:</hi> and the reason this sentence is past upon such, is because they believe not on the only begotten Son of God, and the wrath of God abides on them, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.36. We are all lost in <hi>Adam,</hi> and if it be the office of Christ to save them that are lost, they do worthily abide in death who refuse him and his Salvation.</p>

With what love and tender compassion did he beseech me! how did his bowels earn over me! yet I did but make a jest of it, and hardened my heart against all! how glad would he have been after all his studies, prayers, and pains, if he could have perswaded me cordially to accept Christ, he would have thought himself well recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for all his labours, he would have laid his hands under my feet, and have fallen down on his knees to beg of me obedience to his message; and all the entreaties of Ministers are the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatings of God. O how long did he wait! how freely did he offer! how lovingly did he invite! how importunately did he solicite! how long did Christ stand knocking at my door, crying, open to me, sinner: why sinner, are thy lusts and pleasures better than me? is earth better than heaven? why then dost thou delay or deny? wilt thou not be made clean, when shall it once be? O that thou wouldest hearken to my voice, and obey my Gospel! O that they were wise! As one that is loath to take a denial, would not be repulsed. O how would he have gathered thee, and thou wouldest not! shall the God of heaven and earth follow thee in vain from one

place to another? Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die? I would not have you perish. If you go on with your refusal of Christ, you may expect that the hellish gnawing of conscience for this one sin, will hold scales with all the united horrour of all the rest; you will then cry out, O fools and ideots that we were, when we refused so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a gift, so blessed a Saviour! we could then see no beauty in him, nor comeliness wherefore we should desire him; but now how fair and glorious is he, whom we see upon the white Throne! how desirable is his Sacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty! O how amiable is his countenance! how doth he shine with incomparable splendor, above the brightness of ten thousand Suns? What wrong have we done our own souls, that we have deprived of so beautiful and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful an object, as this most sweet and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Saviour? If now we had time and leave to make our choice, we would prefer the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him, (whom we once contemned) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ten thousand worlds. But alas we cannot, the term of mercy is expired, and the time of justice, wrath, and vengeance, so much spoken of by our faithful Pastors, is now come, and now we must be judged to the easeless, endless, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And all our pleasures and delights are gone; O that we had never been born; O that we had been so happy as our horses or swine, which die but once, and fell no more pain for ever; whereas we must be ever dying, and never free from pain and misery. Wo, wo, wo unto us, that ever

We that accounted such an one a precise fool, for his care to receive and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this gift of God, shall groan out this sad complaint, in the anguish of our spirits: This was he whom we had sometimes in derision, and a Proverb of reproach; we fools counted his life madness, and his end to be without honour: now he is numbred among the Children of God, and his lot is among the Saints. Therefore we have erred from the way of truth, and the light of righteousness hath not shined upon us; and as for the way of the Lord we have not known it. What hath pride profited us? or what good have riches with our vanity brought us? all these things are passed by as a shadow, and as a Post that hasts away. O with what infinite horrour and restless anguish, will this conceit rent the heart in pieces, and gnaw up the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when he considers in hell, that he hath lost heaven for a lust, and Christ for a meer sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow! whereas he might at every Sermon, had even the Son of God his own for the very taking, and with him for ever unspeakable joy and glory; yet then neglecting so great Salvation, must now be crying out therefore against himself, as the most raging <hi>Bedlam</hi> that ever breath'd, lye down in unquenchable flames, without remedy, ease or end.</p>

            <p n="2">2. Second Branch of Instruction and Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Such as have received this gift of God must make it their care and business to retain and keep him. <hi>Buy the truth but sell it not,</hi> Prov. 23.23. <hi>Remember how thou hast received, and hold fast,</hi> Rev. 3.3. This was the exemplary wisdom and care of the Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.4. <hi>I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mothers house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.</hi> She came by him hardly, and therefore she will not part with him lightly; it cost her dear to find him, she sought him up and down with tears and pains, and returns with many a <hi>non inventus,</hi> yet at last got him with much hazard and danger, much loss and suffering, and therefore having found him whom her soul loved, she would by no means part with him, nor leave him for the greatest advantages in the world; she knew well that nothing under heaven could countervail the loss of him, nothing in this wide universe, though never so lovely and desirable, could be equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to such a jewel, all the treasures upon earth could not bear proportion to him, nor make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for the loss of him. I know the true Believer shall never lose Christ, because Christ will never suffer him to be lost; but he may do that which may tend to the losing of him, though through grace he shall not be actually lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t; and he may do that which may deprive him
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:34951:62"/>
utterly of the sense, evidence and comfort of this gift, though his propriety in it remain firm and sure. 'Tis true, a Saint shall never be left so to himself, or his sin, as that sin shall bereave him of his jewel, his Christ, but may and often doth steal away the key of his cabinet, his evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and assurance, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.5, 6. <hi>I opened to my beloved, but my beloved had withdrawn himself and was gone.</hi> Thus you see Christ sometimes withdraws himself from them that dearly love and earnestly desire him; for as he is said (when pleased, to gratifie his people with his grace and assistance, strength and deliverance) to come out of heaven his dwelling place, <hi>Isa</hi> 26. <hi>ult.</hi> and 64.1. So he is said to return thither, when he forbears to put forth and exercise his grace, and to shew his mercy and loving kindness to them, <hi>Hos.</hi> 5. <hi>ult. Isa.</hi> 18.4. he is said to hide his face in regard of his special grace and love, and in regard of intercourse and communion with his Church, not totally, but in part; not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and for ever, but for a moment; a small moment, he shortens his hand in his wonted operations, and ceaseth to be so intimate and familiar with his servants, and seems to be a stranger to them and their condition, and this he does for divers good reasons and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Christ leaves them sometimes, because they will not open to him, when he knocks at the door of their hearts, either they are not at leasure, or busied about other matters and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:34951:63"/>
employments, or are too much setled upon their lees; sloath and security hath seized upon them, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He does it for tryal, that he may make an experiment of his Churches love to him, and faithfulness in his service; to see whether his people can abide to be without him, or will serve and follow him, frowning as well as smile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. As a Father may leave his dear Child, and stand behind the door, to see what it will do: So God exercised <hi>Iob, David, Heman, Asaph,</hi> and others; the Wife is tryed in the long absence of her Husband.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To raise and quicken them more to love and desire him; for though the absence of fuel doth diminish the fire, yet commonly the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Lovers doth increase and heighten love, and makes it more impatient and restless, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.8. This made the Spouse sick of love, and her soul failed, she could not bear it. <hi>Isa.</hi> 26.9, <hi>With my soul have I desired thee in the night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. To cure formality in believers, and to remove all trusting to, resting in, or relying on any thing besides himself, and that the soul may not be satisfied with any thing below himself: As a Father sometimes lets go his hold, that the Child may see his dependance upon him.</p>
            <p>The Children of <hi>Israel</hi> were exceedingly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malized in their Devotion, they only looked at the external Sacrifices, but did not frame their doings to turn unto God, <hi>Hos.</hi> 5 6. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he takes this course with them, <hi>They shall
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:34951:63"/>
go with their flocks, and with their herds to seek the Lord, but they shall not find him:</hi> He hath withdrawn himself from them, <hi>i. e.</hi> they shall go after their accustomed manner of sacrifices; but God hides himself, because he will bring them off their formality and security. So if we trust in outward Ordinances, and lay too much stress upon them, the time may come when we shall use them, and seek God in them, and not find him, because of formality.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That he may teach them to live by faith, not to be too much dejected, but believe that he is near to them, but behind the Wall, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.8, 9. He is kept off from the soul by the wall of sense and carnal reason, that the soul may improve his faith in looking over this wall, as <hi>Iob</hi> did, <hi>Iob</hi> 19.25, 26, <hi>I know that my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer lives,</hi> &amp;c. Isa. 50.10, <hi>He will come and will not tarry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That his presence may be more esteemed and valued when re-injoyed; there is often a remisness and abatement in love to Christ, but when he is lost and found again, we shall watch better over our selves, and set a higher price on him than before: we have need sometimes to be taught the worth of mercies by the want of them <hi>(post frigora dulcior ignis)</hi> when we know what it is to want his presence, we learn to esteem it. (<hi>Post tempestatem dulcior securitas</hi>) How sweet is a calm after a storm! Christs favourable Aspect, is more sweet and acceptable when the sun-shine thereof begins
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34951:64"/>
to break forth again, after some black and bitter tempest of desertion. Now since there is some danger of losing Christ in these respects, we had need look to our selves, and do all we can to retain him with us for our help: I shall lay down some motives, and then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, as in the first branch.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To perswade us to this, I shall use no other arguments or motives, but only to tell you what Christ is to the soul, and so it may see what it deprives it self of by losing him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Keep him, for he is thy life; <hi>Whoso findeth him, findeth life,</hi> Prov. 8.35, and 3.18, <hi>She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy is every one that retaineth her</hi>; speaking of wisdom, under which notion Christ is commended to us. So <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Take fast hold of instruction, let her not go, keep her, for she is thy life.</hi> He saith, I am thy life, and the length of thy days, with him is the fountain of life; he is the only well-spring of life, and all blessedness. How sweet is life! skin for skin, and all that a man hath will he give for his life, he'l part with any thing, every thing rather than life. When many of Christs followers forsook, and walked no more with him; <hi>Will ye also forsake me,</hi> said he to his Apostles? <hi>Peter</hi> answered for himself and the rest, <hi>Lord, whither shall we go, thou hast the words of eternal life,</hi> Joh. 6.68. <hi>q. d.</hi> Lord if we leave thee, we leave our life and all our comfort, we forsake our own mercy, and judg our selves unworthy of everlasting life;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:34951:64"/>
had we no other reason, 'tis motive enough to stay with thee and keep close with thee, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that our lives are hid in thee, eternal life, and consequently all that's dear to us, the quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence of all happiness is with thee.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Keep him for he is thy light; how sad and miserable is it to walk in darkness? if you let Christ go, you eclipse your own light; 'tis night when Christ is gone, who is the only Sun of Righteousness, his life is the light of men, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.5, 9. he saith of himself, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.12. <hi>I am the light of the world, he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life, that lights men to heaven, to eternal light and life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the dark thou art in danger of mistaking thy friend for thy foe, and thy foe for thy friend. <hi>Iob</hi> took God for his enemy in his dark and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal state, and Satan may transform himself into an Angel of light, and wofully deceive thee.</p>
            <p>Besides, he that walks in darkness is in danger of two evils: 1. Of falling into sin, into some dirty distemper, lust, or other; if a man walks in darkness without a guide, he knows not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he goes, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.35. he is apt to stumble and fall. 2. Of declining into error, no better way to escape wandring into ways of error, and by-paths of Heresie, than to keep close to Christ, <hi>holding fast the head,</hi> Col 2.19. O then keep Christ.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He is thy rock and refuge, all thy safety is in him, <hi>the Lord is a sun and a shield,</hi> Psal. 84.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:34951:65"/>
and wilt thou in the open field in the midst of thy mortal enemies, strip thy self of thy best armour, and leave thy self naked and exposed, by letting go Christ, who is thy buckler and defence, <hi>Whose name is a strong tower, unto which the righteous flee and are safe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O do not part with thy Sheild whatever comes, that was it Soldiers in old time stuck to above all, and would lose their life rather than it. When Satan, the Flesh and the World, set upon thee, all armed foes, wilt thou not take unto thee, and keep this armour of God? <hi>Psal.</hi> 27.5, In the time of trouble he shall hide thee in his Pavilion, and in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of his Tabernacle shall he hide thee; he shall set thee up upon a Rock: enter into this Rock, and hide thy self in the clefts of this Rock, he will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on him, because he trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in him; the Lord <hi>Iehovah</hi> is the Rock of ages, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26.3, 4.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He is thy strength, the sap and principle of activity and fruitfulness; without him thou can bear no fruit, do nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.4, 5, <hi>For as the branch cannot bear fruit of it self, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye abide in me, and I in you: Without me you can do nothing</hi> that is spiritually good and acceptable to God. <hi>I am like a green fir-tree, from me is thy fruit found,</hi> Hos. 14.8. While Christ is in the Soul, it is exceeding active, vigorous and nimble, kept above sloth

and sluggishness; but when he withdraws him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, how dull and unactive is the soul, and barren, unprofitable! 'tis Winter with it.

               </gap>4. Christ is the strength of his heart, and his portion for ever, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73.25 and therefore he should say with the Psalmist, <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee, &amp;c.</hi> Will you that have such great work to do, so heavy burdens to bear, let go your strength?</p>
            <p n="5">5. He is thy glory and excellency; the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Christian is in Christ; he defaceth and debaseth himself, if he let go Christ. <hi>Isa.</hi> 60.19, <hi>The Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light; and thy God, thy glory.</hi> When a mans glory is gone, what remains? he hath nothing but what he is ashamed of. Prov. 4.7, 8, 9, <hi>Wisdom is the principal thing, therefore get wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and withal thy getting, get understanding. Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee; love her, and she shall keep thee; exalt her, and she shall promote thee; she shall bring thee to honour when thou dost embrace her, she shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: A crown of glory she shall deliver to thee.</hi> So that when Christ is gone, the Crown of our

head is fallen; he is our garment, not only for ornament but use, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>ult.</hi> Put on the Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>Isa.</hi> 61.10, he is a garment of salvation, and robe of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p n="6">6. He is thy meat, thy food, therefore keep him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.35, 51, <hi>I am the bread of life, he that cometh unto me shall never hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.</hi> A body may be better without meat, than a sensible sanctified soul without Christ. A dead body may be long enough without, but a living body cannot endure long without sustenance: if thou be a living Soul, O never part with thy meat, but eat that which is good, and let thy soul delight it self in fatness. No sooner does a man cease from feeding, but he immediately declines and dies. If you could imagine a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever broken off from Christ, and drawing no nourishment from him for one moment, what a withering dying person would he be? O Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, the life, strength, fruitfulness, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, yea, your all is in Christ, and secured by your holding him; if that fail all would fail.</p>
            <p n="7">7. He is thy heat; as the Sun is for the heat, as well as for the light of the world: What a cold frozen world would it be were it not for the Sun? what a cold season does its further distance from us cause in our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon? but the nearer the Sun is to us, the greater the heat, as in Summer: if thy soul

have not Christ to warm thee, thou wilt be starved to death. <hi>If two lie together, then they have heat; but how can one be warm alone, Eccles.</hi> 4.— 11? How can thy soul be warm, if Christ be departed from thee? O what a chilling coldness comes on the Soul, when Christ goes away! what aguish fits and star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving coldness seizes on the whole Soul, and every grace, when this Sun draws in its beams and influences! at the best there will be a <hi>Laodicean</hi> lukewarmness.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Christ is thy health, and one that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands himself, will let go any thing rather than health; for that's the marrow and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of all other comforts of life. Wisdom is health or medicine to all flesh, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.22, and 3.8, it shall be health to thy Navel, and marrow to thy Bones. It is the watering, moistness, and fatness of the Soul; Christ is as necessary for health to the Soul that's sick and wounded, as Medicine for the sick, and a Plaister for the wounded body; the Soul can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be sound without him. So long as you preserve him, you'l be strong and sound; strong to do, and strong to suffer; but if yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As <hi>Artemesia</hi> did ever

carry in her mind her dear deceased Husband <hi>Mauseolus,</hi> mingling her very drink with his ashes; so let us bear Christ about with us in the vessels of our hearts, mingling our meat, drink, words and works with his sweetest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance: So the Spouse did, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.4. <hi>I would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mothers house; and the chamber of her that conceived me.</hi> Which place according to the consent of best Expositors, is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, either of the Church of God, in her publick Congregations, which is the Mother of us all; or else of the sanctified Heart and Conscience, which is the dwelling-place of Christ, of which he hath said, <hi>Here will I rest, and I will dwell in the heart of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite,</hi> Isa. 57.15, and there we should lay him up by Faith: If the head be for the world, yet let Christ have the heart.</item>

Some, while poor and low in the world, have felt much more of the sweetness of communion with Christ, than when they grew richer and full of cares. O! who would not be content to take less of the world, that they might have more of Christ.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Never leave him, take heed of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from Christ, stick close to him, keep him company, and he will stay with you. As you do with a friend whose stay you desire, so deal with Christ; be much in his company, in prayer, reading, hearing, meditating, and all holy duties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be ambitious of more intimate communion with him; dayly increase sweet acquaintance, and humble familiarity with Christ.</p>

            <p n="3">3. Shake off sloth, ease and security; indulge not your selves, love not your carnal ease, be not drunken with the pleasures of the flesh, nor surfeit with the profits of the world, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated with pomp and honours; set not your affections on things below, let not down your watch, be not secure nor high-minded, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. you have there Christ knocking at the door of her heart, with importunity, and tender vehemency; for admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and he moves and solicites, <hi>Open my sister, my spouse, &amp;c.</hi> every word an argument, a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent weight of love; and does Christ, call and knock, and beg at the door of our souls to enter?

Is any thing so worthy to be harboured there as he? and is it not an imcomparable ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that he should vouchsafe to come under our roof? She aggravates her fault because of his importunity. But observe her idle excuses and vain frivolous pretences for not opening to him,

vers. 3. <hi>I have put off my coat, how shall I put it on?</hi> What absurd and sluggish inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces does she plead? making that her apology which should be her shame, in casting off those garments of holiness, and spiritual duties which should ever adorn her; and growing weary of her nuptial robes, which she should ever wear: And the other is like unto it, <hi>I have washed my feet how shall I defile them?</hi> This is spoken after the manner of those hot Countries where they used to wash constantly before they composed themselves to a setled rest, or before they sat down to eat. By this custom the Church would excuse her somnolency and negligence, as if there were trouble or danger in rising up to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain him: Sad shifts! A Christian should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure more for Christ than a little cold, or unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable diligence.

O be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of errour, if you would keep Christ; let men be in the eyes of the world, in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness Saints, in holiness Angels, in zeal like Christ himself: If damnable errours be the ground of their Catechisms, and their opinions be hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, they cannot keep Christ amongst them, receive and retain his faithful Ministers and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors: <hi>He that receiveth them receiveth me, and he that despiseth them despiseth me,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.40 <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.16.

Be humble and fruitful, these may well be joined together; for humble souls like the low valleys watered with the dew of Grace, are most fruitful; he knows the proud afar off, and resists the proud, but he gives grace to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and dwells in such souls. Barrenness under Ordinances provokes him to leave men, as the barren fig-tree, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>6, 7, 8, 9.

and removes his presence from it. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to walk in a fruitful garden, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. <hi>ult. Awake O Northwind, and come thou South, blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow forth. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.</hi>

            <p>Impart him to others, that's the way to have him; would you have Christ to stay with you, walk about with him, take him abroad, never come into any company but leave something of Christ there; while you seek to shut him up in your selves, you lose him.

            <p>Third Branch of Exhortation, is to make use of this Gift of God. O improve him to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost; 'tis not enough to have Christ, unless you use him. Not enough to have a Well of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but we must draw water and drink it too, if we intend a benefit by it, <hi>Isa.</hi> 12.3. so we must be always drawing, and drinking, and deriving good from Christ, as the branch makes the best of the root, and draws from it, as though it would exhaust all its life and vertue. O that we could carry it so to Christ, even to draw from him, as though we would draw him dry, if such a thing were possible. We have a saying in Philosophy, <hi>The nearer any thing comes to the first cause, the more abundantly doth it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from it; as the nearer any thing is to the Sun, the more it participates of its light and heat.</hi> Now you Believers are nigh unto Christ. (<hi>In whom all fulness dwells,</hi> Col. 1.19.) You are even in him, and he in you. O what sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys of Grace should you be fetching from him, upon all occasions! Why do you not live under more constant, more free and full derivations from him? why should ye want, or what should you want, who are not only at the fountain, but in it? It's not enough for Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to have faith by which to live, but they must live by the faith which they have, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>i. e.</hi> They must by faith draw continual supplys of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:34951:73"/>
Grace, comfort and strength from Christ. 'Twas the looking to the Brazen Serpent that cur'd them them that were stung; 'tis drinking of water that quenches the thirst, and eating the meat that satisfies the hungry. You then that have received Christ, and do keep him, make use and improvement of him; for though some gifts are only for laying up and looking at; yet this is both the excellency of Gods gift, and an encouragement to you for the performance of this duty; that he is for use, yea all for use and benefit to us. The great end for which he was given to us, is that we should make use of him for our own good; God gave his Son to all Believers, that they by applying him, <hi>might have life thorough him,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16. As Christ is a publick person, which both adds much to the excellency of this gift, and gives great encouragement to us to make use of him; It shews his excellency: Heaven is an excellent thing because publick, for 'tis observed, there is nothing in heaven, (that is the seat and element of happiness) but it is common to all, of publick use and enjoyment. The inhabitants of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious place, the glorified Saints and Angels, all see the face of him that sits on the Throne; they all drink of the water of life; all have access to eat of the apples of the tree of life; there is no forbidden fruit in heaven; all have the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the immediate presence of the Lamb, and there is neither need of Sun nor Moon, nor light of candle to any; all equally enjoy Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:34951:74"/>
there is one lease and term-day to the lowest inhabitant of glory, as to the highest, and that is Eternity. There is common to all one City, the streets whereof are transparent gold; that the poorest inhabitants of a place do all walk on streets of gold of <hi>Ophir,</hi> is a great commendation of a City. 'Tis common to them all, that they shall never sigh, never be sad, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be sick, never be old, never die; all feel the smell of the fairest rose that ever men or Angels heard of, or can imagine; the flower, the glory, the joy of Heaven, the Lord Jesus Christ. All walk in white, and can sin no more; all have eternal life, fulness of joy and pleasures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. So Christ is a publick gift; all that truly believe may receive him, may keep him, may use him; though there be many thousands of souls that are receiving from Christ, yet he is full enough to supply thy wants: though millions of souls employ him in the world, yet he is at leisure to do thy work too, if thou employ him. All his offices and benefits are for thy use most properly, he is made, ordained, appointed and fitted unto us of God, <hi>Wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. Is not a Redeemer of use for captives, a Saviour for sinners, a Priest for offenders, a Prophet for the ignorant, a King to deliver such as are in bondage, and to conquer and subdue oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors?

                     </gap>ome for our sins; and he being our true pledg and surety, therefore having satisfied for us by his death, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again to life, gives us a clear evidence and firm argument, that God was fully reconcil'd, and life purchased for us; which assurance we could not have had if Christ our pledg had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained under the power of death; and shall not we make use of Christs Resurrection to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm our faith, that God is satisfied for us? He rose again that he might quicken us to a new life, and shall we lye dead rather than im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove?</item>
                  <item>4. What was the end of Christs Ascension? was not that also for us, and our use and benefit, that then <hi>he might lead captivity captive, and give gifts to men,</hi> Ephes. 4.8. either passively, that Christ might take away from Satan, death and hell, and all their captives, and make them his happy captives; and shall such a Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be refused? Or actively, that he might cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate the world, flesh, devil, death and hell, which in several kinds had captivated mankind, and shall not we make use of him, for conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such enemies? He ascended that he might give his Spirit, and confer the gifts of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.16, 17. and that he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:34951:75"/>
a place for us: And shall these great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits be neglected?</item>
                  <item>5. Once more: Wherefore is he an Advocate, but to plead for us, when we dare not, cannot come to speak for our selves? What a strange piece of folly were it for a man that has a friend in the Court who is appointed purposely to plead his cause, or present his petition, and yet he make no use of him, when the success of his business concerns his whole estate or life? when we have sinned and offended God, we have Christ our advocate with the Father to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose betwixt the blow of Justice and our guilty souls, and shall this priviledg be neglected? 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.1. If we want any thing that God hath laid up for us, he is ready to make interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for us, who cannot be denied, <hi>Heb</hi> 7.25. He must perfume all our Sacrifices, or they are not accepted; offer up all our Prayers, or they are not answered. What need had we then to make use of him? It is only by the blood of Christ that we have boldness or liberty to enter into the holy of holies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19. And <hi>by him is a new and living way consecrated for us that we may draw near with true hearts and full assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of faith,</hi> Heb. 10.20, 22. And none can come unto the Father but by him. O then make use of this only name and way, and be often walking in it to God, and his Throne of Grace.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Object. <hi>O but I am a wretched sinner, a worthless worm and captive, what have I to do
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:34951:76"/>
with such a precious Saviour, with so glorious a Lord?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> But pray tell me, wherefore is Christ a Saviour? is he not for sinners? Wherefore is he a Redeemer? is it that he should lye by God as useless? was he not a Redeemer for Captives? Hath not God fitted and dressed Christ (as I may so speak) for sinners use and advantage? what if all the world should say so, Christ should be a Saviour and save none? a Redeemer and ransome none at all? an Advocate and plead for none? for all are sinners, all are captives, all are at enmity with God naturally. We have the more need to use him because such.</p>
            <p>Now for Direction how we must make use of Christ:
<list>
                  <item>1. As for the manner.</item>
                  <item>2. The particular cases wherein; 1. How or in what manner we may safely and comfortably make use of Christ.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Labour by all means to be acquainted with your spiritual condition; know the state of your souls; otherwise how canst thou make use of Christ suitably? As suppose thou hast a blind eye, or hard heart, how canst thou make use of Christ to open the one, or break the other, as thou ought, if thou knowest it not? as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith in another case, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat, &amp;c.</hi> So here, examine whether thou hast received Christ, whether he be thine, before thou make use of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:34951:76"/>
him; doth Christ belong to thee, or not? how canst thou without trembling think of him or approach to him, when thou knowest not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will condemn or acquit thee in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? nor whether he be fet for thy rising, or thy fall? whether he be the corner-stone and foundation of thy happiness, or a stone of stumbling, to break thee, and grind thee to powder? <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.34. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.44. Take heed of usurping that which belongs not to thee; do not ignorantly and presumptuously conceit thy self to improve Christ, before thou hast received him; try thy state to the bottom; hands off, prophane impenitent unbelievers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reformed sinners.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Get a due sense of thy necessity and want of Christ; learn to look upon thy self as altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther insufficient as of thy self to do any thing: What man is most likely to make use of Christ, what soul is in nearest capacity to improve him, but he that knows he hath nothing, can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without him? Will a man make use of a Physician that thinks he is not sick? Will any intreat his neighbours hand to help him to do or lift that which he is perswaded he hath strength enough to do himself? So if thou have any work to do, as suppose to resist Satan, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due a corruption, and presumest thou canst do it thy self; thou art uncapable of making use of Christ: as a King to suppress rebels, will not call in foreign aid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So think not your selves to have any sufficiency to do any thing that is
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:34951:77"/>
good, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. Empty your selves of self-conceitedness; say not with <hi>Laodicea, I am rich, and increased with goods</hi>; but know what Christ saith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.5. <hi>Non ait, fine me parum, potestis facere, sed nihil.</hi> Aust. Not but little, but just nothing; you cannot think, or speak, nor act in the least measure agreeable to Gods perfect will, but by Christ: unbottom your selves wholly, cast away self-confidence, that you may be fit for the Lord Jesus Christ, who <hi>filleth the hungry with good things, and sends the rich away empty,</hi> Luk. 1.53.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Apply Christ to thy self in particular by faith, believing and being verily perswaded that Christ is able and willing to do for thee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> what thou needest, and what thou desirest in all thy exigencies; trust him with thy work and busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and cast thy self upon him as thou wouldest do on a trusty, able, and faithful friend: as we are to receive Christ by faith, so by faith we make use of him; as we apply him for our justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, so we improve him for continuance of it, and for our Sanctification and Salvation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thus the servants of God have done and prospered; they apply'd Christ in their several needs and exigencies, as <hi>Iob, David, Thomas</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Thus the Scriptures direct, and perswade us to appropriate Christ to our needing souls, so we are bid to put on Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14. <hi>Taste and see that he is gracious,</hi> Psal. 34.8.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:34951:77"/>3. Thus Christ himself invites us to apply and improve him: <hi>Come eat of my bread, and drink of my wine which I have mingled,</hi> Prov. 9.5. Come partake of those good things my Father would have me to communicate unto you. <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Ho every one that thirsteth come ye to the waters, &amp;c.</hi> Joh. 7.37. <hi>If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.</hi> Mat. 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</hi> By these and such like passages in Scripture, you see what warrant you have to apply Christ, and perswade your selves, that if you make use of him, he will do for you that which shall be for your good. Christs call gives you a warrant to go to him, that you may possess these priviledges in Christ without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusion or usurpation, this is that you have to shew to Conscience, you do not presume: Why dost thou, vile wretch, go to Christ for such a blessing? how durst thou that art a sinner look him in the face? lay hold on Christ? make use of Christ? why? I was invited and called. If it should be asked of the guests that came in a wedding garment, Friends, how durst ye come hither and approach the Presence-chamber of the Kings Son? they might answer, We were bidden to the Wedding, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.10, 12. The Scripture doth not call us by name, thou <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> though the offer be propounded generally, yet when God by his messenger speaks directly to my case, and I am included, here's a dish for my hungry soul, intended for me.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:34951:78"/>2. For particular cases, wherein this gift may be very useful, as a Jesus to save us from our sins, <hi>Matt.</hi> 1.21.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a tryed and effectual antidote against sin, that's the greatest evil in the world. Now improve Christ against the guilt, the stain, the temptation, the bondage, and the remainder of sin.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Against the guilt of sin; wouldest thou have pardon, make use of Christ, who hath shed his blood to satisfie infinite Justice, and purcha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e pardon and remission of thy sins, if thou believe in him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24, 25. He hath born them on his body on the Cross, Therefore, as the Apostle, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.12, <hi>these things I write unto you, that ye sin not; and if any man sin, we have an advocate with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Iesus Christ the righteous, who is a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but the sins of the whole world.</hi> If thou hast sinned against God, and guilt pleads against thee, and thou hast nothing to plead for thy self, thou maist go to this Advocate, who will intercede for thee, by vertue of his merits; and so thou maist scape the Judgment of God denounced against thee, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18 4, <hi>The soul that sinneth it shall dye.</hi> O apply the blood of Christ, and sprinkle that upon thy Conscience, that thy sins may be blotted out, when the times of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing shall come from the presence of the Lord, he will heal thy bleeding wounds, and drown the cry of thy sins.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:34951:78"/>2. Against the stain of sin, to purge and cleanse thee; Dost thou find thy Soul stained with original and actual pollutions, so that thou cryest out, I am unclean, I am unclean, <hi>I was born in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me</hi>; and innumerable evils committed by me, do leave a <hi>macula,</hi> or stain upon me? O then, fly to Christ, who is a fountain set open to wash from sin and from uncleanness, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Who is the Lamb of God, that takes away the sins of the world,</hi> John 1.29. Christ was without spot, knew no sin, was born holy, that he might cover the impurity of thy conception. Hath sin like a poison or leprosy spread over thy whole Soul, and all thy actions are impure, so that there is no soundness in thee, but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores? Improve Christ in this case, who will wash thee in his blood, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5, bind up thy wounds, and make thee partaker of the Divine nature; as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Though thy sins be as scarlet, he will make thee white as snow. If the blood of bulls and goats, sprinkling the unclean, sanctified to the purifying of the flesh; how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal spirit, offered himself without spot to God, purge your consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences from dead works, to serve the living Lord, Heb.</hi> 9.13, 14? O then, look unto Christ and be healed, tell him (as he did) <hi>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</hi> No Soap, nor Nitre can purge it: the general deluge swept
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:34951:79"/>
away sinners, but could not wash away one sin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Against the bondage of sin; every one is by nature a bondslave to corruption: Now Christ was sent to Preach, as well as purchase deliverance for captives, and to open the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to them that are bound, <hi>Isa.</hi> 61.1, 2. If a number of men were taken captives by the Turks, and made Gally-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>laves; suppose some rich Merchant should lay down a vast sum of Money to purchase their liberty; or a great Prince make way by the Sword for their escape, or give some Prisoners in exchange for them; and should this dear-bought liberty be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed to all in general, That whoever will apply themselves to him, should be free from bondage; How deservedly may those lye and dye in Chains, that will not accept and make use of those easie terms? If thou cry out, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me, &amp;c</hi>? Christ alone, that Son will make you free, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.32, 33, 34. 'Tis not a feigned, or fancied, but a real liberty, free indeed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Against the danger of sin; Art thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of such a corruption? art thou annoyed with such a temptation, and ready to say, ah, I shall one day perish by the hand of such a sin? Then to prevent falling into sin, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote thee against the solicitations of it, with <hi>Paul</hi> run to Christ, and beseech the Lord once and again, till thou have that answer, <hi>My grace is sufficient for thee,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8, 9.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:34951:79"/>
When sin comes as a <hi>Potiphars</hi> Wife, and offers thee deadly Poison in a golden Cup, let Faith answer, I would consent, but that I am a Christian; how can I do this great wickedness and sin against my Christ? I cannot gratifie this or that lust, but I must be disloyal to my Lord Christ. When ever temptations assault, and an host incamp against thee, hast to the Captain of thy Salvation, as <hi>David,</hi> at <hi>What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee,</hi> Psal. 56.3.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Against the whole body of sin, make use of Christ, who came to destroy the works of the Devil: Would thou have sin mortified and killed, and the old man crucified, nail him to the Cross of Christ, that by vertue of his death, sin may receive its deaths wound; no corruptions can stand before Christs Cross. Rom. 6.8, <hi>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Art thou troubled and molested with passion, and transported with anger? nothing so effectual to subdue and bridle that short madness, as Christ. <hi>Nihil ita irae impetum co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibet, sicut Iesus:</hi> 'Tis the property of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to expel one another. Christ is meekness and love.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Doth Pride, that detestable sin, swell thee? art thou proud of wealth, honour, gifts, friends, <hi>&amp;c? Nihil ita superbiae tumorem, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat sicut Iesus,</hi> he is humble and lowly, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:34951:80"/>3. Or that diabolical sin of envy? Christ can cure thee of that rotten vice: <hi>Nihil ita livoris culmas; sanat sicut Iesus:</hi> Who ever shewed more opposition to it than Christ, who prayed that his Servants might have the same glory with him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.22.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Or that idolatrous heathenish sin of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness? Christ alone can quench the insa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable thirst after worldly things. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.14, <hi>Whoever drinks of this water shall never thirst. Nil ita temperat sitim avaritiae sicut Iesus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Thou wilt trample the Moon under thy feet, and scorn to love this poor dunghil-world, or be fond of these beautiful vanities, and fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd nothings.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Dost thou feel in thy Soul the scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat of Concupiscence, and knowest not how to rid thy self of it? Go to Christ, who will quickly quench that flame: <hi>Nihil ita ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguit libidinis flammam, sicut Iesus.</hi> Christs blood is an excellent antidote against lust, and will quench, and not curb only, that infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. So we might add many more instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for our mortification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As a Physician to cure all Diseases; Christ, the gift of God, is a most excellent and soveraign Remedy for all diseases and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual indispositions; whatever the Soul ails, go to Christ, and he can and will help.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For darkness and blindness; none better than Christ. Do the eyes of thy mind wax
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:34951:80"/>
dim and dark, that thou canst not (so well as formerly) see the soulness of sin, the fairness of Christ, the beauty of holiness? O make use of Christ, who can open blind eyes, and clear the sight, and make you see that plainly, that others can scarce perceive. He can illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the mind, anoint the eye with eye-salve, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18, that thou maist see how naked and wretched thou art; dispel all dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and shew thee the light of life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.12, and 12.46. If any walk in darkness, and hath no light, let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay himself upon his God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50.10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Deadness; Christ is an effectual remedy against deadness and lifelesness of spirit: Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should we go but unto him who hath the words of eternal life? Thou hast fallen among Thieves, and they have bereaved thee of all, yea, of life it self; why Christ is that good <hi>Samaritan,</hi> which puts Wine and Oyl into thy wounded Soul, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.30, he complains that ye will not come unto him, that ye may have life; he is called our life, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.4. O derive life and strength from him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hardness; Art thou infected with that sore disease of hardness of heart, so that thou canst not mourn for sin, nor art scarce sensible of the great burden of sin and misery, nor lay to heart the evils of the times, but thy heart is a Rock, or an Adamant? O go to Christ, who can, and will take away the heart of stone,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:34951:81"/>
and give thee a heart of flesh, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19, and 36.26. In him this gracious promise is, and ever shall be, <hi>yea,</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi> Soak thy heart thorowly in this promise, and set before thine eyes a crucified bleeding Saviour. Hence that saying of <hi>Bernard, Cui fons forte sicul es lanynam invocat Iesum, non fluxit uberius.</hi> What hardness of heart could ever stand before Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ? or what Soul ever went to Christ, and came away with a hard heart, and was not melted as wax before the Sun? If Christ do but strike upon the heart, though it were a Rock, he can make it gush out with a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of brinish tears.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Barrenness; Thou complainest of unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, thou receivest much and returnest little, thou art dry and unprofitable; make use of Christ in this case; the water is not more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to make fruitful the barren ground, than the dew of Christs Grace, to fructifie a barren heart; <hi>I the Lord can turn a barren wilderness into a fruitful garden,</hi> Isa. 51.3. He hath promised to make the Wilderness like Eden, and the Desert like the Garden of the Lord. He hath said, <hi>Isa.</hi> 35.1, 2, 6, 7, That <hi>the desert shall blossom as the rose, yea it shall blossom abundantly; for in the wilderness shall water break out, and streams in the desert, and the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water.</hi> Go to Christ for the fulfilling of those great and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises; say, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi> Lord send out thy
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:34951:81"/>
spirit, to breathe upon my Soul, to blow upon my Garden, that the Spices thereof may flow out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Christ saith, <hi>Except ye abide in me, and I in you, ye cannot bear fruit.</hi> Under the term abiding, is implyed, making use of Christ, drawing sap and nourishment from him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.4, 5.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Despondency; when thou art disquieted with melancholly, <hi>Psal.</hi> 27.13, doubting and distrustful thoughts arising from the weakness of Grace, power of Corruption, and malice of Satan; have recourse to Christ, who hath an incomparable faculty of dispelling all these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and pensive conceits that do torture thy mind: He himself suffered, and was tempted, was a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief, and therefore is able to succour us in all our temptations and troubles, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.18, and 4.15, 16. Now if a man be in any trouble in outward estate or body, what will he do in such a case? He will go and consult with one that hath been in the like condition. Do thus, make use of Christ for help, who hath said, <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee,</hi> Heb. 13.5; which words of his, being spoken home to the heart of a distrustful, perplexed person, by his own Spirit, must needs be of refreshing vertue, and reviving power, as that light will ever spring up out of darkness, and scatter those mists that darken the mind and disturb our peace: 'tis he that forgiveth all thy sins, and healeth all thy diseases, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103.3.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:34951:82"/>3. Improve this gift of God, as a sweet and forcible attractive and help to draw your hearts to the performance of all those duties that are required of you; and to assist in the exercise of those graces that are to be found in you.</p>
            <p>As 1. Faith; In the want or weakness of Faith, make use of Christ, who must needs be very helpful; for he is the author and finisher of your faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2, he is infinitely able to begin, increase, and perfect your faith, so as that it can have no other vertue or power, but such as is derived only from him. 'Tis he by whom we believe in God, who raised him from the dead; his own Disciples finding their faith infirm and weak, did repair to him for more strength, and for a larger measure of it, acknowledging him to be able, and themselves impotent and unable to do it, saying, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.5, <hi>Lord increase our faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Repentance; Does any lye and groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guilt and burden of impenitency? O let him address himself to Christ in this sad case, who came into the world to call sinners to repentance; not as we in the Ministry, to call outwardly, but to call with an effectual voice, and to cause to repent, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.13. God not only gave him to the world to be a Saviour, but hath exalted him to be a Prince, to give repentance and remission of sins, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31. If thy heart be secure and senseless, go to Christ who will freely give (not sell) and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:34951:82"/>
work in thee godly sorrow, that leads to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto salvation, not to be repented of. That repentance you frame in your selves, will miserably deceive you; so that <hi>Austin</hi> said, that repentance doth drown more than sin, when you think you can sufficiently do it your selves; whereas Christ alone doth give true and acceptable repentance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Love; Christ is the best teacher of Love that ever the world had; who taught it, not only by his words, but by his blood, by his life, and by his death. Wouldest thou learn to love? Go to Christ; if thou canst not learn it of him, thou canst never learn it. Love is the greatest commander of love, and the most effectual ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that can insuperably constrain us to it; and none ever loved at the rate and measure that Christ hath loved; to stand by such a fire, is the way for a congealed heart to melt, and the coldest affections to grow warm. A lively Faith still holding Christ the glass of infinite love and goodness, before our faces, is the greatest lesson in the art of love. A believing view of the nature, undertaking, love, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, doctrine, example, sufferings, intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Kingdom of Jesus Christ, must needs inflame believers hearts with an answerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of love: O steep that stiff and hardned heart in the blood of Christ, and it will melt, and it will change thy unkind, unthankful heart, in the very nature of love, to come over with <hi>Thomas,</hi> and by the passage of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:34951:83"/>
his wounds, wind thy self into his heart.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Obedience, both active and passive, to which Christ is both an incomparable motive, and admirable pattern: He fulfilled all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and became obedient to the death of the Cross; <hi>Lo, I come to do thy will, O God,</hi> was his resolution when he came into the world; and <hi>not my will, but thine be done,</hi> when he went out of it. He hath said, he will write his Laws in your hearts, and cause you to walk in his statutes, and give you one heart and one way, that ye may serve him for ever, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. Christs obedience is thine, walking in Christ; all the acts of it are exerted and performed in the strength of Christ.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Prayer; would you know how to pray, as to have your Prayer accepted and answered? let Christ be made use of, who is the alone Mediator, that by the vail of his flesh, hath made a new and living way into the holy place; and sits at Gods right hand making request for you: So that by him, you may have free access with boldness to the throne of grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20. Have you a friend in the Court, that will plead your cause, and speak a good word to the King, and will you not make use of him? <hi>O Let us come boldly to the throne of grace, Heb.</hi> 4.16. In Christ we have access, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.18, <hi>and</hi> 3.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.13. If ye ask any thing in my name, I will do it; in time of the Law,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:34951:83"/>
if any sinned, he was to go to the High Priest, who was to mediate and intercede for him to God. So now we must come to Christ, who mediates, and makes intercession for us; though we have transgressed, he hath suffered; though we be unworthy, yet he is worthy; if we and our suit be commended by one of so great worth, and such interest in the Father, can we doubt of success?—He will give us also his spirit, to help our infirmities, and teach us what to pray for as we ought, and lead us by the hand unto God, and enable us to cry, <hi>Abba,</hi> Father.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Improve Christ, as the purchaser and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyer of all blessings and benefits to your Souls, which they stand in need of; are you empty and hungry, come to him for food; are you naked, come to him for clothes; are you weak, come to him for strength; if wavering, for stedfastness; if weary, for rest.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let the poor, needy and hungry Soul come to Christ, and not lay out its money for that which is not bread; but hearken unto him, eat that which is good, and let your soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light it self in fastness, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.2, 3. He alone will feed and fill the Soul, and satiate it with his goodness; <hi>He will make a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined, Isa.</hi> 25.6. O labour to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ake in his sweetest consolations fresh every morning; the Soul cannot live without some comfort or other,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:34951:84"/>
if it finds no such sweetness in Christ it will look for it elsewhere; and if it tast nothing in his ways to keep it up, it will go down to earthly delights for relief.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let the wretched, naked Soul, make use of Christ, and not sow together Fig-leaves, as <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 3.7. Never think to patch to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a deal of filthy rags to cover thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness and nakedness, <hi>Isa.</hi> 64.6. But if thou know that thou art naked, then buy of Christ <hi>white raiment that thou maist be clothed, and the shame of thy nakedness do not appear, Rev.</hi> 3.18. Christs righteousness is a long white robe to cover thy nakedness, see <hi>Ezek</hi> 16. begin. the Soul according to its nativity is naked and filthy; but Christ spreads his skirt over it, and puts on excellent ornaments, he will take away thy filthy garments, and cloathe thee with change of raiment, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. begin.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Let the weak improve Christ for strength, who will perfect his strength in their weakness; so that thou maist say with the Apostle, <hi>When I am weak, then I am strong,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9. And by his strength, I can do all things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. Trust not in your own strength, but rely upon the power of Christ in all your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances; art thou to grapple with some strong corruption or temptation, and desirest to overcome it? hast thou some weighty and difficult duty to perform? make tryal of Christ, and thou shalt find that he gives power
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:34951:84"/>
to the faint, and to them that have no might, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40.29.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let the wavering make use of him for stability and fixedness; Art thou afraid of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy in these backsliding times, go to Christ to stablish thee, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.13, That <hi>he establish your hearts, unblameable in holiness before God, even our father, at the coming of our Lord Iesus Christ, with all his saints.</hi> He is a Rock, if thou build on him, thou shalt never be moved, <hi>Matt.</hi> 16.10. God stablisheth your Souls in Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. If you can get rooted and built up in him, and established by him in the faith, you need not fear (though you must beware) of being spoiled through Philosophy and vain deceit, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.7, 8. Do you fear falling away from the Grace or Truth of God? then make special use of Christ, who is able to establish you, and keep you from falling, and present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, <hi>Iude</hi> 24.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let the weary Soul come to Christ, and he shall find rest; make use of this gift of God, which is far more suitable to a wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sin-sick soul, than the softest bed to the wearied body: what was prophesied by <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mech</hi> concerning his Son <hi>Noah,</hi> is compleatly fulfill'd in Christ, whereof <hi>Noah</hi> was a type, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.29. <hi>He called his son Noah,</hi> rest, (for saith he) <hi>this same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands.</hi> Think often on that soul-refreshing promise, Matt. 11 28,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:34951:85"/>
               <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest; take my yoke upon you, &amp;c.</hi> Come poor restless, easeless, and dejected souls, let others weary themselves in seeking riches and reputation in the world, to you I faithfully promise rest, which is the thing you want. <hi>Fecisti nos domine propter te, &amp; inquietum est cor nostrum, donec veniat ad te.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Improve this gift of God as a standing cordial against those failings and despondencies of spirit, and make use of it in the midst of those sad thoughts and mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. Is God angry, doth he begin to thunder, and write bitter things against thee? and his waves and billows go over you, so that your moisture is dried up, and you almost overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the fierceness of his wrath? Now let faith recollect it self and say, Well, Christ is mine, in whose wounds is room enough to hold, and in whose heart is readiness enough to receive all that fly unto him; true indeed, there is a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible storm of justice gathering over my head, and ready to fall upon me, but my Christ is my shelter, <hi>an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest,</hi> Isa. 32.2. A flood of vengeance is coming, but I am got into the Ark; destruction near, but Christ is my Passover, my little Sanctuary, able and willing to save to the uttermost with all kinds and degrees of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

               <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>He hath trodden the wine-press alone, and of the people there was none with him, Isa.</hi> 63.3. O then enter into this rock, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his Majesty, till the indignation be over-past. When God is angry with thy soul, take Christ in thine arms and come to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Art thou grown strange to him, and alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated thy self from him by sin? none is so proper and necessary to be made use of as Christ in this case, who is the peace-maker between God and man; who hath not only made peace between those, but so ratified and confirmed it, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing shall be ever able to dissolve it. God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciles the world to himself by Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. not only them that were strangers, but even enemies, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21. Those that are afar of, are made nigh by the blood of Christ; he hath broken down the partition-wall, and slain the enmity, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2 16, 17, 18. If thou hast some dear friend who bestows a gift on thee, in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his dear love and respect to thee, and there should be afterwards some disagreeing and falling out betwixt you, wouldst thou shew this gift a pledg of league and amity? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thus hold up Christ to God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Or though it be not thus, yet thou want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est the sense and feeling of his love, and art com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortless in the want of it; O then make use of Christ in this case, who is able to make all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations abound, and fill thy soul with joy and peace in believing: He hath said, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.18. <hi>I
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:34951:86"/>

Christ is a most soveraign Cordial, apply and use him, and your joy will be full.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Or art thou terrified in Conscience, and groaning under the insupportable burden of a wounded spirit? art thou affrighted with accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and condemning thoughts? O go to Christ, who as he can make peace in the Court of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, so he can create peace in thy heart, and still the crys of Conscience, and make a calm there also; though the waves roar, and the winds blow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thy soul shall have peace in him which passeth all understanding, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20.

It's reported by <hi>Cassander</hi> that in ancient times, sick and weak dying persons were directed and accustomed to make use of Christ at that time especially, interposing him betwixt them and

Or fearest thou judgment, look to Christ and thou shalt not die the second death, but he will raise thee up at the last day, <hi>Ioh</hi> 6.49, 50.

What shall I render to the Lord for this the greatest of all his benefits?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:34951:87"/>O be thankful, not in a common, ordinary, formal manner, but in the most lively, enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and raised manner that is possible; where the mercy is high and great, the thankfulness must bear some proportion to it. O let your apprehensions be widened, to conceive the vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this mercy, that your affections may be more enlarged to praise God for it; O how shall we get our hearts affected with it! what thankfulness can be enough for such a gift! should not the whole soul be summon'd in to give its most united acknowledgment of so signal a mercy? for God to give his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son to be a Saviour for sinners! Here's the wonder of wonders! God never did the like before, and he'l never do the like again; and blessed be his name, there is no need he should. It would have been admirable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy if God would have sent some other person upon this Errand to redeem and save undone sinners. If send he will, why did he not send an Angel, (or body of Angels) to try their skill, and see what they could do? Nay, why did he not send an Angel (as once he did) with a flaming sword in his hand to keep off sinners from the Tree of Life? O this did not comport with his gracious designs (though it did too well with the creatures merit) therefore he would not do it; no his own Son shall be pitcht upon, he is the person whom God will send. Surely here was love, great love, great to the degree of infiniteness. Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions

of Angels were nothing to one Son, to one such Son, his first-born, his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, the Son of his love, who lay in his bosom, had been his delight from everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. O astonishing mercy! O admirable good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and condescention! how may we cry out here, <hi>Lord what is man that thou art thus mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of him, and the Son of man that thou makest this account of him!</hi> Psal. 8.4. and 144.3. or as <hi>Iob</hi> 7.17. <hi>What is man that thou shouldest magnifie him, and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him</hi>! Here was God so loving, so as can never be expressed, never be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, <hi>Ioh</hi> 3.16. <hi>God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believed on him might not perish, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Heavens and the Earth were once call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon to be filled with astonishment, because of the ingratitude of a sinful people, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.2. May not now Heaven and Earth, Angels and men, all creatures whatsoever, be called upon to be filled with astonishment because of the stupendious love of God! O Christians! what influence hath this upon your dull and slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gish hearts? what are you made of, that you are no more (in the sense of it) drawn out in blessing, loving, admiring and adoring of God? Pray, if there be any holy ingenuity in you, take some pains with your selves, that you may be much more affected with it, and give not over, till you have such thoughts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:34951:88"/>
(upon Gods giving his Son) raised in you as may in some measure answer to those thoughts and affections which you shall have about it, when you shall be in Heaven. The Angels never reaped that advantage that we do, yet they were at praising-work as soon as ever Christ was born, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.13, 14. <hi>A multitude of the heavenly host was praising God, saying, Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace, and good will towards men</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Good <hi>Zachary</hi> so soon as his mouth was opened, begun his Prophecy, with <hi>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who hath visited and redeemed his people,</hi> Luk. 1.68, 69. And old <hi>Simeon</hi> ended his life with praise and blessing God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.19. 'Tis the duty of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in every thing to give thanks, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.18. because this is the will of God in Christ, much more should every soul give thanks, for Christ the top of all blessings, the flower of all enjoyments; think much of this threefold cord of obligation to praise: 1. When a gift is free: 2. When it is great. 3. When special<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thanks is most due: for though a man receive a benefit from another, yet if he have in any measure deserved it before, or it be in lieu of something to be done after, it abates the thankfulness: But though it be free, yet if it be not much worth, that lessens thanks; but if it be a thing of worth, yet if it be commonly to be had, or given to all, this will take off somewhat of the edg of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness. But now,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:34951:88"/>1. Christ is an absolutely free gift, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undeserved, but undesired and expected: kindness by the rules of friendship and love, in the heathens judgment, doth challenge ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther recompence if we deal with our matches, or acknowledgment where the distance is great, and the greater this, the greater that: Now betwixt God and us the distance is infinite, and if it were possible our love and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness should fill up that distance, and extend it self to infiniteness. Let Angels and men adore and praise God for this gift to eternity in Heaven, yet they must be ashamed and blush at the imagination of merit. The dignity and worth of this gift must lay an infinite (though sinless) debt for ever on all the Citizens of Glory, whether home-born, and natives of the Country, as elect Angels, or adopted stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as glorified Saints. Christ is the flower, glory, and crown of free Grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The gift is of unspeakable worth and excellency, than which none could ever be greater, none better, the only begotten Son, God blessed for evermore, the brightness of his Fathers Glory; co-equal and co-essential with the Father; there could be no addition at all made to his Glory; he was so high he could not be higher, so great, so good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He is better than wealth or health, than peace or life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There's distinguishing favour in bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christ on thee, and not on others; that

admiration and praise. <hi>Blessed are your eyes, for they see such things that many Kings and Prophets have desired to see and have not seen them,</hi> Luk. 10.23. O what thoughts will ye have of this mercy in Heaven when you shall have your souls laden with a massy weight of glory, and thousands of souls spitting out blasphemies on the Majesty of Heaven, out of the sense of the torment of the gnawing-worm that never dies; and you consider the soul of <hi>Iudas</hi> might have been in my souls stead, and my soul in the same place of torment that he is now in. O the unsearchable riches of the free grace of God in Christ! How should we now sing that new Song that properly belongs to all redeemed ones, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.3. and to say with a loud voice, <hi>Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power be unto him that sitteth on the Throne for ever and ever,</hi> Rev. 5.8. <hi>ad finem:</hi> and <hi>Rev</hi> 7.12. O how should we extol and shew forth his praises, had we as many tongues as members, or joints, or hairs; were our whole body turned into that one member, yet should we not be able for this high and glorious mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, sufficiently to celebrate the praises of the most high God.</p>

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:34951:90"/>
of persons should we be in all holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation and godliness!</p>
            <p>It is most reasonable that we should walk in Christ, as we have received him, both from the rules of ingenuity, fidelity and equity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a rule of an ingenuous man, that nothing be done to the prejudice of him from whom we receive nothing but the fairest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of favour and kindness. God deals with his people in sweet expressions and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of condescending love, bounty, and good-will; all his ways are mercy and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness; his with drawings, or whatever God doth to his people, it is for their good: Now for any man to walk contrary to God, that still goes on to discover more of the riches of his grace to him, is to requite evil for good, a piece of great disingenuity: there is not only rebellion and disobedience, but wickedness in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis a rule of fidelity: whatever is given to a man to be disposed of upon such and such things, and for such ends, should be carefully imployed and laid out upon such things, and for such ends, according to the will of the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. A man may certainly dispose of his own as he pleases. Now Christ was not given to us to live as we list, or to walk in the vanity of our minds as other Gentiles, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.17. Those that have received Christ, and do not walk worthy of him, do not improve him for mortifying the old man, and putting on the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:34951:91"/>
new man, and for holiness of heart and life, they go against the will of him that hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s gift upon them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis a rule and principle of equity: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever we have received from another to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy, we should return it with all possible advantage: being intrusted in anothers business, an ingenious and just man will labour to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage him in whose business he is employed, as much if not more than his own. If we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this special gift and grace of God, and instead of walking answerably we dishonour him by walking contrary to the grace we have received, where is justice and ingenuity in this deportment? As if a servant be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Masters business, he is to use his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most skill, and strength, and put to his utmost endeavours to perform his duty exactly. So we are servants, and whatever we do, is our duty, <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A servant is not to mind his own advantage, and profit, but his masters; the end why you perform duties, and frequent Ordinances, must not be meerly to be free from guilt and horrour, and to escape Judgment and H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. In what respects: 2. Whence it is: 3. What an advancement 'tis to be his servants.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In what respect they are his servants? <hi>Ans.</hi> In these seven.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:34951:105"/>1. To worship and serve him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45.11. <hi>He is thy Lord, and worship thou him.</hi> A servant must attend and wait on his Master, and so the true Christian on Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.35. <hi>That ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.</hi> Col. 3.24. <hi>For ye serve the Lord Christ.</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to Christ is the duty and business of every Christian, by shewing reverence to his person, and yeilding obedience to his commands.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Christ is to be worshipped with Divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; it is the will of God <hi>that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father, Ioh.</hi> 5.35. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.12. The glorious Angels do it, <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.</hi> And <hi>vers.</hi> 13. Every Creature is heard to say, <hi>Blessing, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, glory, and power, be unto him that siteeth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</hi> We must worship him with inward and outward veneration; the first consists in the trust, fear, reverence and adoration of the heart, the latter in attendance upon, and due ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance of Gospel institutions, as Prayer, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word, reverent use of the Sacraments.</p>
            <p>'Tis a known story that of <hi>Amphilochius</hi> to the Emperour <hi>Theodosius</hi>; he had petition'd the Emperour to be severe against the <hi>Arrians,</hi> to discountenance and suppress them, because in their opinions they did disparage the Son of God; but could not prevail: Whereupon he made use of this device, coming one day into the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:34951:105"/>
Emperours presence, and of <hi>Arcadius</hi> his Son, (who ruled jointly with his Father) he made his humble obeisance to the Emperour himself, and shewed him all reverence, but passed by his Son, shewing him no respect at all, the Emperour was much offended, sharply reproves <hi>Amphilochius</hi> for this affront to his Son; whereupon the good man vindicates his carriage, plainly telling the Emperour, he had given reverence enough to his Son; and now the Emperour was more incensed, commands him with great indignation to be thrust out of his Presence; which while some were doing, <hi>Amphilochius</hi> turns himself to the Emperour and said, O Emperour, thou being but a man, canst not bear the contempt or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement of thy Son, how dost thou think the great God can bear the contempt of his Son, which the <hi>Arrians</hi> do cast upon him? The Emperour was much affected with this, beg'd the Bishops pardon, commended his ingenuity; and did that now, which he had refused to do before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. With obedience to all his Laws and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.5. <hi>This is my beloved Son, hear ye him.</hi> This hearing of Christ is obeying of him in all his holy Laws and Institutions; and so 'tis <hi>q. d.</hi> Here's a person whom I own for my Son, whom I have made your Lord, and have set him as my King on my holy hill, into whose hands I have put all power, on whose shoulders I have laid the government, therefore I charge you to hear him, and to yield all obedience and subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:34951:106"/>
to him: Obedience is the chief badg and character of a servant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16. <hi>His servants ye are to whom ye obey.</hi> Eph. 6.5. <hi>Servants be obedient to your masters.</hi> There can be no better proof of service than obedience, and therefore the people said, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 24.24. <hi>The Lord our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.</hi> So <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> the servant of the Lord, when he was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go out of his own Country, obeyed; yea, in that greatest trial of obedience, that ever we read any meer man to be put unto, being commanded to sacrifice his only Son, he never stumbled upon the bare signification of his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: without disputing or debating the matter, we must give both active and passive obedience.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This reverence and obedience will produce in Christs servants (and they are dispositions well becoming servants) a fear to offend, and desire to please their Lord; a deliberate appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of some worthiness in another more than in a mans self, is ever accompanied with a fear to displease, and care to please the person reverenced, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6. <hi>If I be a Master, where is my fear? Serve the Lord with fear,</hi> Psal. 2.11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28. From which a care to please can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be severed; <hi>Servants are to be obedient and to please their Masters or Lord in all things, Tit.</hi> 2.9 So must Christs servants study to walk worthy of him unto all well-pleasing, not much regarding what offence others take at him, so long as his master accepts his service.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To go by Christs warrant, and take his
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:34951:106"/>
word for his rule in all his actions, <hi>Mar.</hi> 13.34. He gives to every servant his work, and he is to receive commission from him for it, as the Porter to watch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what the master bids or forbids is to be observed: If he say go, as the Centurions servant, he is to go; or do this, it must be done; a servant may not do what he pleases, but must wait his masters pleasure, <hi>Psal.</hi> 123.2. <hi>As the eyes of the servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress, so our eyes wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord our God, until that he have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</hi> A servant is not <hi>sui juris,</hi> his own master, to guide his actions, but must subject his own will to the will of another, whether it be in something to be done, or something to be suffered; our right serving of Christ is, when 'tis done according to his own direction, both for the matter and manner of his service. 'Tis a maxim in nature, every ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster is to be served according as himself com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; and if the servant prescribe to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster how he will serve him, he becomes his own, yea his Master's master. In the Civil Law a servant is said to be (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) such a one as sustains no person, but is a dependent and adjunct to his master, to accomodate his will to the will of his master. <hi>Socrates</hi> could see this, and say, If there be a God he must be worshipped, and if he be worshipped it must be according to his own will, or else we do not worship him at all. Will worship is a service that's so far from
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:34951:107"/>
bringing us to Heaven, that it will beguile us of Heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To account and use all he hath and is, as not his own, but his masters; all a Christian is, is Christs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13. <hi>And ye are Christs, and Christ is Gods.</hi> As he is, so all he hath is his masters talent, or goods, to be kept for him, and employed to his profit, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</hi> Mat. 25.14. He deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers unto them his goods, of which they are to make account to him at his coming, they are not <hi>proprietarii,</hi> but <hi>depositarii</hi>; not treasurers, but stewards of his gifts; and must hear, <hi>redde depositum,</hi> he must be served with his own, and that intirely without dividing; for we are not in part, but wholly his; no man can have any propriety in himself, or in any other creature, but what is derived from this absolute Lord, and standeth in full subordination to his propriety; and as we are not our own, so nothing is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our own which we possess; for no man can have more title to any thing else than to himself; nor may we dispose of any thing we have in any way, but to serve the will and interest of this absolute Lord.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To follow his Master in his ways. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians must walk as his servants, not where and how they list, but as their Master pleases, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.26. <hi>If any man serve me, let him follow me. Ye call me Lord and Master,</hi> (saith Christ in

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:34951:108"/>
till they part; so when Christ and our lusts, or our interests command contrary things, then it puts us to the trial, whether we be his servants or not? we must not only follow him in the easie and pleasant ways of obedience, but such as cross our lusts and interests: we must do in reality what the Lawyer said in compliment, <hi>Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</hi> Revel. 14.14. The Angels are Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters that do his pleasure, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103.21. A ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant hath no will of his own, but hath given up his liberty to the directions and commands of others; hence Christs servants do earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and study to know what his will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is, and do it. The Masters will is motive enough, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.3. and 5.18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15. This his will, if God will have it so, if Christ will have it so, it is enough to a faithful servant; the very signification of his will carries with it reason enough to enforce the practice of it. We are not to trade for our selves, and to drive on our own designs of credit and advantage; we are servants and employed for our masters use. A man that sets up of himself, is to trade for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; but all that a servant doth, should be for his masters honour and profit; we are entrusted with talents of Gifts, Graces, Estates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> now after some time the Lord will come and reckon with us, and see what we have done for his honour, what good we have done in our places; how we have employed our gifts, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved our interests; whether we have beaten,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:34951:108"/>
or helped our fellow servants; whether our ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hath been hid in a napkin, or laid out for the good of souls, and the glory of our Lord and Master.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To participate with him in his estate, both good and bad. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.26. <hi>If any man serve me, let him follow me, and where I am, there shall my servant be. If any man serve me, him will my Father honour.</hi> But the world will dishonour and reproach the servant as they have done the Master, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.24, 25. <hi>The Disciple is not above his Master, nor the servant is not above his Lord. It is enough for the Disciple that he be as his Master, and the servant as his Lord: If they have called the master of the house Beelze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub, how much more shall they call them of his houshold?</hi> Servants must be contented to bear his Cross, whose priviledg it shall be to wear his Crown; and should be satisfied with their allowance. The proper work of a servant is to wait and stay his masters pleasure for any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. He that is but a servant in the house, must not think to command whatsoever the house af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth at his own pleasure, (that's the masters prerogative alone), but must content himself with what his master is content to allow him, and take his portion of meat, drink, livery, lodging, and every other thing, at the direction and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of his master; neither may the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Christ look to be his own carver in any thing, nor may he murmur against his master, with that ungracious servant in the Parable,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:34951:109"/>
               <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.24. complaining of his hardness and austerity, if his allowance in some things fall short of his desire; having food and raiment, be it never so little, never so course, he should be content with it, nay though he want either or both, he should be content without it, as grace and long experience had taught that faithful servant of Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.11, <hi>I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.</hi> Pro. 30.8, <hi>Feed me with my al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. To submit to his correction. A beaten ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant must not strike again, nor word it with his master; ('tis chaff that flyes in the face of him that fannes it) must take it patiently, if he be buffeted undeservedly or without fault. How much more ought Christians to accept the punishment of their iniquity, when this gracious master shall think fit to exercise a little severity towards them, especially since he never strikes them but for their fault (such is his justice); nor (such is his mercy) but for their good? he chides not, because he loves it, but because they need it, and because he loves them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.19.

            <p n="3">3. What a Lord and Master Christ is: The Scriptures give us these Characters or Properties of Him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is the most absolute and supreme Lord. His stile is <hi>King of kings, and Lord of lords</hi>; he hath no superior or co-partner with him in his dominion and government; all other Power and Lordship is dependent, and derivative, and subordinate.</p>
            <p n="1">1. All Power is from him; as, 1. Civil, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.15, <hi>By me Kings reign, and Princes decree Iustice.</hi> 2. Ecclesiastical, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.8. That power which the Apostle had was derived from Christ; <hi>For though I should boast something more of the Authority which the Lord hath given us for Edification and not for Destruction.</hi> 3. Inward and spiritual. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.20. <hi>They preached every where, the Lord working with them: the opening of the eyes of the blind, quickening the dead, turning them from darkness to light,</hi> were the effects of his power: not the parts or piety of the Preacher, but his grace and spirit did the work. Lastly, extraordinary and miraculous power, whereby they confirmed the word; signs and wonders were wrought in his name and by his power. When the lame man was healed, and the Apostle examined by what power, or by what name they had done it? <hi>Peter</hi> answered, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.10, <hi>Be it

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As all power is derived from him, and dependent on him; so 'tis to be used and obeyed in subordination to him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For him, as the authority of Magistrates, Parents, 1 Pet. 2.13, <hi>Submit to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake, whether it be to the King as supream.</hi> Eph. 6.1, <hi>Children obey your parents in the Lord: so wives to husbands, servants to masters,</hi> Col. 3.18.</p>
            <p n="2">2. According to him, <hi>Acts.</hi> 5 29, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle answered, <hi>We ought to obey God rather than men.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. All other Lords are responsible to him, for the use and abuse of that authority, and those gifts they received from him; and are therefore punishable by him.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> He is an universal Lord, Lord of all.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In regard of persons, he is over all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. He rules over all nations, persons, hearts; all other Masters and Lords are inferiour to him; Eph. 6.9, <hi>And ye masters, do the same things to them</hi> (that is your Servants) <hi>forbearing threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: knowing that your master also is in heaven, neither is there respect of persons with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In regard of matters and acts, outward, inward, Godward, manward, civil, spiritual, all come under his cognizance, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.5, 6. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.23, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.18, in all these things we are to serve Christ,</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:34951:112"/>3. In regard of places; the three kingdoms of Heaven, Earth and Hell, have no other Lord but Christ: Angels and glorified Saints in Heaven, Saints, Sinners, and every creature on Earth, the damned and Devils in Hell, are all his subjects.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> He is a spiritual Lord, for the manner of his rule and government; <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.36, <hi>My kingdom is not of this world: not from hence.</hi> Not that he governs not in Heaven and Earth, for though his kingdom be not of this world, <hi>Rex tamen est in hoc mundo,</hi> Bern. when <hi>Pilate</hi> had openly declared whose accusation it was, Jesus plainly tells him, that his Kingdom was not secular, but spiritual; not of this world: So that he nothing intrenched on <hi>Caesars</hi> right; which he saith not to avoid death, but to shew that he was unjustly accused.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He is an eternal Lord; <hi>Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom to order it, and to establish it with judgment and justice, from henceforth even for ever,</hi> Isa 9.7, Luke 1.33. He is the King immortal, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. Death the King of terrors, and terror of Kings, is subdued by this Lord; not only so as never to touch him, but also never to hurt any of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: Other Rulers, though they be called gods and lords, yet shall dye like men; earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Monarchs, either by some Poison or Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, are brought to untimely deaths, at least
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:34951:112"/>
some disease or other will lay their glory in the dust; but Jesus Christ is yesterday, to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>day, and the same for ever.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He is a mighty Lord, most able to do what is good for his Servant, and to subdue all persons and things to himself, <hi>Psal.</hi> 3.21. He can kill the Soul, and throw both the Body and Soul into Hell; he can subdue the hearts of men, even of the deadliest enemies, unto his love and obedience; he can protect and shelter his Servants from all evil, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow all good things on them, for the world is his and the fulness thereof: He hath under his command the forces of all creatures in Heaven and Earth, which he rules as he pleases to his own purpose; he can at ease frustrate the harmful intentions, and noisom qualities of the worst of them; he can turn their malice into mercy, their hatred into love, yea can bring forth glory to himself, and profit to his Servants; not only against, but even out of their mischievous designments, as in <hi>Daniel</hi> and the three Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. He is a most just Lord; his is a Scepter of righteousness, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.8, his right hand is full of righteousness, <hi>The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works,</hi> Psal. 145.17. In him is exact and perfect integrity and equity, of all his counsels, words and actions; and there is no unrighteousness in him. His will is the rule and standard of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and whatever he commands is most
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:34951:113"/>
equal and right, because he wills and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. He is a most glorious Lord and Master; The glory of Kings and Emperours is but a borrowed ray, or spark from his Majesty; the glory of all the <hi>Caesars, &amp;c.</hi> is but a black coal in comparison of his splendor; and when he shall appear in his glory, the glow-worms of worldly splendor and majesty shall disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear and be extinguished; the poorest Servant he hath shall then appear with him in such glory, that the combined-excellency of Kings shall not be so much as a shadow to it.</p>
            <p n="8">8. He is a most gracious Lord; he puts them upon none but safe, honourable, and comfortable employments. He puts no more upon them than they can go through; and lays no more upon them than they are able to bear; he knows their mould and frame, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members they are but dust; he is Jesus as well as Lord; a Shepherd as well as a Master; he joins his glory and their happiness together; he never requireth brick from his people, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving them straw; he will either multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply grace, or diminish the temptation: his Grace is always sufficient for them.</p>
            <p n="9">9. He is a wise judicious Master. A man that serves a fickle and unconstant Master, who often changes his mind, has a hard task, and endless labour (but a prudent man, who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders his affairs with discretion and deliberation, his commands are but once obeyed, his work
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:34951:113"/>
is soon done); what he doth now, anon he must undo, and so <hi>Sysiphus</hi> like, he is ever do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and hath never done; he never knows an end of his work: But the Servant of Christ is at a good certainty, and knows before-hand what his work must be, and what his wages; as his Master himself is, so his Commandments are immutable and invariable, without so much as a shadow of change, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.17. That was a needless cavil, and meer peevishness and self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishness in <hi>Ionah, Ionah</hi> 4.2.</p>
            <p n="10">10. He is a most knowing and discerning Lord. He observes the ways and works of his Servants so narrowly, that the closest and subtillest among them cannot deceive him; he spies them in every corner, nay, every corner of their hearts in them; all things are open and naked before him: though now in some sort he be absent, yet he needs no informer, he knows what every Servant doth in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and will manifest every ones work to all the world: his eyes are as a flame of fire, clearer than ten thousand suns; he takes notice of all their services and hearts, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.19, <hi>I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works, and the last to be more than the first.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. He is a pitiful and merciful Lord and Master. He hath an eye as pitying as it is piercing; he doth no less observe the wants and troubles, than the ways and works of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; he is a Father as well as a Master; and

               <hi>As a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him,</hi> Psal. 103.13, 14, <hi>And spareth them, as a father his son that serveth him,</hi> Mal. 3.17, hath more tender bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els than a mother. Isa. 49.15. <hi>Can a woman forget her sucking-child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.</hi> Christ is not as the slothful man thought, a cruel and hard Master, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.24, that looks for much work, and gives little encouragement; but is moved with compassion towards his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.27, he will not have his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants complain that they serve an hard Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</p>
            <p n="12">12. He is a meek and lowly Master, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descending to serve his Servants here and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

               <hi>Matt.</hi> 20.28, <hi>He came not to be ministred unto, but to minister.</hi> Luke 22.27, <hi>Whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.</hi> He stoopt so low as to wash his Disciples feet.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hereafter; Luke 12.37, <hi>Blessed are those servants, whom the Lord, when he cometh, shall find watching: Verily I say unto you, That he shall gird himself, and make them sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.</hi> Study, but yet expect not to understand, either the comfort or condescention of this promise, made to the faithful Servants of Christ; <hi>He shall

Think what it is for Christ himself to serve at the Table; what is it but infinite delight for the guests to have him set himself to solace them, who is infinite, as in sweetness, so in knowledg, to make his sweetness please them. Nor will the dignity of these Servants be less than their delight, who have Majesty it self to serve them: certainly in Heaven there shall be as many Kings as Subjects.</p>
            <p n="13">13. He is a tender and compassionate Lord; <hi>He was made like unto his brethren in all things, sin excepted; and having suffered himself, being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted,</hi> Heb. 2.18. <hi>We have not an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priest, that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin,</hi> Heb 4.15, and 5.2, <hi>Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and them that are out of the way.</hi> He cannot only <gap reason="foreign">

He is sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of his servants wrong, when tempted, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 2.20, <hi>To seduce my servants</hi>) as well as fensible of their grief when wronged and persecuted; in all their afflictions he is afflicted, and takes the wrongs offered to his
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:34951:115"/>
Servants as offered to himself; they that hurt them, touch the apple of his eye: he covers with the mantle of his excusing-love, their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="14">14. He is a most loving and sociable Master, who puts his Servants upon nothing but what himself hath done, or doth before them; he first practiceth what he imposeth on them. He lays no yoke upon them but what he himself hath born; leads them in no way, but himself hath first trodden it: He is not like the <hi>Pharisees</hi> who bind heavy burdens upon others, but will not touch them with one of their fingers, <hi>Matt.</hi> 23.4; but he does as <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech,</hi> Judg. 9.48, <hi>What ye have seen me do, make hast, and do as I have done:</hi> or as <hi>Tully</hi> reports of <hi>Caesar,</hi> that he was never heard to say to his Soldiers, <hi>Ite illuc,</hi> but <hi>venite huc.</hi> So Christ leads by example, his voice is follow me, <hi>Iuvat idem, qui jubet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15. He is a good Master. As he bears part in their sufferings, and is a fellow-sufferer; so he is not only their Lord and Master, but their helper and fellow-worker; whatever he impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses on them, he helps and furnishes them to do it; he puts them to no work, wherein he doth not help them. Herein he goes beyond all other Masters, who can toil and task their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants sufficiently, but cannot strengthen them. Christ encourages and assists them in their work; when they grow faint and weary, he strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:34951:115"/>
them; when doubtful, he teaches them; when slothful, sometimes indeed he corrects them, but not to kill, but quicken them; not to destroy them, but their sloth: when they are sick, he pities and spares them; when old, he turns them not out of his service, but the longer they live in it, the more they love it, yea, the more able they are to perform it: In a word, when they dye, he neither suffers them to lye still, nor sends them to seek another Master; for then they change not their Master for another, but their work for a better; or rather for their wages, <hi>Psal.</hi> 138.3. <hi>Isa.</hi> 40<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 28, 29, 30, 31. <hi>Ioel.</hi> 2.29.</p>
            <p n="16">16. He is a most faithful Master; he keeps, secures and vindicates all his Servants, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves them and provides for them, gives them all things pertaining to life and godliness, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4, comforts them with exceeding great and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promises; he feeds them with his own flesh and blood, he clothes them with his own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, he directs them with his own spirit; his Servants shall want no good thing, they shall neither pine for want, nor surfeit with abundance; they shall never have so much, or so little, as to make them unfit for service; Christ loves to keep them in working case. How can a Servant of Christ want provision, when as he can make his very work meat and drink unto him; nay, his wants meat and drink? How can they want, whose friend hath, and is all things? A Servant of Christ may be sick,

there shall be weeping and wailing, and gnashing of teeth. He that knew his Lords will, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes,</hi> Luk. 12.47. 1 Thes. 1.8. <hi>He will come in flaming fire to take vengeance on his adversaries.

            <p n="20">20. He is a most desirable and incomparable Lord, and such a Master as the world never knew; for he makes all his faithful servants sharers with him in his wealth and honour. <hi>They shall enter into the joy of their Lord,</hi> Mat. 25.21. Sit in Thrones with him, wear never-fading Crowns, and inherit his everlasting Kingdom. They that now follow him, shall be where he is, and the same glory he hath they shall have for ever. <hi>Cadit mundus, non cadit Christianus, quia non cadit Christus.</hi> Aust. Let the world fall, yet a Christian falls not, as long as Christ stands. Whereas Satan chuses the subtillest he can find, and leaven'd through, to do his work, and send on his errand; for he cannot make a <hi>Mercury</hi> out of every block; he is not able to give a man understanding, wisdom and abilities for his work, neither can he increase or improve any mans parts and gifts; he must have instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ready to his hand; he can but put them forward, and tempt them; he will give such as are strong and crafty, many motives to serve him,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:34951:117"/>
but he cannot furnish them with strength or craft to serve. But our Lord Christ sometimes chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the simplest, the meanest, the plainest men, fisher-men, to do his work; for he can give gifts to men which they have not, and raise the parts which they have, he can make himself a <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> a messenger out of any block; Christ can send a fool of his errand, and cause him to do it wisely. He can cause the stammering tongue to speak plain, and the plainest man to speak the highest Rhetorick; when <hi>Moses</hi> complains of a slow tongue, he can say, <hi>I will be thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say,</hi> Exod. 4.12. If he finds us not fit to do his business, he can make us fit. If Christ please, he can make a man master of his trade, before or as soon as ever he is ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to it.</p>
            <p>Thus without the wisdom of the world, Christ overcomes the wisdom of the world, and <hi>by the foolishness of Preaching</hi> (as men count foolishness) <hi>saveth those that believe,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.21. The foolishness of God is wiser than men, <hi>i.e.</hi> those instruments which Christ employs, how foolish soever men count them, shall foil all the wisdom of man.</p>
            <p>Uses of this Doctrine, <hi>That Christ is a true Believers Lord and Master.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. Use of Information and Instruction.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It informs us that Christ is Lord as well as Jesus, our Soveraign as well as our Saviour. He

is both Lord and Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.36. And we are not only to look at benefit by him, but ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to him; and not only come to him (as <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedees</hi> Sons, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.35.) saying, <hi>Master, we would that thou shouldst do for us whatsoever we shall desire</hi>; but with <hi>Saul,</hi> fall at his feet, saying, <hi>Lord, what wouldst thou have us to do?</hi> we will do for thee whatsoever thou shalt command. We should not only come to him for ease for our souls, but to take his yoke on our necks and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28, 29. Men would have Christ to redeem them, and Satan rule them; Christ to save, &amp; sin to lord it.

               </gap>, <hi>We will not have this man to reign over us,</hi> Luk. 19.14. there it sticks, the carnal mind is enmity to the Law; lust cannot endure restraint, and therefore men most oppose Christs <hi>Nomothetick</hi> power; and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal hearts are ready to say, our lips are our own, who is lord over us? to be controul'd for every word, every thought, every action, we cannot endure it.

            <p n="2">2. It's not enough to be in the Church, and outwardly admitted and stiled Christs servants, but we must be really his, and in heart; Christ
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:34951:118"/>
keeps no servants only to wear a livery cloak for security in sinning. As he is not a titular Lord, so neither are his servants titular servants; to speak service, and live in opposition to him; to call him master, and do the work of his enemy; to be in the skin a Christian, and in the core a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; to have an outside verbal complimental profession, and contradict it with an unholy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, is no better than a renouncing of Christ. 'Tis no advantage to bear the marks of Christ in our bodies, and to have no fruit of it in our souls; this is but to clothe our selves with the leaves of the vine, without partaking of the sap. Paganism and loose profession, shall fare alike when Christ comes to judgment.</p>

            <p n="4">4. It may inform us what the state of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is:</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is not his own, not <hi>sui juris,</hi> but a servant to Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. <hi>Ye are not your own</hi>; and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.22. He that is most free in other respects, is Christs servant; no man can have any propriety in himself, or power over himself; but what is derived from this absolute Lord, and stands in full subordination to him: Therefore it belongs to Christ to be the absolute disposer of us and all things; he may do with his own what he pleases, and use it to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his own will; who would interpose, or any way hinder Christ from the free disposal of his own? not any co-partner, for there is none<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor we our selves, for we are wholly his, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not possible for him to do us any wrong however he shall use us; therefore no man should repine at his disposal of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but all should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce in his disposing will; nor do any thing for selfish ends, which is injurious to the will or interest of Christ. Christ hath full power to do what he lift with us or ours: How far should any of his servants be from expecting that he should give an account of any of his actions to them? it should suffice them, that whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls them, it is from the Lord. <hi>The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away</hi>; whensoever he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves any comforts: if we find our selves too ready to say to instruments, as the owners of

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Neither are the good things we possess, our own; he that is not owner of himself, is owner of nothing; all that we have is properly his, as well as we; for no man can have more title to any thing than to himself; we have not any thing, nor can have, which is not as much from Christ as we, so is not as much his. Therefore we should not dispose of any thing we have, but for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest and ends; how careful and wary should we be in using the Creatures! all the comforts we enjoy are the goods of this Lord; we are but stewards of them; what we use must be used for, not against our Lord. Learning, riches, honour, are from him, and therefore should be for him; all our enjoyments are but borrowed, we must therefore use them well; not spot or stain, not tear and cut them by sin, lest we be ashamed when we should return them back to the owner, and give him an account of them, it may be with joy, and not with grief.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Neither may any Christian think himself Lord of the Church, or his Brethren, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3.

It doth not only forbid the abuse of their authority, or imperiously commanding of their own inventions, instead of the Doctrine of the Gospel; or carping Magisterially and insolently towards Gods people, (as <hi>Amet.</hi>) But the use of that authority in the Ecclesiastical office, which it is lawful for Princes to exercise towards their subjects, (saith <hi>Beza</hi>) <hi>Omnes enim esse unius legislatoris &amp; domini servos, &amp;c.</hi> Have Ministers no authority? Yes, saith he, not over the consciences of men, but only as messengers of Christ, whose is all the power of commanding. No Church, no Council can make Laws but in Christ, the compound and the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple word are used (one by <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> the other by <hi>Luke</hi>) in the same sense; so that <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. As a Christian no man hath civil power over his Brother, or the Church, or over men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.26. <hi>It shall not be so among you,</hi> that as the Gentiles exercise authority and dominion over them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As a Christian, he hath no legislative, but only applicative power, or executive in the Church; a Christian must not make Laws in his house, but keep and execute his Laws.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As such, He hath no coercive power over his fellow servants.</p>
            <p>That natural or civil power that any Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an hath otherways over his Brother, is to rule under, for, and according, or like to Christ, <hi>Philemon</hi> 16. <hi>Not now as a servant but above a servant, a brother, beloved, especially to me, How

            <p>Only Christ can ordain laws to bind the Conscience; mans laws bind not as they are mans, but as they are back't by Christ; nor can any but Christ so give laws to which we should be obedient, as withal to make us obedient to the laws which he gives. Christ only can write his laws in the heart: No man should prefer the will or interest of the greatest mortal man or dearest friend, nor the publick interest of States, before, or plead it against the will and interest of this great Lord.</p>
            <p>Neither may we give nor receive ambitious or flattering titles of honour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23 8, 9, 10, <hi>Be not ye called Masters, for one is your Lord and Master, even Christ:</hi> we should so acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg a superiority among men, as to be fearful of causing pride in them, and that they may know themselves not to be absolute Lords, but derivatively and <hi>secundum quid.

            <p n="5">5. It informs us therefore how consistible Christs service is with the service of others.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It dissolves not, but confirms natural and civil Lordship and subjection, as between ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This our relation to Christ as master, regulates the service of others: <hi>Children obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.</hi> Eph. 6.1. For the Lord is the author of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Fathers, and therefore we must yield such obedience as he will have us.

and bondage of the Law; but a Son, having received the adoption by Christ, the eternal Son of God, who was sent to redeem us, that he might purchase, and graciously communicate the right of sonship, (which he hath by nature) to every true believer. <hi>And because ye are Sons, God hath sent forth the spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba father.</hi> We are in such sort free, and so set at liberty, as that we must be governed by the Spirit of Christ which reigneth in our hearts, and teacheth us the true service of the Father; but this is not to serve, but rather to enjoy true liberty, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh Sons and Heirs.</p>

            <p n="2">2. The practices of vile and wicked men. We should make it our business and only Plot to promote his honour and service in the world, and endure nothing that would eclipse and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair his glory: He who touches that, should touch the apple of our eye; look upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach

as cast upon our selves, mourning for that dishonour offered to him which we cannot redress; 'tis against both Christianity and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ingenuity, to suffer him to be abused whom we have undertaken to serve: This neither agrees with honesty nor honour; 'tis indeed not only a sin but a shame: Hardly is any Servant so low spirited, as to think it consistent with his credit to serve a disgraced Master<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they that truly call Christ Lord, will never endure that his glory should suffer from others, much less from themselves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our own unsuitable practices. <hi>A servant of Christ must not be a son of Belial</hi>; every one is under a yoke still; Christ does not give his servants leave to sin, but liberty to serve God; Christ came not to free us from the Law, but sin; from the service of the Devil, not from the service of God: He came not to make the Law less strict, or sin less odious, or us less holy; freedom from wrath and Hell is a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, but from duty and obedience is none; because we are made free by Christ, we are to be more apt and ready to discharge the duty we owe to God and man: <hi>in maxima libertate minima licentia,</hi> a great deal of liberty by Christ, and yet the strongest ingagement to service that may be.

Those that addict themselves to strong and inordinate desires of liberty, which is the worst slavery; that will not submit to his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; quarrelling at duties rather than performing them; thinking it a kind of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness to be free: and that there is no freedom but in sinning, and following the bent and sway of their own hearts, and being Lords of their own actions; and dream of an exemption from all kind of Law, but their own lusts; they would he above all checks and controul, and have scope and room for their own lusts. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise themselves liberty,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.19. Men would have it at this, to be at their own dispose, and to be answerable to none that would call them to account, and therefore that will not obey his laws and commands.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Such as in a proud contempt and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy against reproof and instruction, do cast off all respect and obedience to Christ; they cannot endure restraints, are as bullocks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accustomed to the yoke, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.18. Are all for breaking bonds and dissolving cords. <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.4. Bursting the yoke altogether. <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.5. They cannot endure to hear of denying their fashions, renouncing their lusts and pleasures forsaking their vain, worldly, wanton thoughts, and ways; what every thought, every desire, every word, must be under a Law! So much time spent in duties, such gravity in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, such awe in their speeches! No vain
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:34951:124"/>
licentious Spirits will not be clogged and yoked thus, <hi>what a weariness is it,</hi> Mal. 1.13. Sacrifice upon Sacrifice, such waiting upon God they cannot endure, their spirits are impatient, and recoil with the more violence upon reproof; and storm and vex, which argues much non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>subjection to the Lord Christ. <hi>Hear ye and give ear, be not proud, Ier.</hi> 13.15. These are flat refusers. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.14. <hi>We will not have this man to reign over us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Such as name themselves Christs servants, and are content to wear his livery, but do not mind this state cordially, and follow it constantly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such as are ignorant concerning the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, manner and points of this service. How shall men serve one whom they know not? He that knows not his Landlord cannot pay his Rent; they follow the fashion of the Country, and in a blind superstitious manner conform to the worship of the place, not considering why, nor whom it is they serve, but offer sacrifice, as the <hi>Athenians</hi> to the unknown God; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship an Idol rather than Christ: or as Christ tells the <hi>Samaritans, ye worship ye know not what.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Fair promisers and pretenders, but slow performers; as, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.30. When his father bid him, <hi>go work to day in my Vineyard,</hi> he answered, <hi>I go sir, and went not:</hi> so many whose service is like <hi>Ephraims</hi> goodness, <hi>Hosea</hi> 6.4. As a morning cloud and early dew, it
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:34951:124"/>
quickly vanisheth, but let us take heed we do not gloze with him, as we do one with another; nor flatter him with our lips, when our heart is far from him; we are deceived, if we think that this Lord will be mocked with hollow and empty promises and protestations. We live in a wonderous complemental age, wherein scarce any other word is so ready in every mouth, as your servant, and at your service, when all is but meerly formal without any purpose; or many times not so much as a single thought of doing any serviceable office to those men, to whom we profess so much service. However we are one towards another, yet with the Lord there is no dallying, it behoveth us to be real; good words and fair speeches serve not our Lord Jesus Christ. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.18.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Partial, hypocritical, temporary servants. Some divide between the service of Christ and of sin, like the false mother that would have the child divided, as <hi>Cambden</hi> reports of <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald</hi> King of the East <hi>Saxons,</hi> the first Prince of this Nation that was Baptized; yet in the same Church, he had one Alter for Christian Religion, another for Heathenish. So too many are of Mungril Religion, halting between Christ and <hi>Baal. Heteroclites</hi> in Religion, this is to set the Ark of God and <hi>Dagon</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; which God will never endure, he came not for one half of thy heart, if Sin and <hi>Devil</hi> have the other half.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:34951:125"/>How much hypocrisy is there in men! many like the Souldiers, that bowed to Christ, and mocked him, give their outsides to Christ, their insides to all uncleanness; that as <hi>Luther</hi> saith of <hi>Cain,</hi> give <hi>opus personae Deo,</hi> but not <hi>personam</hi>; their cap and knee to God, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to all sin and iniquity; this is the Capital sin of this age. And then how many are but temporary, of whom we may justly say, what <hi>Nabal</hi> did unjustly of <hi>David,</hi> there are many servants now-adays that break away every man from his Master. Yesterday Gods people, and to day are turned knaves. <hi>Better they had never known the way of Righteousness,</hi> 2 Peter 2.21. A relapse makes their condition worse. He that first served sin, and then turned to the service of Christ, and afterwards falls again to the service of sin, proclaims to all the World that he esteems that better; O how great affront is this to Christ! <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.66. <hi>From that time many of his disciples went away, and walked no more with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Such are to be reproved, that lay claim to this honourable title, and yet indeed serve other masters. There are many of whom we may say too truly, as it is Recorded of the <hi>Samaritans.</hi> 2 Kings 17.33. <hi>They feared the Lord, and served their own gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Some serve themselves and not Christ, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t up themselves as Idols, and do what seems <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

their rule, their lust their Law. This is (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) self-worship, self-Idolatry, which is the greatest and worst of all; It is the greatest curse under Heaven, for God to give a man over to himself to live as he list, <hi>Psal.</hi> 81.11, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.26. the judgment of the hardned <hi>Iews</hi> and blinded <hi>Gentiles.</hi> We read of one given over to the Devil for his good, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>5, but never any given over to himself, but for his damnation. <hi>Austin</hi> prays, <hi>libera me domine a memetipso,</hi> self is mans greatest and most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous enemy; we are naturally self-destroyers; without self-denyal, no Salvation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Those that serve men, not the Lord. Not that it is contrary to the service of Christ, to be in that civil relation or subjection to men, as servants to their Masters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But as the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23. <hi>Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.</hi> That is, (saith <hi>Ambrose</hi>) subject not your consciences to the superstitious inventious of men in Gods worship, that build their Religion on mans bare Authority, as <hi>Papists</hi>; or be not servants to the lusts of wicked men; such are reproved as serve men, when they run in a cross line to Gods will. Such were the subjects of <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> that at the command of the King, worshipped the golden image, and served the King, not the Lord; such was <hi>Pilate,</hi> that for fear of dipleasing <hi>Caesar,</hi> delivered up Christ to be crucified though he knew him to be innocent; such were the Nobles of <hi>Cambyses,</hi> who having
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:34951:126"/>
a lust to marry his own Sister; He sends for all his Counsel, and asked them, if they had any Law in <hi>Persia,</hi> to allow him to marry his own Sister? They answered that there was no such Law; but yet there was another Law, that the Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> might do what they list; these Nobles were slaves to the lust of <hi>Cambyses.</hi> O that we had not many amongst us, that sell their Consciences, and their Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their Salvation, to be Panders to the lustful, covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ambitious desires of great men: men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers, and men pleasers, are worthy of sharp reprehension, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Such as serve not the Lord, but their own belly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.18, <hi>Whose god is their belly. Phil.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Love their pleasures more than God</hi>; that serve and fulfill the lusts of the flesh; such an one that <hi>lives in pleasure, is dead while he lives,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.6. Ye cannot make provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof, and fulfill the will of God too, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>ult.</hi> to rot in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, makes men utterly uncapable of serving the Lord, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.3. Serving divers lusts and pleasures, which is the worst slavery; to walk after our own lusts, is to seek to cherish that which Christ came to destroy; and so go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to defeat our Redeemer, and hinder him from obtaining his purpose in our hearts: What a Christian and yet sensual! A Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and yet proud! A Christian believing in Christ, a man of sorrows, and yet given to pleasures! What a Christian and yet worldly!</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:34951:126"/>4. Such as serve the world, and yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to serve Christ: Christ tells you it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be; <hi>Ye cannot serve God and Mammon, Mat.</hi> 6.24. 'tis impossible to join these toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Those that are slaves to the <hi>Naaman</hi> of iniquity, that do not only possess money, but are possessed of money; that with <hi>Iudas</hi> will sell Christ for thirty pieces of silver; that rise early and lye down late, and eat the bread of carefulness; that will compass Sea and land to get gain; these make gold their God; their covetousness is justly termed Idolatry, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. Alas, my Brethren, what is their in the world that it should be so much coveted, and heaven slighted? What hath the world done for its most faithful servants? How oft have we heard them complaining at last, O the world hath deceived me, and undone me; it flattered me in my prosperity, and now utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cast me off in my necessity? Ah, if I had served the Lord as faithfully as I have served the world, he would not have cast me off at last, nor have left me thus comfortless and hopeless in my depth of misery.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Time-servers, that change their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the times, are not servants of the Lord; their Religion is like a piece of wax, to be moulded into any frame, according as the times alter: Such as will be Superstitious if the times be so; that will be devout or athei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical according to the times. It was the speech of a time-server, that was said to be spoken
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:34951:127"/>
by the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> to <hi>Beza, That he would lanch no further into the sea of Religion, than he might be sure to return safe in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> This is the right Picture of a time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server; as many turned <hi>Protestants</hi> in K. <hi>Edward</hi>'s days, and <hi>Papists</hi> in Q. <hi>Maries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, Those that serve the worst Master, that is sin. 'Tis indeed one thing to be a sinner, and another to be the servant of sin; that is, one that gives himself over to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of sin, that is bound Apprentice to sin. The difference was great between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Ahab<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Paul</hi> was sold under sin, but it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his will; but <hi>Ahab</hi> sold himself will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to work wickedness: How many such servants of sin are there, as the Centurions ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant served him, if sin bid go, they go; such servants are swearers and drunkard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, that are at the service of their oaths and cups. This is a most shameful and pernicious service, for it is to serve the Devil, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.44. O that the world would believe this, that when they serve this or that lust, they serve the Devil. <hi>Cyprian</hi> brings in the Devil upbraiding Christ, <hi>Ostende mihi tet servos, qui tibi, &amp;c.</hi> Shew me, if thou canst, so many servants that have served thee so diligently and willingly, as I can shew that have served me.

Is Christ such a Lord as you have heard? then let every one of us be prevailed with to take him for our Lord, and give up our selves to him, and become his servants this day; we must either resign up our selves to this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Lord, or we cannot be true Christians, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. this is the essence of Christianity, and life of Religion, and marrow of Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

That which will be enquired after at the great day, is not who owned Christ as Lord in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, but who honoured Christ as Lord by real subjection and resignation of themselves unto him: The great question will be, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did Christ reign over us, and bring us under his Law and Dominion; and upon the decision of this important question depends the

everlasting state of our souls and bodies in the next world. If you now say unto Christ, We are Lords, we will not come at thee; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from us, we desire not the knowledg of thy ways; or as <hi>Pharoah, Who is the Lord, that I should obey him?</hi> He will say unto you at the last day, <hi>Depart from me ye cursed, I know you not</hi>; nor will your crying, Lord, Lord, then any thing avail you. O then let it be your resolution now to resign your selves to this gracious Saviour; take him for your Lord and Soveraign; <hi>Kiss the Son, serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</hi> O that your hearts would once at last say, as 'tis foretold of Gospel times, <hi>Isa.</hi> 44.5. <hi>I am the Lords, other Lords have had dominion over me, but henceforth by thee only will I make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy name.</hi> Isa. 26.13, <hi>We will not say any more to the work of our hands, nor to the lusts of our hearts,</hi> (to the world, the flesh, or to sin) <hi>ye are our gods, for with thee (O Lord) poor lost creatures find mercy,</hi> Hos. 14.3.

Have you found or ever heard of any thing in him that may deter you? what iniquity have you seen in him that you keep at distance from him, and walk after vanity? Is he not worthy of your love? not good enough to be your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster? can you bestow your selves better? em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy your selves more profitably? what sticks it at? would you take time to consider of it, and defer your resolutions to another day? so you have done too long already, and ventur'd too far by your delays: <hi>To day if you will hear his voice, then harden not your hearts: Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near</hi>: He now saith, <hi>hearken unto me, and I will make a covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David: Encline your ear, come unto me: Hear, and your soul shall live: why do you spend your money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which satisfieth not?

Take heed how you refuse him that speaks from heaven; do not (as you want Christ) despise this loving invitation, and make light of this gracious offer, lest his wrath be kindled in his breast, and you perish. He that hath so long held forth his Scepter of Grace, yet stands waiting for your return, yet stretcheth forth his arms to embrace you, yet opens his very heart to entertain you: Hark, he bids you come and lodg your souls in his warm bosom; yet he calls by his Word, yet he strives by his Spirit; and follows you with checks of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and renews his mercies on you every morning; would fain draw you with cords of love, if it would be. But it will not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thus, his patience will not always wait; his Spirit shall not always strive with man; the door of mercy shall not always stand open; <hi>When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us</hi>; then 'tis too late, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.25.

            <p>This is my business with you (my beloved) at this time; this is mine errand to your Souls: What answer shall I return from you to him that sent me? The great work (you know) of us Ministers, is to perswade men to become Christs covenanting Servants, to consent to his Laws, and acknowledg his Lordship; our way to win your hearts, is to tell you what he is; some little hath been spoken, but not the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand part of the excellencies of this incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lord; <hi>O he is the chiefest of ten thous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that he may be your Lord.</p>
            <p>This being a matter of greatest importance, <hi>and knowing the terror of the Lord, let me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade you</hi>; for that end I intreat you, to press upon your selves, and improve in your retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, these considerations as motives.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Motive. Yeild up your selves to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Lord Christ, or you are unjust, you do him open wrong. Equity and justice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires

that you render to all their due; <hi>jus cui<expan>

                  </expan> tribuere,</hi> is the first and most proper act of justice; <hi>Tribute to whom tribute, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour,</hi> Rom. 13.7. It is a common principle among you, which nature teacheth, that you deal righteously with men, owe no man any thing, do no man wrong; let every one have that which of right appertaineth to him: And if we may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unto <hi>Caesar</hi> the things that are <hi>Caesars,</hi> it is but right we should also give unto God the things that are Gods by so many just titles. Why now, you cannot without apparent wrong to Christ deny him your selves; you are his, and owe your selves unto him, and all you have, and all that you can do; you are not your own but his. I lay claim unto you in the name of Christ, and challenge your souls and bodies to his use; Dare you deny the claim? or will any step out and question this title? The Lord Jesus hath laid challenges to you. It has been a custom in <hi>England,</hi> on the Coronation day, as multitudes of people were feasting in <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-Hall,</hi> a Herald comes forth, and Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the King, and proclaimed his title to the Crown; and if any questioned his title, he was there ready to make it good.</p>
            <p>I do now proclaim to you, that Christ is your Lord, and you are his Servants, and challenges your service; if any question his Title, I will justifie it, and make it good, let the case come to tryal, on condition that whoever is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:34951:130"/>
shall yield subjection: Let me ask you then, Did not he make you, and not ye your selves, <hi>Psal.</hi> 95.6? and does not he preserve and sustain you? and ye are the Sheep of his pasture, <hi>Vers.</hi> 7? Did not Christ purchase you with his own blood, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18? Were you not the dearest purchase, and was not the greatest price paid for you that ever the world heard of? Well, what say you to this Title? Doth not justice give every one his own? and are not you Christs? If there be any creature in Heaven or Earth, that can lay a better claim, or pretend a juster Title to you than Christ, then let it have your hearts and service; but if the Lord Jesus have the full and sole right to you, then do not so much wrong him and your own souls, as to deny or withstand this just and reasonable motion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Give up your selves to this Lord, or you are unthankful; gratitude as well as justice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires this at your hands. Nothing is more abhorrent to an ingenuous spirit, than the brand of ingratitude, to be so base and unworthy as to render evil for good; <hi>ingratum si dixeris, omnia dixeris,</hi> call a man unthankful, and you call him all that's naught: abhor it as death, to be guilty or have the name of ingratitude.

freedom for him; Must not that man be wholly his, who hath ransomed him from the Gallows? This is our case, Sin was our work, and Death was our wages; we had sinned, and must dye for it; there was no escape from destruction: but the Lord Jesus would not suffer us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish, but debased himself, came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, gave himself for us, and suffered in our stead, that we might live; and made himself a Servant for us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though no way bound to us. Now judg with your selves, I appeal to your own Consciences, whether this incomparable favour do not lay an unavoidable obligation upon us, to devote our selves wholly to him? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15.

Lord, nor serve a better Master: There is nothing in him that can justly discourage you, nor reasonably deter you from his service; fear not evil from the greatest good, unless it be in a way of disobedience and rebellion. He is not a proud, rigid, imperious or cruel Master; he will not deal with you as the treacherous Master, the World, which fills your souls with nothing but husks and swill, and rewards all your painful services with nothing but disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and misery; at the best, presents you with a breast full of wind and vanity; and at the last with wo and vexation, and leaves you helpless in your greatest necessities. Nor is he cruel and tyrannical, as Satan, who fills his Servants with terror here, and hereafter rewards them with fire and brimstone. Nor like the flesh and sin, whose work is bad, and its wages no better; for the servant of sin, besides that he hath no fruit nor comfort of his service in the mean time, when he comes to receive his wages at the end of his term, findeth nothing but shame or death; shame if he leave his service; if he le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His service is freedom, and his work wages; to be Christs devoted servant, is not only better than liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but more to be desired than soveraignty: No other Lord ever bought his Servants so dear, or fed them so plentifully, or clad them so sumptuously, or used them so gently, or rewarded them so bountifully. He will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and prosper them, yea, takes pleasure in their prosperity; he will bless them with spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual blessings, which are the best blessings, and lead them by his own counsel, yea carry them in his bosome, and afterward receive them to glory.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

            <p n="5">5. Take Christ for your Lord, and own your selves for his Servants, for so you are, whether you will or not; your consent and resignation is necessary to your good, to ease you of your cares, and secure you from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent eternal misery, not for his title and right which is absolute and unquestionable, and he will have you either by love or by force. He requires in the Covenant of Grace, that he have his right by your consent, and not by constraint; that you thankfully accept the motion, and with hearty and full consent of will resign your selves to him as his own, even as his creatures and his ransomed ones, by a Covenant never to be violated.

Who would not desire to be ruled and guided by his Testimonies, rather than to be suppressed and destroyed by his Providence? We must all either bow the knee, or he will break the back; if we will not bear his yoke, we must become his footstool. Were it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to take hold of his strength by Faith, than his strength should take hold of us in displeasure and wrath? and to feel the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of his grace, than the power of his anger?

O do not thou lift up the heel against him, to whom thou must one day bow the knee; if thou wilt not now kiss the Son, thou shalt short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lick the dust of his feet; if thou be not now in the number of his willing people, in the day of the power of his grace; in the

            <p>But the way to secure your selves, and whatever is dear to you, is to give up all to Christ. He that loseth himself and his life, shall find it; and he that labours to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure himself another way, loseth all, <hi>Matt.</hi> 16.25. If you be his, you are happy; but if you be your own, you are most miserable. Can you support, preserve, or provide for your selves? who shall save you in the hour of temptation and distress? know ye not yet so much of your own insufficiency, and do ye not yet feel your selves to be such a daily burthen to your selves, that you have enough
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:34951:134"/>

            <p>Remember, that none in the world hath sufficient power, wisdom and goodness, to take the full care and charge of you, but Christ; none else can save you, or sanctifie you, or keep you alive one hour; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will be your happiness and honour, that you are his. He will use you only in safe and honourable services, and to no worse an end than your endless happiness.</p>
            <p>Consider a little, how unfit you are to be your own Lords, and how unable to govern your selves; so blind and ignorant, so byassed by a corrupt will, so turbulent are your pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, so uncessant and powerful is the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your sence and appetite, that 'twere as fit for a man to be govern'd by a servant, or a rider by his horse. But he is most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly fit to govern you and all the world; you can desire nothing reasonably in a Lord and Governor which is not in him: He hath perfect wisdom to know what is best; perfect goodness, and therefore will be most regardful of his subjects good, and will put no evil into his Laws; Almighty to protect his Servants, and see to the execution of his Laws: most just, and therefore can do no wrong; but all his Laws and judgments are equal and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial.

He is our very end, interest and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, our dearest friend and father, and therefore loves us better than we love our selves: and therefore we have greatest reason to submit to his Lordship, and obey him, as one that rules us to our own felicity.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Let him be your Lord to rule and save you, or you must needs perish everlastingly; it's a folly to think Christ should save you, while you serve his enemies: in vain do you expect the dignities and priviledges that come by Christ, and not submit to the duties and services that are due to Christ. <hi>He is the author of salvation to them that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5.9. The Gospel is a message of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life only to those to whom it is a rule of spiritual life; and the true believer does not only cast himself into the arms of Christ to be saved; but also casts himself at Christs feet to serve him: never man had Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
