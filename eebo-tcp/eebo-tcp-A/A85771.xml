         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving ever been ambitious to ſerve you, and alwayes deſirous to have you with us, I have
thought it part of my love and ſervice to acquaint you with our proceedings here in <hi>Portſmouth;</hi>
where Colonell <hi>Goring</hi> our Generall hath declared himſelfe for the King, and the whole
Towne and Garriſon; Colonell <hi>Goring</hi> hath a Commiſſion, for the raiſing of Horſe and Foot
from the King: And if you pleaſe to bend your ſelfe this way, 'twill bee as honourably and
well taken, as if you ſhould bend your courſe to the North: alſo if you intend to meet the
King, I think you will aſſoone doe it here as any where, for his Majeſty is here expected; The
condition is thus, If you raiſe horſe and bring them in here, levie money there is as yet none allowed, but this be
ſure, you ſhall receive your own entertainment as Captane; you ſhall have conduct money, and halfe a crown
a day for every horſe; here you ſhall finde all your old friends, Captain <hi>Donnell</hi> Lievtenant Colonell, Captaine
<hi>Bellinghim,</hi> Captain <hi>Burgeſſe,</hi> my ſelfe, with many others of your acquaintance: ſtirre up your ſelfe and write to all
your friends, and try how ſtrong you can make your ſelf, you may write to Mr <hi>Manington</hi> and the reſt of your
friends the Catholiks and Divines about you, and ſee if they will furniſh you with each a horſe and a man; as for
Armes here is none, therefore you muſt furniſh your ſelf at <hi>Briſtow</hi> or otherwhere, for all other things, Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Artillery here is enough; you muſt provide your ſelfe with two Trumpeters, if they be three they ſhall be
welcome; as for Armes you will have them better cheap and with leſſe trouble at <hi>Briſtow</hi> than at <hi>London.</hi> Send
this newes with all ſpeed to Captaine <hi>Charles Price,</hi> and tell him that the Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi> is our Generall of the
horſe, and ſee what horſe he will ſet you forth with, for I doubt not, but he will forward you in the buſineſſe; the
journey is not long, <hi>Chicheſter</hi> is in the midway, but faile not to ſend away a truſty Meſſenger whether you
will come or no, that the place may be kept open for you, for I have engag'd my ſelfe that there ſhall be an anſwer
in fourteen dayes. Thus hoping of your reſpect to my care I reſt with my true love, and Captaine <hi>Burgeſſe</hi> his
