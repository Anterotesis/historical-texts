            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough that which is foretold in these two Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and namely in the fourth and fifth verses of
this Chapter, was in part fulfilled when the people
of God returned from Captivitie in <hi>Babylon</hi> at the
end of seventie yeares: yet we must not limit the
place to that time onely, but may extend it further
to the dayes of the Gospel, and the spirituall return, not of the Jews
onely, but of the Gentiles also, when men shall be converted from
Pagan, Antichristian, Babylonish, or Jewish bondage and capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie,
or from slavery to sinne, and self-righteousnesse, and shall be
joyned to God in the fellowship of his Church, in the dayes of the
New Testament. For as some passages in this Scripture were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
fully accomplished at the returne from the captivitie of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventie
yeares, and namely this, that the children of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
should returne both together: (for the ten tribes returned not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57319:3"/>
at all:) so many things that literally concerned the Jewes were
types and figures, signifying the like things concerning the people
of God in these latter dayes: In which respect sincere converts
are called Jewes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 29. and Israelites, <hi>Gal. 6. 16. Ioh.</hi> 1. 47.

of the returne of Christians from Romish slavery to the true Sion,
the Christian Church. And this may be added further, that this
place seemes not onely to be meant of the private or personall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of this or that particular Christian, but also further, of the
open and joynt calling of a company, because it is said, they shall
come, the children of <hi>Israel</hi> and the children of <hi>Iudah</hi> together, and
that their saying shall not be, <hi>Let me joyne, &amp;c.</hi> but in the Plurall

            <p>Concerning which Covenant with God, it will not be amisse for
the better understanding of that which followes; first, briefly to
shew how diversly Covenant is taken in the Scripture, which
sometimes i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ports generally any firme appointment or promise

againe: Thus the preserving of <hi>Noah</hi> in the Arke, and of the

                  </gap>as;</hi> the setting forth of the Shew-bread every Sabbath
before the Lord, and the giving of the heave-offering unto the
Priests, are said to be done by a Covenant, or an everlasting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 18. &amp; 9. 9. 10. 11. <hi>Ier. 33. 20. Num. 25.

                  </gap>. 24. 8. Num.</hi> 18. 19. But sometimes Covenant is
taken more strictly and properly, for an agreement which God
doth make with men, when he promiseth some blessing unto men,
and bin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es them to performe some dutie backe againe to him.
Taken thus it hath two parts: first, a promise or stipulation of
some blessing on Gods part: secondly, Restipulation or promise,
or bind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57319:3"/>
taken thus is either the Covenant of workes, or the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of grace: And againe the Covenant may be considered, first
as it is personall, private and particular, between God and one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
soule, making Covenant with God, and God with him, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at his first conversion, or at other times; of which we reade
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5. &amp; <hi>Psal. 119. 106. &amp; 66. 13, 14. &amp;</hi> 27. 8. &amp; <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.
7, 8 Secondly, it is generall and publick of a company joyntly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
of which this Text <hi>Ier.</hi> 50. 5. seemes most properly to
speake: as also that <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 9, 10, &amp;c. and that <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 5, 6,
and many others: A Covenant taken thus generally when it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
spirituall blessings, and spirituall duties, in the Communion
of Saints, is that which is called Church-covenant, which Church-Covenant
differs not in substance of the things promised from that
which is between the Lord and every particular soule, but onely
in some other respects; as first, the one is of one Christian in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
the other of a company joyntly together. Secondly, if
right Order be observed, a man ought not to enter into Church-Covenant,
till he be in Covenant with God before, in respect of
his personall estate. Thirdly, The one is usually done in private,
as in a mans Closet between the Lord and his soule, and the other
in some publick assembly. Fourthly, The one in these dayes is of
such duties as the Gospel requires of every Christian as a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
the other of such duties as the Gospel requires of every Church
and the members thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now concerning Church-Covenant, two things are to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the better understanding thereof: first, the description of
it: secondly, the use of it, and the benefit and fruit thereof. For
the former it may be thus described,</hi> viz. <q>A solemne and publick
promise before the Lord, whereby a company of Christians, called by the
power and mercy of God to fellowship with Christ, and by his providence
to live together, and by his grace to cleave together in the unitie of faith,
and brotherly love, and defirous to partake together in all the holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of God, doe in confidence of his gracious acceptance in Christ,
binde themselves to the Lord, and one to another, to walke together by
the assistance of his Spirit, in all such wayes of holy worship in him and
of edification one towards another, as the Gospel of Christ requireth of
every Christian Church, and the members thereof.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In this description, there are compr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed six things: First the
generall name of the thing: [<hi>a solemne and publick promise</hi>] a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57319:4"/>
it is, and therefore it is called, a joyning in Covenant here:
an entring into Covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 10. Solemne and publick,
and therefore it is by the children of <hi>Israel</hi> and the children of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
together: and they say, <hi>let us joyne.</hi> Secondly, The object
<hi>[the Lord, and one another] joyne our selves to the Lord.</hi> it is not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
onely to man, but to the Lord himselfe, and likewise to one
another; for, <hi>come let us joyne,</hi> implyes mutuall consent together.
Thirdly, The Agents or the qualification of the persons: [<hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>]
not Turkes, Indians, &amp;c. Saints, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 5. 16, 17. [<hi>called
to fellowship with Christ</hi>] so 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9. else if they be not united to
Christ by faith, they are not fit materialls for such a building as a
Church of God, which is the house of the living God, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 1.
1 <hi>Cor. 1. 2. Phil. 1. 1. Rev.</hi> 21. 27. [<hi>By his providence to live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>]
else they cannot partake in the Lords Ordinances together
as Churches ought to doe, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 23. Act.</hi> 14. 27. the whole
Church comes together in one place [<hi>cleaving together in faith and
love</hi>] so <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 32. If they differ, namely, in opinion, or in their
affection, and should joyne in this Covenant, breaches, factions,

things so unlike would not close nor long hold together, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 43
[<hi>Desirous to partake in all Ordinances</hi>] this should be the ground of
their joyning in Covenant together, <hi>Psal.</hi> 110. 3. willing: and
not pride, nor gaine, nor the like: Fourthly, The Act [<hi>binde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi>]
that now they are bound by their owne word and promise,
that they may say now, as <hi>Psal. 56. 12. Thy vowes are upon me,</hi> or
as <hi>Num.</hi> 30. 2. if he binde his soule with a vow. Fiftly, The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

edification, as the Gospel requireth of Churches and Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>]
they binde not themselves to observe any devises of their
owne, nor inventions of men, but such things as the word of God
requireth; neither is it perfect obedience to the Law, for that were
impossible to performe, and presumption to promise; nor is it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in generall the duties of the Gospel, but specially such duties of
worship to God, &amp; edification of one another as concerne Church-State,
which now they enter into. Sixtly, The manner of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

and much more in such speciall matters of weight: If men in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into this Covenant looke for acceptance, through any worth
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57319:4"/>
of their owne, or promise dutie in their own strength, they shew
themselves like to the Pharisees, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 10, 11. and turne the
Church-Covenant into a Covenant of workes: and as many as are
of the workes of the Law, are under the curse, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
            <p>The use and benefit of this Church-Covenant, and the fruit
thereof, may be seene in two particulars; first, That this is that
whereby a company of Christians doe become a Church: It is the
Constituting forme of a Church. Secondly, This is that by taking
hold whereof a particular person becomes a member of a Church,
which was constituted afore. For the former of these; every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church must have in it both matter and forme, and as the
matter by Gods appointment are visible Saints, or visible belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
<hi>Ephes. 1. 1. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 2. and in the New Testament, onely so
many as may meete together in one Congregation: So the forme
is a uniting, or combining, or knitting of those Saints together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one visible body, by the band of this holy Covenant. Some uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or band there must be amongst them, whereby they come to
stand in a new relation to God, and one towards another, other
then they were in before: or els they are not yet a Church, though
they be fit materialls for a Church; even as soule and body are not
a man, unlesse they be united; nor stones and timber an house,
till they be compacted and conjoyned.</p>
            <p>Now that a company becomes a Church, by joyning in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
may be made good sundry wayes; first, By plaine Texts of
Scripture; as from <hi>Deut. 29. 1, 10, 11, 12, 13. Yee stand this day all
you before the Lord your God, your Captaines of your Tribes, your El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
your Officers, with all the men of Israel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> ver. 10. <hi>That thou shouldest
enter into Covenant with the Lord thy God,</hi> ver. 12. <hi>and he may establish
thee for a people unto himselfe,</hi> ver. 13. So that here is plain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y shewed,
that here was a company, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. and this company were to be
established to be a people unto the Lord, that is to say, a Church,
<hi>ver.</hi> 13. And this is done by the peoples entring into solemne Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with God, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. And therefore a company of people
doe become a Church by entring into Covenant with God.</p>
            <p>
               <q>This Covenant was not like our Church-Covenants,<note place="margin">Object. 1.</note> for it was of all
the Nation together; whereas the Church-Covenant with us, is of some
select persons, leaving out others.</q>
            </p>
            <p>1. This Objection concerns the matter of a Church,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> but the
Covenant is not the materiall cause of a Church, but the formall
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57319:5"/>
cause thereof: and for this the Text is plaine and expresse, that by
entring into Covenant with God, a people come to be the Lords
people, that is to say, his Church.</p>
            <p>2. If it was of all the people together, the reason was because
that Church was a nationall Church: now if a nationall Church
becomes a Church by entring into solemne Covenant with God,
then a Congregationall Church becomes a Church by the same
means; for there is no difference between them in this point.</p>
            <p>3. Though it was of all the people, we may not say it proves
that when we looke at the materiall cause of a Church, there may
be a promiscuous taking in of all Commers without distinction or
separation of the precious from the vile; for, first, when God took
in this Nation to be his people, he separated them from all the
Nations of the earth besides: so that there was a distinction and
separation of some from others. Secondly, this generation was
generally a generation of beleevers; for it was they that were to
enter into the land within a while after; for they were fortie yeares
in the Wildernesse, &amp; this Covenant, was made in the last moneth
save one of the last of those fortie yeares, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 3. And their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kasses
fell not in the Wildernesse through unbeliefe, as their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
did, <hi>Num. 14. Heb.</hi> 3. but entred by faith, and when they were
entred, subdued Kingdomes by their faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 33. and served
the Lord all the dayes of <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and of the Elders that outlived
<hi>Ioshua,</hi> Josh. 24. 31. As for that which is said of them, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5. of
this Chap. that the Lord had not given them eyes to see, &amp;c. that
proves not that they were wholly hardned in a carnall estate, but
onely that they were dull and slow of heart to consider of sundry
dispensations of God towards them; for as much is said of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Christ, <hi>Mar.</hi> 8. 17, 18. when doubtlesse they were not
meere carnall or naturall persons.</p>
            <p>
               <q>This people <hi>Deut.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Object. 2</note> 29. could not become the Lords people by entring
into sol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mne Covenant with God, for they were the Lords Church and
people already before this.</q>
            </p>
            <p>1. If they were,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> yet that was by entring into solemne Covenant
with God on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> when the Lord had brought them up
out of the Land of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> for then they entred into solemne Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with God, and God with them, and so they became the
Lords peculiar people, <hi>Exod. 19 4, 5, 6, 8. &amp;c.</hi> If they were his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
before that, yet that also was by Covenant made with them in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57319:5"/>
the loynes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> when God tooke him and his seede to be
his Church and people, yet separating <hi>Ishmael</hi> from <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi>
from <hi>Iacob,</hi> that the inheritance of the Covenant of God, and of
being the Church of God, might rest in the house of <hi>Iacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Yet it was not without great reason that the Lord should
now establish them by solemne Covenant to be a people to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
because the Nation had been much degenerated from the
spirit and wayes of <hi>Abraham</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and had broken that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
by their Idolatries there, <hi>Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

made in <hi>Sinai</hi> or <hi>Horeb</hi> when they were come out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> they
had also broken by their Idolatries in the Wildernesse, <hi>Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>k</hi> 20.
13, 16. for which causes, and the like, the Lord consumed that
generation, that they never entred into the Land, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 5. 4, 6.
And therefore now when their posteritie and children were ready
to enter in, the Lord entred into Covenant with them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
established them to be his people, their Fathers being cut off for
breaking the Covenant. But still it was by Covenant that both
Fathers first, and children afterward became a Church and people
unto God; and when this generation were entred into the Land,
their Covenant made before between God and them, was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by Circumcision, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 5. 3 7. they being not Circumcised
before.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But this Covenant was of the whole Church with God,<note place="margin">Object. 3</note> and therefore

            </p>
            <p>Our Church Covenants are with the Lord himselfe,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> as was

duties of edification one towards another, are but branches of the

to beborne, and prosely<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to them, <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15. Like as our Church-Covenants are with
them that now are, and that hereafter shall become members of
the same Church. When <hi>Iehojada</hi> made a Covenant between the
King and the people, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 11. 17. that Covenant was but a
branch of the Lords Covenant with them all, both King and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
for the King promised but to Rule the people righteously, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the will of God: and the people to be subject to the
King so Ruling. Now these duties of the King to them, and of
them to the King, were such as God required in his Covenant,
both of him and them: and so it is in Church-Covenant, the duties
of the Church to the members, and the members to the Church,
and one another, are no other but such as the Gospel and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of grace requireth both of the Church and the members of
it in their severall places.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But this place of <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. is not sufficient to prove a Church-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in these dayes:<note place="margin">Object. 4.</note> because it is in the Scriptures of the old Testament,
for whatsoever must be used in the dayes of the New T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>stament, must be
proved from the Scriptures of the New Testament, or else it is to be
layd aside.</q>
            </p>
            <p>1. The Church-Covenant may be proved from the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament<note place="margin">Answer.</note> also, as will afterwards appeare.</p>
            <p>2. But suppose there were not pregnant places for it in the New
Testament, yet it is not enough to prove the same unlawfull: for
whatsoever Ordinance of the old Testament is not repealed in the
New Testament, as peculiar to the Jewish Paedagogie, but was of
morall and perpetuall equitie, the same bindes us in these dayes,
and is to be accounted the revealed will of God in all ages, though
it be not particularly and expressely mentioned in the writings of
the New Testament, else how shall we prove it unlawfull for a
man to marry his Sister, or his Aunt? How shall we prove it war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
and necessary for Magistrates to punish Sabbath-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
blasphemy, and Idolatry? How shall we prove it lawfull to
apply the seale of Gods Covenant unto Infants? or to admit wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to eate of the holy things; for the Scriptures of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
doe speake little in these cases; onely the Scriptures of the
Old Testament doe give direction, and light about them, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.
<hi>&amp; 19. Neh. 13. 15. &amp;c. 2 Chron. 15. 16. &amp; 2 King. 23. Gen.</hi> 17. 2.
<hi>&amp; Exod.</hi> 12. 4. 6. And the New Testament hath nothing to the
contrary, and they are all according to morall equitie and reason,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57319:6"/>
and therefore they are to be observed from the Scriptures of the
Old Testament, as the revealed will of God, though there were
nothing expressely for them in the New. And the same we say of
the particular in hand. For, that a company should be combined
together into one body, in way of Government and subjection,
by way of mutuall free Covenant; as men doe when they enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Church Estate, nothing is more naturall or agr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eable to morall
equitie; nay, it implyeth a contradiction in the very name of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
or freedome, that free-men should take upon them authoritie
or power over free men without their free consent, and voluntary
and mutuall Covenant or Engagement. And therefore seeing this
Covenant is not repealed in the Scriptures of the New Testament,
the Scriptures of the Old are sufficient warrant for it.</p>
            <p>Another Scripture to prove the same, is <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 16, 17, 18.
with <hi>Deut. 27. 9. This day the Lord hath commanded thee to doe these
Statutes and Iudgements, thou shalt therefore keepe and doe them, &amp;c.
Thou hast avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, and to walke in his
wayes, and to keepe his Statutes, &amp;c. And the Lord hath avouched thee
this day to be his peculiar people; Take heed and hearken, O Israel, this
day thou art become the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ople of the Lord thy God.</hi> This Scripture
plainly shewes these things: 1. That here was the making of a
Covenant between God and man; for that avouching of God to
them, and them to God, was the making of Covenant, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. 18.
2. This was not of one person, but of a company together, the
whole people of <hi>Israel, 26. 18. &amp;</hi> 27. 9. 3 Here is the effect of this
Covenant, that thereby they become the Lords people, <hi>ver.</hi> 9.
So that when a company doe enter into holy Covenant with God,
they become thereby the Lords people, that is to say, his Church.
So <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16. 8. proves the same likewise: <hi>I ent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed into Covenant
with thee, saith the Lord, and thou becam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st mine.</hi> Here also is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Covenant between the Lord and men; and this Covenant
was not personall, but of a company; for it was with Hierusalem,
<hi>ver.</hi> 2. which was a whole Citie; it was with them that were mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied
as the bud of the seild, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. and it was with them that did
prosper into a kingdome, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. and therefore not meant onely
of any one particular person: And by this Covenant they became
the Lords; that is, the Lords Church and people; for it is expresly
said, <hi>I entred into Covenant with thee, and thou becamest mine.</hi> So that
when a company enter into Covenant with God, and God with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57319:7"/>
them, they become thereby the Lords Church and people. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<hi>Ezek. 20. 37. I will cause you to passe under the rod; and I will
bring you into the bond of the Covenant.</hi> In which place, there is first
mention of an holy Covenant. Secondly, This was not of one
person, but of a company, the whole house of Israel, <hi>ver.</hi> 30. 39.
Thirdly, And this Covenant is called a <hi>Bond,</hi> because it is by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
that a people are bound, and tyed, and knit together, as one
Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch, all of them unto the Lord, and one unto another; So that
the Covenant is the bond of union, by which a company are so
combined and united, as that they become a Church. It is also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rvable,
how the Lord before he would bring them into this bond
of the Covenant, he would <hi>cause them to passe under the rod;</hi> by
which phrase, as <hi>Iunius</hi> upon the place well observes, is meant try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and probation; drawne from the manner of Shepheards or
owners of Cattell, who went among their sheepe, or other cattell
with a rod, and therewith pointed out such as were for the Lords
holy use, as <hi>Lev.</hi> 27. 32. And so hereby is noted that God would
not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n the dayes of the Gospel have men to be brought into his
Church hand over head, but he would first cause them to passe
under the rod of due tryall and probation; and then such as upon
tryall were found to be holy for God, or meete matter for his
Church, should solemnly enter into Covenant with God, and that
Covenant should be the bond that should combine them, and knit
them together into one, that so they that were many particular
persons, should all become one body, that is to say, a Church.</p>
            <p>And so much of the first Argument drawne from plaine Texts
of Scripture.</p>
            <p>A second Argument may be taken from the Titles that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven<note place="margin">Argu. 2.</note>
to the Church; as first, that the Church is said to be married
or espoused unto Christ, <hi>Ier. 2. 2. &amp; 3. 14. 2 Cor.</hi> 11. 2. From
whence the Argument may be formed thus: If every Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a Church by being married or espoused unto Christ, then
a company becomes a Church by way of Covenant: But the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is true, therefore the latter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> true also.</p>
            <p>The Assumption, that a Church becomes a Church by being
married unto Christ, is plai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e from the former Scriptures, where

               </gap> of <hi>Israel,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> in regard of their

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tring into Church Estate, are said to be espoused and married
unto Christ, as a loving and chast Virgine to one husband. Which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57319:7"/>
spirituall marriage between Christ and his Church, is also taught
in the type of the marriage between King <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Pharoahs</hi>
daughter, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45.</p>
            <p>The Consequence of the Proposition is plaine in reason; for
there is no marriage but by way of Covenant; no woman becomes
a mans wife, but by way of bestowing her selfe in Covenant upon
such a man: neither doth a man become an husband, but by the
same means; and therefore the Scripture speaking of the violation
of marriage, calls it a violation of Covenant, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 17.</p>

of Gods Elect in heaven, in earth, dead, now living, and not

one; so there are particular and visible Churches, which are in
number many; and therefore the Scripture speakes of Churches,
2 <hi>Cor. 8. 1. 19. Gal.</hi> 1. 2. Of the Churches of the Gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.

<hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. The Jewish Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 7. be the Spouse and wife
of Christ, there is no reason but others should be the same also,
especially seeing there is no particular Church, but in respect of
their Church estate, they may decline and goe a whoring from
Christ, and that shews that they were first espoused to him; for
no woman can be said to got a whoring from a man, if shee were
never married, nor espoused to him at all.</p>
            <p>2. This that seemes an absurditie, and were a sinfull practise
among men, in respect of Christ, is a certaine truth, and no disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
unto him at all, to have more Spouses then one upon earth,
many spirituall Spouses. Men cannot give themselves wholly and
intirely to many as Christ can. Every faithfull soule is espoused
and married unto Christ; and in that respect he hath not onely
many hundred but many thousand, yea many millions of spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Spouses.</p>

the Church Covenant is between the Church and the members, and
therefore this marriage doth not prove the Church-Covenant.</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:57319:8"/>1. In some sort there may be said to be a marriage between the<note place="margin">Answer.</note>
Church and the members, <hi>viz.</hi> in respect of that deare love and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
that ought to be between them; and therefore it is said,
<hi>As a young man marrieth a Virgine, so shall the children of the Church
be married to the Church,</hi> Isa. 62. 5.</p>
            <p>2. But properly the marriage is between Christ &amp; the Church,
and so is the Covenant also, so farre as therein they give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
to Christ as unto an head and Lord; as a woman in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rriage doth give up her selfe unto her husband; And
the performance of such duties as the Church and the member owe
one unto another, is a branch of that marriage-Covenant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they are tyed to Christ; for Christ himselfe in his Covenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
not onely that they should give up themselves to him, but
also that they should performe these duties one unto another.
And accordingly it is said of the Churches in <hi>Mac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>donia,</hi> that <hi>they
gave up themselves first to the Lord, and then to us by the will of God,</hi>
2 Cor. 8. 5. True it is, they doe also binde th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mselves by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
one unto another, but in that respect the Covenant is p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
a brotherly Covenant; like that 1 <hi>Sam. 20. 8. Am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s.</hi> 1. 9.
because there the engagement is to one another as brethren, fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
-members, and fellow-helpers, and not as to one head or Lord,
as it is in respect of Christ, and therefore in that respect it is not so
properly a marriage-Covenant as it is in respect of Christ: though
duties to one another are promised in their Covenant with one
another, and also in their Covenant with Christ. In briefe thus:
They promise unto Christ duties to him, and duties to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
according to him: and so their Covenant is a marriage-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with Christ: They promise also to one another, duties to
one another, and so it is a brotherly Covenant.</p>
            <p>Another Title given to the Church (which also proves that
a Church is made by Covenant) is the Title of a Citie, or Citie
of God, <hi>Psal. 87 3. &amp; 48 1. 8. &amp; 122. 3. Ephes</hi> 2. 19. The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
lyeth thus. If a true Church be a Citie of God, then a Church
becomes a Church by Covenant: But every true Church is a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of God. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Assumption is proved by the Scriptures forealledged. The
Consequence of the Proposition is plaine in reason, for every Citie
is un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted by some Covenant among themselves, the Citizens are
received unto <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Civitatis,</hi> or right of Citie priviledges, by some
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57319:8"/>
Covenant or Oath; And therefore it is so likewise in this Citie of
God the Church; and men become Citizens of the Church by
solemne Covenant.</p>
            <p>The third Argument<note place="margin">Argu. 3.</note> may be drawne from the meanes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
and restoring a Church when it is corrupted, which is by
entring into Covenant a new with God, 2 <hi>Chron. 15. 10. &amp;</hi> 29. 10.
<hi>&amp; Neh. 9. 38. &amp; 10. 28, 29 Ier.</hi> 50. 4, 5. The reason may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
thus: If a Church decayed is to be restored and refo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>med by
renuing Covenant with God, then it was instituted and erected at
the first by way of Covenant: The reason of which Consequence
is, because abuses and corruptions are to be reformed by bringing
things back to the first Institution: Thus Christ re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ormes the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of marriage, by bringing them to the first Institution of that
Ordinance; <hi>From the beginning it was not so,</hi> Mat. 19. 8. And thus
<hi>Paul</hi> reformeth the Abuses of the Lords Supper, by telling them
what was the first Institution thereof, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23 &amp;c. And thus
the Lord Jesus calling on the declining Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
<hi>bids her remember from whence shee is fallen, and repent and
doe her first workes.</hi> Rev. 2. 5.</p>
            <p>Now the Assumption is plaine from the Texts above alledged,
that at the reforming of a Church, there is to be a renuing of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
and thence it follows, that at the first erecting of a Church,
there was the making of a Covenant with God, for els this renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Covenant would not have been the way to reforme it.</p>
            <p>The fourth Argument is taken from that which doth dissolve
a Church,<note place="margin">Argu. 4.</note> which is the dissolving or breaking of the Covenant,
<hi>Zach.</hi> 11. 9, 10 14. If dissolving the Covenant be that which doth
dissolve the Church, then the making of Covenant is that which
constitutes a Church. The reason of the Consequence is plaine,
because otherwise the Covenant might be dissolved &amp; the Church
stand still, if it were not the making of the Covenant that did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
the Church: But if dissipating stones in a building doe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> house, then the compacting and conjoyning of them is
that which makes the house; If separation of soule and body be
that which destroyes the man, that then we say he is not: it must
needs be the uniting of them, that did constitute &amp; make the man:
and so it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> case. And that dissolving the Covenant is that
which dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ves a Church, is plaine from the Text alledged,
<hi>Zach.</hi> 11. Where the breaking of the two staves, of beautie and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57319:9"/>
bands, that is, the unchurching of the Jewes, is interpreted to be
the breaking of the Covenant that God had made with that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and the brotherhood that was between <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifth Argument is taken from the distinction which God
hath appointed amongst Churches,<note place="margin">Argu. 5.</note> and the confounding of all
Churches into one, if there be not this Covenant to distinguish
them. If Churches be distinct Societies, and may not be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
then Churches are compacted and combined by Covenant:
But the former is true. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Churches are distinct Societies, is plaine in the Scripture,
where we have mention of many Churches in one Countrey or
Province, <hi>Gal. 1. 1. 1 Thes.</hi> 2. 14. Of seven Churches in Asia,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 4. and of all the Churches, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 33. Rev. 2. 23. Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
is not <hi>Smyrna,</hi> nor <hi>Smyrna</hi> is not <hi>Thyatira,</hi> nor either of them
<hi>Pergamus,</hi> but each one distinct of themselves, having Officers of
their owne, which did not belong to others: vertues of their owne
for which others are not praised, corruptions of their owne, for
which others are not blamed; If it were not thus, then when <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ea</hi>
is condemned for lukewarmenesse, or <hi>Ephesus</hi> for declining,
all the rest should be reproved also: And when <hi>Philadelfia</hi> is prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
all the rest should be praised also, which we see is otherwise.
Now from hence the Consequence is certaine, that therefore they
are combined by some Covenant each one amongst themselves;
for there is nothing els without this that wil sufficiently distinguish
them. The Spirit of God and Faith in their hearts, is common to
all Christians under heaven, and in heaven also, and therefore this
is not the thing that makes distinction. Nor is it habitation in the
same Towne together, for that may be common to such Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
as are not of this Church, and usually is to many that are no
Christians. As it is with Companies in <hi>London;</hi> as the Company
of Goldsmiths, &amp;c. that many others dwell in the same Towne
with them, yea it may be in the same streete that are not of their
Company: and therefore it is not meerely habitation that doth
distinguish them from others, but some combination and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
amongst themselves; So it is not habitation in the same
Towne that distinguisheth Churches, and Church-members
from other men, but their mutuall agreement and combination
and joyning themselves together in an holy Covenant with
God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:57319:9"/>
               <q>If the Spirit of God and Faith in their hearts cannot distinguish one
Church from another,<note place="margin">Object.</note> because these are common to them all, then how
can Covenant distinguish them, sith all Churches are joyned by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
one as well as another?</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is not a Covenant simply or a Covenant in generall that doth
constitute a Church,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> or distinguish one Church from another,
but a Covenant with application and appropriation to these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
Even as it is in marriage, though all married couples be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Covenant, and a Covenant, wherein one couple promiseth
the same duties that another couple doth yet a Covenant with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
and appropriation of the duties covenanted to this man
and this woman in particular, such a Covenant is the very thing
that make a couple, man and wife together, and gives them mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
power over each other, as husband and wife, and puts a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
between them and all other men and women in the world.
And so it is in this case; a Covenant to performe Church-duties
with application and appropriation to such persons, is the very
thing that constitutes a Church, and distinguisheth one Church
from another.</p>
            <p>And thus much concerning the former of the two particulars,
to shew the use of Church-Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is that whereby
a company doe become a Church.</p>
            <p>The second particular is this, taking hold of the Covenant,
or joyning in it, is that which makes a particular person a member
of a Church. And this followes upon the former, and that may
be the first Argument to prove it.</p>
            <p>If joyning in Covenant be that which makes a company to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Church,<note place="margin">Argu. 1.</note> then taking hold of that Covenant is requisite to
make a particular person become a member of the Church: But
the first is true, as hath been shewed before; Therefore the second
is true also: If compacting and conjoyning of stones and pieces
of Timber, be that that makes an house, then a particular stone
cannot become a part of that house, till it be compacted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
to the rest: But the former is true, even in the Church of
God, which is the spirituall Spouse and Citie of God, living stones,
Christians, beleevers must be compacted together, and builded up
together, <hi>Ephes. 2. 21. 22. Psal.</hi> 122. 3. and therefore the latter is
true also, that a particular Christian becomes a member of the
Church, a part of that building by being combined with the rest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:57319:10"/>A second Argument may be drawne from the Scripture,<note place="margin">Argu. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Isa.</hi> 56.
3, 6, 7. <hi>Let not the sonne of the stranger, that hath joyned himselfe to the
Lord, speake, saying, the Lord hath utterly separated me from his people,
&amp;c. The sonnes of the strangers that joyne themselves to the Lord, to serve
him, &amp;c. and take hold of my Covenant, even them will I bring to my
holy mountaine, and make them joyfull in my house of Prayer, &amp;c.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which Scripture, note three things to the present purpose.
First, That these strangers were members of Christ, true beleevers,
joyned to God by Faith; for it is said, <hi>they have joyned themselves to
the Lord,</hi> v. 3 &amp; v. 6. that they loved the name of the Lord, served
him, and kept his Sabbaths, <hi>v.</hi> 6. and yet for all this they were not
as yet joyned, as members of the visible Church, for if they had
been ioyned, there would have been no cause for such a complaint,
<hi>the Lord hath separated me from his people,</hi> v. 3. Besides, bringing them
into the Church as members, and granting them the priviledge of
members, is promised as a reward and blessing upon this their joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the Lord by faith and obedience, <hi>v.</hi> 7. And therefore it is
not the same, but a disti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct thing from it; the one being promised
as a reward and blessing upon the other. Secondly, The Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth
that he will make them members of his Church: <hi>Them will
I bring to my holy mountaine, and make them joyfull in my house of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi>
Thirdly, That among other things requisite to make them
members, this was one, <hi>viz.</hi> the taking hold of that Covenant
which was between the Church of <hi>Israel</hi> and God, <hi>v.</hi> 6. So that
hence we may gather, that men may be members of Christ, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the Lord by faith and love, and yet for the present not be
members of the visible Church: And that when God is so graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to true beleevers, as to make them members of his visible
Church, it is requisite that they joyne in Covenant before.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But might not faith in Christ,<note place="margin">Object.</note> beleeving in heart on the God of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
be all the taking hold of the Covenant that is here meant.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Not so,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> but over and above that, here is also meant their open
profession of their Faith in the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> and open binding of
themselves by Covenant to all such duties of faith and obedience,
as God required of the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> and the members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Now distinctly take the Answer to this Objection in three or
foure particular Propositions. First, There was a Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Church of <hi>Israel</hi> and God, <hi>Exod. 19. 5, 6, 7, 8. Ezek</hi> 16.
8. <hi>Deut. 29. 10. &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, This Covenant was mutuall; not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57319:10"/>
onely a promise on Gods part to be their God, and to take them
for his people, but also reciprocally on their part to give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unto God to be his people, and to doe the dutie of people to
their God; The Covenant is not meerely to receive from God,
and promise nothing back againe to him; nor doth God binde
himselfe therein, and leave men at libertie, but it is mutuall on both
parts, as these Scriptures declare; <hi>Gen.</hi>
17. 1. <hi>Exod. 19. 7. 8. Deut.</hi> 5.
27. <hi>&amp; 6. 16, 17. Hos. 2. 23. &amp; Zach.</hi> 13. 9. Thirdly, Hereupon
it followes, that if men had not promised, and also performed, in
some measure of truth, the duties of Faith and obedience unto
God, they had not taken hold of the Covenant, but had discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted
themselves, notwithstanding all the promises of God unto
their Fathers or others. Thus though God promised <hi>Abraham</hi> to
be a God to him, and to his seede in their generations, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7.
yet the <hi>Ishma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lites</hi> and <hi>Edomites</hi> descending from <hi>Abraham,</hi> were
discovenanted by not promising nor performing those duties of
Faith and obedience, which God required on the peoples part:
when a Covenant containes promises on Gods part, and duties al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
on mans, he doth not take hold of the Covenant that takes one
part, and leaves another. Fourthly, To beleeve what God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the Covenant for his part, and to promise in a private way
the duties of obedience on mans part, was not sufficient to make
these strangers members of the Church, but they must doe it open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and in the view of the Church, else the Church could have had
no warrant to have admitted such into their Fellowship, if their
faith and obedience had not been visibly professed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 43.
48 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 19.</p>
            <p>And in as much as the Covenant was mutuall, when these stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
did manifest their taking hold of the Covenant, they manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
and professed both Faith and obedience, both that they belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
what God promised, and that they would be obedient to what
he required; If any shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d have claimed Church-fellowship, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I beleeve the promises, but would not binde himselfe to any
duties of Evangelicall obedience, this had been a taking hold of the
Covenant by the halves, a taking of one part of it in seeming and
pretence, and a leaving of another; but it would not have been
sufficient to have brought a man into the fellowship of the church:
Such of the Congregation of <hi>Israel</hi> as would not come to <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
to enter into Covenant, were to be separated from the Church
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57319:11"/>
in the dayes of <hi>Ezrya, Ezra</hi> 10. 8. And therefore such as being
strangers should refuse to enter into it, could not be admitted into
the Church; So that the taking hold of Gods Covenant, which
is there required to make these strangers members of the Church,
is a beleeving in heart on the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> and an open profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
that they did beleeve, and likewise a promise of obedience or
subjection unto the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> and an open professing of such
obedience and subjection; and that is the joyning in Covenant
which we stand for, before a man can be a member of a Church,
even an open profession of Faith and of Obedience.</p>
            <p>A third Argument is taken from those Scriptures which shew
that men become members by being added to the Church,<note place="margin">Argu. 3.</note> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
joyned to them, <hi>Act. 2. 47. &amp; 5. 13. &amp;</hi> 9. 26. If men become
members of the Church by being added or joyned, then joying
in Covenant (or professing of subjection to the Gospel or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of God) is that whereby a man becomes a member of a
Church: But the former is true, as appeares by the Scriptures fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
and therefore the latter is true also.</p>
            <p>But all the doubt in this Argument will be concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of the <hi>Major</hi> Proposition; but that may be made good
by this reason, and the confirmation of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that a man cannot
be added or joyned to the Church by any other meanes without
this joyning in Covenant. The truth of which Assertion will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
by shewing the insufficiency of all other means, without this
joyning in Covenant, and that may be done in Answer to the
Objections ensuing.</p>
            <p>
               <q>When men were added to the Church,<note place="margin">Object. 1.</note> it may be, no more is meant
but tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> God did convert them and worke Faith in their hearts, and that
converting of them was the adding of them to the Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This cannot be all;<note place="margin">Answer.</note> for, first, <hi>Saul</hi> was converted and had faith
wrought in his heart, and yet he was not at the first received for a
member of the Church at <hi>Hierusalem</hi> (though he assayed to be
joyned unto them,) till they were better satisfied in his spirituall
estate by the testimony of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> Act. 9. 26, 27, 28. And those
strangers, <hi>Isa.</hi> 56. (as was said before) were joyned to the Lord
by being converted, and having Faith wrought in their hearts,
and yet they doe lament it with griefe, that they were not joyned
as members to the visible Church: <hi>The Lord hath separated me from
his people,</hi> say they, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. The old saying is true concerning the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57319:11"/>
visible Church, <hi>There are many wolves within, and many sheepe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</hi>
Secondly, Those that were joyned were beleevers before they
joyned; for it is said, <hi>divers were added,</hi> ver. 14. Thirdly, Those
that were added to the Church, were added and joyned to them
by such an act as others durst not put forth, <hi>Act. 5. 13. Of the rest
durst no man joyne unto them,</hi> and therefore it was not by the irresi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
act of God in converting of them, but by some volun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ary
act of their owne choice and consent; for Gods converting grace
depends not upon mans daring, or not daring to receive it. If to be
joyned be no more but to be converted, then when it is said, <hi>Some durst
not be joyned,</hi> the meaning should be, they durst not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
nor suffer Faith to be wrought in them; which is grosse
Arminianisme, suspending the converting grace of God upon the
free will of the creature. Fourthly, And as this joyning which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
durst not doe, cannot be meant of being converted; So if it
be well considered, what the thing was wherein they durst not
joyne, it may appeare that it was nothing els but this, that they
durst not agree, and engage themselves to be of their body and
societie; that is, they durst not joyne in Covenant with them.
For it cannot be meant of dwelling in the Towne with them, for
this they both durst doe and did: nor is it onely of joyning to
heare the Word in their assembly, for this also they durst doe, and
many did it in great multitudes, so that many by hearing the
Word became beleevers, and were added to the Lord both of men
and women, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. at this very time when it is said of some they
durst not joyne unto them: Nor is it of joyning to them in affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or approbation of their way, for this they also durst doe and
did expresse so much in magnifying and commending them, when
yet they durst not joyne unto them, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. Which magnifying
of them doth imply that they heard their doctrine, and saw their
practise, and approved it, and highly commended them for the
same: Wherefore seeing this joyning, which some durst not doe,
cannot be meant of being converted, nor of joyning in habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor of joyning in affection, nor in hearing the Word in their
Assembly, nor of approbation, and expressions that way, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
that it must be meant of joyning in that neere relation of
Church-fellowship amongst them, so as to be engaged by volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
consent and agreement to be members of their Church.
Fiftly, If joyning to the Church, were no more but to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57319:12"/>
then he that were converted were joyned as a member of
every visible Church throughout the world, which were a great
confusion of that Order, and distinction of Churches, which the
Lord hath appointed.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Men may be joyned to the Church,<note place="margin">Obj. 2.</note> in heartie affection and love, and
yet without any Covenant.</q>
            </p>
            <p>True, but this will not make them members of that Church,<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
for then <hi>Saul</hi> was member of the Church at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> afore he
was joyned a member, for he was joyned to them in heartie affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
afore, and therefore assayed to joyne as a member; and so
were they that durst not joyne, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 13. yea then a man should
be a member of many Churches, yea of all Christian Churches in
the world; for he is to love them, and beare heartie affection to
them all; The true members of the Churches in <hi>England</hi> are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in heartie affection, to the Churches in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi>
in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> &amp;c. And yet they are not members
of all these Churches, nor subject to their censures as members
are.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But the reason of that is because they doe not dwell among them in
the same Towne.</q>
               <note place="margin">Obj. 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Neither would habitation with them in the same Towne, make
a man a member of the Church there, if there be no more then so.
Suppose <hi>Saul</hi> to have dwelt in the same house afore his conversion
in which he dwelt after, which is not unpossible nor unlikely; yet
we see he was no member of the Church at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> afore his
conversion, no nor of some time after, though he might have
dwelt in an house in the midst of the Christians, and Church-members
there. The members of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Churches
in <hi>London,</hi> or other Townes in <hi>England,</hi> are not members of the
<hi>English</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>Congregations or Churches, no more then the <hi>English</hi>
are of theirs, and yet they dwell promiscuously together in the
same S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>recte of the same Towne. Towne-dwelling would not
make a man a free-man of a Company in <hi>London,</hi> or some other
Corporation; for many others dwell in the Towne with them;
yea it may be in the same streete, that are not free of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and so it is in this case.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But the reason why such as dwell in Towne with the Church,<note place="margin">Object. 4.</note> are
not members thereof, may be, because they frequent not their Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:57319:12"/>Idiots and Infidells might come into the publick meetings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answ.</note> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 23, 24, 25. yet Idiots and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dells
were not therefore members of the Church. And <hi>Saul</hi> after
his conversion might have come in among the Church in time of
publick duties, and have seene and heard all that they had done:
yet this would not have made him of one body with them. Some
<hi>Indians, Moores,</hi> and other naturall persons come into our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in <hi>New-England,</hi> some of their owne accord, and others by
the Command or Counsell of their Masters and Governours, yet
no man can say, that all these are hereby made Church-members.
Wherefore seeing neither conversion, nor loving affection, nor
cohabitation, nor coming into their meetings, doth joyne a man
as a member of the visible Church (for some men have all these,
and yet are not members, and others are sometimes members of
the visible Churches, and yet want some of these, are hypocrites
and want sound conversion) it remaineth therefore that as sound
conversion makes a man fit matter for a Church; So profession of
his Faith, and of his subjection to the Gospel, and the Churches
approbation, and acceptance of him (which is the summe of
Church-Covenant) is the formall cause that gives him the being
of a member.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But joyning doth not alway signifie joyning in Covenant;<note place="margin">Object. 5.</note> Philip joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the Eunnuchs chariote, and dust to mens feete, <hi>Act. 8. 29. &amp;
Luke</hi> 10, 11. and yet there was no Covenant, and therefore men may
joyne to the Church without any Covenant.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The word indeed may expresse any close joyning,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> whether na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
(as the branch is joyned to the Vine, or an arme or other
member to the body) or artificiall, as when two stickes were joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to become one in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> hand, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. Or when Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
or Masons doe joyne pieces of stone or Timber together, to
make one house, <hi>Neh. 4. 6. Ezr.</hi> 4. 12. but is not onely the force
of the word that is stood upon. But when joyning is used to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
such joyning, wherein a man voluntarily takes on him a
new relation, there it alwayes implyes a Covenant, whether the
relation be morall and civill, or religious and Ecclesiasticall: We
speake of voluntary relation, for there are naturall relations, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
parents and children: and these need no Covenant, there
is no Covenant to make a man a Parent, or a childe; There are
also violent relations, as between Conquerour and Captives, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57319:13"/>
in these there is no Covenant neither; but others are voluntary,
and these alwayes imply a Covenant, and are founded therein,
whether they be morall and civill (as between husband and wife,
<hi>Pro.</hi> 2. 17. between Master and servants, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 15. between
Prince and subject, between Partners in Trade, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 20. 35,
36, 37. where the Covenant or agreement is, that men shall bare
such a share of charges, and receive such a share of profits:) or
religious, as between Minister and people, between the Church
and the members: all these are done by way of Covenant. A
man cannot joyne himselfe to a woman as her husband, but by
way of Covenant: A man cannot joyne himselfe to another as
a servant, or apprentise, but by way of Covenant; And so may
we say of all the rest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor into any body corporate, but by the
same way and means. If men be united into a body politick or
incorporate, a man cannot be said to be joyned to them by meere
heartie affection, unlesse withall he joynes himselfe unto them by
some Contract or Covenant. Now of this nature is every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church, a body incorporate, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 27. Yee are the body
of Christ, &amp;c.</hi> and hath power to cast out, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8 as a body incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate;
and therefore he that will joyne unto them, must doe it
by way of Covenant or Agreement; and so this Answer to this
Objection, may be a fourth Argument to prove the point in hand,
that joyning in Covenant is that which makes a man, a member
of a Church.</p>
            <p>All voluntary relations,<note place="margin">Argu. 4.</note> all relations which are neither naturall
nor violent, are entred into by way of Covenant.</p>
            <p>But he that joynes into a Church as a member, or enters into a
Church, doth take upon him such a relation; Therefore joyning
to a Church as a member, is by way of Covenant.</p>
            <p>A fifth Argument may be drawne from the power which all
Churches,<note place="margin">Argu. 5.</note> Officers and members, have over all their members in
the Lord. If all Churches, Officers, and members, have power in
the Lord over all their members, then joyning in Covenant is
necessary to make a man a member of a Church, but the former is
true, therefore the latter is true also.</p>
            <p>The Assumption in this Argument, that all Churches have
power over their members, is proved from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4, 5. 13.
where the Apostle reproveth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for suffering the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestuous
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57319:13"/>
man amongst them, and commands them to deliver him
to Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>an, and cast him out from amongst them. Now this he
would not have done, if they had had no power over him, or if
there had been any roome for them to say, wee have nothing to
doe with him, wee have no power over him. And the same is
prooved in other Scriptures also; as, <hi>Mat. 18. 17. Psal.</hi> 149. 6.
7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>And the Consequence of the <hi>Major</hi> Proposition, <hi>viz.</hi> that then
members doe engage themselves by Covenant, is proved by this
reason; That Churches have no power over such as have not
engaged themselves by Covenant, and committed power unto
them, by professing to be subject to all the Ordinances of Christ
amongst them.</p>
            <p>The truth whereof may appeare by two Reasons:</p>
            <p>First, Because all Christians have power and right, <hi>jure divino,</hi>
to choose their owne Officers to whom they commit their soules,
<hi>Act.</hi> 6. &amp; 1. &amp; 14 23. where the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, imports choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
by Election: and so the word is used and translated, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.
19. <hi>he was chosen by the Churches, &amp;c.</hi> It is not ministeriall gifts that
makes a man a Minister to every Church, nor investeth him with
spirituall power over them, nor though he dwell amongst them,
unlesse they call him, and he accept of that call: And as they have
power to choose their Officers, so likewise to choose their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
according to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1. Now if they have power to
choose their Officers and brethren, then none can have power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them as Officers and brethren, without their owne consent,
and whom they never chose, nor promised by any Covenant or
Engagement to be subject to the Lord.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If the Church should exercise any Act of Church-power
over such a man as never entred into Covenant with them
(suppose to Excommunicate him for whoredome or drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or the like) the man might protest against their Act, and
their Sentence, as <hi>Coram non judice,</hi> and they could not justifie their
proceedings, if indeed there have passed no Covenant or Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
between him and them. If he shall say, you have nothing
to doe to passe Sentence or Censure upon me, I am none of your
Church, but of another Church; Suppose in <hi>Holland,</hi> in <hi>France, &amp;c.</hi>
and I am onely here now for Merchandise sake, or upon some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
occasion: what shall they say to stop his mouth, if there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57319:14"/>
passed any Covenant between him and them.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But Ministers have power over the people by the word of God,<note place="margin">Object.</note>
                  <hi>Heb. 13. 17. 1 Thes. 5. 12. 1 Tim.</hi> 5. 17. and not by mens engaging
themselves by Covenant.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But what is it that makes men Ministers to such a people,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
to such a Church, or maketh them sheepe of my flocke?
Is it not those Scriptures that makes every man a Pastour, or
Teacher, or Ruler to a people, unlesse they call him to that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
and then in so doing they Covenant and Engage themselves
to be subject to him in the Lord, and then those Scriptures take
hold on them. One might as well say, it is not the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of a wife to her husband that gives him power over her, but
the Word of God; For as the Word of God commands people to
obey their Ministers, so it commands <hi>wives to be subject to their
husbands,</hi> Ephes. 5. 22. And yet all men know, a man cannot take
this woman for his wife but by Covenant. So that if shee once
makes her selfe a wife by her owne voluntary Covenant, then the
word of God takes hold on her, and bindes her to doe the duties
of a wife: but if shee, hath made no Covenant, the man hath no
power over her as her husband, neither is shee his wife; So if men
once make themselves members of such a Church, sheepe of such
a mans flocke, by their own voluntary Covenant, then the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
of God takes hold of them, and bindes them to doe the duties of
members to their fellow-brethren, and of people to their Pastours
or Ministers. But if they never chose such a man to be their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
nor Covenanted to be subject to him in the Lord, he then
can have no power over them as a Minister unto them, because
they have right to chose their owne Ministers.</p>
            <p>A sixth Argument may be taken from the distinction that is
between members,<note place="margin">Argu. 6.</note> and not members. If there be by the word of
God a distinction, between members of the Church and such as
are no members, then joyning in Covenant is necessary to the
being of a member; but the former is true, as appeares 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.
12. Some are within, and may be judged by the Church, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are without, and may not: and therefore the latter is true
also. And the reason of the Consequence is because there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else without this joyning in Covenant, that can sufficiently
distinguish them; It is not Faith and Grace in their hearts, for
some men are members of the visible Church, and yet have no
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57319:14"/>
Grace, and others may have Grace, and yet be no members, and
therefore this is not the thing that doth distinguish them, nor is it
affection, nor cohabitation, nor every approbation of the Word
of God, and the wayes of his Church, not comming into their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
to heare the Word; But these things were touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and therefore may be here the more briefly passed over.</p>
            <p>And so much shall suffice to have spoken of the second particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
concerning the use of Church-Covenant, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t is by joyning
therein that a particular person becomes a member of a Church.</p>
            <p>But here it will be needfull to remove sundry Objections, which
may seeme to some to be of great weight against Church-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
that so by the removing of them, the truth may be the more
cleared, to fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ler satisfaction, if it be the will of God.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Church-Covenant is a Terme that is not found in S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>First,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> So is Sacrament, Trinitie, &amp;c. and yet those termes may
be lawfully used, because the thing meant thereby is found.</p>
            <p>Secondly, But seeing the Covenant is between the Lord and his
Church, as the two parties that are confederate, it is all one whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be called the Lords Covenant, or the Church-Covenant:
As when <hi>Mamre, Aver,</hi> &amp; <hi>Eschol</hi> were confederate with <hi>Abraham,</hi>
Gen. 14. 13. might not one truely say, <hi>Abraham</hi> was confederate
with them? Relatives doe mutually put and establish one another.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Scripture allowes both the Lords Covenant with
the Church, <hi>Eze.</hi> 16. 8. &amp; the peoples covenant or Saints covenant,
or Churches Covenant with him, <hi>Deut. 29. 12. Psal. 50. 5. Ier.</hi> 50. 5.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There is good reason for both the words; both the
Lords Covenant, and the Church-Covenant, because both are
confederate; And for that of Church-Covenant, there is this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
also, <hi>viz.</hi> to distinguish it from other Covenants, as a marriage-Covenant,
<hi>Pro.</hi> 2. 17. and a brotherly Covenant, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 8. The
Church- Covenant being thus called not onely because they are a
Church, or members thereof that make it, but also because they
enter into it in reference to Church-Estate and Church-duties:
The duties which they bind themselves unto in this Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such especially as concern a Church and the members thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But this Church-Covenant puts some disparagement upon the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace,<note place="margin">Object. 2.</note> which every beleever is already entred into with God,
and seeme to charge the same with insufficiency; for every second Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
doth argue that the first was not faultlesse, <bibl>
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 7.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:57319:15"/>1. A second Covenant doth argue that the first was not fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
where<note place="margin">Answ.</note> the Covenants are contrary one to another, as the
covenant of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>race, and the covenant of works are, and so it is
most true, that the bringing in of the free Covenant of Grace did
argue that righteousnes and life could not be attained by the Law,
or Covenant of works; for if there had been a Law given which
could have given life, verily righteousnesse should have been by
the Law. <hi>Gal. 3. 21. Rom.</hi> 8. 3.</p>
            <p>2. But if it be the same Covenant that is renewed or made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,

works given to <hi>Adam</hi> was not blamed or saulted, because it was
renewed in <hi>Sinai</hi> The Covenant of Grace was first given to <hi>Adam</hi>
in Paradise after his fall, afterward to <hi>Abraham,</hi> then to the people
of Israel under types and shadows; And againe after the coming
of Christ in the flesh; yet none of these doth disanull the former,

               </gap>aulty; and the reason is, because it is still
the same Covenant though renewed upon new occasions; and in
some particulars in some other manner. And the like we say con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Church-Covenant, or the Covenant which a man makes
when he enters into the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is not another Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
contrary to the Covenant of Grace, which every beleever is
brought into at his first conversion, but an open profession of a
mans subjection to that very Covenant, specially in the things
which concerne Church estate, into which estate the man is now
entring.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It is not lawfull to make such a Covenant as the Church-Covenant,<note place="margin">Obj. 3.</note>
because it is not in our power to keep it, and we do not know whether
God will give us power.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This ground is very true,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> that no man hath power of himselfe
to any thing that good is, but all a mans power and abilitie must
come of God through Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ist, 2. <hi>Cor. 3. 5. Phil. 2. 13. Ioh.</hi> 15. 5.
But the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erence is not good, that therefore it should be unlawfull
to ento into Church-Covenant: for 1. By the same reason, all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
are unlawfull, and all covenants whatsoever; as the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of marriage, the covenant of service, yea and the personall
covenant o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Grace, when a particular soule promiseth faith and
new obedience; for there is none of these, no not the covenant of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57319:15"/>
Marriage, which a man is able of himself to keep, as the adultery
of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> among others, doth plainly prove.</p>
            <p>2. God hath promised to give power to them that in self-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
seek it of him, and trust to his promise for it. <hi>Ezek. 36. 27. Ier.</hi>
31. 33. <hi>Rom. 6. 14. Ier.</hi> 32. 40. The true inference therefore from
this ground, from mans disabilitie to performe were this, that
therefore a man should not enter into Church Covenant in his
owne strength, for that was <hi>Peters</hi> fault in promising not to deny
Christ, but to die with him rather: but Church-Covenant, as also
all other promises, should be entred into, in an humble looking up
to Christ Jesus for help and assistance to performe. <hi>Thou therefore
my sonne, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Iesus, 2. Tim.</hi> 2. 1.</p>
            <p>
               <q>God disalloweth covenants of mans making (and so our Church-Covenant)
in those words,<note place="margin">Obj. 4.</note> But not by thy Covenant. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 61.</q>
            </p>
            <p>God doth not reprove them there for making Covenant,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> for
then he were contrary to himselfe, who elsewhere called them to
do it, <hi>Exod. 29. Deut.</hi> 29. and commended them for it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 5.
Yea and in that very place of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. acknowledgeth a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
betweene him and them, <hi>Ver.</hi> 60. 62. But the meaning is,
he would do them good, but not for their good keeping the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of works, for they had very sinfully broken it, <hi>ver.</hi> 59. but
even as he saith elsewhere, not for their sakes, or for their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
<hi>Ezek. 36. 32. Deut.</hi> 9. 4, 5, 6. But what force is there in
this arguing, <hi>viz.</hi> If God will do us good, but not for our good
keeping the covenant of works, then it is not lawfull to promise
obedience to the covenant of Grace, in such things as concerne
Church estate; All men may easily see that here is a plaine <hi>non se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This entring into Covenant may keep out many good men from joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Churches,<note place="margin">Obj. 5.</note> because they are not satisfied about it: and therefore
it is better laid aside.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is not impossible,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> but good men may for a time be unsatisfied
about it, till they understand the nature and use of it, and yet the
thing be warrantable enough for all that in the sight of God; the
Tribes were troubled at the Altar set up upon the banks of Jordan
by the two Tribes and an halfe, till they understood the intent and
use of it, and for what purpose it was erected: and then they were
satisfied. <hi>Iosh.</hi> 22. And the same may be said of <hi>Peters</hi> eating with
the Gentiles, which at the first was very offensive to them of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57319:16"/>
circumcision, till they understood what <hi>Peter</hi> had to say for his
defence therein, and then they rested well satisfied, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>But if men understand what the Church-Covenant is, there is
no reason that good men should be troubled at it; it being nothing
else but a promise of obedience unto the Gospel of Christ, or of
such duties as the Gospel requireth of all Christians in Church-estate:
For, will good men refuse to obey the Gospel, or submit
to the ordinances of Christ? or will they refuse to professe and
promise so much? If a man understand what it is, and what we
meane by it, and yet refuse to enter into it when he hath opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
thereto, such refusing is no part of his goodnesse, but is to be
reckoned amongst his corruptions; It is ignorance at the best, and
if not so, then it may be perversenesse of will, or some want of
will to performe obedience to the Gospel. And surely there is smal
hope that such would yeeld subjection and obedience to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
who do refuse to professe or promise it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But the Scripture,<note place="margin">Obj. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 41. tels of joyning to the Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Covenant. For it was not possible that 3000. should enter into
covenant in one day.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Two things may be said in Answer to this Objection.<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
            </p>
            <p>First, that 3000. were not so many, but that joyning in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
might easily be done by them all, in one day. For, 1. it was at
Penticost, at which time of the yeer the dayes were at the longest:
And, 2. the Scripture tels us, that <hi>David</hi> made a Covenant with
all the Tribes of Israel in one day, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 5 1, 2, 3. The Articles
of the covenant betweene <hi>David</hi> and the Tribes, and so betweene
this 3000. and the Lord might be openly declared, and they both
the one and the other might by some signe or other, expresse their
consent thereunto in one day.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as joyning in Covenant is a thing that might be
done, so it is more then probable that indeed it was done, by those
3000. soules. For it is said, <hi>ver. 41 that they gladly received the word,</hi>
that is, they openly professed that they did with all their hearts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it, for this receiving of the Word is noted as a condition, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which they were admitted to baptisme, and therefore it was
not onely an inward receiving of it in their hearts, but also an open
professing that they did receive it; for an inward receiving of it in
their hearts, without an open professing thereof outwardly, would
not have been sufficient for the admitting of them unto Bapti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57319:16"/>
Now this Word which they received was an exhortation to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
for sinne, and to Faith in the promise, <hi>ver.</hi> 38. 39. and
to obedience in severing themselves from others, and saving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from that untoward generation, <hi>ver.</hi> 40. And therefore
when they openly professed, that they gladly received this word,
there was an open professing of their Repentance for sinne, <hi>ver.</hi>
40. of their Faith in the promise, and of obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
which is nothing else, but the very summe of Church-Covenant:
yea, and further, their very preparation to this repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
faith and obedience, in that true compunction and sorrow
of soul, was also openly made manifest. <hi>ver.</hi> 37.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But yet there would not be such long narrations, of every one seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
as now are used,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> when men do enter into Church-Covenant, when
each one makes a good long speech, in the profession of his Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When the thing is certaine,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> as was shewed before, that they did
openly professe repentance, faith and obedience, it is not difference
in the length or largenesse of their spe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ches in expressing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that can make any difference in the thing: <hi>Majus &amp; minus
non diversisicant speciem.</hi> And we denie not but they might be
briefer, because there was not such need they should be long in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of some difference betweene them and us, their time and
ours: First there were the Apostles present to heare their confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and to judge thereof, who were men of very good discerning,
and therefore briefer expressing of mens selves might suffice;
whereas the best Christians, yea the best Ministers amongst us are
not to be compared to the Apostles; and therefore as we need
more time for study, and for preparation for our Sermons then
they did: so likewise we need more time to heare, and try the
soundnesse of mens repentance towards God, and faith towards
our Lord Jesus Christ. Yet this we may adde withall, that if the
Apostles and those primative Christians, men of such excellent
discerning were sometimes deceived, and could not alwayes so
discern, but that some Hypocrites would creep into the Church: as
the example of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> doth witnesse; how much
more need is there, that the Churches of God in these dayes (being
far inferiour to them) should be very watchfull and circumspect in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57319:17"/>
trying the spirituall estates of them that offer to come into the
Church?</p>
            <p>Secondly, their times also differed from ours: for their Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie
was a matter of reproach and danger of excommunication,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. 22. of imprisonment, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 3. and 5. 18. and the like.
And therefore to see men now to make open profession of their
faith in Christ Jesus, whose servants and disciples were so hated,
and who himselfe but a while before was crucified, this was not an
ordinarie matter: and therefore in words, men might be the briefer
when they came to be received into the Church: But our times in
<hi>New England</hi> do not persecute Christ, and Christians, and Christian
Churches, but countenance them, and protect them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is more need now to be more studious in examination
of mens estates when they offer themselves for Church members:
when the Jews were in favour, many of the people of the Land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Jews, <hi>Esth.</hi> 8. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But why is there so little proofe of this Church-Covenant in the New
Testament?</q>
               <note place="margin">Obj. 7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. Suppose the New Testament said nothing of it,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> yet it might
have ground sufficient from the Scriptures of the old Testament;
for if it was Gods revealed will in those dayes, that a companie
should become a Church, and particular persons become members
of that Church by way of Covenant, we may be sure it is so now
likewise, unlesse covenanting were peculiar to the Jewish Paedigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie;
indeed if it had never been used in those times, but were some
new ordinance, peculiar to the dayes of the New Testament, in
such cases also a ground from the Scriptures of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were necessarie, as there is in all such things wherein there is
any change or variation, from what was used in those times afore
Christ, as that there should not be Nationall Churches, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall,
and not one visible Church, but many, that there
should be baptisme, and the Lords Supper: these are matters that
are not found in the old Testament, nor were appointed to be used
in those dayes, and therefore we must have warrant for them in
the New, and so we have. But for the Covenant it is otherwise, it
is no new ordinance peculiar to the dayes of the Gospel, nor any
Leviticall ordinance peculiar to the Jewish Pedigogie; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Scriptures of the Old Testament that give warrant for it,
may be sufficient as hath been shewed afore.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:57319:17"/>2. And yet there is not wanting good warrant for it, that it
ought to be used, in the dayes of the New Testament. For, 1. the
Prophets do foretell it, <hi>Isa</hi> 56, 6, 7, and 44 5. and <hi>Ier. 50. 5. Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k,</hi>
20. 37. and in sundrie other places, to omit the rest at this time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
some of them have been spoken of before; Onely let those
words of <hi>Isa.</hi> 44. 5. be well considered, and see if they do not
plainly hold forth that in the dayes of the New Testament, men
should openly professe their faith, and solemnly bind themselves
by Coven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt to be the Lords people, one shall say, I am the Lords,
and another shall call himself by the name of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and another
shall subscribe with his hand, and sirname himself by the name of
<hi>Israel.</hi> These words are so plaine for open professing of faith in
the Lord, and open binding of mens selves by Covenant unto him,
as we conceive nothing need be more.</p>
            <p>2. The Apost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es do sufficiently testifie, that such a thing was
practised in heir dayes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> how should we understand that fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
in the Gospel in its full latitude and breadth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 5. if
this combining into Church fellowship be no part thereof; yea
when it is said, <hi>they continued stedfastly,</hi> or as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, may well be translated, <hi>they strongly did cleave together,</hi> or
hold together in such a Fellowship, which was not preaching and
hearing the doctrine of the Apostles, nor Sacraments, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Prayer,
but a thing distinct from all these. If this combining themselves
into a spirituall fellowship and societie of Church-state be no part
thereof, we know not how to understand it, nor what that fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
should meane; If Doctrine, and Sacraments, and Prayer had
not been particularly mentioned, in the same place, it might have
been thought that the Fellowship in which they so steadfastly
clave together had been no more, but their coming together to
observe these said ordinances, and their communion therein. But
when all these are particularly mentioned, and Fellowship menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
among them, as a thing distinct from the rest, we may not
confound it with the rest. We might as well say, that by doctrine
is meant Sacraments, and by Sacraments is meant Prayer; as to say
that by Fellowship is meant not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing else but the exercise of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and Sacraments, and Prayer. And if these as they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
named be distinct ordinances, and may not be confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
then Fellowship being named in the same manner imports
something distinct from them all, and may not be confounded
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57319:18"/>
with them, nor with any of them, no more then the other may
be confounded one with another. And if so, then as this Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
may import, the communion of their gift and goods one for
the helpe of another, so it must first of all imply a combining of
themselves into Church-state by mutuall ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eement, consent, or
covenant.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, when the Apostle writ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th, that by experience of
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> liberall contribution to the poore Saints, men glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
God for their professed subjection to the Gospel of Christ,
2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 13. he plainly imployes thereby, that the <hi>Corinthians</hi>
had made a profession or promise of such subjection to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
as did comprehend this particular of distributing to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
of the Saints, among other things. And their liberall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution
which he there speaks of, was looked at as one point
of their reall performance of that subjection to the Gospel, which
they had before professed, and promised. Now the Church-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
is nothing else, but the professing or promising of such sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
and therefore this place is another proofe of Church-Covenant.
Besides, it hath been shewed afore in <hi>Argument</hi> 3.
that those places which speake of being added to the Church, of
joyning, or assaying to joyne unto the Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 47. and
5 13. and 9 26. are not expounded according to the full meaning
of them, when they are understood of any other joyning, if joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in Covenant be left out. And therefore the Scriptures of the
New Testament do beare good witnesse unto Church-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
though, as we said before, the Scriptures of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
might have been sufficient if the New Testament had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
nothing of it.</p>

               </gap>st,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> True Antiquitie is that of the Scriptures. Now sith
Church Covenant is warranted by the Scripture, as hath been
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57319:18"/>
shewed before in this discourse, it cannot be charged to want true
Antiquitie. When the Papists are wont to charge the doctrine of
Protestants with Novelty, and such as was never heard of before
<hi>Luther,</hi> the Orthodoxe are wont to answer, that if the doctrine
do not agree with the Scripture, then let it be condemned for No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veltie;
and if it do, it is warranted by the best Antiquitie, even
the testimonie of God himself who is the Antient of dayes: Our
Faith, saith Doctor <hi>White,</hi> is in all points the same that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Scripture, and so consequently of the same Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie:
and therefore all they that say it came up but of late, must
first prove it contrary to the Word of God, or else hold their
peace. <hi>White, Way,</hi> 44. 1. And the same we say in this particular of
the Church-Covenant.</p>
            <p>Secondly, And yet they that search the Stories and Writers of
the times and ages next after the Apostles, may find some testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of Church-Covenant in those dayes: For instance, <hi>Iustine
Martyr</hi> in his Apol. 2. makes mention of three things which were
required of all that were admitted into the Church as members,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is regeneration, and soundnesse in
the Faith, and a promise to walke in obedience to the Gospel.
And generally this was the practise of all those times, that never
any man was admitted to Baptisme, nor his children neither, but
they put him to answer three questions, <hi>Abrenuntios?</hi> whereto he
answered, <hi>Abrenuntio. Credis?</hi> whereto his answer was, <hi>Credo:</hi>
and <hi>Spondes?</hi> to which he answered, <hi>Spondeo.</hi> So that here was
an open declaration of his Repentance from dead works, and of
the soundnesse of his Faith, in the two first particulars, and an
open binding himself by covenant or promise to walke according
to the Gospel, in the third. But much needs not to be said in this
point, unto them that do acknowledge Scripture Antiquitie to be
sufficient, though after times should be found to swerve from the
Rules and Patterns that are therein contained.</p>

Polit. Eccles. lib. 1. Cap. 14. p.</hi> 158. that is, The manner is,
that they who by reason of age and proficiencie in the doctrine
of Catechisme are first admitted to the Lords Supper, should
publickly before the whole Church make confession of their
faith, being brought forth into the sight of the Church by their
parents, or them that are instead of parents, at the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Minister; and likewise should promise and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
by the grace of God to continue in that Faith which they
have confessed, and to lead their lives according to it; yea, and
moreover to subject themselves freely and willingly to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
of the Church.</q> These words we see are full and plaine,
that children are not in those Churches received to the Lords
Supper, without personall confession of Faith, and entring into
Covenant before; And if they tooke this course with children
come to age, there is as much reason, or more, that the same
course should be holden with men of yeers, when they are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

brought against him, then indeed he is admitted; but yet no

            </p>
            <p>The reasons why wee are loath to say, that the Congregations
in <hi>England</hi> are utterly without a Covenant, are these:</p>
            <p>First, Because there we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e many Christian Churches in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
in the Apostles time, or within a while after, as M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ster <hi>Fox</hi>
sheweth at large, <hi>Act. &amp; Mon. lib.</hi> 2. beginning <hi>pag</hi> 137 where
he reporteth out of <hi>Gildas,</hi> that <hi>England</hi> received the Gospel in the
time of <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperour, under whom Christ suffered, and
that <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hea</hi> was sent of <hi>Philip</hi> the Aposti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from <hi>France</hi>
to <hi>England</hi> about the yeare of Christ 63. and remained in <hi>England</hi>
all his time, and so he with his fellowes layd the first foundation
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57319:20"/>
of Christian Faith among the Britaine people, and other Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
and Teachers comming afterward, confirmed the same and
increased it. Also the said Master <hi>Fox</hi> reporteth out of <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
that the Gospel was dispearsed abroad by the sound of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
into many Nations, and amongst the rest into <hi>Britaine,</hi> yea
into the wildest places of <hi>Britaine,</hi> which the <hi>Romans</hi> could never
attaine unto: and alledgeth also out of <hi>Nic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>phorus,</hi> that <hi>Simon
Zelotes</hi> did spread the Gospel to the West Ocean, and brought the
same into the Iles of <hi>Britaine:</hi> and sund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y other proofes he there
hath for the same point. Now if the Gospel and Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
were brought into <hi>England</hi> in the Apostles times, and by
their means, it is like that the <hi>English</hi> Churches were then consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
by way of Covenant, because that was the manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting Churches in the Apostles time, as also in the times afore
Christ, as hath been shewed from the Scripture before in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
And if Christian Congregations in <hi>England</hi> were in those
times combined by Covenant, then eternitie of Gods Covenant
is such, that it is not the interposition of many corruptions that
may arise in after times that can disanull the same, except when
men wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ully breake Covenant and reject the offers of the Gospel
through obstinacy, which we perswade our selves they are not
come unto: and consequently the Covenant remaines which hath
preserved the essence of Churches to this day; though the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of manifold corruptions, have made the Covenant more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite
then were mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Because there want no good Records (as may be
seene in <hi>Seldens History of Tithes</hi>) to prove that in former times in
<hi>England</hi> it was free for men to pay their Tithes and Oblations
where themselves pleased: Now this paying of Tithes was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
as a dutie of people to their Minister, or sheepe to their
Pastour: and therefore seeing this was by their owne voluntary
agreement and consent, their joyning to the Church as members
thereof, &amp; to the Ministery thereof as sheepe of such a mans flock,
was also by their owne voluntary agreement and consent: and
this doth imply a Covenant. It was not the precincts of Parishes
that did limit men in those dayes, but their owne choice.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Those Questions and Answers ministred at Baptisme,
spoken of before, (viz. <hi>Do st thou renounce? I doe renounce: doest
thou beleeve? I doe beleseve: doest thou promise? I doe promise</hi>) as they
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57319:21"/>
were used in other places, so were they also in <hi>England,</hi> and are
unto this day, though not without the mixture of sundry corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Now this doth imply a Covenant. And when the children
came to age, they were not to be admitted to the Lords Supper,
before they had made personall Confession of their owne Faith,
and ratified the Covenant which was made at their Baptisme by
their Parents, which course indeed afterward did grow into a
Sacrament of Confirmation, but that was an abuse of a good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>If here it be said, that the Members of the Parishionall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
are not brought in by their owne voluntary profession, but by
the Authority and Proclamation of the Prince, and therefore they
have no such Covenant.</p>
            <p>The Answer is, that the Christian Prince doth but his dutie
when he doth not tollerate within his Dominions any open Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
or the open worship of false Gods by baptized persons, but
suppresse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h the same: and likewise when he gives free libertie to
the exercise of all the Ordinances of true religion, according to
the minde of Christ, with countenance also and encouragement
unto all those whose hearts are willingly bent thereunto, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 1.
13 &amp; 7 13. And therefore this practise of his cannot overthrow
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reenesse of mens joyning in Church-Communion, because
one dut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e cannot oppose nor contradict another. And suppose
that this course of the Magistrate shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d seeme to be a forcing of
some to come in for members who were unfit, (in which case it
were not justifiable) yet this doth not hinder the voluntary sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of others, who with all their hearts desired it. When the
<hi>Israelites</hi> departed out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> there went a mixed multitude
with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> many going with them that were not <hi>Israelites</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 12. And in the dayes of <hi>Morde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay</hi> and <hi>Hesth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r,</hi> many
of the people of the lands became <hi>Iewes,</hi> when the <hi>Iewes</hi> were in
favour and respect, <hi>Est.</hi> 8. 17. and so joyned to them not of their
owne voluntary minde, nor of any sincere heart towards God,
but meerely for the favour or feare of men; yet this forced or
feined joyning of some could not hinder those that were <hi>Israelites</hi>
indeed from being <hi>Israelites,</hi> nor make the <hi>Iewes</hi> to be no <hi>Iewes,</hi>
no Church-members.</p>
            <p>And the same may be said in this case, Suppose the Magistrates
Proclamation should be a cause, or an occasion rather, of bringing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57319:21"/>
some into the Church, who came not of their owne voluntary
minde, but for feare, or for obteining favour, yet this cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
but others might voluntarily and freely Covenant to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the Gospel of Christ: Such subjection and the promise of
it being the thing which themselves did heartily desire, though the
Magistrate should have said nothing in it.</p>
            <p>If any shall hereupon inferre, that if the Parishionall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
be Churches, then the members of them may be admitted
to Church priviledges in <hi>New England,</hi> before they joyne to our
Churches: Such one may finde his Answer in the Answer to the
tenth of the thirty-two Questions; Whereunto we doe referre the
Reader for this point. Onely adding this, that this were contrary
to the judgement and practise of the Reformed Churches, who
doe not admit a man for member without personall profession of
his Faith, and joyning in Covenant, though he had formerly been
a member of a Church in another place, as was shewed before out
of Master <hi>Parker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, If any say, that if these reasons prove the <hi>English</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
to have such a Covenant as proves them to be Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
then why may not <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Assemblies of Papists goe
for true Churches also? For some man may thinke that the same
things may be said for them that here in Answer to this eleventh
Objection are said for the Parishes in <hi>England:</hi> Such one must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
two things: first, that we doe not say simply, a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
makes a company a true Church, but (as was said before)
a Covenant to walke in such wayes of worship to God and edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of one another, as the Gospel of Christ requireth. For who
doubts, but there may be an agreement among theeves, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.
A confederation among Gods enemies, <hi>Psal.</hi> 83. A conspiracy
among the <hi>Arabians,</hi> the <hi>Ammonites</hi> and <hi>Ashdodites,</hi> to hinder the
building of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> Neh. 4. 7, 8. And yet none of these are
made true Churches by such kind of confederacies or agreements.
And so wee may say of the Assemblies of Papists, especially since
the Counsell of <hi>Trent.</hi> If there be any agreement or confederacy
among them, it is not to walke in the wayes of the Gospell, but in
wayes contrary to the fundamentall truths of the Gospel, as Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y
in worship, Heresie in doctrine, and other Antichristian pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
and corruptions: and therefore if they combined in these
things, such combinations will never prove them true Churches.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57319:22"/>
The Church is the Pillar and ground of truth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. But
the Religion of Papists is so farre from truth, that whosoever li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
and beleeveth according to it, without repentance, cannot
be saved. Witnesse their doctrine in the point of vilifying the
Scriptures, and in point of free-will, and of Justification by works,
of the Popes Supremacy, of the Sacrifice of the Masse, of worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of Images, &amp;c. In regard of which, and such like, the Holy
Ghost saith, that their Religion is a Sea, <hi>become as the bloud of a
dead man, and every soule in that Sea dyeth,</hi> Rev. 16. 3. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
agreement in such a Religion will never prove them to be
true Churches; nor any Assemblies of Arrians, Antitrinitaries,
Anabaptists, or Famelists, supposing them also to be combined by
Covenant among themselves.</p>
            <p>But now for the Assemblies in <hi>England,</hi> the case is farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
for the Doctrine of the Articles of Religion which they
professe, and which they promise to hold and observe (though
some things are amisse in some of those Articles, and though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
persons live contrary in their lives) yet the doctrine is such that
whosoever beleeveth, and liveth according to it, shall undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be saved, and many thousands have been saved therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
therefore Assemblies united by Covenant to observe this doctrine
may be true Churches, when the Assemblies of Papists and others
may be false, although they also were combined by Covenant:
the reason of the difference rising from the difference that is in the
doctrine and Religion which they severally professe, and by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
binde themselves to observe, the one being fundamentally
corrupt, and consequently pernicious: The other in the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
points Orthodoxall and sound.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It must be remembred also (which was intimated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
that if fundamentall corruptions be professed in with impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency
and obstinacy, then God may disanull the Covenant on
his part, and give a Bill of divorce to such a people, <hi>Iere.</hi> 3. 8.
Now experience and the Scripture also doth witnesse of the Jesui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and <hi>Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt</hi>-Papists, that they repented not of the workes of
their hands, of worshipping Devills, and Idolls of Gold, &amp;c. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
repented they of their murthers, nor of their sorceries, nor of
their fornications, nor of their thefts, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 20, 21.</p>
            <p>But now for the Parish Assemblies in <hi>England,</hi> we hope that we
may safely say, they doe not sinne of obstinacy, but of ignorance,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57319:22"/>
having not been convinced (and many of them never having had
means to be convinced) of the corruptions that are amongst them,
in respect of their constitution, and worship, and Ministery, and
so the Covenant remaining among them, may prove them to be
Churches, when it cannot stand the Papists in like stead, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impenitent and obstinate: Which we doe not speake to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
the Parishes altogether, as if there were not dangerous cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
found in them, nay rather (the Lord be mercifull to the
sinnes of his people) wee may lament it with teares, that in respect
of their members and Ministery, in respect of their worship and
walkings, in many of those Assemblies there are found such appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
corruptions, as are justly grievous to a godly soule, that is
enlightened to discerne them, and greatly displeasing to the Lord,
and indeed had need to be repented of betime, least otherwise the
Lord remove the Candlesticke and unchurch them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 5.
In a word, the corruptions remaining are just causes of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and humiliation: but yet in as much as the Articles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which they professe, containe such wholesome doctrine,
that whosoever beleeveth and walketh according thereunto, in
sinceritie, shall undoubtedly be saved, and in as much as the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
are not persisted in with obstinacy, therefore wee deny
not but they have the truth of Churches remaining.</p>

by some speciall bond amongst themselves: for so one
Church would many times be dissolved into many, and many
Churches confounded into one. Now this bond is a Covenant,
either expressed or implicite, whereby beleevers do binde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
particularly to performe all such duties, both towards God
and mutually to one another, as pertaine to the nature of a

in <hi>New-England</hi> at this day. And that he was not for that seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
and regiditie of separation, may be cleared from sundry of
his workes, wherein he plainly and fully beares witnesse against
the same, and namely, in his <hi>Fresh suite against Ceremonies, pag.</hi> 207.
and in his second <hi>Manuduction,</hi> wherein he purposely and at large
deales in this Argument of Separation. Sure it is Master <hi>Canne</hi> in
his Booke, wherein he goes about to prove the necessitie of separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the Non-Conformists principles, doth professedly and
expressely oppose himselfe against Doctor <hi>Ames</hi> in the point of
Separation, which shewes how farre the good Doctor was from
favouring that way, when they most zealously therein doe count
him to be a speciall opposite of theirs, as indeed he was. And for
Master <hi>Parker,</hi> his judgement of Church-Covenant was heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in part; where he so much approveth the practise of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches in this point. And much more may be seene of
his judgement herein, in the sixteenth Chap. of the third booke of
his <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erence from this ground, that therefore Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Covenant
should not be received, because it is pleaded for and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed
by the Separatists. We Answer, that this will not follow,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57319:23"/>
unlesse it could be proved, that the Separatists hold no truth; or if
they hold a truth wee must not hold it, that so it may appeare
wee differ from them; Either of which, it were unreasonable to
affirme. If the Papists hold sundry Articles of Faith, as that there
is a unitie of the Divine Essence, and Trinitie of Persons, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ is God and man, and that true Messiah that was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and the onely Saviour of the world, and many such like, must
wee deny these things because they are holden by the Papists?
This were as unreasonable as to condemne the doctrine of the
Resurrection, because it was maintained by the Pharisees, <hi>Act.</hi> 23.
8. And so we say of Church-Covenant, holden and practised by
them of the Separation; as also many other truths are maintained
by them: No reason that truth should be refused, because the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratists
maintaine it. When Doctor <hi>Bancroft</hi> in a Sermon at
<hi>Pauls</hi>-Crosse, had avouched that the Superioritie of Bishops a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
other Ministers, is by Gods owne Ordinance, and to make
the contrary opinion odious, affirmed that <hi>Aerius</hi> per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ting in it,
was condemned for an Heretique by the generall consent of the
whole Church, and that <hi>Martin</hi> and his Companions, doe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the same opinion of <hi>Aerius;</hi> What saith learned Doctor Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds
hereunto, in a Letter to Sir <hi>Francis Knolls,</hi> who required him
to shew his judgement herein: <q>Touching <hi>Martin,</hi> saith he, if
any man behave himselfe otherwise then in discretion and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
he ought, let the blame be laid where the fault is, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
him not; but if by the way he utter a truth, mingled with
whatsoever else, it is not reason that that which is of GOD
should be condemned for that which is of man: no more then
the doctrine of the Resurrection should be reproved, because
it was maintained and held by the Pharisees: Wherefore remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the odious name of <hi>Martin</hi> from that which is sinceritie
and love, is to be dealt with, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And the very same doe wee say to them that would make
Church-Covenant to be odious, because it is held by those of the
Seperation, who are commonly called Brownists: If men behave
themselves otherwise then they ought, we defend them not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
but if they hold any truth mingled with whatsoever else, wee
would not have that which is of God to be condemned, for that
which is of man: truth should not be refused, because of other
corruptions that may be found in them that hold it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:57319:24"/>
               <q>If you with them hold Church-Covenant,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> you iustifie them in all
their Wayes of seperation and erronious opinions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Not so,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> for many of them hold that there are no visible Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
that stand members of the Parishes in England, and that it
is not lawfull to hold any private Religious communion with
such perso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s; and that the parishionall Assemblies are none of
them true Churches, and that it is not lawfull to hear any of those
Ministers to preach the Word, none of which are justified at all
by holding Church-Covenant, though they do hold the same;
There is no such necessarie and inseparable connexion betweene
these opinions, and that of Church-Covenant, that he that holds
this, must needs hold the other also.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But the time hath been,<note place="margin">Obje. 13.</note> when your selves did not hold Church-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
as now you do; when you were in England you were not of this
mind, and therefore no marvell if your change since your coming to New
England be suspected, and offensive. If you change your judgement
and practise in this manner, God knows whether you may come at last,
and therefore men may well be afraid of holding with you in this point,
which your selves did not hold when you lived in your native Countrey.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Some of us when we were in <hi>England,</hi> through the mercie of
God,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> did see the necessitie of Church-Covenant; and did also
preach it to the people amongst whom we ministred, though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
so soone nor so fully as were meete, for which we have cause
to be humbled, and to judge our selves before the Lord.</p>
            <p>But suppose we had never knowne nor practised the same be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our coming into this countrey, yet if it be a truth of God,
there is no reason why we should shut our eyes against the light,
when God holds it forth unto us, nor that others should be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at us for receiving the same. For by the same reason men
might still continue in their sinnes, and not make any progresse
in knowledge and holinesse, that so they may not seeme uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
which were contrary to the Scripture, wherein we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
nor to fashion our selves according to the former lusts of

                  </gap>hians</hi> and <hi>Ephesians,</hi> that the time had been
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57319:24"/>
when they were not the same men that now they are when he
wrote unto them; and yet he doth not blame them for leaving
their former opinions or practise, but commends them for it, 1.
<hi>Cor. 6. 11. Ephes.</hi> 2. 3. &amp;c. And it is said of <hi>Apollos</hi> an eloquent
man, aud mighty in the Scripture, that when he came to <hi>Ephesus</hi>
the way of God was expounded unto him more perfectly by
<hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla,</hi> whereas before he was instructed in the way
of the Lord, knowing onely the Baptisme of <hi>Iohn:</hi> yet this was
no dispraise at all to him, that now upon better information he
would change his judgement to the better, nor unto them that
were the means thereof: <hi>Act. 18. 25, 26. Nullus pudor est ad ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liura
transire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The time hath been, (and we may be humbled for it) when we
lived without God in the world, and some of us in many sinfull
courses: and shall any be offended, because we are not still the
same? and when God called us from the wayes of sin and death,
to the Fellowship of his grace in Christ; yet some of us lived a long
time in conformity to the ceremonies imposed in our native
Countrey, and saw not the evill of them. But when God did open
our eyes, and let us see the unlawfulnesse thereof, we cannot see
but it would have been a with-holding the truth in unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and a great unthankfulnesse to God for light revealed to us,
if we should still have continued in that course through an inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
desire of seeming constant: and therefore it is not any just
cause of offence that we have changed our judgement and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
in those things, when we once perceived the Word of God
to disallow them.</p>
            <p>Indeed it hath been sometime objected against Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi>
and others, that desired the reformation of the Churches in
<hi>England,</hi> in regard of Discipline and Church-Order, that they
which stood so much for Reformation in Discipline, did in after
times adde and alter some things, beyond what they saw at first,
and what themselves had formerly desired; and that therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so mutable, and inconstant in their apprehensions, they were
not to be regarded, nor hearkened unto: to which Objection Mr.
<hi>Parker</hi> makes full Answer <hi>in Eccles. lib. 2. ca. 36. p.</hi> 307. where he
sheweth from the Scripture, and the testimonie of Bishop <hi>Iewel,</hi>
               <q>Doctor <hi>Reinolds,</hi> and others, that in the Reformation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
God brings not his servants into perfection in knowledge
and zeale at the first, but by degrees, so as they grow and make
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57319:25"/>
progresse in these things in such wise; that their good works are
more at the last then at the first, as was said of the Church of
<hi>Thyatira,</hi> even as the man that had been blind, when Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
him to his sight, could at the first but see men like trees
walking, and afterward saw every man cleerly; and therefore it
is no good arguing to say these men have altered and corrected
such things from what their apprehensions were at first, and
therefore they are not to be regarded.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now if this be no good arguing against Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and
those that in <hi>England</hi> have been studious of Reformation (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is not) then it is no good Argument against us in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Church-Covenant, to say we now hold and practise other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then we have done in former time.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If any shall here reply,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> that change from conformity to the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
to Worship God more purely is warranted by the Word, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not blame-worthy, and that the same may be said of the case of
Apollos, of the Corinthians, and Ephesians forementioned, and of <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright,</hi> and the rest in his times.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> that this is true, and thereby it appears, that it is not
simply the changing a mans opinion or practise that can be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
blame-worthy, or offensive, but changing without warrant of
the Word; and therefore in point of Church-Covenant, the issue
must not be whether we or others have formerly known and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
it, but whether it have ground from Gods Word; For if it
have (as we hope have been proved before in this discourse) then
the observing of it, can be no cause of just offence unto others, nor
imputation of inconstancy to our selves, though in time past we
had not had so much light as to discerne the necessitie and use
thereof.</p>
            <p>The good Lord pardon every one that prepareth his heart to
seek God, though he be not cleansed according to the purification
of the Sanctuary: and grant unto all his Churches and servants,
that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> love may abound yet more and more in knowledge, and
in all judgement, that they may discerne the things that differ;
and approve the things that are excellent, and by his Spirit of
truth be led forward into all truth, till Antichrist be utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
with the breath of his mouth, and the brightnesse of his
coming, and the holy City new Jerusalem come down from God
out of heaven, as a Bride adorned for her husband the Lambe, the
Lord Jesus, to whom be all glory of affiance and service for ever.
