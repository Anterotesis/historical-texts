            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>John Penington</hi>'s Complaint, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THat men that profeſs Religion, (yea, which is more groſs, the Truth it ſelf) ſhould imploy their Skill, Wit and utmoſt Endeavours to ſmite and vilifie ſuch as were and are honourable therein, and that not through Ignorance, but wilfully and deſigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is truly ſad to conſider. An inſtance whereof I ſhall here give, in this my <hi>Complaint</hi> againſt <hi>William Rogers</hi>; wherein I wiſh I could charge him with only raſhneſs and indiſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not with premeditated and palpable falſhood, of which he is notoriouſly guilty. This let not the Reader take upon my bare word only, (as I doubt, from his ſeeming fairneſs too many have his) but read his Book, and obſerve the drift thereof, then he will ſee whether I had not juſt cauſe thus to reflect on him; and by comparing my Father's Book with his quotations, be able to judge, whether it did not behove me to vindicate, whom he had thus traduced, and lay the load at his own door. But that I may not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him too long from the proof, I haſten to make good my Charge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Rogers,</hi> in part 3. pag. 88. of his Book, (falſly ſtiled, <hi>The Chriſtian Quaker,</hi> &amp;c.) ſaith, <hi>We <hi>think it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to cite a Teſtimony publiſhed in Print by</hi>
               </hi> Iſaac Penington <hi>the younger, in the year</hi> 1660. <hi>being part of a Diſcourſe enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>The Authority and Government which Chriſt exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of his Church</hi>,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as it lies <hi>all together,</hi> word for word, and not taken <hi>by parts and pieces</hi> here and there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:45707:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>Who would have deſired fairer dealing than this! But here I charge him with a down-right falſhood, and impious prevarication, who with a <hi>Judas</hi>-kiſs (I mean a ſhew of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and integrity, with which he would prepoſſeſs and beguile his unwary and credulous Reader) labours to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the Truth and its ſincere Profeſſors into the hands of the wicked and ungodly: For notwithſtanding he ſo ſolemnly profeſſes to give <hi>the Teſtimony, not by parts and pieces, but as it lay altogether</hi>; and calls it, <hi>The Teſtimony of the ſaid</hi> Iſaac Penington, as if it were the whole: yet inſtead of keeping touch herein, he hath leapt over ſome leaves at the beginning, explanatory of the reſt, and left out an intire ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence at the cloſe, which he knew would n<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> ſerve his turn; but if fairly and impartially ſet down, would have both ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred his work inſignificant, and detected the falſeneſs of his dealing, as it could not but have manifeſted to every conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Reader, That <hi>W. R</hi>'s. deduction was not genuine but forc'd, which I cannot believe him unſenſible of, and therefore with deſign to have done it. For he could not but ſee, that what was there laid down did infer a neceſſity of <hi>Church-Government</hi>; a thing, he would inſinuate, neither my Father nor Friends in the beginning owned or allowed. And to make this good, indeed there was no ſurer way than to let fall what ſpake to the contrary; which courſe <hi>W. R.</hi> hath taken, and begins his quotation with the latter part of an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to a <hi>Queſtion,</hi> which he was ſo unworthy; as well as untrue to his word, as never to tranſcribe, nor the firſt part of the Anſwer neither. Theſe baſe under-hand dealings are ſo far from becoming a pretended <hi>Friend,</hi> that they are not like a <hi>fair Adverſary</hi>: and ſo unſuitable to a <hi>Christian Quaker,</hi> that they would be cauſe of ſhame to a <hi>moral Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queſtion propounded by my Father, was (as may be ſeen part 1. p. 238. of his Works.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:45707:3"/>Queſt.
<q>But is there to be no Greatneſs, no Authority among the Diſciples of Jeſus, or in the Church of Chriſt? Is every one to do what he will, to be ſubject to his own Fancies and Imaginations, to the Inventions of his own corrupt heart? What a confuſed Building will this be? Sure this will not long remain a <hi>Zion,</hi> but ſoon become a <hi>Babylon,</hi> even an heap of diſorder and confuſion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which my Father replied as followeth:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>There is to be no ſuch kind of greatneſs, no ſuch kind of Authority; yet there is both a Greatneſs and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſuitable to the ſtate of Diſciples, ſuitable to that kind of Kingdom whereof they are. There are Laws, there are Governments, there are Governours, there is Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and there is Subjection; but all in the Spirit, all ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to that which is to be governed: but no government of, or according to the Fleſh. As Chriſt's Kingdom is not of this world, ſo the government of his Church and People is not according to this world; but as that which gathers is his Spirit, and that which is gathered is ſpiritual; ſo that which is governed is the Spirits of his People, and they are to be governed by his Spirits, and ſpiritually, and not after a fleſhly manner.</p>
               <p>Thus Chriſt himſelf, though he miniſtred to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, yet he was alſo their Lord and Maſter; and in the Spirit and Life of the Father ruled over them; and thus the Apoſtles and other Miniſters of Chriſt had likewiſe in the Spirit, the care of the Churches, and Authority in the Lord, by his Spirit, to govern the Spirits of his People: not to govern after a fleſhly manner, by their own wills; not to preſcribe them in a lordly way, either what they ſhould believe or practice, but in the Light, and in the Power of the Spirit, to make their way into every ones Conſcience in the ſight of God, miniſtring to every one in the Spirit according to their capacity and growth, and waiting pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45707:4"/>
for God to convey the food and nouriſhment, and to build their Spirits up in the Faith thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Spirit of the Prophets is ſubject to the Prophets.</hi> Here is the Government, here is the Law of rule and ſubjection in the Life. Every one feeling a meaſure of the Spirit in himſelf, is thereby taught to own and ſubject to a greater meaſure of the ſame Spirit in another. He that hath no meaſure of the Spirit of God, he is not of God, he is none of Chriſt's: and he that hath received a meaſure of the Spirit, in the ſame Spirit feels anothers meaſure, and ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it in its place and ſervice, and knoweth its moving, and cannot quench it, but giveth way to it with joy and delight. When the Spirit moves in any one to ſpeak, the ſame Spirit moves in the other to be ſubject and give way: and ſo every one keeping to his own meaſure in the Spirit, here can be no diſorder, but true ſubjection of every Spirit: and where this is wanting, it cannot be ſupplied by any outward rule or order ſet up in the Church by common conſent; for that is fleſhly, and lets in the Fleſh, and deſtroys the true Order, Rule and Subjection.</p>
            </q>
            <p>[<hi>Thus far my Father.</hi>]</p>
            <p>All this <hi>W. R.</hi> never ſo much as mentions, which was the occaſion of all that he quotes, and to which it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative: but what follows, more immediately relating to the Government and Authority Chriſt excluded rather than to what he allowed, we find him cite at large, till the ſubject pinch'd him anew again, which was a few words concluſive of the whole, and that wound up his ſenſe, which it ſeems <hi>W. R.</hi> was not pleaſed to give us: And had he not had the confidence to ſay, <hi>That he had not taken it by parts and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but <hi>All</hi> together,</hi> I ſhould have the leſs wondered: But that a man pretending to Truth ſhould thus prevaricate in the face of the world, I cannot ſufficiently admire. Yet, whither will not men run to propagate an Intereſt, or defend a blaſted Cauſe! O that they would conſider it! O that they would lay it to heart!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:45707:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>That which <hi>W. R.</hi> left out at the cloſe, were theſe words (as may be ſeen part 1. p. 242. of my Father's Works.)</p>
            <p>
               <q>And the unity being thus kept, all will come into one <hi>outwardly</hi> alſo at length, as the Light grows in every one, and as every one grows into the Light: but this muſt be patiently waited for from the hand of God, (who hath the right way of effecting it, and who alone can do it) and not harſhly and cruelly attempted by the rough hand of man.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This would fully have evinced, that my Father did not only point at an inward Government of God's Spirit in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, but alſo laid down, That <hi>as the Life grew in every one, and every one grew into the Light,</hi> it would bring into <hi>one outwardly alſo at length</hi>; which is far from <hi>W. R.</hi>'s. purpoſe, and therefore deſignedly left out. For the whole drift of that very part of <hi>W. R</hi>'s Book (as the very Title-page exhibits) is to tie up all to an <hi>inward Government of Chriſt,</hi> excluſive of any outward Form of Government, Order or Diſcipline. And he cannot be content to be thus principled himſelf, but would make it appear as my Father's ſence too, though theſe his words (with many more omitted by him) are of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary tendency, which he durſt not (for all his ſhew of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and promiſe to <hi>take altogether as it lies</hi>) truſt his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with, leſt his untrue inferences ſhould be too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous.</p>
            <p>Thus much of his quotations, which being firſt compared with the Book, are now atteſted by <hi>Benjamin Clark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I dare appeal to any unbyaſſed judicious Reader, whether <hi>W. R.</hi> hath not dealt fallaciouſly, deceitfully and ſurreptiouſly, as well as unrighteouſly, thus to inſiſt as if he had been ſo fair and conſcientious in his quotations, when he hath been ſo egregiouſly the contrary. And ſince his ſcope and deſign in printing that part of my Father's Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45707:5"/>
ſeems to be that he might thereby inſinuate, as if my Father (at the writing of that Teſtimony) was in judgment one with himſelf, and oppoſite to, or different from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment Eſtabliſhed, and now practiſed in the Church of Chriſt among us, (as ſome of that Party have traduced him by word of mouth) let the Reader take the following in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances out of that part of the ſame diſcourſe, which <hi>W. R.</hi> hath knowingly omitted. And firſt, at the beginning of the Anſwer to the Queſtion, p. 238. par. 1. (tranſcribed alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy above) my Father hath theſe words: <hi>There is to be no ſuch kind of greatneſs, no ſuch kind of authority</hi> (meaning, as was exerciſed among the Gentiles, p. 236.) <hi>yet there is both a greatneſs and authority ſuitable to the ſtate of Diſciples, ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that kind of Government, whereof they are.</hi>— Again, <hi>There are Laws, there are Governments, there are Governours, there is ruling, and there is ſubjection, but all in the Spirit, all ſuitable to that which is to be governed: but no Government of, or according to the Fleſh.</hi>— Again, <hi>Thus the Apoſtles, and other Miniſters of Chriſt, had likewiſe in the Spirit the care of the Churches, and authority in the Lord, by his Spirit, to govern the Spirits of his People: not to govern after a fleſhly manner, by their own wills; not to preſcribe them in a lordly way, either what they ſhould believe or practice, but in the Light, and in the Power of the Spirit, to make their way into every ones con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in the ſight of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">This very paſſage anſwers much of <hi>W. R</hi>'s conteſt in his Book.</note> &amp;c.— Again, <hi>Every one feeling a meaſure of the Spirit in himſelf, is thereby taught to own and ſubject to a greater meaſure of the ſame Spirit of another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let us ſee, whether even out of that very part <hi>W. R.</hi> hath quoted, there be not words to the ſame effect; as where (p. 94. par. 3. of <hi>W. R</hi>'s Book) my Father ſaith, <hi>Care muſt be had, that nothing govern in the Church of Chriſt, but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt: that nothing elſe teach, nothing elſe exhort, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe admoniſh and reprove, nothing elſe cut off and cast
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45707:5"/>
out.</hi>— Again, <hi>Every Member is to wait in that meaſure of the Spirit which he hath received, to feel the goings forth of the Spirit in him that teacheth and governeth; and ſo to <hi>ſubject</hi> not to man, but to the Lord, to receive from the Lord, to obey the Lord.</hi>— Whence <hi>W. R.</hi> might have eaſily obſerved, that my Father, though he placed the Government of the Church in the Spirit of Chriſt only, as the Principal and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, yet he acknowledgeth, the Adminiſtration of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is committed both to Miniſters and Members as Inſtuments. But for a more full and additional ſatisfaction to any that may deſire further information in this matter, I refer the Reader to a Book entituled, <hi>Somewhat relating to Church-Government, wherein the Neceſſity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">See alſo part 2. page 400. of his works.</note> 
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs and bleſſed Effects of the true Church-Government is here and there hinted at,</hi> &amp;c. publiſhed ſince his death, but written by himſelf, in anſwer to ſome <hi>Apoſtates and Innovators,</hi> who probably may account themſelves <hi>Chriſtian Quakers</hi> as well as <hi>W. R.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed I am ſurprized, not expecting ſuch kind of dealing; nor could have thought his heart had been ſo hardned as not to value the juſtneſs of a cauſe, ſo he could but promote his tottering Fabrick. Will he proſtitute Soul, Reputation and all, in a ſtiffneſs againſt the Lord and his People! <hi>The Lord keep me in a tender ſenſe of, and regard to them, and that living Teſtimony they are entruſted withal, that I may not, through prejudice, fight againſt any thing that is of him, either in my own particular, or through his Servants, whom he is bleſſing and honouring in his Work, having ſeen the ill effects of it in this perſon, who doubtleſs, had he been told formerly, he ſhould thus have appeared againſt the Truth, and them that are in it, would have been ready enough to have ſaid with</hi> Hazael <hi>of old,</hi> Is thy Servant a Dog, that he ſhould do this thing?</p>
            <p>I could alſo obſerve, that in this his work of darkneſs and traducing my Father, he uſeth the word [We] and [Our]
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45707:6"/>
but knowing none that will own themſelves concern'd here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, I ſhall the leſs inſiſt thereon.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Thomas Criſp,</hi> who hath put forth a Book called, <hi>The Teſtimony of</hi> Iſaac Penington, &amp;c. he confeſſed to me, in the preſence of <hi>Philip Ford,</hi> That he had never read or ſeen that Book of my Fathers, but only gathered it out of <hi>William Roger</hi>'s Book. Now whether this be fair and equal, to take things thus upon truſt, without once (<hi>Boerean</hi>-like) <hi>ſearching his writings, to ſee whether the things were ſo or no</hi>; and then to add wide inferences of his own, as of a <hi>liberty in paying Tythes, as a Civil Right,</hi> &amp;c. far from my Father's ſence and conſtant practice; And laſtly, to publiſh them from the ſole Authority of a <hi>profeſſed Adverſary,</hi> who had already mangled the Book, and took things piece-meal, be not very injurious, and unbecoming a man, much more a Chriſtian, and which many <hi>Turks, Jews</hi> and Infidels would have ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, let the impartial conſider. But what can be expected of men that are departed from the juſt Principle in themſelves, and are daily doing deſpite to the Spirit of Grace? Indeed the very Title is fallacious,. to call it <hi>The Teſtimony of</hi> Iſaac Penington, and is an impoſing upon his Reader; whereas at beſt it is but <hi>Part</hi> of his Teſtimony, and that <hi>Part</hi> ſo craftily managed, as to ſpeak his ſence but in <hi>Part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this <hi>W. R.</hi> alſo may ſee what Spirit his Book gratifies, even a looſe, libertine Spirit, without Yoke, that would run back again to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and weaken the hands of the faithful Sufferers, even to death, for that oppreſſion of Tythes, which Friends, in the beginning, and to this day, aſſert to be <hi>a denying Chriſt come in the Fleſh</hi>; which I believe <hi>W. R.</hi> himſelf will not ſeem to gainſay. But this man ranks it and the uſe of plain Language (which is the only true Language, the other being a Lie) amongſt Friends <hi>Orders and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Which</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I fear you take more care for the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45707:6"/>
ſtrict obſervations of, than the Truth in the heart</hi>; as if theſe things had not been delivered from the Spirit of Truth, through Inſtruments it made choice of at the firſt breaking forth of Truth, but were taken up and held by Tradition only, as the beggarly rudiments of the world are; and therefore queries, <hi>If one cannot do ſo, must he therefore judge his Brother?</hi> adding, <hi>That may be required of one, which may not be required of another.</hi> (ſee p. 14 of his Pamphlet) Will <hi>W. R.</hi> ſtand by him herein? Will he thus encourage <hi>Tythe-Payers?</hi> Will he open this gap for Libertiniſm? Will he thus oppoſe the Truth to the Truth, making it to require one thing of one, and the contrary of another? to call one to bear a Teſtimony againſt Tythes with jeopardy of Life and Eſtate, and allow the other to pay it as a <hi>Civil Right</hi>? What, will God's Spirit be thus inconſiſtent with it ſelf? But if he ſay <hi>Nay,</hi> and fall not in with this man's work; yet hence he may ſee what it is joyns with him, and ſhelters it ſelf under his wing, even that which ſhuns the Croſs, and ſeeks eaſe in the Fleſh.</p>
            <p>That which <hi>W. R.</hi> cites as <hi>Edward Borrough</hi>'s Paper, and which <hi>T. C.</hi> takes upon truſt, as his Viſion, is a Queſtion to ſeveral; firſt, Whether <hi>E. B.</hi> ever wrote that, or any ſuch Paper? 2<hi>dly.</hi> For ſatisfaction it is demanded of <hi>W. R.</hi> and <hi>T. C.</hi> to prove that cited by them to be <hi>E. B</hi>'s. own intire Paper, and to acquit themſelves that they have not prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated here, as <hi>W. R.</hi> has done in my Father's Caſe, however fair he would ſeem to be, confeſſing, pag. 84. part 5. <hi>That adventuring to add to another man's words,</hi> (and I may hope I ſay, or to diminiſh from them either, eſpecially when he avers, <hi>he has taken them altogether as they lay) rendring them as another man's words, materially altering the ſence, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted plain Forgery.</hi>

            <head>My Mothers Account is as followeth.</head>
            <p>IT is very contrary to my judgment, and the frame of my mind, to make any other appearance in publick, than an Innocent and Righteous Converſation; but I ſee a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to give ſome account of the cauſe of my dear Husband (<hi>Iſaac Penington</hi>'s) Impriſonment in <hi>Reading,</hi> as alſo to ſpeak ſomething in reference to the ſettling of my Rents, thereby to remove, out of the way of the tender, the ſtumbling-block that <hi>W. R.</hi> (in his Book entituled, <hi>The Chriſtian Quaker,</hi> &amp;c. par. 5. p. 43, to 47.) may have laid before the upright, to the leſſening of my Teſtimony to the undefiled Truth, unvailed with covers or pretences.</p>
            <p>As for his charging <hi>G. F.</hi> with adviſing me, I never had any advice from him contrary to my own conſcience, nor in the leaſt to leſſen Truths Teſtimony: But this I ſay, My ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and dear Husband ſuffered five times Impriſonment in the Gaol of <hi>Alisbury</hi> in the County of <hi>Bucks,</hi> for the ſpace of ſeven years, being but little at home, but Impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned many months at a time; once three quarters of a year, another time a year and a half; in all which Impriſonments, I (through the Lord's great kindneſs to me) never conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted proviſion or ſecurity in any point, though ſollicited by my Relations to have done ſomewhat to preſerve my Eſtate, all my Husband's being gone upon his Father's account: But ſo clearly and fully was I given up to ſuffer the loſs of Eſtate and ſpoil of Goods, in his pure Teſtimony to Truth, that I never ſo much as attempted any ſecuring it or them; and never had, but once ſo much as an inclining in my mind to put by any thing, though of value, and not of very neceſſary uſe in the Family; but at that very time, before I could lay hand on any thing for that purpoſe, it was ſaid in me, <hi>Do not provide; Do not contrive; Leave all with the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45707:7"/>
Lord</hi>; and immediately let the thing fall. And further, when ſufferings for Meetings by Impriſonment, gave way to Proceedings by Fines upon Preachers, Hearers and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Houſes where Meetings were, the Lord gave me a clear quiet ſubmitting to it, though I had in my view the ruine and havock that 40 <hi>l.</hi> a week could procure to us, my Husband being engaged in at leaſt two meetings a week, and having a Teſtimony for Truth by the Gift beſtowed on him to miniſter in.</p>
            <p>All this I make mention of, to manifeſt that whilſt my dear Husband ſuffered purely for Truth's Teſtimony, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver went about in the leaſt way to ſhun or fly the ſuffering. Now the cauſe of his ſuffering in <hi>Reading</hi> Gaol was not, in the firſt place, upon a neceſſity immediately laid upon him from the Lord for his Teſtimony; but he was betrayed for the ſake of my Eſtate, as was confeſſed by the perſon that committed him, to a Woman of Condition, that lived near <hi>Reading</hi>; who being earneſt with him on my Husband's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, and could not allay him, ſaid, <hi>What will ye get by premu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niring him? He hath no Eſtate, all being forfeited to the King, for his Father's being one of the King's Judges</hi>: To which he replied, <hi>I know that; but his Wife hath a good Joynture.</hi> The Gaoler alſo confeſſed to me, that he had orders a year before to ſtop him in the Priſon, when he came thither to viſit the Priſoners, and to give notice of it; which words he ſaid to me, upon my charging him with betraying my Husband: And I anſwered to it, <hi>What, to be thus dealt with, without an Offence?</hi> But he was ſilent to that. Nay, his very going to <hi>Reading</hi> was very accidental; I being from home, and he intending in my abſence to viſit three ſeveral places, but was diſappointed in them all; upon which, a Friend that was with him ſaid, <hi>Go with me to</hi> Reading, <hi>and viſit Friends in Priſon</hi>; which he did: And when he had viſited thoſe of the fore-ſide of the Priſon, he croſſed the Gaoler's Yard, to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45707:8"/>
ſee the Friends on the other ſide. The Gaoler ſeeing him, asked a Friend, what that man's name was? who ſimply told him, <hi>Iſaac Penington.</hi> Immediately he goes, or ſends to one (called a Juſtice) to acquaint him; who ſends an Officer and a Servant to fetch him before him, and he and another (called a Juſtice) tendring him the Oath, upon his refuſal committed him. I coming towards home, and being met with this unpleaſant account, was, I confeſs, greatly ſadned, his going being ſo accidental, only in an innocent freedom, and not upon a conſtraint; I weighing, that this was a great ſuffering to his perſon, which threatned ruin alſo to me and my Children. Now chiefly looking upon it, as indeed it was, a trepan for my Eſtate, I had great freedom in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring the ſecuring of it, and preventing the Devourers of their prey: ſo I did in clearneſs ſend to <hi>London,</hi> and had the Arrears and Rents, that hereafter ſhould be due (for the Eſtate it ſelf they could detain no longer than my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band lived) made over to a Friend of mine, for the uſe of me and my Children. As alſo, I put out of the Houſe ſome Plate and other Goods as was mine when I was a Widow, and made over to a Kinſwoman of mine before marriage; but what was neceſſary for a Family, was left to a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable value; which things were more immediately my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Goods, who was then in Priſon.</p>
            <p>And now I have given this true Relation, I ſum up all thus, That what I have here aſſerted to be done by me, was no ſhift, or carnal hiding from ſpoil, in that that was a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, but a clear acting to diſappoint the Betrayer of the Innocent, who was made a Tranſgreſſor for to be prey'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and in freedom from the Lord to ſecure him, my ſelf and Children from the Treachery and evil Stratagems of his Proſecutor. I do, in God's fear, ſay to every one that reads or hears theſe lines, That in the tendereſt, compoſedſt, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt frame of mind, that ever I felt ſince, I was never condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45707:8"/>
for it, nor ſhewed that I erred in it, but rather acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and am ſatisfied in it at preſent, as in reference to its being no hiding from Sufferings. For I do believe, that if I had appeared to ſuffer for Truth, and at that time had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly ſecured my Eſtate, it had been a very evil thing, and that which I have hitherto been preſerved from; who in the midſt of many infirmities and weakneſſes have this to boaſt of (in the Lord's mercy and ſtrength) that I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered without guile or covering, by ſecret Contrivances or Proviſions for my ſafety: This the all-ſeeing God knows, and to him I commit my Cauſe, and the Cauſes of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Servants of the Lord, aſperſed by <hi>W.
