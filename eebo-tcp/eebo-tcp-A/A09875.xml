            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Wherevpon this Examinat demaunded his name? and the Spirit answered, his name was <hi>Tibb</hi>: and so this Examinate in hope of such gaine as was promised by the sayd Deuill or <hi>Tibb,</hi> was contented to giue her Soule to the said Spirit: And for the space of fiue of sixe yeares next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the sayd Spirit or Deuill appeared at sundry times vnto her this Examinate about <hi>Day-light</hi> Gate, alwayes bidding her stay, and asking her this Examinate what she would

haue or doe? To whom this Examinate replyed, Nay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: for she this Examinate said, she wanted nothing yet. And so about the end of the said sixe yeares, vpon a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both day in the morning, this Examinate hauing a litle Child vpon her knee, and she being in a slumber, the sayd Spirit appeared vnto her in the likenes of a browne Dogg, forcing himselfe to her knee, to get blood vnder her left Arme: and she being without any apparrell sauing her Smocke, the said Deuill did get blood vnder her left arme. And this Examinate awaking, sayd, <hi>Iesus saue my Child</hi>; but had no power, nor could not say, <hi>Iesus saue her selfe</hi>: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the Browne Dogge vanished out of this Examinats sight: after which, this Examinate was almost starke madd for the space of eight weekes.</p>

That a little before Christmas last, this Examinates Daughter hauing been to helpe <hi>Richard Baldwyns</hi> Folkes at the Mill: This Examinates Daughter did bid her this Examinate goe to the said <hi>Baldwyns</hi> house, and aske him something for her helping of his Folkes at the Mill, (as aforesaid:) and in this Examinates going to the said <hi>Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyns</hi> house, and neere to the said house, she mette with the said <hi>Richard Baldwyn</hi>; Which <hi>Baldwyn</hi> sayd to this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, and the said <hi>Alizon Deuice</hi> (who at that time ledde this Examinate, being blinde) get out of my ground Whores and Witches, I will burne the one of you, and hang the other.

                  <p>And further this Examinate confesseth, and sayth, that the speediest way to take a mans life away by VVitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, is to make a Picture of Clay, like vnto the shape of the person whom they meane to kill, &amp; dry it thorowly: and when they would haue them to be ill in any one place more then an other; then take a Thorne or Pinne, and pricke it in that part of the Picture you would so haue to be ill: and when they would haue any part of the Body to consume away, then take that part of the Picture, and burne it. And when they would haue the whole body to consume away, then take the remnant of the sayd Picture, and burne it: and so therevpon by that meanes, the body shall die.</p>

                     <p>And this Examinate further sayth; that <hi>Robert Nutter</hi> did desire her Daughter one <hi>Redfearns</hi> wife, to haue his pleasure of her, being then in <hi>Redfearns</hi> house: but the sayd <hi>Redfearns</hi> wife denyed the sayd <hi>Robert</hi>; wherevpon the sayd <hi>Robert</hi> seeming to be greatly displeased there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, in a great anger tooke his Horse, and went away, saying in a great rage, that if euer the Ground came to him, shee should neuer dwell vpon his Land. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon this Examinate called <hi>Fancie</hi> to her; who came to her in the likenesse of a Man in a parcell of Ground cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Laund</hi>; asking this Examinate, what shee would haue him to doe? And this Examinate bade him goe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge her of the sayd <hi>Robert Nutter.</hi> After which time, the sayd <hi>Robert Nutter</hi> liued about a quarter of a yeare, and then dyed.</p>
                     <p>And this Examinate further sayth, that <hi>Elizabeth Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> wife to old <hi>Robert Nutter,</hi> did request this Examinate, and <hi>Loomeshaws</hi> wife of <hi>Burley,</hi> and one <hi>Iane Boothman,</hi> of the same, who are now both dead, (which time of request, was before that <hi>Robert Nutter</hi> desired the company of <hi>Redfearns</hi> wife) to get young <hi>Robert Nutter</hi> his death, if

they could; all being togeather then at that time, to that end, that if <hi>Robert</hi> were dead, then the Women their Coosens might haue the Land: By whose perswasion, they all consented vnto it. After which time, this Examinates Sonne in law <hi>Thomas Redfearne,</hi> did perswade this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminate, not to kill or hurt the sayd <hi>Robert Nutter</hi>; for which perswasion, the sayd <hi>Loomeshaws</hi> Wife, had like to haue killed the sayd <hi>Redfearne,</hi> but that one M. <hi>Baldwyn</hi> (the late Schoole-maister at <hi>Coulne</hi>) did by his learning, stay the sayd <hi>Loomeshaws</hi> wife, and therefore had a Capon from <hi>Redfearne.</hi>

and so neuer after that time, for some eight or nine weekes, they could haue any drinke, but spoiled, and as this Examinate thinketh was by the meanes of the said <hi>Chattox.</hi> And further he saith, that the said <hi>Anne Whittle,</hi> alias <hi>Chattox,</hi> and <hi>Anne Redferne</hi> her said Daughter, are commonly reputed and reported to bee Witches. And hee also saith, that about some eighteene yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, he dwelled with one <hi>Robert Nutter</hi> the elder, of Pendle aforesaid. And that yong <hi>Robert Nutter,</hi> who dwelled with his Grand-father, in the Sommer time, he fell sicke, and in his said sicknesse hee did seuerall times complaine, that hee had harme by them: and this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate asking him what hee meant by that word <hi>Them,</hi> He said, that he verily thought that the said <hi>Anne Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> alias <hi>Chattox,</hi> and the said <hi>Redfernes</hi> wife, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched him: and the said <hi>Robert Nutter</hi> shortly after, being to goe with his then Master, called Sir <hi>Richard Shattleworth,</hi> into Wales, this Examinate heard him say before his then going, vnto the said <hi>Thomas Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferne,</hi> that if euer he came againe he would get his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to put the said <hi>Redferne</hi> out of his house, or he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe would pull it downe; to whom the said <hi>Redferne</hi> replyed, saying; when you come back againe you will be in a better minde: but he neuer came back againe, but died before Candlemas in Cheshire, as he was comming homeward.</p>

                     <p>And he also sayth, That the names of the said Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as were on Good-Friday at this Examinates said Grandmothers house, and now this Examinates owne mothers, for so many of them as hee did know, were these, <hi>viz.</hi> The wife of <hi>Hugh Hargreiues</hi> of Burley; the wife of <hi>Christopher Bulcock,</hi> of the Mosse end, and <hi>Iohn</hi> her sonne; the mother of <hi>Myles Nutter; Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> the wife of <hi>Christopher Hargreiues,</hi> of Thurni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holme; <hi>Christopher Howgate,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> his wife; <hi>Alice Graye</hi> of Coulne, and one <hi>Mould-heeles</hi> wife, of the same: and this Examinate, and his Mother.

                     <p>HE saith, that vpon Sheare Thursday was two yeares, his Grand-Mother <hi>Elizabeth Sothernes,</hi> alias <hi>Dembdike,</hi> did bid him this Examinate goe to the church to receiue the Communion (the next day after being Good Friday) and then not to eate the Bread the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster gaue him, but to bring it and deliuer it to such a thing as should meet him in his way homewards: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding her perswasions, this Examinate did eate the Bread: and so in his comming, homeward some for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie roodes off the said Church, there met him a thing in the shape of a Hare, who spoke vnto this Examinate, and asked him whether hee had brought the Bread that his Grand-mother had bidden him, or no? whereupon this Examinate answered, hee had not: and thereupon the said thing threatned to pull this Examinate in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and so this Examinate thereupon marked himselfe to God, and so the said thing vanished out of this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates sight. And within some foure daies after that, there appeared in this Examinates sight, hard by the new Church in Pendle, a thing like vnto a browne</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:15387:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>Dogge,</hi> who asked this Examinate to giue him his Soule, and he should be reuenged of any whom hee would: whereunto this Examinate answered, that his Soule was not his to giue, but was his <hi>Sauiour Iesus Christs,</hi> but as much as was in him this Examinate to giue, he was contented he should haue it.</p>
                     <p>And within two or three daies after, this Examinate went to the Carre-Hall, and vpon some speeches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Mistris <hi>Towneley</hi> and this Examinate; Shee char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging this Examinate and his said mother, to haue stolne some Turues of hers, badde him packe the doores: and withall as he went forth of the doore, the said Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris <hi>Towneley</hi> gaue him a knock betweene the shoulders: and about a day or two after that, there appeared vnto this Examinate in his way, a thing like vnto a black dog, who put this Examinate in minde of the said Mistris <hi>Towneleyes</hi> falling out with him this Examinate; who bad this Examinate make a Picture of Clay, like vnto the said Mistris <hi>Towneley:</hi> and that this Examinate with the helpe of his Spirit (who then euer after bidde this Examinate to call it <hi>Dandy</hi>) would kill or destroy the said Mistris <hi>Towneley:</hi> and so the said dogge vanished out of this Examinates sight. And the next morning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, this Examinate tooke Clay, and made a Picture of the said Mistris <hi>Towneley,</hi> and dried it the same night by the fire: and within a day after, hee, this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate began to crumble the said Picture, euery day some, for the space of a weeke: and within two daies after all was crumbled away; the said Mistris <hi>Towneley</hi> died.</p>
                     <p>And hee further saith, That in Lent last one <hi>Iohn Duckworth</hi> of the Lawnde, promised this Examinate an old shirt: and within a fortnight after, this Examinate

went to the said <hi>Duckworthes</hi> house, and demanded the said old shirt; but the said <hi>Duckworth</hi> denied him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And going out of the said house, the said Spirit <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> appeared vnto this Examinate, and said, Thou didst touch the said <hi>Duckworth</hi>; whereunto this Examinate answered, he did not touch him: yes (said the Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine) thou didst touch him, and therfore I haue power of him: whereupon this Examinate ioyned with the said Spirit, and then wished the said Spirit to kill the said <hi>Duckworth</hi>: and within one weeke, then next after, <hi>Duckworth</hi> died.</p>
                     <p>This voluntary Confession and Examination of his owne, containing in itselfe matter sufficient in Law to charge him, and to proue his offences, contained in the two seuerall Indictments, was sufficient to satisfie the Gentlemen of the Iury of Life and Death, that he is guiltie of them, and either of them: yet my Lord <hi>Brom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> commanded, for their better satisfaction, that the Witnesses present in Court against any of the Prisoners, should be examined openly, <hi>viua voce,</hi> that the Prisoner might both heare and answere to euery particular point of their Euidence; notwithstanding any of their Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations taken before any of his Maiesties Iustices of Peace within the same Countie.</p>

                     <p>ANd being examined, he further saith, That vpon Sheare-Thursday last, in the euening, he this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate stole a Wether from <hi>Iohn Robinson</hi> of Barley, and brought it to his Grand-mothers house, old <hi>Demb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike,</hi> and there killed it: and that vpon the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being Good-Friday, about twelue of the clocke in the day time, there dined in this Examinates mothers house a number of persons, whereof three were men, with this Examinate, and the rest women; and that they met there for three Causes following, as this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates said Mother told this Examinate.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The first was, for the naming of the Spirit which <hi>Alizon Deuice,</hi> now prisoner at Lancaster, had, but did not name him, because she was not there.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The second Cause was, for the deliuerie of his said Grand-mother; this Examinates said sister <hi>Alizon</hi>; the said <hi>Anne Chattox,</hi> and her daughter, <hi>Redfernes</hi>; killing the Gaoler at Lancaster; and before the next Assises to blow vp the Castle there, to the end the aforesaid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons might by that meanes make an escape &amp; get away: all which this Examinate then heard them conferre of.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And the third Cause was, for that there was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb facs="tcp:15387:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
dwelling in Gisborne Parish, who came into this Examinates said Grandmothers house, who there came and craued assistance of the rest of them that were then there, for the killing of Master <hi>Lister</hi> of Westby, because (as shee then said) he had borne malice vnto her, and had thought to haue put her away at the last Assises at Yorke, but could not and this Examinate heard the said woman say, That her power was not strong ynough to doe it her selfe, being now lesse then before time it had beene.</p>
                     <p>And also, that the said <hi>Iennet Preston</hi> had a Spirit with her like vnto a white Foale, with a blacke spot in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>
                     <p>And he also saith, That the names of the said Witches as were on Good-Friday at this Examinates said Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers house, &amp; now this Examinates owne mothers, for so many of them as he did know, were these, <hi>viz.</hi> the wife of <hi>Hugh Hargreiues</hi> of Barley; the wife of <hi>Christopher Bulcock</hi> of the Mosse end, and <hi>Iohn</hi> her sonne; the mother of <hi>Myles Nutter; Elizabeth,</hi> the wife of <hi>Christopher Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greiues,</hi> of Thurniholme; <hi>Christopher Howgate,</hi> and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> his wife; <hi>Alice Graye</hi> of Coulne, and one <hi>Mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heeles</hi> wife, of the same: and this Examinate, and his Mother. And this Examinate further saith, That all the said Witches went out of the said House in their owne shapes and likenesses. And they all, by that they were forth of the dores, were gotten on Horsebacke, like vnto Foales, some of one colour, some of another; and <hi>Prestons</hi> wife was the last; and when shee got on Horsebacke, they all presently vanished out of this Examinates sight. And before their said parting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, they all appointed to meete at the said <hi>Prestons</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:15387:39"/>
wiues house that day twelue-moneths; at which time the said <hi>Prestons</hi> wife promised to make them a great Feast. And if they had occasion to meete in the meane time, then should warning be giuen, that they all should meete vpon <hi>Romleyes</hi> Moore.</p>

Against IENNET BIERLEY, ELLEN BIERLEY, <hi>and</hi> IANE SOVTHVVORTH, <hi>prisoners at the Barre, vpon their Arraignement and Triall,</hi> viz.</head>
                     <p>THe said <hi>Grace Sowerbutts</hi> vpon her oath saith, That for the space of some yeares now last past shee hath beene haunted and vexed with some women, who haue vsed to come to her: which women, shee sayth, were <hi>Iennet Bierley,</hi> this Informers Grand-mother; <hi>Ellen Bier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> wife to <hi>Henry Bierley; Iane Southworth,</hi> late the wife of <hi>Iohn Southworth,</hi> and one <hi>Old Doewife,</hi> all of Salmes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie aforesaid. And shee saith, That now lately those foure women did violently draw her by the haire of the head, and layd her on the toppe of a Hay-mowe, in the said <hi>Henry Bierleyes</hi> Barne. And shee saith further, That not long after the said <hi>Iennet Bierley</hi> did meete this Examinate neere vnto the place where shee dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and first appeared in her owne likenesse, and after that in the likenesse of a blacke Dogge, and as this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate did goe ouer a Style, shee picked her off: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit shee saith shee had no hurt then, but rose againe, and went to her Aunts in Osbaldeston, and returned backe againe to her Fathers house the same night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fetched home by her father. And she saith, That in her way home-wards shee did then tell her Father,
<pb facs="tcp:15387:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
how shee had beene dealt withall both then and at sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times before that; and before that time she neuer told any bodie thereof: and being examined why she did not, she sayth, she could not speake thereof, though she desired so to doe. And she further sayth, That vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Saterday, being the fourth of this instant Aprill, shee this Examinate going towards Salmesbury bote, to meete her mother, comming from Preston, shee saw the said <hi>Iennet Bierley,</hi> who met this Examinate at a place called the Two Brigges, first in her owne shape, and afterwards in the likenesse of a blacke Dogge, with two legges, which Dogge went close by the left side of this Examinate, till they came to a Pitte of Water, and then the said Dogge spake, and persuaded this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to drowne her selfe there, saying, it was a faire and an easie death: Whereupon this Examinate thought there came one to her in a white sheete, and carried her away from the said Pitte, vpon the comming whereof the said blacke Dogge departed away; and shortly after the said white thing departed also: And after this Examinate had gone further on her way, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the length of two or three Fields, the said blacke Dogge did meete her againe, and going on her left side, as aforesaid, did carrie her into a Barne of one <hi>Hugh Walshmans,</hi> neere there by, and layed her vpon the Barne-floore, and couered this Examinate with Straw on her bodie, and Haye on her head, and the Dogge it selfe lay on the toppe of the said Straw, but how long the said Dogge lay there, this Examinate cannot tell, nor how long her selfe lay there: for shee sayth, That vpon her lying downe there, as aforesaid, her Speech and Senses were taken from her: and the first
<pb facs="tcp:15387:48"/>
time shee knew where shee was, shee was layed vpon a bedde in the said <hi>Walshmans</hi> house, which (as shee hath since beene told) was vpon the Monday at night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: and shee was also told, That shee was found and taken from the place where shee first lay, by some of her friends, and carried into the said <hi>Walshmans</hi> house, within a few houres after shee was layed in the Barne, as aforesaid. And shee further sayth, That vpon the day following, being Tuesday, neere night of the same day, shee this Examinate was fetched by her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother from the said <hi>Walshmans</hi> house to her Fathers house. And shee saith, That at the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore specified, called the Two Brigges, the said <hi>Iennet Bierley</hi> and <hi>Ellen Bierley</hi> did appeare vnto her in their owne shapes: whereupon this Examinate fell downe, and after that was not able to speake, or goe, till the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day following: during which time, as she lay in her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house, the said <hi>Iennet Bierley</hi> and <hi>Ellen Bierley</hi> did once appeare vnto her in their owne shapes, but they did nothing vnto her then, neither did shee euer see them since. And shee further sayth, That a good while before all this, this Examinate did goe with the said <hi>Iennet Bierley,</hi> her Grand-mother, and the said <hi>Ellen Bierley</hi> her Aunt, at the bidding of her said Grand-mother, to the house of one <hi>Thomas Walsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> in Salmesbury aforesaid. And comming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the night, when all the house-hold was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, the doores being shut, the said <hi>Iennet Bierley</hi> did open them, but this Examinate knoweth not how: and beeing come into the said house, this Examinate and the said <hi>Ellen Bierley</hi> stayed there, and the said <hi>Iennet Bierley</hi> went into the Chamber
<pb facs="tcp:15387:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
where the said <hi>Walshman</hi> and his wife lay, &amp; from thence brought a little child, which this Examinate thinketh was in bed with it Father and Mother: and after the said <hi>Iennet Bierley</hi> had set her downe by the fire, with the said child, shee did thrust a naile into the nauell of the said child: and afterwards did take a pen and put it in at the said place, and did suck there a good space, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards laid the child in bed againe: and then the said <hi>Iennet</hi> and the said <hi>Ellen</hi> returned to their owne houses, and this Examinate with them. And shee thinketh that neither the said <hi>Thomas Walshman,</hi> nor his wife knew that the said child was taken out of the bed from them. And shee saith also, that the said child did not crie when it was hurt, as aforesaid: But she saith, that shee thinketh that the said child did thenceforth languish, and not long after dyed. And after the death of the said child; the next night after the buriall thereof, the said <hi>Iennet Bierley</hi> &amp; <hi>Ellen Bierley,</hi> taking this Examinate with them, went to Salmesburie Church, and there did take vp the said child, and the said <hi>Iennet</hi> did carrie it out of the Church-yard in her armes, and then did put it in her lap and carryed it home to her owne house, and hauing it there did boile some therof in a Pot, and some did broile on the coales, of both which the said <hi>Iennet</hi> and <hi>Ellen</hi> did eate, and would haue had this Examinate and one <hi>Grace Bierley,</hi> Daughter of the said <hi>Ellen,</hi> to haue eaten with them, but they refused so to doe: And afterwards the said <hi>Iennet</hi> &amp; <hi>Ellen</hi> did seethe the bones of the said child in a pot, &amp; with the Fat that came out of the said bones, they said they would annoint themselues, that thereby they might sometimes change themselues into other shapes. And after all this being done, they said they
<pb facs="tcp:15387:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
would lay the bones againe in the graue the next night following, but whether they did so or not, this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate knoweth not: Neither doth shee know how they got it out of the graue at the first taking of it vp. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further sworne and examined, she deposeth &amp; saith, that about halfe a yeare agoe, the said <hi>Iennet Bierley, Ellen Bierley, Iane Southworth,</hi> and this Examinate (who went by the appointment of the said <hi>Iennet</hi> her Grand mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) did meete at a place called Red banck, vpon the North-side of the water of Ribble, euery Thursday and Sonday at night by the space of a fortnight, and at the water side there came vnto them, as they went thether, foure black things, going vpright, and yet not like men in the face: which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oure did carrie the said three women and this Examinate ouer the Water, and when they came to the said Red Banck they found some thing there which they did eate. But this Examinate saith, shee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer saw such meate; and therefore shee durst not eate thereof, although her said Grand mother did bidde her eate. And after they had eaten, the said three Women and this Examinate danced, euery one of them with one of the black things aforesaid, and after their dancing the said black things did pull downe the said three Women, and did abuse their bodies, as this Examinate thinketh, for shee saith, that the black thing that was with her, did abuse her bodie.</p>
                     <p>The said Examinate further saith vpon her Oth, That about ten dayes after her Examination taken at Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, shee this Examinate being then come to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house againe, after shee had beene certaine dayes at her Vnckles house in Houghton: <hi>Iane Southworth</hi> wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, did meet this Examinate at her Fathers house dore
<pb facs="tcp:15387:49"/>
and did carrie her into the loft, and there did lay her vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the floore, where shee was shortly found by her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and brought downe, and laid in a bed, as afterwards shee was told: for shee saith, that from the first meeting of the said <hi>Iane Southworth,</hi> shee this Examinate had her speech and senses taken from her. But the next day shee saith, shee came somewhat to her selfe, and then the said Widow <hi>Southworth</hi> came againe to this Examinate to her bed-side, and tooke her out of bed, and said to this Examinate, that shee did her no harme the other time, in respect of that shee now would after doe to her, and thereupon put her vpon a hey-stack, standing some three or foure yards high from the earth, where shee was found after great search made, by a neighbours Wife neare dwelling, and then laid in her bed againe, where she remained speechlesse and senselesse as before, by the space of two or three daies: And being recouered, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a weeke after shee saith, that the said <hi>Iane Southworth</hi> did come againe to this Examinate at her fathers house and did take her away, and laid her in a ditch neare to the house vpon her face, and left her there, where shee was found shortly after, and laid vpon a bedde, but had not her senses againe of a day &amp; a night, or thereabouts. And shee further saith, that vpon Tuesday last before the taking of this her Examination, the said <hi>Iane South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> came to this Examinates Fathers house, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this Examinate without the doore, tooke her and carried her into the Barne, and thrust her head amongst a companie of boords that were there standing, where shee was shortly after found and laid in a bedde, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in her old fit till the Thursday at night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:15387:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>And being further examined touching her being at Red-bancke, shee saith, That the three women, by her before named, were carried backe againe ouer Ribble, by the same blacke things that carried them thither; and saith that at their said meeting in the Red-bancke, there did come also diuers other women, and did meete them there, some old, some young, which this Examinate thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth did dwell vpon the North-side of Ribble, because she saw them not come ouer the Water: but this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate knew none of them, neither did she see them eat or dance, or doe any thing else that the rest did, sauing that they were there and looked on.</p>
                     <p>These particular points of Euidence being thus vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged against the Prisoners: the father of this <hi>Grace Sower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butts</hi> prayed that <hi>Thomas Walshman,</hi> whose childe they are charged to murther, might be examined as a witnes vpon his oath, for the Kings Maiestie, against the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners at the Barre: who vpon this strange deuised accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, deliuered by this impudent wench, were in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of many of that great Audience guilty of this blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die murther, and more worthy to die then any of these Witches.</p>

                     <p>Heere they vse great violence to her, whome in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place they make choise to be of their counsell, to go with them to the house of <hi>Walshman</hi> to murther the childe. This courtesie deserues no discouery of so foule a Fact.</p>
                     <q>
                        <pb facs="tcp:15387:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>Not long after, the said <hi>Iennet Bierley</hi> did meet this Examinate neere vnto the place where she dwelled, and first appeared in her owne likenesse, and after that in the likenesse of a blacke Dogge.</q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vno &amp; eodem tempore,</hi> shee transformed her selfe into a Dogge. I would know by what meanes any Priest can maintaine this point of Euidence.</p>
                     <q>And as shee went ouer a Style, shee picked her ouer, but had no hurt.</q>
                     <p>This is as likely to be true as the rest, to throw a child downe from the toppe of a House, and neuer hurt her great toe.</p>
                     <q>She rose againe; had no hurt, went to her Aunt, and returned backe againe to her Fathers house, being fetched home.</q>
                     <p>I pray you obserue these contrarieties, in order as they are placed, to accuse the Prisoners.</p>
                     <q>Saterday the fourth of this instant Aprill.</q>
                     <p>Which was about the very day the Witches of the Forrest of Pendle were sent to Lancaster. Now was the time for the Seminarie to instruct, accuse, and call into question these poore women: for the wrinckles of an old wiues face is good euidence to the Iurie against a Witch. And how often will the common people say <hi>(Her eyes are sunke in her head,</hi> GOD <hi>blesse vs from her.)</hi> But old <hi>Chattox</hi> had <hi>Faencie,</hi> besides her withered face, to accuse her.</p>
                     <q>
                        <pb facs="tcp:15387:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>This Examinate did goe with the said <hi>Iennet Bier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> her Grand-mother, and <hi>Ellen Bierley</hi> her Aunt, to the house of <hi>Walshman,</hi> in the night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, to murther a Child in a strange manner.</q>
                     <p>This of all the rest is impossible, to make her of their counsell, to doe murther, whome so cruelly and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously they pursue from day to day, and torment her. The Witches of the Forrest of Pendle were neuer so cruell nor barbarous.</p>
                     <q>And she also saith, the Child cried not when it was hurt.</q>
                     <p>All this time the Child was asleepe, or the Child was of an extraordinarie patience, <hi>ô inauditum facinus!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <q>After they had eaten, the said three women and this Examinate daunced euery one of them with one of the Blacke things: and after, the Blacke things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused the said women.</q>
                     <p>Here is good Euidence to take away their liues. This is more proper for the Legend of Lyes, then the Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a witnesse vpon Oath, before a reuerend and learned Iudge, able to conceiue this Villanie, and finde out the practise. Here is the Religious act of a Priest, but behold the euent of it.</p>
                     <q>Shee describes the foure Blacke things to goe vpright, but not like Men in the face.</q>
                     <p>The Seminarie mistakes the face for the feete. For <hi>Chattox</hi> and all her fellow Witches agree, the Deuill is clouen-footed: but <hi>Fancie</hi> had a very good face, and was a very proper Man.</p>
                     <q>
                        <pb facs="tcp:15387:53"/>About tenne dayes after her Examination taken at Black-borne, then she was tormented.</q>
                     <p>Still he pursues his Proiect: for hearing his Scholler had done well, he laboured she might doe more in this nature. But notwithstanding, many things are layd to be in the times when they were Papists: yet the Priest neuer tooke paines to discouer them, nor instruct his Scholler, vntill they came to Church. Then all this was the Act of GOD, to raise a child to open all things, and then to discouer his plotted Tragedie. Yet in this great discouerie, the Seminarie forgot to deuise a Spirit for them.</p>
                     <p>And for <hi>Thomas Walshman,</hi> vpon his Oath he sayth, That his Child had beene sicke by the space of a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, or three weekes, before it died. And <hi>Grace Sower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butts</hi> saith, they tooke it out of the bedde, strucke a nayle into the Nauell, sucked bloud, layd it downe againe; and after, tooke it out of the Graue, with all the rest, as you haue heard. How these two agree, you may, vpon view of their Euidence, the better conceiue, and be able to judge.</p>
                     <p>How well this proiect, to take away the liues of three innocent poore creatures by practise and villanie; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a young Scholler to commit periurie, to accuse her owne Grand-mother, Aunt, &amp;c agrees either with the Title of a Iesuite, or the dutie of a Religious Priest, who should rather professe Sinceritie and Innocencie, then practise Trecherie: But this was lawfull; for they are Heretikes accursed, to leaue the companie of Priests; to frequent Churches, heare the word of GOD preached, and professe Religion sincerely.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:15387:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>But by the course of Times and Accidents, wise men obserue, that very seldome hath any mischieuous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt beene vnder-taken without the direction or assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a Iesuit, or Seminarie Priest.</p>
                     <p>Who did not condemne these Women vpon this eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and hold them guiltie of this so foule and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble murder? But Almightie God, who in his prouidence had prouided meanes for their deliuerance, although the Priest by the helpe of the Deuill, had prouided false witnesses to accuse them; yet GOD had prepared and placed in the Seate of Iustice, an vpright Iudge to sit in Iudgement vpon their liues, who after he had heard all the euidence at large against the Prisoners for the Kings Majestie, demanded of them what answere they could make. They humbly vpon their knees with weeping teares, desired him for Gods cause to examine <hi>Grace Sowerbuts,</hi> who set her on, or by whose meanes this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation came against them.</p>
                     <p>Immediately the countenance of this <hi>Grace Sowerbuts</hi> changed: The witnesses being behinde, began to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell and accuse one an other. In the end his Lordship examined the Girle, who could not for her life make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny direct answere, but strangely amazed, told him, shee was put to a Master to learne, but he told her nothing of this.</p>
                     <p>But here as his Lordships care and paines was great to discouer the practises of these odious Witches of the Forrest of Pendle, and other places, now vpon their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all before him: So was he desirous to discouer this dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable practise, to accuse these poore Women, and bring their liues in danger, and thereby to deliuer the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:15387:54"/>And as he openly deliuered it vpon the Bench, in the hearing of this great Audience: That if a Priest or Iesuit had a hand in one end of it, there would appeare to bee knauerie, and practise in the other end of it. And that it might the better appeare to the whole World, exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Thomas Sowerbuts,</hi> what Master taught his daughter: in generall termes, he denyed all.</p>
                     <p>The Wench had nothing to say, but her Master told her nothing of this. In the end, some that were present told his Lordship the truth, and the Prisoners informed him how shee went to learne with one <hi>Thompson</hi> a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarie Priest, who had instructed and taught her this accusation against them, because they were once obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Papists, and now came to Church. Here is the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie of this Priest, and of his whole practise. Still this fire encreased more and more, and one witnesse accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing an other, all things were laid open at large.</p>
                     <p>In the end his Lordship tooke away the Girle from her Father, and committed her to M. <hi>Leigh,</hi> a very reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Preacher, and M. <hi>Chisnal,</hi> two Iustices of the Peace, to be carefully examined. Who tooke great paines to examine her of euery particular point: In the end they came into the Court, and there deliuered this Examination as followeth. ⸫</p>

And the said <hi>Anne Redferne,</hi> her said daughter, wrought her Clay or Marle to make the third picture withall. And this Examinate passing by them, a Spirit, called <hi>Tibbe,</hi> in the shape of a blacke Cat, appeared vnto her this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and said, Turne backe againe, and doe as they doe.

<pb facs="tcp:15387:59"/>
Whereunto the said Spirit said, They are making three pictures: whereupon shee asked, whose pictures they were? whereunto the said Spirit said, They are the pictures of <hi>Christopher Nutter, Robert Nutter,</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> wife of the said <hi>Robert Nutter.</hi> But this Examinate deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to goe backe to helpe them to make the pictures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid, the said Spirit seeming to be angrie therefore, shot or pushed this Examinate into the Ditch; and so shedde the milke which this Examinate had in a Kanne, or Kitt: and so thereupon the Spirit at that time vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed out of this Examinates sight. But presently after that, the said Spirit appeared vnto this Examinate again in the shape of a Hare, and so went with her about a quarter of a myle, but said nothing vnto her this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, nor shee to it.</p>

And so not long after these perswasions, this Examinate being walking towards the Rough-Lee, in a Close of one <hi>Iohn Robinsons,</hi> there appeared vnto her a thing like vnto a Blacke Dogge: speaking vnto her, this Examinate, and desiring her to giue him her Soule, and he would giue her power to doe any thing she would: whereupon this Examinate being therewithall inticed, and setting her downe; the said Blacke-Dogge did with his mouth (as this Examinate then thought) sucke at her breast, a little below her Paps, which place did remaine blew halfe a yeare next after: which said Blacke-Dogge did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to this Examinate, vntill the eighteenth day of March last: at which time this Examinate met with a Pedler on the high-way, called Colne-field, neere vnto Colne: and this Examinate demanded of the said Ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to buy some pinnes of him; but the said Pedler stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily answered this Examinate that he would not loose his Packe; and so this Examinate parting with him: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently there appeared to this Examinate the Blacke-Dogge, which appeared vnto her as before: which Black
<pb facs="tcp:15387:74"/>
Dogge spake vnto this Examinate in English, saying; What wouldst thou haue me to do vnto yonder man? to whom this Examinate said, What canst thou do at him? and the Dogge answered againe, I can lame him: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon this Examinat answered, and said to the said Black Dogge, Lame him: and before the Pedler was gone for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Roddes further, he fell downe Lame: and this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate then went after the said Pedler; and in a house about the distance aforesaid, he was lying Lame: and so this Examinate went begging in Trawden Forrest that day, and came home at night: and about fiue daies next after, the said Black-Dogge did appeare to this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, as she was going a begging, in a Cloase neere the New-Church in Pendle, and spake againe to her, saying; Stay and speake with me; but this Examinate would not: Sithence which time this Examinat neuer saw him.</p>

                     <hi>THE IVDGEMENT OF THE RIGHT HONORABLE Sir EDVVARD BROMLEY, Knight, one</hi> of his Maiesties Iustices of Assize at Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster vpon the Witches conuicted, <hi>as followeth.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is no man aliue more vnwilling to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce this wofull and heauy Iudgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you, then my selfe: and if it were possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I would to God this cup might passe from me. But since it is otherwise prouided, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all proceedings of the Law, there must be a Iudgement; and the Execution of that Iudgement must succeed and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in due time: I pray you haue patience to receiue that which the Law doth lay vpon you. You of all people haue the least cause to complaine: since in the Triall of your liues there hath beene great care and paines taken, and much time spent: and very few or none of you, but stand conuicted vpon your owne voluntarie confessions and Examinations, <hi>Ex ore proprio:</hi> Few Witnesses examined against you, but such as were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and parties in your Assemblies. Nay I may further affirme, What persons of your nature and condition, euer were Arraigned and Tried with more solemnitie, had more libertie giuen to pleade or answere to euerie particular point of Euidence against you? In conclusion such hath beene the
<pb facs="tcp:15387:86"/>
generall care of all, that had to deale with you, that you haue neither cause to be offended in the proceedings of the Iustices, that first tooke paines in these businesses, nor with the Court that hath had great care to giue nothing in euidence against you, but matter of fact; Sufficient matter vpon Record, and not to induce, or leade the Iurie to finde any one of you guiltie vpon mâtter of suspition or presumption, nor with the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses who haue beene tried, as it were in the fire: Nay, you cannot denie but must confesse what extraordinarie meanes hath beene vsed to make triall of their euidence, and to discouer the least intended practice in any one of them, to touch your liues vniustly.</p>
                  <p>As you stand simply (your offences and bloudie practises not considered) your fall would rather moue compassion, then exasperate any man. For whom would not the ruine of so many poore creatures at one time, touch, as in apparance simple, and of little vnderstanding?</p>
                  <p>But the bloud of those innocent children, and others his Maiesties Subiects, whom cruelly and barbarously you haue murdered, and cut off, with all the rest of your offences, hath cryed out vnto the Lord against you, and sollicited for satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and reuenge, and that hath brought this heauie iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon you at this time.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore now time no longer wilfully to striue, both against the prouidence of God, and the Iustice of the Land: the more you labour to acquit your selues, the more euident and apparant you make your offences to the World. And vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible it is that they shall either prosper or continue in this World, or receiue reward in the next, that are stained with so much innocent bloud.</p>
                  <p>The worst then I wish to you, standing at the Barre con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted, to receiue your Iudgement, is, Remorse, and true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb facs="tcp:15387:86"/>
for the safegard of your Soules, and after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, penitent, and heartie acknowledgement of your grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous sinnes and offences committed both against <hi>GOD</hi> and Man.</p>
                  <p>First, yeeld humble and heartie thankes to Almightie <hi>GOD</hi> for taking hold of you in your beginning, and making stay of your intended bloudie practises (although <hi>GOD</hi> knowes there is too much done alreadie) which would in time haue cast so great a weight of Iudgement vpon your Soules.</p>
                  <p>Then praise <hi>GOD</hi> that it pleased him not to surprize or strike you suddenly, euen in the execution of your bloudie Murthers, and in the middest of your wicked practises, but hath giuen you time, and takes you away by a iudiciall course and triall of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Last of all, craue pardon of the World, and especially of all such as you haue iustly offended, either by tormenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, children, or friends, murder of their kinsfolks, or losse of any their goods.</p>
                  <p>And for leauing to future times the president of so many barbarous and bloudie murders, with such meetings, practises, consultations, and meanes to execute reuenge, being the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of your comfort in all your actions, which may instruct others to hold the like course, or fall in the like sort:</p>
                  <p>It only remaines I pronounce the Iudgement of the Court against you by the Kings authoritie, which is; <hi>You shall all goe from hence to the Castle, from whence you came; from thence you shall bee carried to the place of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for this Countie: where your bodies shall bee han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vntill you be dead; And GOD HAVE MERCIE VPON YOVR SOVLES: For your comfort in this world I shall commend a learned and worthie Preacher
<pb facs="tcp:15387:87"/>
to instruct you, and prepare you for an other World: All I can doe for you is to pray for your Repentance in this World, for the satisfaction of many; And forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the next world, for sauing of your Soules. And God graunt you may make good vse of the time you haue in this World, to his glorie and your owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi>

And it were not much if as many wrote of them as could write at al, to set forth to the world the particular Rites and Secrets of their vnlawfull Artes, with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and wonderfull practises which many men little feare till they seaze vpon them. As by this late won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull discouerie of Witches in the Countie of Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster may appeare, wherein I find such apparant matter to satisfie the World, how dangerous and malitious a
<pb facs="tcp:15387:91"/>
Witch this <hi>Iennet Preston</hi> was, How vnfit to liue, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing once so great mercie extended to her: And againe to reuiue her practises, and returne to her former course of life, that I thinke it necessarie not to let the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of her life and death die with her; But to place her next to her fellowes and to set forth the Arraignement Triall and Conuiction of her, with her offences for which she was condemned and executed.</p>
                  <p>And a though shee died for her offence before the rest, I yet can afford her no better place then in the end of this Booke in respect the proceedings was in an other Countie;</p>
                  <p>You that were husband to this <hi>Iennet Preston</hi>; her friends and kinsfolkes, who haue not beene sparing to deuise so scandalous a slander out of the malice of your hearts, as that shee was maliciously prosecuted by Master <hi>Lister</hi> and others; Her life vniustly taken away by practise; and that (euen at the Gallowes where shee died impenitent and void of all feare or grace) she died an Innocent woman, because she would confesse no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: You I say may not hold it strange, though at this time, being not only moued in conscience, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, for example sake, with that which I haue to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of her, I suffer you not to wander any further; but with this short discourse oppose your idle conceipts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to seduce others: And by Charmes of Imputations and slander, laid vpon the Iustice of the Land, to cleare her that was iustly condemned and executed for her of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; That this <hi>Iennet Preston</hi> was for many yeares well thought of and esteemed by Master <hi>Lister</hi> who afterwardes died for it Had free accesse to his house, kind respect and entertainment; nothing denied her she

stood in need of. Which of you that dwelleth neare them in Crauen but can and will witnesse it? which might haue incouraged a Woman of any good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to haue runne a better course.</p>
                  <p>The fauour and goodnesse of this Gentleman Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Lister</hi> now liuing, at his first entrance after the death of his Father extended towards her, and the reliefe she had at all times, with many other fauours that succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from time to time, are so palpable and euident to all men as no man can denie them. These were suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent motiues to haue perswaded her from the murder of so good a friend.</p>
                  <p>But such was her execrable Ingratitude, as euen this grace and goodnesse was the cause of his miserable and vntimely death. And euen in the beginning of his greatest fauours extended to her, began shee to worke this mischiefe, according to the course of all Witches.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Iennet Preston,</hi> whose Arraignment and Triall, with the particular Euidence against her I am now to set forth vnto you, one that liued at Gisborne in Crauen, in the Countie of Yorke, neare Master <hi>Lister</hi> of West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie, against whom she practised much mischiefe; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing cut off <hi>Thomas Lister</hi> Esquire, father to this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man now liuing, shee reuenged her selfe vpon his sonne: who in short time receiued great losse in his goods and cattell by her meanes.</p>
                  <p>These things in time did beget suspition, and at the Assizes and Generall Gaole deliuerie holden at the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of Yorke in Lent last past, before my Lord <hi>Bromley,</hi> shee was Indicted and Arraigned for the murder of a Child of one <hi>Dodg-sonnes,</hi> but by the fauour and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full consideration of the Iurie thereof acquited.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:15387:92"/>But this fauour and mercie was no sooner extended towardes her, and shee set at libertie, But shee began to practise the vtter ruine and ouerthrow of the name and bloud of this Gentleman.</p>
                  <p>And the better to execute her mischiefe and wicked intent, within foure dayes after her deliuerance out of the Castle at Yorke, went to the great Assembly of Witches at <hi>Malking-Tower</hi> vpon Good-friday last: to pray aide and helpe, for the murder of Master <hi>Lister,</hi> in respect he had prosecuted against her at the same Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes.</p>
                  <p>Which it pleased God in his mercie to discouer, and in the end, howsoeuer he had blinded her, as he did the King of Aegypt and his Instruments, for the brighter euidence of his own powerfull glory; Yet by a Iudiciall course and triall of the Law, cut her off, and so deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his people from the danger of her Deuilish and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked practises: which you shall heare against her, at her Arraignement and Triall, which I shall now set forth to you in order as it was performed, with the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full signes and tokens of GOD, to satisfie the Iurie to finde her guiltie of this bloudie murther, committed foure yeares since.</p>

                     <p>THis Examinate saith, That vpon Good-Friday last about twelue of the clocke in the day-time, there dined in this Examinates said mothers house a number of persons, whereof three were men, with this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and the rest women: and that they met there for these three causes following (as this Examinates said mother told this Examinate): First was for the naming of the Spirit, which <hi>Alizon Deuice,</hi> now Prisoner at Lancaster, had, but did not name him, because shee was not there. The second cause was for the deliuery of his said Grand-mother, this Examinates said sister <hi>Alizon,</hi> the said <hi>Anne Chattox,</hi> and her daughter <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferne</hi>: Killing the Gaoler at Lancaster; and before the next Assizes to blow vp the Castle there; to that end the aforesaid Prisoners might by that meanes make an escape and get away. All which this Examinate then heard them conferre of. And the third cause was, for that there was a woman dwelling in Gisburne Parish, who came into this Examinates said Grand-mothers
<pb facs="tcp:15387:94"/>
house, who there came, and craued assistance of the rest of them that were then there, for the killing of Master <hi>Lister</hi> of Westby: because, as she then said, he had borne malice vnto her, and had thought to haue put her away at the last Assizes at Yorke; but could not. And then this Examinat heard the said woman say, that her power was not strong enough to doe it her selfe, being now lesse then before-time it had beene.</p>
                     <p>And he also further saith, That the said <hi>Prestons</hi> wife had a Spirit with her like vnto a white Foale, with a blacke-spot in the forehead. And further, this Examinat saith, That since the said meeting, as aforesaid, this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate hath beene brought to the wife of one <hi>Preston</hi> in Gisburne Parish aforesaid, by <hi>Henry Hargreiues</hi> of Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shey to see whether shee was the woman that came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the said Witches, on the said last Good-Friday, to craue their aide and assistance for the killing of the said Master <hi>Lister</hi>: and hauing had full view of her; hee this Examinate confesseth, That she was the selfe-same woman which came amongst the said Witches on the said last Good-Friday, for their aide for the killing of the said Master <hi>Lister</hi>; and that brought the Spirit with her, in the shape of a White Foale, as aforesaid.</p>
                     <p>And this Examinate further saith, That all the said Witches went out of the said house in their owne shapes and likenesses, and they all, by that they were forth of the doores, were gotten on horse-backe like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Foales, some of one colour, some of another, and <hi>Prestons</hi> wife was the last; and when she got on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, they all presently vanished out of this Examinats sight: and before their said parting away, they all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to meete at the said <hi>Prestons</hi> wifes house that

day twelue-month; at which time the said <hi>Prestons</hi> wife promised to make them a great feast; and if they had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to meet in the meane time, then should warning bee giuen that they all should meete vpon Romles-Moore. And this Examinate further saith, That at the said feast at Malking-Tower, this Examinat heard them all giue their consents to put the said Master <hi>Thomas Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> of Westby to death: and after Master <hi>Lister</hi> should be made away by Witchcraft, then al the said Witches gaue their consents to ioyne altogether to hancke Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Leonard Lister,</hi> when he should come to dwell at the Sowgill, and so put him to death.</p>

                     <p>THe said Examinate vpon her Examination saith, that vpon Good-friday last there was about twenty persons, whereof only two were men, to this Examinats remembrance, at her said Grand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>mothers house, called Malking-Tower aforesaid, about twelue of the clocke: all which persons, this Examinates said mother told her were Witches, and that she know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the names of diuers of the said Witches.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:15387:96"/>AFter all these Examinations, Confessions, and Euidence, deliuered in open Court against her, His Lordship commanded the Iurie to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the particular circumstances; first, Master <hi>Lister</hi> in his great extremitie, to complaine hee saw her, and requested them that were by him to lay hold on her.</p>
                     <p>After he cried out shee lay heauie vpon him, euen at the time of his death.</p>
                     <p>But the Conclusion is of more consequence then all the rest, that <hi>Iennet Preston</hi> being brought to the dead corps, they bled freshly, And after her deliuerance in Lent, it is proued shee rode vpon a white Foale, and was present in the great assembly at <hi>Malkin Tower</hi> with the Witches, to intreat and pray for aide of them, to kill Master <hi>Lister,</hi> now liuing, for that he had prosequuted against her.</p>

                     <p>After the Gentlemen of the Iurie of Life and Death had spent the most part of the day, in consideration of the euidence against her, they returned into the Court and deliuered vp their Verdict of Life and Death. ⸫</p>

                  <p>My Lord <hi>Bromley</hi> being very suspicious of the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of <hi>Iennet Deuice,</hi> the little Wench, commanded her to looke vpon the Prisoners that were present, and declare which of them were present at <hi>Malkin Tower,</hi> at the great assembly of Witches vpon Good-Friday last: shee looked vpon and tooke many by the handes, and accused them to be there, and when shee had accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed all that were there present, shee told his Lordship there was a Woman that came out of Crauen that was
<pb facs="tcp:15387:97"/>
amongst the Witches at that Feast, but shee saw her not amongst the Prisoners at the Barre.</p>
                  <p>What a singular note was this of a Child, amongst many to misse her, that before that time was hanged for her offence, which shee would neuer confesse or declare at her death? here was present old <hi>Preston</hi> her husband, who then cried out and went away: being fully satisfied his wife had Iustice, and was worthie of death.</p>
                  <p>To conclude then this present discourse, I heartilie desire you, my louing Friends and Countrie-men, for whose particular instructions this is added to the former of the wonderfull discouerie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster: And for whose particular satisfaction this is published; Awake in time, and suffer not your selues to be thus assaulted.</p>
                  <p>Consider how barbarously this Gentleman hath been dealt withall; and especially you that hereafter shall passe vpon any Iuries of Life and Death, let not your conniuence, or rather foolish pittie, spare such as these, to exequute farther mischiefe.</p>
                  <p>Remember that shee was no sooner set at libertie, but shee plotted the ruine and ouerthrow of this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and his whole Familie.</p>
                  <p>Expect not, as this reuerend and learned Iudge saith, such apparent proofe against them, as against others, since all their workes, are the workes of darkenesse: and vnlesse it please Almightie God to raise witnesses to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse them, who is able to condemne them?</p>
                  <p>Forget not the bloud that cries out vnto God for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, bring it not vpon your owne heads.</p>
                  <p>Neither doe I vrge this any farther, then with this, that I would alwaies intreat you to remember, that it is
<pb facs="tcp:15387:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as great a crime (as <hi>Salomon</hi> sayth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the innocent, as to let the guiltie escape free.</p>
                  <p>Looke not vpon things strangely alledged, but iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously consider what is justly proued against them.</p>
                  <p>And that as well all you that were witnesses, present at the Arraignement and Triall of her, as all other stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, to whome this Discourse shall come, may take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample by this Gentleman to prosecute these hellish Furies to their end: labor to root them out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, for the common good of your Countrey. The greatest mercie extended to them, is soone for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
                  <p>GOD graunt vs the long and prosperous continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of these Honorable and Reuerend Iudges, vnder whose Gouernment we liue in these North parts: for we may say, that GOD Almightie hath singled them out, and set them on his Seat, for the defence of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</p>
                  <p>And for this great deliuerance, let vs all pray to GOD Almightie, that the memorie of these worthie Iudges may bee blessed to all Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities.</p>
