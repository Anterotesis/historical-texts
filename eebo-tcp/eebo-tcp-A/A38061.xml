         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THO Cuſtome hath in ſome ſort made it neceſſary to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Reader with a <hi>Preface,</hi> before he enters upon the
peruſal of a Book, ſhewing the deſign, and the occaſion of
Writing of it; yet in this caſe I hope there will be no need, either
to <hi>Court his Favour,</hi> or <hi>Mollifie his Diſpleaſure,</hi> for undertaking
the Defence of Chriſtianity againſt the great and dangerous oppoſers
of it. For this being the common cauſe in which every man who is
called by the name of Chriſt, hath an Intereſt, he may I hope with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>begging pardon,</hi> or if he pleaſe without <hi>ſhewing any Reaſon,</hi>
engage in maintenance of our holy Religion, embraced by the whole
Church of God, as well as by that of which he is a Member; againſt
all ſuch, who ſhall either openly oppoſe, or ſecretly endeavour to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine
it.</p>
            <p>Here every man is a <hi>Souldier,</hi> and by his <hi>Baptiſmal</hi> Vow, having
bin liſted under Chriſts Banner, is obliged to fight under it, againſt
all the Enemies of his Savior; and ſuch are the <hi>pernicious Opinions</hi>
here repreſented, which carry in their forehead an open, and declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Hoſtility, and direct oppoſition to the Divinity, and the Croſs of
Chriſt. The adverſaries of our Holy Religion have taken the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
to publiſh their Impious Opinions, not only <hi>without Leave,</hi>
but <hi>in Oppoſition</hi> to the juſt Authority, and the known and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Laws of this Nation: they have revived the Opinions, reprinted
the Books of ſome former Socinian Writers, which had almoſt bin
<pb facs="tcp:40896:5"/>
forgotten, but they have taken care to refreſh our memories; and all
this hath bin done in defyance to the Government, as well as in the
Face of it.</p>
            <p>It hath bin as the occaſion of trouble to all <hi>Good men,</hi> ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
matter of Wonder and Enquiry to all <hi>Conſidering men,</hi>
to find the Nation peſter'd with ſuch numbers of Socinian Books,
which have ſwarm'd all upon a ſuddain, and have bin induſtriouſly
diſperſed thro' all parts of the Kingdom, whereby many weak and
unſtable Souls have bin beguiled, <hi>and their minds corrupted from
the ſimplicity which is in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who they are, who have bin the ſecret abettors and promoters of
theſe Antichriſtian Doctrines as it is variouſly diſcourſed, ſo I ſhall
not Curiouſly Enquire; leaſt by Roaving and uncertain Conjectures,
the Innocent may be miſtaken for the Criminals. Only this I think
is ſo evident, that it may be taken for granted; That ſince there
have bin no conſiderable numbers of men formerly, that we know of,
who have <hi>openly and avowedly</hi> profeſſed the Impious tenents of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus;</hi>
They muſt have <hi>lain lurking</hi> under ſome other <hi>outward name
and profeſſion,</hi> watching the firſt and moſt convenient opportunity
to divulge their Opinions, which for ſome juſt and weighty reaſons
no doubt, they thought fit for ſome time to ſtifle and conceal. I
think there are ſcarce any among us ſo fooliſh as to imagine, that
like <hi>Cadmus</hi> his Off-Spring (tho' without doubt the Old Serpent hath
had no ſmall hand in this Affair) theſe men ſhould ſpring out of the
Ground; or as ſome have fancyed of Woodcocks, that they have dropped
out of the <hi>Clouds among us:</hi> it is therefore beyond all doubt, that
they have lain hid and diſguiſed under the denomination of ſome other
Sect or Party, and Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>But among other perſons or parties concerned in this Affair, it
would be a <hi>Miracle,</hi> greater than any of late years pretended to be
wrought in France for the Converſion of the poor <hi>Hugonots</hi> there,
if the Papiſts ſhould not be engaged in it: who never as yet have
ſtood by as <hi>unconcerned Spectators,</hi> when any miſchief was in
contrivance againſt our Church: But have always watched, and laid
hold on the fitteſt Opportunity, of Sowing and Increaſing <hi>Diviſions</hi>
among us; and who have by a late Experiment ſufficiently convinced
the World, that they have a much better Knack, at <hi>Unſetling and
<pb facs="tcp:40896:5"/>
Diſturbing our Religion,</hi> than in <hi>Eſtabliſhing and Defending
their own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No queſtion it muſt afford matter of no ſmall Sport and Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to them, to find a <hi>Generation of Men,</hi> or <hi>Vipers</hi> rather ſhall
I call them? riſen up in their ſtead, who may tho' by different methods,
at length perfect that deſign which they have bin long ſince projecting;
<hi>viz.</hi> the Ruine of this poor Church, and the deſtruction of that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and Excellent Religion, which by Gods Right Hand hath bin Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
and hitherto wonderfully preſerved among us.</p>
            <p>But whatever <hi>the Cauſes</hi> have bin of this ſuddain Appearance
of <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> or whoever were <hi>the Authors</hi> that have ſecretly
and in maſquerade, abetted and encouraged it; much of which lies
as yet in the <hi>dark;</hi> the <hi>pernicious effects</hi> of it have bin, and are,
at this day too <hi>Viſible.</hi> The minds of men, as we ſaid before,
throughout the Nation being ſtrangely corrupted; <hi>Infidelity and
Scepticiſm</hi> univerſally prevailing. Some deriding all Religion, which
they either laugh at as the effect of <hi>Folly and Superſtition,</hi> or
deteſt as a meer <hi>Cheat and Contrivance</hi> of ſome Cunning and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
men.</p>
            <p>Others profeſs themſelves Enemies to Revealed Religion, ſpeak
opprobriouſly of the Holy Scriptures, deride the Sacred Pen-men of
them, and make but a jeſt of any thing that is ſaid in vindication
of their Authority and Inſpiration.</p>
            <p>A Third ſort ſeem to own, and profeſs to believe the Bible, yet
oppoſe, nay not only ſo but <hi>Ridicule</hi> all the Great <hi>Myſteries</hi> of our
Religion; ſuch as are the Doctrines concerning the Bleſſed Trinity,
the Incarnation of the Son of God, the Redemtion of the World by
the Merit of his Death and Sufferings; the belief of which have bin
hitherto looked upon to be the Badge and Mark whereby Chriſtians
have bin diſtinguiſhed from Jews and Mahometans.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, a Fourth ſort there are (for you muſt know there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Ranks and Orders of theſe Enemies of our Religion) who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Holy Scriptures as we do, and Believe, at leaſt they tell
us they do ſo, all the Great Myſteries of our Faith contained there;
but yet at the ſame time they take care to let us know, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of theſe <hi>is not neceſſary.</hi> So that whether you are a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
or an Infidel</hi> in theſe matters, it makes no great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
<pb facs="tcp:40896:6"/>
foraſmuch as the Honour of God, the Welfare of Religion,
and the Salvation of your own Soul, is not concerned either one way
or other. And if ſo I am ſure no wiſe man ought to <hi>trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi>
much leſs to give others any Trouble about ſuch <hi>Trifling and
Inconſiderable Opinions.</hi> And theſe I look upon to be the greateſt
and moſt dangerous of all the forementioned Enemies, foraſmuch as
by the Obſervation of all Ages, it hath bin found a much ſurer and
ſpeedier way, to ruin any cauſe by <hi>betraying</hi> than <hi>oppoſing</hi> it;
and that you may much eaſier guard your ſelf from the <hi>Open Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility</hi>
of a profeſſed Enemy, than from the <hi>Treachery and falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi>
of a pretended Friend.</p>
            <p>To prevent therefore if it be poſſible (and I hope it is not too
late to Attempt it) the Growth and Progreſs <hi>of that Infidelity</hi>
which is to be found in many; That <hi>Coldneſs and Indifference</hi> about
the Great and Sacred Myſteries of our Religion, which is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in others; All which are the bleſſed effects of Socinianiſm;
and which ſeem to have diffuſed themſelves among all <hi>Orders and
Ranks</hi> of men among us, beyond the <hi>Example of former times;</hi>
It hath bin Judged an adviſable courſe, to ſhew the plain and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
oppoſition, that is between the <hi>Doctrines of Socinus</hi> and thoſe
which are revealed by the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> in the Holy Scriptures,
and eſpecially in the Writings of the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> And this,
among ſuch eſpecially who have not extinguiſhed all Regard for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
may, as it is hoped, be of ſome good uſe, to fortify them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginſt
the <hi>Infection</hi> of theſe pernicious Errors, which have already
ſpread <hi>like a Gangrene.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Writers generally have bin Employed, and that very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendably,
and for the moſt part with great ſucceſs, in vindicating
our Holy Religion, from the Bold and Impudent Cavils of theſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks;
and ſo have ſtood upon the <hi>Defenſive part.</hi> Now it may
be thought, for many good Reaſons, adviſable, to make an <hi>Offenſive
War</hi> upon theſe <hi>Infidels;</hi> and to bring it into their own Territories.
That is, that the charge of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſonableneſs and Impiety, which
they with <hi>Equal Falſhood and Impudence,</hi> have laid at the door
of the Chriſtian Religion; ſhould be retorted upon their New, and
dangerous Opinions; which upon Examination will be found to be
<hi>Oppoſite to Piety, Repugnant to plain Reaſon,</hi> and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
<pb facs="tcp:40896:6"/>
ſuch as will conduce to the <hi>Overthrow of all true Religion.</hi>
And to diſcover this, (which I hope in ſome meaſure is done in them)
is the deſign of theſe following Papers; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Religion of
<hi>Socinus</hi> as oppoſed to Chriſtianity is both <hi>Impious and Abſurd.</hi>
So that fairly to <hi>repreſent</hi> Socinianiſm will be the beſt method that
we can take to <hi>Conſute it;</hi> and rightly to ſtate the Controverſy,
will be the ſpeedieſt way to put an end to it.</p>
            <p>I confeſs as to the point of Reaſon, the <hi>Socinians</hi> have laid
ſuch a claim to it, as if they did intend to <hi>Engroſs and Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polize</hi>
that to themſelves, which yet, tho' in ſeveral degrees, is the
<hi>Right and Inheritance</hi> of all mankind. And for their attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in this, they have ſo magnified themſelves, and have bin ſo
undecently as well as unjuſtly magnified by others; that many inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and well meaning men have bin afraid to enter the Liſts with
theſe <hi>Sons of Anak,</hi> theſe <hi>Champions of Infidelity.</hi> But I dare
venture to aſſure the Reader, he needs not fear to encounter theſe
Gyants upon the <hi>plain ſquare of Reaſon,</hi> notwithſtanding all their
Boaſts and Brags of it. And I think it may be eaſily made out,
that in Oppoſition to ſome Important Articles of our Faith, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of their Repugnance to Reaſon, they have advanced ſome other
poſitions, ſo contrary to Reaſon; that when they come to be compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I believe it will be found, that there is ſcarce any thing in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
not excepting that <hi>Groſs Fulſome Doctrine of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation;</hi>
which contains <hi>greater Abſurdities,</hi> more oppoſite to, and
incomprehenſible by natural Reaſon. Particularly what they ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Factitious Divinity of Chriſt,</hi> is by far more uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
then what the Papiſts aver of the change of the Elements in
the Euchariſt. And any man that hath abilities to judge of theſe
matters, will upon enquiry find; that it is leſs Abſurd and Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
if there are Degrees of Abſurdity in Contradictions, and of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
in things that are Impoſſible; that a piece of Bread ſhould
be <hi>Tranſubſtantiated into Fleſh,</hi> than that a man ſhould be <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
into a God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort tho Reaſon be the Idol of theſe men, yet I muſt deſire
to be excuſed if I do not ſtand in any great awe and admiration
of it: and truly for my own part, I ſhould much rather fear the
<hi>Malice</hi> then the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of a Socinian, at any time. And I am
<pb facs="tcp:40896:7"/>
afraid, that if ever theſe men (<hi>Quod avertat Deus</hi>) ſhould gain
<hi>ſtrength and numbers</hi> among us; they would prove one of the moſt
<hi>Cruel and Sanguinary</hi> Sects, that ever yet diſturbed the peace of
the Church. It is not to be denied, but that they have in their Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
advanced ſome parts of Chriſtian Morality to a great height, and
have ſpoke many and deſervedly great things, concerning forgiveneſs
of injuries and patience under them, in complyance with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and in Imitation of the Example of our Bleſſed Saviour:
But I ſhould be loath to truſt a <hi>Socinian</hi> for all that; and if
we were forced to make the Tryal (tho I hope we are in no danger
of the experiment) I doubt not but we ſhould find, <hi>the forgiveneſs</hi> of
theſe Men more Implacable than the <hi>Revenge of others:</hi> and that
their <hi>meekneſs and moderation</hi> would have more terrible effects,
than the <hi>rage and fury</hi> of the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> in ancient
times. And that the Reader may not think I utter this without ground,
tho I have a <hi>great many,</hi> I will at preſent offer but <hi>one reaſon</hi>
for my conjecture, and that is taken from their <hi>Boyſterous, Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
Scurrilous</hi> way of treating the great and adorable myſteries
of our Religion; which ſhews what uſage the <hi>profeſſors of them</hi>
would in all likelyhood meet, if they ever had them in their power.</p>
            <p>The Bleſſed Trinity is by ſome of them ſtyled <hi>Triceps Cerberus,</hi>
and the doctrine concerning it they have aſcribed to the <hi>Invention
of the Devil,</hi> and tell us that it was fetched from <hi>Hell.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they will ſpeak very honourably of our Saviour, but at other
times, and upon other occaſions ſo reproachfully of his divine nature,
that they treat him worſe then either the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Romans</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
and Crucified him. And tho they pay <hi>Divine Honour and
Adoration</hi> to him, yet that doth not take off the guilt and impiety
of their <hi>Sacrilegious denyal,</hi> and as far as in them lies <hi>Deſpoiling
him of his Divinity;</hi> but herein they tranſcribe the Copy which the
<hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers before mentioned ſet them after his Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
by <hi>Pilate,</hi> who put a Crown upon his head, and a Scepter into
his hand; and yet at the ſame time they Spit in his Face and Buffeted
him.</p>
            <p>One would think that the <hi>great and venerable myſteries</hi> of our
Religion, entertained by all the Wiſeſt, and Learnedſt, and beſt Men
and Churches, in all ages ever ſince Chriſtianity was firſt planted in
<pb facs="tcp:40896:7"/>
the World; tho they had bin Errors, yet had deſerved to be treated
with a little more <hi>Civility and Reſpect,</hi> than theſe men have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their Writings: who have wanted ſomething elſe beſides a good
Cauſe to defend: for they have wanted Modeſty and Civility in the
Defence of a very bad one; have wanted the Candor and Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
of a fair adverſary; and have treated the myſteries of our Faith
with ſuch a <hi>Proſtitute,</hi> and <hi>Impudent Scurrility;</hi> that we cannot
well tell what reply to make to them; except in Imitation of the
bleſſed and meek Arch-Angel <hi>Michael,</hi> we ſhould deſire God to Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
in his own quarrel, and to rebuke the <hi>Blaſphemies of theſe
men,</hi> but to have mercy upon the <hi>Blaſphemers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To Conclude all, as there is no danger at preſent, God be thanked,
that we ſhould be <hi>frighted</hi> out of our Religion, ſo I hope we ſhall
not be <hi>wheedled</hi> out of it, by <hi>any of the Artifices</hi> of theſe ſeducers
who lye in wait to deceive; nor by any other <hi>ſpecious pretences</hi>
that they may make; no not by the <hi>pretence of Peace,</hi> which I know
hath ſometimes bin offered in their behalf. I confeſs peace is a moſt
deſireable thing, the bleſſings that attend it are <hi>ſo great</hi> that we
cannot tell how ſufficiently <hi>to value,</hi> and <hi>ſo many,</hi> that we can
ſcarce <hi>number them.</hi> So that all <hi>humble and truly pious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
ſhould be content to part with any thing to obtain it.</p>
            <p>But I muſt recal that laſt word, for upon <hi>ſecond thoughts</hi> I
find it may be too <hi>dearly purchaſed;</hi> as it certainly will be, when
bought at the expence either of <hi>Truth or Juſtice;</hi> without which,
<hi>Peace</hi> tho otherwiſe the moſt uſeful and excellent, would prove one
of the moſt pernicious and miſchievous things in the World. And
when I ſpeak of Truth I chiefly and principally mean thoſe fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Truths which are treated of in theſe following Papers, the
Belief of which have hitherto bin looked upon by moſt Chriſtians, to be
<hi>neceſſary to our Salvation:</hi> and if there be any Truths of that
Importance I hope every man will conſider, that tho Peace be much to
be deſired, yet that it is not adviſable for him to hazard his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to ſecure it.</p>
            <p>When all is done the reputation of being eſteemed a <hi>Peaceable and
moderate man</hi> will ſtand a man but in little ſtead when he comes
to appear before the Tribunal of Chriſt, and there to be charged with
the guilt of betraying his Religion, and at the ſame time, the Souls
<pb facs="tcp:40896:8"/>
of them committed to his charge, to endleſs perdition and ruin. In
one word, tho Peace be ſo great a bleſſing that a man might be content
to lay down his Life, yet no man ſhould lay down his Soul for the ſake
of it. And tho a <hi>Pious man</hi> might in ſome caſes commendably ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<hi>to Death,</hi> yet no <hi>wiſe man,</hi> nay indeed no man not out of his
wits, would <hi>venture upon damnation to Obtain it.</hi>

PRESERVATIVE
AGAINST
Socinianiſm.</head>
            <p>IN all ages ever ſince the firſt planting of a Chriſtian Church
in the world, God for many wiſe reaſons hath thought fit
to exerciſe it with various and different ſorts of tryals. The
Apoſtles who were immediately commiſſioned by Chriſt,
and ſent to teach all Nations, and thereby to bring them over
to the belief and obedience of the Goſpel, (according to the
prediction of their bleſſed Maſter in the 10<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Matth.</hi> who
had forewarned them of it,) met with great and violent oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that both from <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> who with an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
zeal or rather fury, ſet themſelves to oppreſs and ſtifle this
new doctrine, if it were poſſible, at its firſt appearance, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it had gained much ground and footing in the world.</p>
            <p>But beſides the open force with which the enemies of it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to deſtroy the Chriſtian doctrine, the Apoſtles and
other Miniſters of it, met with another and more dangerous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
from ſome falſe brethren, who did not aime ſo much
at the deſtruction of the Chriſtian faith, as by ſome undue
mixtures to corrupt the purity of it. Such were the Judaizing
Chriſtians, who tho they embraced the doctrine of the Goſpel,
yet ſtill they retain'd a weighty affection for their old Religion
and the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to the obſervance of which they thought
themſelves under an indiſpenſable obligation, and not only ſo,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40896:9"/>
but would oblige all other Converts to the like obſervance; and
their zeal in this matter occaſioned no ſmall trouble to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
and diſturbance to the Churches, where they firſt planted
the Chriſtian faith. See <hi>Acts</hi> 15. and 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> And tho this was a
matter of no ſmall concern, and might in the concluſion have
proved of dangerous conſequence, yet it was not conſiderable
in a manner, if compared with many other execrable opinions
and practices, which began very early to be introduced into
the Church, by <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus, Menander, Saturninus, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilides,</hi>
and <hi>Carpocrates.</hi> Succeeded afterwards by <hi>Valentinus</hi> and
<hi>Marcus, Marcion,</hi> and <hi>Hermogenes,</hi> and a long train of <hi>Hereticks</hi>
ſhall I call them? or <hi>Hogoblins;</hi> for ſo I think they might well
be ſtyled, if we conſider either the darkneſs and ignorance of
all religious matters with which they were encompaſſed, or the
wild pranks which they played, to the great diſturbance of all
good men; who were all deſcended from that ſon of perdition
<hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who was their Patriarch and Ring-leader. It were
a difficult task to muſter up the names, but almoſt an endleſs
attempt to reckon the ſenſeleſs and extravagant opinions of
theſe <hi>Hereticks;</hi> by reaſon of whoſe pernicious ways, the way
of truth was evil ſpoken of. For many of the objections of
the Heathens againſt Chriſtianity, tho all of them were falſe,
yet were taken from the execrable opinions and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of theſe lewd miſcreants, who thereby brought no ſmall
diſgrace upon the Chriſtian Religion, and put no ſmall ſtop to
the growth and propagation of it. But not to proſecute this
matter any farther, if we deſcend a little lower, we ſhall find
that God had no ſooner diſſipated the ſtorm that hung over
the Chriſtian Church for ſome Centuries; and put a ſtop to the
effuſion of any more of that blood, (which without any diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Age or Sex, was ſpilt like water under the ten famous
perſecutions) by the advancement of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to the Empire;
but the devil betakes himſelf to new ſhifts: who finding his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
methods of cruelty ſo ſignally baffled by the patience and
conſtancy of the Martyrs, he begins to play a new, or rather to
revive his old game, and ſince he cannot deſtroy the profeſſors
of Chriſtianity, he will endeavour to undermine their Religion.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40896:9"/>
He had indeed made a vigorous effort, to extinguiſh both the
name and memory of the Chriſtian Religion, and to have tore
up both the faith and the believers quite by the very roots;
but herein he was diſappointed, and therefore he endeavours to
compaſs that by ſtratagem, which he cannot effect by ſtorm;
and in this method he finds greater ſucceſs than in the former.
For being baffled as we ſaid before, in his attempts upon the
diſciples of Chriſt, he attacks the doctrine which they embraced:
and here <hi>Inimicus homo,</hi> the enemy came and ſowed tares among
the Wheat; hoping thereby to choke the word, which now he
deſpair'd to extirpate. And herein he found fit inſtruments for
the execution of his deſign; for taking advantage of the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and curioſity, the diſcontent and revenge, and other diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
paſſions of <hi>Arius, Photinus, Neſtorius, Eutyches</hi> and others,
he ſoon prevail'd with them to aſſiſt him in the project which he
had laid, for corrupting the doctrine and thereby diſturbing the
peace of the Church. For they preſently broached many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
opinions, whereby they did either plainly deny, or ſome
other way pervert the doctrines then generally entertained by
the whole Church, concerning the natures and the perſon of the
Son of God.</p>
            <p>But theſe errors having long ſince bin buried in the Weſtern
Church, and lay forgotten in a manner with their Authors, were
again unhappily revived at the beginning of the Reformation,
by the endeavours chiefly of ſome Polanders and Italians in the
laſt age, and among them principally of <hi>Fauſtus Socinus;</hi> who
having gathered up the dangerous errors of <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus</hi>
and <hi>Photinus</hi> chiefly, againſt the divinity of Chriſt, he put them
together in one body, together with thoſe of <hi>Pelagius</hi> in the point
of original ſin, and thoſe other doctrines which are ſuppoſed to
have a neceſſary dependance upon it.</p>
            <p>And herein <hi>Socinus</hi> ſeems chiefly to have choſen <hi>Pelagius</hi> for his
pattern. For the other Hereticks, I mean <hi>Arius, Photinus,</hi> and
<hi>Macedonius</hi> being content with the denyal of thoſe fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
doctrines, concerning the divinity of the Son and the Holy
Ghoſt, or with their particular Errors about the natures and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Chriſt, as <hi>Neſtorius</hi> and <hi>Eutyches;</hi> they did not attend to,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40896:10"/>
or at leaſt did not draw out thoſe doctrines into all their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
conſequences, which might when clearly underſtood,
overthrow all the other parts of the Chriſtian doctrine. But
<hi>Pelagius</hi> gave us a ſyſteme of his Divinity, and drew out his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
into a greater length, in oppoſition to ſeveral important
parts and branches of our Religion; chiefly that which concerned
the doctrine of Original ſin, which naturally lead him into thoſe
other dangerous miſtakes, which did by conſequence overthrow
the neceſſity of the ſatisfaction made by Chriſt, and the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the world by the merit of his death and ſufferings, as
the Fathers, and particularly St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> directly charge him. For
he was maſter of reaſon enough to conſider where it was that
his firſt error would naturally lead him, and he was content
to follow it, and thereby fell into that Labyrinth of errors,
from which with all his skill and ſophiſtry he could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entangle
himſelf; for when preſſed with the arguments of his
adverſaries, and the authority and tradition of the Catholick
Church; tho he could and did find as many ſhifts and tricks
as any other, to eſcape the force and conviction of truth; yet
his former and fundamental error in denying the imputation
of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, and the original guilt and ſtain of our natures
contracted thereby, hung like a dead weight about him, and
ſunk him down into thoſe impious opinions which he broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
concerning the grace of God, and the liberty and freedom
of mans will in religious matters in oppoſition to that Grace;
concerning the nature and efficacy of the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
the merit of good works and the juſtification of a ſinner,
the nature of Gods law and the poſſibility of raiſing to a ſtate
of perfection in this life, by yielding a perfect obedience to
it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which having been picked up by <hi>Socinus,</hi> together with
what was deliver'd by the other Hereticks, againſt the divinity
of the Son of God, and the Holy Ghoſt, he hath at
length given us the moſt perfect ſyſteme of Hereſies, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to the doctrine of the Goſpel, in almoſt all the
parts and branches of it, that ever was uſhered into the world.
And indeed to give him his due, tho in point of time and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he was inferior, yet in point of skill and management, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40896:10"/>
is, in the art of Hereſie, he was ſuperior to all that went before
him, moſt of whom were but fools and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>unglers in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
For many of the ancient Hereticks had ſeveral extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
and incoherent notions, which had no more connexion
between one another, then the parts of a rope of ſand: ſo
that like a company of mad and hair-brained people, they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked
the Chriſtian Religion with great fury, but it was at
randome and without skill; flinging about their mad opinions
like wild-fire, with which indeed they did a great deal of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
but it was at all adventures, without order, and as one
would imagine, without any certain aim. But <hi>Socinus</hi> comes
more gravely and leaſurely to work, and what <hi>M. Cato</hi> ſaid
in another caſe of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> 
               <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               <note place="bottom">1 Ad evertendam Rempublicam ſobrium acceſſiſſe. <hi>Suet. in Jul. Caeſ.</hi>
               </note> may be applyed to him, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brius
acceſſit ad perdendam religionem.</hi> LIke a man that had his
wits, tho, as many think, not the fear of God about him, he
comes more ſoberly and with greater deliberation to deſtroy the
Chriſtian Religion: he puts his opinions into better order, his
errors are better united, and have as far as the nature of error
would allow, for the moſt part, a good correſpondence between
one another: like a wary and well diſciplined Captain, he puts
his arguments into good array, levels his Batteries againſt the
great myſteries of our Religion, and chiefly againſt the eternal
Divinity of the Son of God: as well knowing that if he can ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in his attempt upon that, he may promiſe himſelf an eaſy
and cheap victory over all the reſt of our Religion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
having, as he thinks, effectually overthrown that main and
fundamental Article of it concerning the ever bleſſed Trinity,
he is reſolved to follow his blow, and to purſue his imaginary
conqueſt in that point, to the overthrow of all the other parts
of the Chriſtian doctrine. He ſaw where <hi>Arius, Photinus, Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,
&amp;c.</hi> were wanting, who having, as was ſaid before, contented
themſelves with their particular errors concerning the natures
and perſon of Chriſt, as perſons who thought they had done
miſchief enough, they ſeemed content with what they had
done, and went no farther. But <hi>Socinus</hi> in imitation of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40896:11"/>
loved <hi>Pelagius,</hi> enlarged our proſpect into his Religion, and from
the principles which he laid down, he drew out his concluſions
to a greater length: for having denyed the Trinity, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
the eternal divinity of our Saviour, with it he could not
avoid denying his ſatisfaction, and the redemption of the world
by the merit of his death and ſufferings; having diſowned the
perſonality of the Holy Ghoſt, the neceſſity of his grace, and
the efficacy of his operations upon the minds of men, muſt
at the ſame time fall to the ground. Together with theſe
he hath publiſhed many dangerous errors concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and attributes of God; concerning his preſcience and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
in the government of the world; concerning the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of man and the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and that corruption of our
natures which is the conſequence of it; concerning juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and faith which is the means of obtaining it; concerning
the Church, its nature and the notes whereby it may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
from all other ſocieties; concerning the miniſtry
and the perſons to whom Chriſt hath committed the care
and government of his Church; their diſtinction and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to preach the Goſpel, and to exerciſe diſcipline in it;
concerning the Sacraments and the end of their inſtitution,
and particularly concerning the nature and efficacy of Baptiſm
and the Lords Supper; laſtly, concerning a future ſtate and the
condition of men after this Life. To which may be added
ſome other doctrines, which do not ſeem to have any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
with the former, but yet are of dangerous conſequence
to the peace and welfare of all civil Societies: thoſe I mean
which he hath advanced about the power and authority of the
Civil Magiſtrate, the Lawfulneſs of War and Oaths in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Commonwealth, which have as miſchievous an influence
upon the order and peace of States and Kingdoms, as his other
opinions have upon Religion.</p>
            <p>So that <hi>Socinus</hi> having obſerved what was wanting in the
former Hereticks to make their attempts entirely ſucceſsful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Chriſtian Religion; being engaged in the ſame deſign,
but in order to make it more effectual, he wiſely reſolved to
correct what he thought was amiſs in them: wherefore lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40896:11"/>
aſide what was more groſs and abſurd in the wilder and
more extravagnt opinions of the ancient Hereticks, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
the defects of the more ſubtile and refined who came
afterwards; he and his followers have at length given us a
body of their divinity, more compleat in its kind then ever
the world was bleſſed with before their time. Not but that in
ſpight of all their art and skill, ſuch being the fate and folly
of error, they cannot avoid, eſpecially in the defence and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of their opinions, falling into many and thoſe very
plain contradictions. Upon the whole matter I think it may
be reaſonably doubted whether <hi>Socinus,</hi> any more than that
grand Impoſtor <hi>Mahomet,</hi> may be properly called a Heretick,
as being the Founder of a new Religion, rather than the Author
of a new name and ſect among Chriſtians. For as the Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran
of the former, is, as we are told, a fardel of errors and
abſurdities ariſing from the impure mixture of Chriſtianity,
<hi>Judaiſm,</hi> and <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> together with ſome idle and extravagant
notions of his own; ſo the doctrine of <hi>Socinus,</hi> ſeems to be a
compoſition of the errors of <hi>Arius, Photinus,</hi> and <hi>Pelagius, &amp;c.</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with ſome additions of his own, not indeed ſo ſeemingly
abſurd, as thoſe of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> but, I am afraid, no leſs dangerous
to the Chriſtian religion; of which he hath retained only the
name together with the empty ſound of the words; but with
ſuch falſe gloſſes, ſuch forced and malicious interpretations, as
have quite deſtroyed the true notion, as the whole deſign of
the Goſpel: in oppoſition to which he hath given us a kind
of natural and new Religion, not ſuch as the ſpirit of God
hath revealed in his word, but ſuch as his own carnal reaſon
ſuggeſted to him, in oppoſition to that revelation. And that
this may not be looked upon to be an uncharitable becauſe a
groundleſs charge; I ſhall lay before the reader a ſcheme of
the religion revealed by God in Holy Scripture, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
that publiſhed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles in the writings
of the New Teſtament, and which hath bin embraced by all
ſound Chriſtians in all ages of the Church, from the firſt plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of one in the world, to this day, together with another of
the new, or newly revived opinions of the <hi>Socinians:</hi> that by
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40896:12"/>
comparing of both, he may be able to make a judgment of
what is here ſuggeſted, which upon examination I hope he will
find to be agreeable to truth, and not contrary to charity.
And firſt, as it is fit, we ſhall begin with the great object of
our religion, Almighty God: in the knowledge and worſhip
of whom, together with an obedience to his commands, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
the entire nature of religion. And here upon enquiry I
believe we ſhall find, that what the Scriptures have revealed
concerning the nature of God, is widely different from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
which <hi>Socinus</hi> and his diſciples give us of him.</p>
            <p>As to what concerns the nature of God, the Scriptures pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
him to be conſidered two ways by us. 1. Abſolutely in
his glorious and eſſential attributes, or 2<hi>ly,</hi> Relatively in the
great and adorable myſtery of the ever bleſſed Trinity.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>if we conſider God in his Attributes, we ſhall find that
the firſt great, and, if I may ſo call it, fundamental attribute
which the Scriptures reveal, and indeed natural reaſon dictates
concerning him, is the unity of the Godhead, Deut.</hi> 6. 4. Hear,
O Iſrael, the Lord our God is one Lord. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 39. See now that
I, even I am he, and there is no God with me. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5. 6. For
tho there be that are called Gods, whether in heaven or in earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
But to us there is but one God the Father of whom are all things.
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. There is but one God, and one Mediator between God
and man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here undoubtedly it will be ſaid that the <hi>Socinians</hi> are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all ſuſpition orthodox, all their ſtudies and labors being
employed in aſſerting and vindicating the unity of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
in oppoſition to the doctrine of the Trinity, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their apprehenſions muſt infer a plurality of Gods.
But for all their boaſts concerning this matter, and aſſuming to
themſelves upon that ſcore the name of Unitarians, we muſt
not be too haſty in acquitting them from the imputation of
Polytheiſm; for tho they deny the eternal generation and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Chriſt, and ſay that he had no exiſtence before his being
formed in the womb of the Virgin, and appearance in the
world; and that the being which he then had was purely
humane: yet after his reſurrection from the grave, and his

aſcenſion into heaven, they ſay that God the Father as the
reward of his obedience and ſufferings, exalted him to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and dignity of a God; not indeed to be the ſupreme and
eternal God, but however <hi>deus verus,</hi> a true God, diſtinct and
ſeparate from his Father; and <hi>Socinus</hi> takes it ill of his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
that they ſhould charge him with denying Chriſt to be
God,<note n="1" place="bottom">Quaſi nos Chriſtum verum deum eſſe negamus, quod tamen à nobis non ſit, <hi>Socin. oper. Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 645.</note>, and complains againſt them that will not be brought to

once a weak and infirm man: and herein he ſaith the power
and goodneſs of God was diſcovered, and his admirable wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
diſplayed, in extolling and deifying this man, beyond

            <p>And to the objection that might be made againſt this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
as that which did unavoidably infer a plurality of Gods,
<hi>Wolzogenius</hi> will tell you, that if by two Gods you mean one of
whom are all things and we in him, and one by whom are all
things and we by him, we are ſo far ſaith he, from being aſhamed
of worſhipping two ſuch Gods, that we rather glory in it<note n="4" place="bottom">Ut potius id gloriae nobis &amp; laudi ducamus, <hi>Wolzogen. Prolegom. in Evangel. Johannis cap.</hi> 8. de vera divinitate Chriſti.</note> But
if it ſhall be farther ſaid, that to do them right, they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
but one ſupreme God by nature, and that Chriſt is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a God by Appointment and Office, not, <hi>natus</hi> but <hi>factus,</hi>
not born but made, and deifyed after his aſcenſion, by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of the divine power, wiſdom and goodneſs to him:</p>
            <p>I Anſwer that this is ſo far from abating, that it rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes
the difficulty, and makes the <hi>Socinian</hi> notion both ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
and impious, as may be ſhewn more at large hereafter,
when we come to lay the charge of Idolatry at their door.
Indeed one would think it ſhould be a debaſing of the name
and honour that is due to God, to give either of them to
any but him that is ſo from all eternity; the ſame <hi>Wolzogenius</hi>
will tell you, you may if you pleaſe, reproach them for ſo doing,
but he values it not a ruſh, <hi>nos non erubeſcimus,</hi> we are not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40896:13"/>
aſhamed to own that we worſhip <hi>Deum factum vel factitium,</hi> a
made God; not made indeed by a Goldſmith or Engraver, <hi>ab
aliquo ſculptore vel aurifabro,</hi> but they acknowledge with St. <hi>Peter</hi>
Acts 2. 36. <hi>that God hath made Jeſus who was crucifyed Lord and
Chriſt,</hi> that is, ſaith he, <hi>deum eximium fecerit,</hi> hath made him
a great and eminent God. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this be not enough, if you pleaſe to conſult <hi>Smalcius,</hi>
he will give you all the ſatisfaction that you can poſſibly
deſire further in this matter. For firſt, he will tell you, that
whereas the Scriptures aſſure us that there is but one only true
God, yet that muſt be taken <hi>ſano ſenſu;</hi> not as if there were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
true God beſides God the Father, but that there is none that
is God; <hi>eodem prorſus modo,</hi> juſt in the ſame manner as he is<note n="1" place="bottom">Quod vero Deus ille unus qui pater eſt, ſolus verus dicitur, id non ideo fieri di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus quod nemo alius praeter Patrem deus verus ſit, ſed quia nemo alius praeter Patrem, iſto prorſus modo deus verus ſit, quo ille eſt. <hi>Smal. Exam. Cent. Err. p.</hi> 4.</note>.
For otherwiſe the thing is certain and paſt all doubt, that
there are more true Gods then one; and let the Inſpired writers
be never ſo poſitive, yet he and his friends can and will with
equal confidence advance this contrary poſition, that the true
God is not one only God<note n="2" place="bottom">Certiſſimum eſt quod non unus tantum verus Deus ſit. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note>. Nay it is not an indifferent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but a truth which they firmly believe and earneſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for<note n="3" place="bottom">Contendimus &amp; fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſime
docemus eſſe plures Deos praeter unum. Eoſque veros. <hi>Refut. Smigl. de Novis Monſt. Nov. Ar. p.</hi> 14.</note>. And therefore pronounce it without any haeſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that there are more true Gods then one.</p>
            <p>And indeed they have reaſon to contend earneſtly for this
opinion, if it be true what he ſaith in the ſame place, that to
acknowledge and confeſs, and adore one only chief and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
God, is purely <hi>Judaical,</hi> and a <hi>renunciation of the
Chriſtian Religion</hi>
               <note n="4" place="bottom">Tantum unum ſummum deum agnoſcere unum tantum na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura Deum Colere, unum tantum Independentem Deum confiteri, eſſe Judaicum quid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, &amp; abnegationem Chriſtianae Religionis. <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 26.</note>. Here he ſpeaks as home to the point as
you can poſſibly deſire, and it is enough in all conſcience. Thus
whereas the Scriptures tell us there is but one God, the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
ſay there are two; one God by nature, another by grace,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40896:13"/>
one Supreme, another Inferior, one Greater, another Leſſer,
one Elder and eternal, the other a junior and modern God:
and this by <hi>Socinus</hi> is made the great myſtery of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion, greater indeed if true, and more incomprehenſible
than any other, or than all the other ſtupendous and adorable
myſteries of our Faith put together.</p>
            <p>Now as the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay there are two Gods; ſo if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<hi>Curcellaeus,</hi> he will confidently tell you there are three,
who tho he be no <hi>Socinian,</hi> yet he agrees perfectly with them
in <hi>almoſt all</hi> their other Errors, except that which concerns
the doctrine of the Trinity, where he hath a peculiar notion
of his own, diſtinct as he tells you both from <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus:</hi>
for he makes the Son and Holy Ghoſt to have a divine
nature communicated to them from all eternity, but yet ſuch
that is different in each of them, ſo that they are thee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
divine beings. And to the objection made by <hi>Mareſius,</hi>
that this notion muſt inevitably imply that there are three
Gods; he Anſwers, that if by three Gods, be meant three ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically
diſtinguiſhed from each other, he diſowns any ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
between the perſons of the Trinity; but if by three,
by meant three perſons agreeing in the ſame common nature,
yet numerically diſtinguiſhed in each of them, it is that which
he owns and earneſtly contends for; that the Father, Son and
Holy Ghoſt, are as much three Gods as <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi>
agreeing in the ſame common nature are three diſtinct men.
And if you believe him, he will tell you the Ancients were
not afraid of the imputation of <hi>Polytheiſm,</hi> in this ſenſe; and
to think of the ſame individual nature being communicated to
three perſons, was a notion that never entered into the heads
of any of the Fathers, in their diſputes againſt the <hi>Arians,</hi> as
being againſt both Reaſon and Religion. <hi>Curcell. Diſſert. prima
de vocibus Trinit. &amp;c. cap.</hi> 105. <hi>&amp; deinceps.</hi> And <hi>Limburg,</hi> who
publiſhes and recommends him to the world, I ſuppoſe is of the
ſame opinion.</p>
            <p>The 2<hi>d</hi> Attribute which the Scriptures aſcribe to God, is his
immenſity and omnipreſence, aſſuring us that his nature is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
and conſequently that it cannot be confined to any
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40896:14"/>
place, or circumſcribed within any limits. Tho he is peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
and eminently reſident in Heaven, yet <hi>Solomon</hi> will tell
us that <hi>Heaven, and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him,</hi> 1 King.
8. 27. and the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> puts the queſtion, <hi>Whither ſhall I go from
thy ſpirit? or whither ſhall I flee from thy preſence? If I aſcend up
into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold thou
art there alſo.</hi> Pſ. 139. 7, 8. So St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> Act. 7. 48. <hi>the moſt
High dwelleth not in Temples made with hands,</hi> that is, is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
within thoſe limits, as many of the Heathens thought
their Gods were, for, <hi>as ſaith the Prophet, heaven is my Throne,
and the earth is my footſtool.</hi> And indeed not only the infinite
nature of God, but the belief of his providence neceſſarily
ſuppoſes it. Upon which account we are ſaid <hi>in him to live,
and move, and have our being,</hi> Act. 17. 28. foraſmuch as he <hi>is above
all, and through all, and in all.</hi> Eph. 4. 6.</p>
            <p>Now in oppoſition to this important Truth, which is not
only revealed in Scripture, but dictated by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and acknowledged upon that ſcore to be ſuch, by all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Heathens, as well as by ſound Chriſtians; the <hi>Socinians</hi>
will tell you, that God is not infinite in his Eſſence, or Nature,
but that he is ſo confined to the Heavens, as not to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially
preſent elſewhere, or not to fill any places out of
thoſe limits. And therefore when urged with thoſe places of
Scripture, which ſay that God <hi>fills Heaven and Earth,</hi> and that
he is <hi>every where preſent,</hi> Jer. 23. 24. Pſ. 139. They anſwer, that
they muſt be Interpreted, only with reſpect to the vertue, power,
and operations of God, which extend to the remoteſt places
where he is not eſſentially preſent<note n="1" place="bottom">Ea verba, <hi>ſpeaking of thoſe words</hi> Jer. 23. 23. [<hi>Am I a God at hand, and not a God afar off?</hi>] Suadere videntur, ipſius Dei ſubſtantiam non ubique pariter praeſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem eſſe, &amp; ſic eam non eſſe immenſam ſive infinitam, quamvis ubique tamen ſua vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute &amp; providentia ſit ipſe Deus praeſens. <hi>Socin.</hi> de Dei eſſentiae Cognitione <hi>p.</hi> 68. vid. <hi>Crellium, cap.</hi> 27. de Dei Immenſitate &amp; Omnipraeſentia.</note>. As the Sun, which is the
Inſtance ſome of them give us to illuſtrate this matter, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to the Heavens, and indeed takes up but a ſmall roome
there in compariſon, yet may be ſaid to be, <hi>ubique terrarum,</hi>
becauſe he diffuſes his Light, Heat, and other influences, to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40896:14"/>
the remoteſt parts of the Earth. But of this Attribute more
hereafter.</p>
            <p>The 3. Attribute aſcribed to God in Scripture, is his omniſcience,
whereby he knows all things paſt, preſent, and to come, which
knowledge of his extends it ſelf not only to all things and
perſons, but likewiſe to all their actions and the effects of them,
and together with them views the ſecret ſprings and principles
of thoſe actions, diſcerning the deſigns and contrivances of men,
and all the thoughts and intents of the heart, <hi>There being no
creature that is not manifeſt in his ſight, but all things are naked and
open to the eyes of him with whom we have to do,</hi> Heb. 4. 13.</p>
            <p>What our Tranſlation renders open, is more Emphatically
expreſſed in the Greek, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, all things are, as it were,
diffected and anatomized, the very inſide of all things are laid
open to his view. What is lodged in the darkeſt corners and
deepeſt receſſes of the Soul, cannot be hid from his ſight,
whoſe eies are in every place, like a flame of fire, beholding
the evil and the good. Nay this knowledge is of ſo vaſt an
extent, as to comprehend within its mighty compaſs, not only
things paſt and preſent, but likewiſe all things to come; for his
duration being commenſurate to all the parts of time, he doth
not meaſure things as we do, by firſt and laſt, but all things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
and to come, are open to him at one view, <hi>with whom a
thouſand years are but as one day, and one day as a thouſand years,</hi>
2 Pet. 3. 8. Nay not only thoſe things which are properly
future with reſpect to any neceſſary cauſes of their producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but even thoſe which are moſt contingent, as depending
upon the ſpontaneous motion of mens free will; all ſuch acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
together with the moſt caſual events, as well as remote
conſequences of them, are the objects of Gods knowledge,
who doth not only diſcern our Intentions and deſigns whilſt
they are <hi>in fieri,</hi> in the time of their hatching and framing in
the Soul, but antecedently, long before the mind comes to any
determination, he <hi>underſtands our thoughts afar of, Pſ.</hi> 139. 2.</p>
            <p>And of this beſides the plain declarations of Scripture, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
that have bin made by God of the moſt contingent and
fortuitous events are an Argument that one would think ſhould
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40896:15"/>
place this truth beyond all contradiction: It being that which
God Almighty made choice of, to vindicate the honour of his
divine nature and perfections, in oppoſition to the vain claim
that was laid to them by the dull Idols of the heathens, and
their more ſtupid worſhippers, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 41. 22. <hi>Let them bring forth
and ſhew us what ſhall happen, let them ſhew the former things what
they be, that we may conſider them, and know the latter end of them,
and declare us things for to come. Shew the things that are to come
hereafter that we may know that you are God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true this knowledge of God as it extends to things to
come, is too wonderful for us, we cannot attain to it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if we think to meaſure his knowledge by our own ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
conception of things, we engage in a task more abſurd and
ridiculous, than if we ſhould attempt to take up the waters of
the Ocean and incloſe them in the hollow of our hand.</p>
            <p>And of this abſurdity are the <hi>Socinians</hi> guilty. who will by
no means be brought to acknowledge this great truth; for tho
when you come to diſcourſe with them upon this ſubject, they
will tell you, they allow God to be omniſcient, and that he knows
all things; yet you muſt not be too haſty in taking an advantage
of that conceſſion. You muſt give them leave to explain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
God knows all things, That's true, but with this limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>quatenus ſunt ſcibilia,</hi> as far as they are capable of being
known. But future contingencies muſt be excluded out of that
number, having no being either in themſelves, or in any certain
or neceſſary cauſes of their production; and therefore are no
more the object of any, even divine knowledge, then darkneſs is
the object of ſight: your eyes may as ſoon be dazled with one,
as your underſtandings be affected or receive any Impreſſion
from the other.</p>
            <p>For Gods knowledge, ſay they, is agreeable to the nature of
the things known; which may in ſome ſenſe be true, but is
a truth ill applyed by them, when they tell us, that God knows
things that are <hi>certain,</hi> as ſuch that <hi>ſhall</hi> come to paſs; things
that are <hi>likely,</hi> he conſiders as ſuch that <hi>may probably</hi> come
to paſs; things that are <hi>barely poſſible,</hi> as depending upon
the arbitrary, and therefore uncertain determinations of mens
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40896:15"/>
free will, he knows as <hi>poſſible,</hi> that is, they may or may not
come to paſs, but whether of theſe two ſhall happen, that is
ſtill a <hi>ſecret</hi> even to God himſelf; whoſe divine knowledge can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
arrive to the knowledge of ſuch future contingencies, of
which, according to the known <hi>maxim,</hi> there can be no certain
or determinate truth or falſhood.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you will ſay this <hi>maxim</hi> is true, with reſpect to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
cauſes, and any <hi>created</hi> knowledge, but not with reſpect
to the knowledge of God, to whom the moſt <hi>caſual</hi> events are
preſent, and therefore certain; for as much as he foreſees which
way men will freely determine their own choice, either in
acting, or forbearing to act, in doing this, or doing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
And without this preſcience we cannot well imagine how
God ſhould be able to govern the world, and particularly An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and Men, in whoſe actions and the event of them, his own
glory is ſo eminently concerned.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Socinians</hi> will tell you all this is a great miſtake, and that
ſuch a notion of Gods knowledge is ſo far from being neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to his providence, that it is derogatory to the freedom
of mens will, and thereby leads to the diſhonour of God, and
the overthrow of all Religion, which <hi>Crellius</hi> endeavours at
large to prove <hi>Lib. de Natura Dei cap.</hi> 24. <hi>de Sapientia Dei.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And after he hath taken ſome pains to ſhew that this omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is oppoſite to reaſon, he comes to ſhew its repugnance, as
he thinks, to the plain declarations of Scripture, and what he
and his Maſter ſay upon this head, and upon that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
it will be worth our while a little to enlarge upon, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as it will help to give us a true Idaea of <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> which
tends plainly to the diſhonour of God, and in the concluſion
to the overthrow of all natural as well as revealed Religion.</p>
            <p>Now the places of Scripture which he quotes to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
are thoſe which ſpeak of Gods waiting for the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and repentance of ſinners, as he doth in that remarkable
manner, <hi>Eſay</hi> 5. 4. <hi>What could I have done more for my vineyard,
that I have not already done to it; and yet when I expected it
ſhould bring forth grapes, it brought forth wild grapes?</hi> and v. 7.

               </note>: How ſaith he could it be ſaid either with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
or truth, that if God had foreſeen their <hi>obſtinacy,</hi> he could
have waited and hoped for their <hi>amendment.</hi> He farther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
us to two other places, to <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 21. Concerning <hi>Sodom,</hi> and
to that concerning <hi>Abram Gen</hi> 22. 12. this is certain ſaith he,<note n="2" place="bottom">Deum novum quoddam &amp; inſigne expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentum, illic quidem impietatis Sodomicae videre voluiſſe, hic vero pietatis Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamicae vidiſſe, quod antequam fieret, plane certum &amp; exploratum non erat.</note>,
That God here by a new and an extraordinary experiment, made
a diſcovery of the faith and piety of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which he was
not certain of before he made this tryal of it: And of the
execrable Impieties of the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> which he would ſcarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
they could be guilty of, till he came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
on purpoſe, and made as it were his own eyes the witneſſes
of the truth and certainty of thoſe matters.</p>
            <p>For a further confirmation of his opinion, he cites thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Scripture where God is ſaid to tempt <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is,
to make a tryal of his obedience, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 1. and ſo thoſe other
<hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>Judges</hi> 2. 21. where God is ſaid to have lead the
Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſs forth years, to prove them,
and to know what was in their hearts, and whether they would
keep his commandments or no: and to have left of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites</hi>
in the land, declaring his reſolution not to drive them
out thence, that he might prove <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whether they would keep
the waies of the Lord as their Fathers did or no. From all
which he concludes that he muſt be <hi>pertinaciſſimus,</hi> extreamly
obſtinate that ſhould oppoſe his opinion, which if you believe
him<note n="3" place="bottom">Non modo Evidentiſſima &amp; plane cogente ratione nititur, ſed &amp; ſacrarum literarum au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritate ſtabilitur.</note>, is ſupported not only by the evidence and ſtrength of
reaſon, but by the Authority of Holy Scripture<note n="4" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Crell. Ibid.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Crellius</hi> here ſaith againſt Gods preſcience, he learned

Maſter goes farther then the Scholar in aggravating the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences

hence ſaith he it muſt follow, that many things are aſcribed to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40896:16"/>
God in Scripture either <hi>falſly,</hi> or elſe muſt ſuppoſe him guilty
of ſuch <hi>imprudence</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Quae ne in hominem cadere poteſt, niſi plane dementem. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note>, which we cannot imagine any man could
be lyable to, except he were <hi>ſtark mad.</hi> And then quotes the
places before cited by <hi>Crellius,</hi> and to them adds <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
where God ſware that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould not enter into the
Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which yet he ſware to their forefathers he would
give them, and he did once really intend to put them in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of it, but their murmurings and rebellions cauſed him to
alter his reſolution.</p>
            <p>Now if God had <hi>foreſeen</hi> the diſobedience and impieties of
the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> which moved him to change his purpoſe
concerning them, in promiſing to bring them into the Land of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> and confirming that promiſe with an oath; he muſt have
acted, ſaith this <hi>Bold man,</hi> ſo, as we cannot ſuppoſe any man to
have acted, that was not <hi>quite out of his wits</hi>
               <note n="2" place="bottom">Quis ex hominibus it a amens est, ut juret ſe aliquid facturum, quod ſe facturum minime eſſe jam probe noverit. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note>. But now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all this, the foretelling of future events, even ſuch as
are moſt contingent, as depending upon the entire freedom of
mens wills; and the numerous as well as plain predictions of
theſe matters which ſtand upon record in the book of God,
one would think ſhould be an <hi>unanſwerable objection.</hi> And
it ſeems it was ſo with <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> who though he agrees too
well with <hi>Socinus</hi> in many of his other <hi>looſe and dangerous</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
concerning the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>attributes</hi> of God, yet here
he leaves him, and declares himſelf of a contrary Opinion,
being chiefly induced thereunto from this Argument of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.</p>
            <p>But yet to mollify the matter; and to give as little offence
as might be, to a party whoſe favour he courted, he tells
them and us<note n="3" place="bottom">Lib. 4. Inſt. Th. cap. 18.</note>, that it was but a ſmall matter about which they
differ'd, which ſhould break no ſquares between friends; for
tho he affirmed, and they denyed, yet the<note n="4" place="bottom">Inter Eruditiſſimos Theologos Lis adhuc ſub judice eſt. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note> matter of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40896:17"/>
of the moſt learned Divines, but never to that day had
received any determination;<note n="1" place="bottom">Vixcredo milleſimum Christianum dari qui ſcientiam hujus rei habeat.</note> That there was not one Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

               </note> that it was
ſo trifling and inconſiderable a matter, that neither Religion
nor the worſhip of God was at all concern'd in it. But what
<hi>Epiſcopius</hi> could not do, <hi>Socinus</hi> hath done, or at leaſt hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
the doing of it; <hi>viz.</hi> the reconciling the truth of Gods
<hi>predictions</hi> with the denyal of his <hi>preſcience,</hi> and it is worth our
while to hear what he ſaith upon this occaſion.</p>
            <p>1. Then, ſometimes Gods predictions are no more then his
<hi>warnings, Potius monet quam praedicit,</hi> Socin. prael. Th. cap. 10.
God dealing with <hi>men,</hi> as men ſometimes deal with <hi>children,</hi>
telling them that they will do ſuch and ſuch ill actions, to
deterr and ſhame them from ſo doing, <hi>Solemus nos cum puerum ab
aliquo errore committendo deterrere volumus,</hi> &amp;c. Ibid.</p>
            <p>2. God foretells ſome actions, and particularly ſome wicked
actions, not as if he knew they would certainly be committed
by evil men, <hi>Quia ea certiſſime futura noſſet, ſed quia ſic plane
veriſimile erat,</hi> Ibid. but becauſe it was very likely they ſhould be
ſo: that is, what we call a <hi>prediction,</hi> and what the Scriptures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any limitation deliver as ſuch, <hi>Socinus</hi> accounts but a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,</hi>
that is a <hi>probable gueſs,</hi> of what <hi>may</hi> likely come to paſs;
But what may come to paſs, <hi>may</hi> likewiſe not come to paſs,
and ſo for all their <hi>confidence,</hi> the inſpired writers, and what
we cannot think of without horror, the Holy Spirit that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
them might be miſtaken. But foraſmuch as theſe two
former Anſwers may ſerve for ſome predictions, but cannot
give a reaſonable Enquirer juſt ſatisfaction as to others, which
are ſo plain that the force of them cannot be thus eluded:</p>
            <p>Therefore once for all to put an end to this objection,
and you may well imagine he was hard <hi>preſſed,</hi> before he would
betake himſelf to this <hi>laſt,</hi> and in him a <hi>deſperate ſhift;</hi> he
is forced to take ſanctuary at thoſe very decrees of God,
which at other times he oppoſes with all his might: like a
<hi>Malefactor</hi> when cloſe purſued, and finding no other way of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40896:17"/>
eſcape, he flies for <hi>protection</hi> to thoſe very <hi>Altars,</hi> which at other
times he hath ſo often profaned by his crimes.</p>
            <p>For ſaith <hi>Socinus,</hi> the things which God foreſees, are either
good or evil; if good, he may abſolutely decree what is ſo<note n="1" place="bottom">Si teſtimonium loquitur de bonis operibus certo praeviſis, ſine dubio Deus ipſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crevit. <hi>Socit. Prael. Th. cap.</hi> 10. <hi>p.</hi> 549.</note>, and
make that neceſſary otherwiſe would be but indifferent:
nay he may impoſe a neceſſity upon the Wills of men, and make
them to do and chooſe what is good<note n="2" place="bottom">Crell. cap. 24. de ſap. Dei.</note>. Now this is downright
<hi>Calviniſm,</hi> and if you had a mind to believe it to be true, yet the
<hi>Socinians</hi> themſelves, and the Remonſtrants their friends, will
furniſh you with ſuch Objections againſt the belief of it, that
to them at leaſt they muſt be unanſwerable. For it is a <hi>known</hi>
and an <hi>avowed Principle</hi> among them both, Firſt that where there
is neceſſity, there is no religion; and conſequently neither
good nor evil<note n="3" place="bottom">Hoc eſt peſſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare religionem, quae nulla proprie eſt ubi eſt neceſſitas. <hi>Smalc. contra Smigl. cap.</hi> 2.</note>. If our actions proceed not from freedom,
they loſe their nature, and may be any thing elſe, but cannot
be virtue and vice, foraſmuch as <hi>neceſſity</hi> takes way the <hi>diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
of actions good and bad.<note n="4" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Crell. cap.</hi> 24. <hi>de ſapientia Dei p.</hi> 204. Ubi talis neceſſitas eſt, nec ullum verum pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum est, nec meritum poenae.

               </note>.</p>
            <p>2. That Freedom and Neceſſity are ſo oppoſite one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
that Omnipotence it ſelf cannot reconcile them, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as they are plain contradictions, and terms that deſtroy
each other<note n="5" place="bottom">Quod neceſſe eſt, hominis libertatem à ſe penitus excludit. <hi>Socin. Prael. Th. cap.</hi> 8.

That neceſſity robs you not only of your free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
but of your will itſelf, to which freedom is ſo neceſſary,
that without it it is no will, it being an eſſential property of
it, <hi>proprium quarto modo;</hi> and to ſay that the Will can ſubſiſt
without its property, that is it's <hi>eſſential liberty,</hi> is <hi>abſurditate
ipſa abſurdius</hi>
               <note n="6" place="bottom">Exam. Cenſurae Conf. Remonſt. cap. 6. p. 76.</note>. Now let us put both theſe things together:
there is no Religion, conſequently neither Good nor Evil, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
nor Vice, where there is neceſſity; and yet <hi>nihil prohibet,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:40896:18"/>
ſaith <hi>Crell.</hi> nothing, conſequently neither religion, nor the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of good and evil hinders, but that God may abſolutely
decree things good to be done<note n="1" place="bottom">Nihil prohibet quin Deus ſimpliciter bona fieri decernat. <hi>Crell. de ſap. Dei p.</hi> 210.</note>, and decree them ſo as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
neceſſary by virtue of that decree.</p>
            <p>Again, the Will cannot be <hi>neceſſitated</hi> in any of its actions, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as this would deſtroy its freedom, which is a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
radical property of it, and cannot be ſeparated from it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
deſtroying the Will itſelf: And yet God can <hi>impoſe a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi>
upon the <hi>wills</hi> of men of chooſing this thing or another<note n="2" place="bottom">Poteſt neceſſitatem homini imponere hoc vel illud volendi. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note>:
and <hi>Socinus</hi> will tell you, that God uſually leaves the <hi>wills</hi> of
men to their freedom, <hi>except</hi> it be when the judgements require
him to lay them under a neceſſity<note n="3" place="bottom">Deus voluntatem liberam eſſe ſinit, niſi quando ut ei neceſſitatem afferat, ejus judicia requirant. <hi>Socin. Praelect. Th. cap.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 544. </note>. Now how ſhall we reconcile
theſe ſayings, which to us poor Chriſtians ſeem to be
plain contradictions, and therefore impoſſible to be true. But
<hi>Socinus</hi> is not only a great admirer of reaſon, but a great maſter
of it too; and therefore by the help of a diſtinction, he doubts
not but to bring himſelf fairly off; for in the forementioned
place, having in order to give an account of ſome of the predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Scripture, bin forced to bring in the <hi>Decrees</hi> of God into
his aſſiſtance, which could not, one would think, but <hi>entrench upon
the freedom</hi> of mans will, by making all actions ſubject to theſe
Decrees neceſſary; he gravely tells us, and we are behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him for the diſcovery; That notwithſtanding his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
God hath left man entirely to his liberty; for beſides
the direction and government of his <hi>external actions which indeed
God hath reſerved</hi> to himſelf, he hath left every thing elſe in
the power of mans will <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               <note place="bottom">Volunt as hominis ad extremum uſque eſt plane libera, adeo ut praeter ipſum factum externum, omnia in ejus ſint poteſtate. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note>. That is, when you ſay a man is a
<hi>free Agent,</hi> you muſt diſtinguiſh between the <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
Act, between <hi>chooſing</hi> and <hi>doing;</hi> in the former ſenſe a
man is entirely at liberty, for what can be freer than thought,
who can lay a reſtraint upon mans will, or ſhackle his deſires?
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40896:18"/>
The decrees of God, can put no force upon theſe, and here
<hi>Sapiens dominabitur aſtris;</hi> they only govern mens <hi>outward actions,</hi>
which may indeed become thereby neceſſary, <hi>but that's no great
matter; animus cujuſque eſt quiſque,</hi> the <hi>mind</hi> is the nobler part,
let a man but aſſert the honor and dignity of that; and he need
not be much concerned what becomes of his <hi>outward</hi> actions.
But againſt this it may be objected, that a great part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
conſiſts in the practice of many External actions of <hi>Piety</hi>
towards God, <hi>Iuſtice</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> towards men; and if theſe are
not free, they are no longer Acts of Religion, any thing elſe
but not Virtue and Vice as was ſaid before. To this he will
tell you, that God meaſures mens Obedience or Diſobedience
reſpectively, not by the <hi>External Fact,</hi> but by the <hi>Internal Actions
and conſent of the Will</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Deus Obedientiam &amp; Inobedientiam hominum, ex ipſa perfecta &amp; conſummata voluntate, non autem ex ipſo Externo facto metitur. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>Which tho in ſome ſenſe, and with a juſt limitation it may
be true; yet as it is here brought in by him, to ſerve his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
purpoſe, is a very <hi>looſe and a dangerous determination;</hi> in
ſhort this whole matter, as it is ſtated by <hi>Socinus,</hi> is lyable to
very many and thoſe unanſwerable exceptions.</p>
            <p>For 1<hi>ſt.</hi> whereas he ſaith the will even to the laſt is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
at liberty, tho the external actions are ſubject to the
decrees of God, and thereby become neceſſary; this is a <hi>plain
contradiction</hi> to what both he and <hi>Crellius</hi> before told us, that
God might <hi>neceſſitatem afferre voluntati &amp; neceſſitatem imponere
hominibus hoc vel illud volendi:</hi> force even the will, as well as make
the outward actions neceſſary.</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly,</hi> He aſſerts a freedom in men to <hi>little or no purpoſe;</hi> for
one would think if God gave man a principle of <hi>freedom,</hi>
he did it chiefly for the <hi>government of his actions;</hi> and if theſe
are not in his power he had even as good be without his
liberty; and that his will and his actions ſhould run the ſame
<hi>fate,</hi> and be both equally ſubject to it. For my part I ſhould
think I had as good be ſhackled and manacled, as to have a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40896:19"/>
full power of moving, and yet not be able to ſtir either hand or
foot.</p>
            <p>3<hi>ly,</hi> If <hi>Socinus</hi> ſhould be asked, how it can be imagined that
the actions can be neceſſary, when the principle from whence
they proceed is abſolutely free, for it is of humane and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
actions that <hi>Socinus</hi> in that place is ſpeaking, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it would puzzle him to give a ſatisfactory anſwer.</p>
            <p>4<hi>thly,</hi> Tho <hi>Socinus</hi> takes care of the <hi>freedom of mans will,</hi>
which he in this place is concerned to vindicate, yet as far as
I can perceive he hath little care of <hi>Religion;</hi> for if, where there
is neceſſity there can be no Religion, as the <hi>Socin.</hi> and <hi>Remonſtrants</hi>
ſaid before, and that a great part of Religion conſiſts in <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
as well as <hi>internal</hi> actions; I cannot ſee but that thereby
Religion is left in great danger, if not entirely overthrown,
and that <hi>Vertue and Morality,</hi> are for any aſſiſtance that <hi>Socinus</hi>
in this place affords them, fairly left to ſhift for themſelves.</p>
            <p>Well, but however tho <hi>Socinus</hi> by making good actions ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Gods decrees, and thereby neceſſary, may be guilty
of <hi>contradicting himſelf;</hi> yet there is no great harm in all
that, his opinion may be abſurd, but he doth not deſign
to encourage impiety thereby; for tho he make God the cauſe
of good actions yet he doth not as his adverſaries do, make
him the <hi>Author of Sin.</hi> In reference to what is <hi>Evil,</hi> here man
is left entirely to his own freedom, the guilt of which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be transferred upon the decrees of God, which are not
in any wiſe concerned in them; but the ſhame and blame of
all muſt be laid at mans own door, and imputed only to his
own freedom. But ſoft and fair: there is no general rule but
may have ſome exceptions; for there are plain predictions in
Scripture, not only of <hi>ſome good,</hi> but of many <hi>evil and wicked
actions,</hi> ſuch for inſtance, as were the Treachery of <hi>Judas,</hi> and
the denyal of <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now theſe according to the <hi>Socinians,</hi> God could not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee
except they were neceſſary, and they could not well be
neceſſary without his decree, and therefore to reconcile the
prediction and the event, God firſt reſolves to have an ill
thing done, and then wiſely foretels the doing of it. Read
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40896:19"/>
what follows and then you will be further ſatisfyed in this
matter, and that <hi>Socinus</hi> and his followers are not wronged
in having this laid to their charge.</p>
            <p>For firſt, ſaith <hi>Crellius,</hi> if God finds men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it and diſpoſed
for any miſchief, <hi>Eorum malitia uti poteſt ad conſilia ſua exequenda</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Crell. cap. 24. De Sapientia Dei p. 210.</note>,
he may make uſe of their wickedneſs to compaſs his own
<hi>deſigns.</hi> Nay not only ſo, he may likewiſe decree ſomething
to be done by them, <hi>Quod ſine peccato ab iis fieri nequit,</hi> Ibid. which
cannot be done without ſin. What <hi>Crellius</hi> ſaith in general,
<hi>Socinus</hi> gives us an example of in the Egyptians, whoſe ſin
in oppreſſing the Children of Iſrael, God long before fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw
and foretold, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. as having decreed it to be done.
But to excuſe this matter he ſaith, God did not put that wicked
diſpoſition into the minds of the Egyptians, but found it there,
<hi>Malam eam mentem in ipſis invenerat, qua ad judicium ſuum exequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,
quodammodo abuſus eſt.</hi> Praelect. Th. cap. 10. p. 547. and
what he found there, he made uſe of for the execution of his
judgements.</p>
            <p>This is ſomething, but it is not full enough, this is but beating
about the buſh, therefore he will keep you no longer in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.
Not only an action that could not be done without ſin,
but the ſin it ſelf may be decreed and effected by God,
<hi>Si quid ab hominibus contra Dei legem committitur id non quidem
decernente ac autore Deo fieri aſſeveramus, niſi raro ac quibuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
de cauſis,</hi> Socin. Prael. Th. p. 544. that is, if God be the
Author of ſin it is but rarely, and that for very weighty
reaſons. Here again <hi>Socinus</hi> to our great amazement, is a
downright predeſtinarian, and if we may judge of the opinions
of <hi>Calvin</hi> even by the repreſentation of his adverſaries, he is
<hi>Calvino ipſo Calvinior.</hi> What <hi>Socinus</hi> here affirms, that God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
is the Author of mens ſins, is confirmed by <hi>Smalcius,</hi>
but with this difference, that whereas by <hi>Socinus</hi> God is made
the immediate Author of ſin, <hi>Smalcius</hi> will bring in the Devil
to bear part of the blame, <hi>deum quandoque per diabolum homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
compellere ad ſcelera perpetranda</hi>
               <note n="2" place="bottom">Smal. Contra Frantz. p. 416.</note>. God indeed, ſaith he, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40896:20"/>
men to do evil, but he makes uſe of the miniſtry of the
Devil, who is the inſtrument in the Compulſion.</p>
            <p>What they ſay thus in general, they do further illuſtrate,
if you think what hath bin ſaid may not be ſo clear, but that
it may want a Comment, by particular inſtances, and ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that of <hi>Peter</hi>'s denyal of his Maſter, which was a <hi>contingent
Event,</hi> one would think, as depending upon the freedom of
his will, and yet this was foretold by Chriſt. But how could
this be? why <hi>Socinus</hi> will tell you this denyal of <hi>Peter,</hi> was
not a matter ſo contingent as you may imagine; for God
for the puniſhment of his confidence, decreed to withdraw his
Grace from him, upon which ſubſtraction of his Grace, that
denyal could not but follow<note n="1" place="bottom">Negatio ista neceſſario conſecutura erat, <hi>Socin. ibid. p.</hi> 548.</note>. Nay he goes farther; not only
withdrawing his Grace from <hi>Peter</hi> in the <hi>Hour of Temptation,</hi>
but taking <hi>effectual courſe</hi> that he ſhould be tempted. For, ſaith
he, <hi>Peter</hi> being diſpoſed to commit this ſin, and wanting only
an <hi>Opportunity</hi> of putting it into practice, to make good the
truth of his prediction, God took care to offer him <hi>that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</hi>
And this he thinks may ſafely be ſaid, without any ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity<note n="2" place="bottom">Non alia re opus erat, niſi ut occaſio Chriſtum negandi Petro daretur, id quod deum ipſum curaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, i. e. Effeciſſe, nihil abſurdi continet. <hi>Vid. Smal. Contra Frantz. p.</hi> 431. Ubi aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerit voluntatem Petri quodammodo eſſe coactum &amp; ad breve temporis ſpacium liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate ſua privatam, idque Deum interdum &amp; facere poſſe &amp; ſolere.</note>. Here he ſpeaks home and full to the point.</p>
            <p>Indeed at another time he himſelf can ſcarce <hi>digeſt,</hi> what he
here would have his Readers <hi>ſwallow without ſtraining;</hi> for, ſaith
he, to ſay that God <hi>foreſees evil, becauſe he decrees it, cannot be
affirmed without impiety</hi>
               <note n="3" place="bottom">Peccata ita à deo nota fuiſſe affirmare, quia futura omnino ita decreviſſet, impium prorſus videri debet. <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 547.</note>. How ſhall we reconcile this with all
we before quoted out of him? I confeſs I was in ſome pain
for him, to know how he would come off, but he ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
me: by the help of a diſtinction he can perform wonders,
among which one of the greateſt is to <hi>reconcile contradictions.</hi>
For ſaith he, <hi>Si certa mali operis praedictio erit, ipſum quidem
opus à deo decretum fuerit, non autem cordis malitia,</hi> p. 549.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40896:20"/>
That is, you muſt diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Act</hi> and the <hi>Obliquity</hi>
of it, and then you may reconcile the honour of <hi>Gods juſtice</hi>
and the <hi>truth</hi> of his <hi>predictions:</hi> a very nice and Methaphyſical di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
and which I ſhould almoſt have deſpaired to have found
any where, but in the writings of a <hi>Schoolman</hi> or a <hi>Calviniſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole, I think, we have reaſon to admire the
<hi>Judgment</hi> of God, upon theſe men; in giving them up, as a <hi>juſt
puniſhment</hi> of their contempt of his <hi>Revelations,</hi> to the <hi>conduct</hi>
of their own <hi>carnal</hi> and <hi>corrupt Reaſon,</hi> which when it is not
aſſiſted by a Divine Revelation, is but a blind guide in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion; and therefore it is no wonder if we find them
roving and wandring in a labyrinth and maze of Errors, like
men bewildred, going backward and forward, ſaying and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying,
and at length growing giddy, and falling back into
thoſe very opinions which they have made ſo much haſt to
fly from, and upon the account of which, they and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants
have raiſed ſo many, and ſuch <hi>tragical</hi> exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
againſt their adverſaries.</p>
            <p>4<hi>ly.</hi> The next <hi>Attribute</hi> that the Scriptures aſcribe to God,
is his Immutability, whereby he is uncapable of <hi>Alteration,</hi> and
therefore not <hi>liable to change</hi> 1 Sam. 15. 29. <hi>The ſtrength of Iſrael
will not lie nor repent: for he his not a man that he ſhould repent.</hi>
This would argue God to be like our ſelves, of like weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and like paſſions with men.</p>
            <p>For whatever <hi>Alterations</hi> may happen in the world, yet he
remains <hi>unalterable, with whom is no variableneſs, neither ſhadow
of turning.</hi> James 1. 17. Indeed men upon many accounts, and
for many very warrantable reaſons, may be obliged to ſhift
and change their Counſels and Reſolutions: who for want
of <hi>wiſdom and foreſight</hi> in laying their projects, or for want
of <hi>ſtrength of execute them,</hi> and by a great many other <hi>unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
accidents,</hi> which the greateſt prudence could not foreſee,
nor conſequently avoid, oftentimes meet with many and fatal
diſappointments.</p>
            <p>But when <hi>Infinite Wiſdom</hi> is joyned with <hi>Infinite Power,</hi>
nothing can hinder ſuch an <hi>Agent</hi> from bringing his purpoſes
to the deſired Event. <hi>My counſel, ſaith the Lord, that ſhall
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40896:21"/>
ſtand, and I will do all my pleaſure, Eſay.</hi> 46. 10. Who can
withſtand the power of God? who can baffle his Contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or reſiſt his will? For the Counſels and Decrees of God
are as <hi>Immutable</hi> as his Nature; for be they Abſolute, or be
they Conditional, as long as he foreſees the performance of
the Condition, it makes no difference in this caſe: many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
may be in mans heart, <hi>but the counſel of the Lord that ſhall
ſtand,</hi> Prov. 19. 21. however men may alter, and the dealings
and <hi>diſpenſations of Gods providence</hi> in ſeveral acts of mercy and
juſtice upon that ſcore, may be different towards them; yet
this is without <hi>alteration</hi> or change in his purpoſes towards them,
<hi>who remains ſtill the ſame, yeſterday, and to day, and for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Socinians</hi> utter many bold and <hi>dangerous</hi> expreſſions in
oppoſition to this plain truth, which is the unavoydable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of their denyal of Gods Omniſcience. Foraſmuch as
there are many events which depend upon the actions of men,
which ariſing from the freedom of their Will, are therefore

God accommodating his decrees to the nature of things,

but not without good reaſon, he may alter his purpoſes as
wiſe men uſually do, according to the <hi>different circumſtances</hi> of
things, and as the exigence of his affairs ſhall require.</p>
            <p>But with the leave of this bold man, another would be apt
to think, that tho men may without the imputation of levity
alter their counſels, yet this ariſes from the <hi>imperfection of their
natures,</hi> and particularly of their <hi>knowledge of future events,</hi> which
tho it be no <hi>fault,</hi> yet it muſt be acknowledged a <hi>weakneſs,</hi>
tho ſuch an one as they are no more accountable for, than they
are, becauſe they cannot reſtore ſight to a man born blind,
or raiſe the dead. But it cannot be aſcribed to God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a <hi>derogation</hi> to his infinite knowledge, and <hi>unerring judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and is therefore an argument of weakneſs, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all that <hi>Crellius</hi> urges very weakly to the contrary,
<hi>Ibid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore that we may return where we firſt began, to the
Decrees of God concerning the future, and final ſtate of men;
this is certain, that they with relation to their ſeveral and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
objects, are fixed and unmoveable; for be they <hi>ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent</hi>
or <hi>ſubſequent</hi> to his foreſight of mens <hi>faith or infidelity,</hi>
it matters not in this caſe: the Scriptures however aſſure us,
and right reaſon would confirm the ſame, that they are <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable,</hi>
more ſtable then the <hi>Foundations of the Earth,</hi> or the
<hi>Poles of the World,</hi> which may and ſhall be ſhaken, and ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
out of their places like drunken men, <hi>but the Counſel of the
Lord that ſhall ſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For let holyneſs and perſeverance be the cauſe or the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of Gods election, yet all ſober perſons agree in this, that
whoever lives an holy life, and perſeveres in it, <hi>is undoubtedly
choſen</hi> by God to eternal life, and whoſoever lives and dies
in his <hi>ſins and impenitence,</hi> is certainly deſigned and ſhall be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40896:22"/>
doomed to everlaſting puniſhment: <hi>here the foundation of the
Lord ſtandeth ſure, the Lord knoweth them that are his,</hi> and them
that are not ſo. But <hi>Socinus,</hi> who denies the certainty of Gods
knowledge of many future events, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent,
ſuch as are the actions of men, as depending upon
the <hi>uncertain becauſe free</hi> motions of their will; muſt in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance
of this principle, deny the certainty of Gods Election;
becauſe he cannot foreſee who will obey his commands and
continue to do ſo, againſt all the temptations which they will
meet with in the world to the contrary: and conſequently he
muſt ſay, what another would account Impiety to think, that
God Almighty for <hi>want of knowing</hi> the determination of mens
choice, muſt likewiſe <hi>be ignorant</hi> of the final event of their
actions: and therefore he who at preſent is the object of
his Love, and deſigned by him for the joyes of Heaven, may
in the concluſion for ought he knows, merit his diſpleaſure,
and be tumbled down to hell.</p>
            <p>Now that men may make ſuch <hi>uncertain conjectures</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their final ſtate, and thereupon meet with <hi>a fatal and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
diſappointment,</hi> may be a certain tho a ſad truth, and
therefore no great wonder: But to think that it ſhould thus
happen to the <hi>Allwiſe Creator of men,</hi> is to have too mean and
diſhonourable conceptions of him; and ſuch the <hi>Socinians</hi>
have, doubting not to aver, that God finds reaſon to alter
not only his diſpenſations towards men according to their
behaviour, but his own intentions of kindneſs and diſpleaſure,
chooſing what at firſt he refuſed, and refuſing afterwards
what once he thought worthy of his Approbation and choice,

               <hi>A fifth attribute in God,</hi> and which indeed cannot be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from him, without overthrowing all Religion, is his
Juſtice: and that not only as it ſignifies <hi>his holineſs and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi>
but as it betokens his <hi>anger, indignation, his ſeverity</hi>
and <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> againſt Sin and Sinners. And this the Scripture
ſpeaks very often of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. the Pſalmiſt deſcribes God as one
not only <hi>that hath no pleaſure in wickedneſs,</hi> ver. 4. which ariſes
from the holineſs and righteouſneſs of his nature, but as one
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40896:22"/>
likewiſe that <hi>hates all the workers of iniquity,</hi> ver. 5. and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
who abhors the deceitful, and will deſtroy the Lying
man. <hi>The wicked and him that loveth violence his Soul abhors,</hi> Pſal.

authority and honour, and will revenge the contempt of it:
<hi>he</hi> is ſlow to anger, but yet will not acquit the wicked, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as he is jealous, and furious, who <hi>will take vengeance
on his adverſaries, and reſerves wrath for his enemies, Nahum.</hi> 2, 3.
and when God proclaims his name, the name by which he
deſires to be known, it is the <hi>God merciful and gracious,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>but yet one that will by no means clear the guilty,</hi> Exod. 34. 6.
Numb. 14. 18. <hi>he is</hi> Deus ultionum, <hi>the God to whom vengeance
belongeth,</hi> Pſ. 94. 1. <hi>the God of recompences,</hi> Jer. 51. 56. and in <hi>ſhort,
a conſuming fire,</hi> Heb. 12. 29.</p>
            <p>All which expreſſions ſeem plainly to denote, that Juſtice
in God is a neceſſary and an eſſential attribute, and which
you can no more ſeparate from him than you can his nature:
I mean that Juſtice which betokens his <hi>ſeverity and indignation</hi>
againſt ſinners, and moves and enclines him to puniſh them,
tho the puniſhment it ſelf may in ſome ſenſe be ſaid to be
<hi>arbitrary,</hi> and ſubject to the freedom of Gods will; as are
alſo the <hi>Emanations of his goodneſs,</hi> and the <hi>effects</hi> of his power:
but yet all this doth not hinder but that power and goodneſs
may be eſſential Attributes of God, and are acknowledged ſo to
be by the <hi>Socinians</hi> themſelves: and the like we affirm of
<hi>Juſtice,</hi> to the terrible effects of which, the ſins of men ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them neceſſarily obnoxious: all guilt which is the inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
conſequence of ſin being in its own nature an obligation
to puniſhment.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Socinus</hi> will furniſh you with new notions concerning
God in this matter, and quite different from what either Jews
or Chriſtians have conceived of him. For he will tell you,
that Juſtice and Mercy in God, not only as to <hi>their external
effects</hi> as they are diſcovered in rewards and puniſhments, but
likewiſe in themſelves, are not attributes eſſentially belonging
to God, but are things purely arbitrary and indifferent: and
particularly that juſtice, as it beſpeaks an hatred of ſin and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40896:23"/>
againſt the workers of iniquity, is not a <hi>permanent
property,</hi> or, as he loves to ſpeak, <hi>a quality</hi> reſiding in God,
which belongs to him <hi>per ſe,</hi> but <hi>ex accidente,</hi> that is, it is a
matter purely contingent, and the effect only of his <hi>free and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
will</hi>

            <p>Now this as it is laid down by the <hi>Socinians</hi> I take to be
not only a falſe but a dangerous poſition; foraſmuch as it
furniſhes us with ſuch a notion of God as is <hi>diſhonorable to him,</hi>
and will naturally lead us to a contempt of him. But before
I come to prove this, (foraſmuch as I take it to be a matter
of great importance in it ſelf, and eſpecially is ſo in our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who have introduced this notion of
God without Juſtice, in order to deſtroy the <hi>true reaſon</hi> of
Chriſts death and ſufferings, which was to give <hi>ſatisfaction to
the Juſtice</hi> of God for the ſins of mankind,) I muſt crave leave
to lay down certain poſitions, which tho I might take for
granted, and call <hi>poſtulata,</hi> as being commonly known and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Truths: yet I ſhall as I go along endeavour to prove
them ſo.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing therefore which I ſhall lay down, is, that if
there be a <hi>Providence,</hi> it muſt be chiefly and principally em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the care and government of human affairs: for there
can be no imaginable reaſon aſſigned, nay it would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all reaſon to ſuppoſe, that God ſhould take care of
<hi>Beaſts and Inanimate Creatures,</hi> and neglect one of the nobleſt
parts of the Creation, I mean man, for whoſe ſake chiefly,
next to his own Glory, he created the viſible world, and to
whom as to his <hi>Vicegerent</hi> he hath given the Dominion over
the works of his hand, having put all things under his feet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:40896:23"/>
2<hi>dly,</hi> There can be no <hi>providence</hi> nor care of human affairs
without giving men <hi>Laws</hi> for the government of their actions:
for as his providence towards other creatures is ſeen, in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them certain laws of motion and reſt ſuitable to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
natures, and in guiding and governing them ſo, as
may moſt tend to his own glory, and the wellfare and beauty
of the univerſe: ſo his <hi>government and care of men</hi> conſiſts in
giving them certain Laws as Rules of their actions and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
it being much more requiſite upon many accounts that
they ſhould act by a certain direction; foraſmuch as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
and miſchief that muſt be the conſequence of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
living muſt be far greater, and more repugnant to the
nature and righteouſneſs of God, than if other creatures ſhould
ſwerve from the Laws of their creation; which yet they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably
obſerve, except when God thinks fit to <hi>interpoſe,</hi> for
the ends of his own Glory, and the good of men.</p>
            <p>3<hi>dly,</hi> That Laws are ſo a<note n="1" place="bottom">Lex eſt regula actuum moralium, obligans ad id quod rectum eſt, <hi>Gr. de Jur. B. &amp; P. Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect</hi> 9.</note> Rule of <hi>Moral actions,</hi> as to put

            <p>4<hi>thly,</hi> That the violation of a Law naturally and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
upon that very ſcore makes a man <hi>lyable to puniſhment:</hi>
which is but the ſame thing tho in other words with the

but any evil in general, <hi>ſhould receive for that evil that he

            <p>Laſtly, That there is a neceſſary relation between puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and juſtice, whoſe office among other things is to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
rewards and puniſhments. I do not ſay that Juſtice is
alwaies <hi>obliged to exact the puniſhment,</hi> which the Delinquent is
alwaies and neceſſarily <hi>obliged</hi> to ſuffer, I mean is neceſſarily
obnoxious to; but wherever there is puniſhment if juſt, it muſt
flow from that <hi>Habit or Attribute</hi> which we call <hi>Juſtice;</hi> and
that not only as it beſpeaks <hi>Righteouſneſs and Equity;</hi> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
as it ſignifies that <hi>ſeverity and indignation</hi> which every
Lawgiver is ſuppoſed to conceive againſt him that tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
his Laws, who thereby violates his Authority and offends
againſt the publick good.</p>
            <p>It hath bin doubted indeed whether in human puniſhments,
the Civil Magiſtrate may aime at the vindicating of his own
Authority, conſider'd abſtractedly from the publick good. And
here that famous paſſage of <hi>Seneca</hi>
               <note n="3" place="bottom">Nemo prudens punit quia peccatum eſt, ſed ne peccetur: revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cari enim praeterita non poſſunt, futura prohibentur, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Clem. Cap.</hi> 6.</note>, is often cited upon this
occaſion, and which he tranſlated out of <hi>Plato de Leg. no wiſe man
puniſhes</hi> a fault becauſe it hath bin committed, but leſt the
like ſhould be committed again: for what is paſt cannot be
recalled, but wiſe and good men in puniſhment aime at prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
miſchief for the future.</p>
            <p>But tho this may be true with reſpect to men, yet it is
not ſo with regard to Almighty God, to whom, as <hi>Grotius</hi> in

the formentioned Book and Chapter <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. hath very tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and judiciouſly obſerved, thoſe ſayings of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi>
would be very ill applyed; foraſmuch as God in puniſhing
the ſins of men, may very righteouſly, and oftentimes
doth, aime at nothing but the aſſerting of his own honour,
and vindicating the authority of his Laws, and in ſhort, the
<hi>revenging the contempt and violation of them:</hi> as is evident in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
inviſible <hi>puniſhments</hi> inflicted upon ſome ſinners in this
life, ſuch as are <hi>obduration</hi> and giving them up to a <hi>Reprobate</hi>
ſenſe; and will be much more evident in thoſe <hi>everlaſting pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments</hi>
(for ſo we will make bold to call them whatever
the <hi>Socinians</hi> may ſay to the contrary) in the life to come, where
God can aime at nothing but the <hi>ſatisfaction of his Juſtice,</hi> and
thereby the manifeſtation of his own Glory<note n="1" place="bottom">Certe poenas quorundam valde perditorum à Deo non ob aliud (ſcil. extra ſe) exigi, ſacra verba testantur, cum dicunt eum voluptatem capere ex ipſorum malo, ſubſannari atque irrideri impios à Deo.

            <p>But whatever the reaſons may be of inflicting puniſhment

            <p>Now theſe things being thus premiſed, I proceed to make
good my charge againſt the <hi>Socin.</hi> in calling that not only a
<hi>falſe but a dangerous Opinion</hi> of theirs, which makes Juſtice to
be no <hi>neceſſary or eſſential Attribute</hi> in God, but a matter pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Arbitrary and Contingent,</hi> as being the effect only of his free
will.</p>
            <p>1. Then this Opinion I ſay is falſe and impious, becauſe
it furniſhes us with ſuch an Idea of God as is <hi>diſhonourable</hi>
to him and will naturally lead us to a contempt of him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it teaches us ſo to conceive of God, as of one that is not
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40896:25"/>
neceſſarily concerned in the Actions of men and the affairs
of the World: that is, it gives us a notion of a God <hi>without
a providence;</hi> for if there be a providence, it muſt chiefly and
principally be imployed (as was ſaid in our firſt Prop.) in the
<hi>care and government of Human Affairs;</hi> there can be no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
without Laws, no laws without the Sanctions of
Puniſhment, either expreſſed or neceſſarily implyed in all ſuch
Laws; no puniſhment without Juſtice to inflict it; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
(that we may bring both ends of our <hi>Sorites</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
where there is no Juſtice, there is no Providence; and
where the one is not neceſſary, the other is not ſo too. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
tho the <hi>Socinians</hi> do acknowledge Gods providence and that
he doth actually govern the World, yet this doth not take
off the charge of falſhood and impiety from this poſition of
theirs; becauſe thereby they make his providence to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent
and perfectly an Arbitrary matter; you may notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all this have a true notion of God and do him no
wrong, if you conceive of him as of one that may be uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the actions of men, who after he hath ſent them
into the world, may ſuffer them to live as they pleaſe, every
man doing that which is right in his own eies: which yet is
great Impiety ſo much as to imagine; foraſmuch as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to the infinite perfections of Almighty God, helps
to debaſe him in our thoughts, to weaken that reverence and
eſteem which ariſes in our minds when we conceive of him;
and thereby leads us naturally and inevitably from a diſeſteem
to a denyal of him.</p>
            <p>So that what at firſt I called a <hi>dangerous</hi> I am now afraid
in the concluſion will prove to be an <hi>Atheiſtical aſſertion:</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which account <hi>Epicurus</hi> among the Ancients was generally
accounted an Atheiſt;<note n="1" place="bottom">Cicer. de Natura Deo. Lib. 1. Cap. 123.</note> 
               <hi>Poſidonius</hi> the Stoick thought him ſo,
and that it was only the Envy and Infamy which attended
ſuch perſons, which obliged him not to profeſs himſelf one: But

and if a Providence, I am ſure there muſt be that Attribute
in God which we call Juſtice, without which that other can
never be exerciſed. But you will ſay that God may give men
Laws for the government of their Actions, and that will be
a ſufficient <hi>vindication of his providence,</hi> tho he aſſigns no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the breach of them. That is, tho we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<hi>a God without a providence,</hi> yet we may <hi>conceive a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
without Juſtice.</hi> Indeed <hi>Socinus</hi> hath told us ſo, for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the command of God to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him not to eat of the forbidden fruit, and the threatning
annexed, <hi>In the day thou eateſt thou ſhalt dy the death, Gen.</hi> 3.
which <hi>threatning Covet</hi> his adverſary told him, did flow from
that <hi>Juſtice</hi> in God which we have hitherto bin ſpeaking of;
he Anſwers, <hi>that this Juſtice was not any thing in God inhering
in him, and therefore nothing could flow from it, as being only an
accidental effect of his free will:</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Socin Diſp. de Chriſto Serv. pars prima p. 123.</note> 
               <hi>Cum à me oſtenſum fuerat, ejuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modi
juſtitiam in Deo non veré reſidere, nec proprié Dei qualitatem
dici poſſe, ſed tantummodo effectum voluntatis ejus; nihil ex ea fluere
potuit:</hi> as much as if he had ſaid, <hi>non entis nullae ſunt operatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
what is not, can have no influence to produce any thing.
And for a confirmation of this he adds,<note n="2" place="bottom">Quod verum eſſe depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendetur, ſi conſideremus potuiſſe Deum praeceptum illud homini tradere, neque ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men poenam Mortis, ſi illud non ſervaſſet addere: Immo ne poenam quidem ullam. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note> that God might have
given <hi>Adam</hi> (and what God might have done to <hi>Adam,</hi> he
might undoubtedly have done to all the Sons and poſterity
of <hi>Adam</hi>) this law, and not have annexed Death as the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the breach of it, nay if he had ſo pleaſed he might
have aſſigned no puniſhment at all.</p>
            <p>But this is delivered by <hi>Socinus</hi> with the ſame <hi>Confidence</hi> as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40896:26"/>
are many of his other abſurd <hi>Errors,</hi> in which he ſtands ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
by himſelf, againſt the conſtant and uniform ſuffrage of
Divines Ancient and Modern, Fathers and Schoolmen, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
and Lawyers, and thoſe both Canoniſts and Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians:
among whom it paſſes for an uncontrolled maxim, That,
that is very vainly and <hi>impertinently commanded</hi> which may be
<hi>ſecurely neglected. Fruſtra eſt aliquid praecipere, quod impuné poteſt
negligi:</hi> and this bold poſition he lays down, and gives us not
the leaſt reaſon for it, but his own affirmation. But tho he
gives us no reaſon for his aſſertion, I am ſure there is very
great as well as very apparent reaſon againſt it; foraſmuch
as ſuch Laws as theſe will neither ſecure the honour of God,
nor ſerve the ends of his providence; being but in the nature
of good advice, which, as we ſaid before, every man is at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to take, or refuſe at his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>So that while he makes the Law precarious, at the ſame
time and for the ſame reaſon he makes the Obedience of men
ſo too: in which caſe God muſt be beholding not to his own
<hi>Authority,</hi> but to the <hi>good nature</hi> of his Creatures, that they
yield any obedience to his commands. Perhaps you will ſay
there may be other <hi>obligations,</hi> beſides thoſe of puniſhment
which men may be under to practiſe their duty: ſuch as are
thoſe of <hi>Honour and Gratitude,</hi> and the ſtrong tye of Reaſon,
which will bind a man to comply with his Duty, if there were
no other motive to it, but this, that to do otherwiſe will be
to act unſuitably to the dignity of his nature.</p>
            <p>All this may be fine in ſpeculation, but will ſignifie little
when reduced to practice: the generality of men being go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
<hi>by ſenſe,</hi> the motions of which are too <hi>headſtrong</hi> and
<hi>furious</hi> to be curbed by the bare commands of reaſon, when
they are not enforced with the <hi>fear of puniſhment:</hi> the voice
of which will be as feeble as that of old <hi>Eli</hi> to his rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
Sons, far too weak to maſter their violence: and
therefore that <hi>Frantick Woman</hi> that ſome have talked of, who
brought fire in one hand to burn up Paradiſe, and water
in the other to quench the flames of Hell, if ſhe had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in her deſign, inſtead of promoting would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40896:26"/>
all virtue, and ſoon have rooted it out of the
world.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, to ſumm up what hath been ſaid upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
if there be no <hi>Juſtice naturally in God,</hi> there might have
bin no <hi>Providence,</hi> and if no providence, then men might have
bin left to the conduct of their own <hi>giddy and unruly paſſions,</hi>
which would ſoon break through the reſtraints of reaſon;
and when men were thus left to the government of <hi>Luſt and
Senſe,</hi> the unavoidable conſequence of this muſt have bin, that
the world would have bin filled with <hi>Blood and Murders,</hi> with
<hi>Impurity and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs,</hi> with <hi>Theft and Rapine,</hi> with <hi>Injuſtice
and Oppreſſion,</hi> and the gentle race of men would ſoon have
become worſe then the worſt of wild Beaſts, preying upon
and devouring one another. And to ſuppoſe that God could
be <hi>unconcerned</hi> at all this, as if there be no <hi>Juſtice</hi> in him which
enclines him to puniſh ſuch wickedneſs, he might be, is to
have ſuch a notion of God as it is reported <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11<hi>th</hi>
of <hi>France</hi> had of his Leaden God which he carried about him,
and when he had cauſed any man to be Murder'd, or done
the like miſchief, he would take it into his hands, and kiſs it, and
beg pardon, and then all was well again, and he himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
immediately ſafe if not innocent. In ſhort at this rate,
we ſhould not diſhonour God if we ſo conceived of him, as
of one who did not <hi>neceſſarily</hi> act according to the <hi>eternal
and unalterable Rules of Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and Righteouſneſs,</hi> that
he might be a God not of Order but Confuſion, which is
not only an <hi>Impious,</hi> but a <hi>Blaſphemous</hi> aſſertion.</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> My ſecond reaſon why I account this Poſition of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi>
about Gods juſtice to be falſe and dangerous, is becauſe
it takes away the diſtinction between <hi>Laws Poſitive and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural;</hi>
which diſtinction hath hitherto bin looked upon, not
only to be <hi>true</hi> but <hi>ſacred;</hi> ſoraſmuch as the contrary would
open a Gap to all manner of impiety and wickedneſs. Now
<hi>poſitive</hi> Laws are accounted ſuch as owe their original only
to Gods free will and pleaſure; and therefore as they cannot
be known, ſo they cannot oblige any but thoſe to whom he
hath made ſuch a declaration, and diſcovery of his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.

               <hi>Natural Laws are thoſe which are diſcovered by the light
of nature, as being the neceſſary reſult of our Conſtitution, and that
relation which we hear to God as rational Creatures: many of which
tho revealed in Scripture, yet in themſelves are obligatory, antecedent
to any ſuch revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now theſe Laws do neceſſarily ſuppoſe Juſtice in God,
without which they would be inſignificant: for tho natural
Laws owe their Original to the holyneſs of God, as being but
a tranſcript of thoſe eſſential Rules of righteouſneſs which make
up his nature; yet all their <hi>force and obligation,</hi> (without which
they are not properly Laws) reſults from his <hi>Juſtice;</hi> that is,
from the fear of puniſhment, which the <hi>Law threatens,</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
inflicts,</hi> without which they would be perfectly inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant.
From which by a juſt and neceſſary conſequence it
unavoidably follows, that if their be natural Laws, there muſt
be Juſtice naturally in God: ſo on the other hand, if there
be no Juſtice, there can be no Laws of nature, foraſmuch as
without the former they can have neither <hi>Force nor Obligation,</hi>
nor conſequently have the <hi>formal reaſon of Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3<hi>dly</hi> And Laſtly, This Opinion of <hi>Socin.</hi> is both falſe and
Impious, becauſe it tends to overthrow all natural Religion,
by ſupplanting that which is the chief if not the only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of it in the world, and that is the fear of God. For
take away his Juſtice as this <hi>Socinian</hi> hypotheſis doth, and then
you have left nothing in him which a man governed by the
light of nature need to fear: not his unity, nor his eternity,
nor immenſity, not his holyneſs, nor his goodneſs, to be ſure;
nor laſtly his power which in conjunction with the former,
as it neceſſarily is in God, is as harmleſs and innocent as either
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40896:28"/>
of the former Attributes, when it is not moved nor excited by a
juſt diſpleaſure and indignation.</p>
            <p>Imagine therefore a <hi>Socinian</hi> were to diſcourſe a <hi>Pagan,</hi> I
would fain know how upon this principle he could convince
him that it were his Duty to worſhip God, and to live a
virtuous life: he might tell him indeed, and tell him with great
truth, that the <hi>Divine nature and perfections</hi> are in themſelves
a juſt ground of <hi>Eſteem and Adoration:</hi> That virtue hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and thoſe powerful though inviſible charms, as being both
agreeable to our Reaſon, and at the ſame time ſerving to promote
our wellfare and happineſs in this world; yet all this would
lay him under no <hi>obligation</hi> to do that, which otherwiſe would
be <hi>highly reaſonable</hi> and fitting to be done: ſuppoſe it be <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,</hi>
ſuppoſe it <hi>rational,</hi> ſuppoſe it his <hi>Intereſt,</hi> yet he is left to
his <hi>liberty,</hi> and may, and no doubt will, do what he pleaſes
for all that: he may act indeed like a fool and a Brute, yet
he is guilty of no ſin in the mean time; for where there is
no <hi>Juſtice,</hi> there can be no <hi>fear of puniſhment,</hi> where there is
no puniſhment, there is no obligation, nor conſequently Law;
and where there is no Law, there can be no tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>So that tho his reaſon may upbraid him with the folly, his
Conſcience in this caſe would never <hi>check him</hi> for the <hi>guilt of
his vices;</hi> which if the <hi>Laws of his Country</hi> did not take ſome
care to prevent, he might ſecurely practice without any fear
of <hi>Gods diſpleaſure.</hi> In ſhort, notwithſtanding all the fine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
about the beauty and amiableneſs of religion and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
the inclinations of ſenſe would ſoon bear down the
dictates of Reaſon, and the <hi>ſlighteſt temptations</hi> would prove
too ſtrong for theſe <hi>very ſpeculations;</hi> and as to the generality,
the concluſion which they would draw from this principle,
would be, <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we dye,</hi> and after
death comes no reckoning or account. <hi>Come on let us enjoy
the good things that are preſent, and let us ſpeedily uſe the Creatures
like as in youth: Let us fill our ſelves with coſtly Oyntments, and
let no flower of the ſpring paſs by us: Let us crown our ſelves with
Roſe-buds before they are withered, Let none of us go without his
part of our voluptuouſneſs: Let us leave tokens of our joyfulneſs in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40896:29"/>
every place; for this is our portion, and our Lot is this.</hi> Wiſd. 2.
ver. 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>But tho this notion overturns all <hi>natural Religion,</hi> yet it is
it ſelf effectually overthrown by the dictates of <hi>natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi>
which are an unanſwerable proof both of <hi>the exiſtence</hi>
and the <hi>Juſtice of God:</hi> for we muſt know that Conſcience is
ſomething more than <hi>bare Reaſon:</hi> for Reaſon may <hi>direct,</hi> but
Conſcience will <hi>preſcribe;</hi> Reaſon gives us a <hi>Rule</hi> for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of our actions, Conſcience paſſes that <hi>Rule into a
Law,</hi> gives it its force and obligation. <hi>The</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And therefore Conſcience is not <hi>bare Reaſon,</hi> but reaſon as
it is <hi>Gods Vicegerent,</hi> cloathed with his Authority, armed with
his Juſtice: and therefore in a more <hi>Imperious way</hi> it commands
our obedience, not only perſwading us to our duty, but threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
for the neglect of it: it puts on a <hi>Majeſtick Aire,</hi> tells us
this muſt be done, or refuſe it at your peril: indeed it exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes
the office, and ſuſtains the perſon of a <hi>Legiſlator, a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and a Judge:</hi> firſt <hi>preſcribes</hi> a Law, then <hi>accuſes</hi> for our
diſobedience, and laſtly <hi>ſolemnly arraigns</hi> the Sinner for his
guilt, and then paſſes ſentence upon him. So that theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Conſcience and the Tribunal that God hath erected
there, are one of the cleareſt and moſt <hi>uncontrolled</hi> proofs of a
future Judgement, of which the former are a kind of <hi>Antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed if we look back to former times, and conſult
the Hiſtory of Ages and Countries, the moſt ignorant and
barbarous, we ſhall find, that as the Light of Nature hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
them to the <hi>belief and acknowledgement</hi> of a God; ſo
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40896:29"/>
one of the earlieſt notions that aroſe in their minds when
they have thought of him, hath bin the <hi>Apprehenſion of his
Juſtice:</hi> of which among other things, the <hi>numerous,</hi> tho many
of them <hi>Impious and Ridiculous rites,</hi> which they made uſe of
to appeaſe the anger of their <hi>incenſed Deities,</hi> are an irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable
Argument. And this apprehenſion of divine Juſtice,
was, as one of the principal cauſes, ſo one of the chiefeſt, if
not the only ſupport of natural Religion in the world.</p>
            <p>Now to apply this to our preſent purpoſe, and to bring the
parts of our argument a little cloſer together: If men by the
light of nature could diſcover this Attribute of Juſtice in God,
it muſt unavoidably follow, that Juſtice in him is natural;
for the light of nature can diſcover nothing in God but what
is ſo: whatever is the effect of Gods <hi>meer pleaſure,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
of his free will, can never be known but by <hi>Revelation;</hi>
and it is impoſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe diſcovered, except
we ſhould ſuppoſe men to be Omniſcient, and that they may
know more of God than they can of one another: <hi>For what
man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of man that is
within him?</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 11. ſo much leſs <hi>can any man diſcern the
things of God but the ſpirit of God.</hi> He indeed <hi>ſearches the deep
things of God,</hi> ſuch as are the reſults of his free pleaſure, and
the counſel of his will; which lay hidden in the <hi>breaſt of God,</hi>
and muſt for ever have done ſo, had not he who lay in the
<hi>boſom of his Father,</hi> revealed them unto us: and therefore if
juſtice were, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> tell us, the effect only of Gods
free will, it muſt have lain undiſcovered to the Gentile world,
to whom God vouchſafed no revelation of his will; which yet
is contrary to the account which the Hiſtories of all times
and ages have given us of this matter: from whence it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that the belief of Gods Juſtice among men, is <hi>coeval</hi> with
that of their being, written in the <hi>ſame Characters,</hi> and engraven
by the <hi>ſame Hand,</hi> that implanted the notion of a God in the
minds of men; and if ſo, then the ſame hand that <hi>defaces</hi> the
notion of Gods Juſtice, muſt at the ſame time and for the ſame
reaſon <hi>eraſe</hi> the belief of his exiſtence out of the Souls of men:
and I doubt not if the <hi>Socinians</hi> had lived in thoſe days, by this
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40896:30"/>
Hypotheſis of theirs, they would have been extreamly ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to <hi>Theodorus, Diagoras, Democritus,</hi> and <hi>Epicurus,</hi> in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
they were engaged in, of rooting the belief of a God and
Religion out of the world; for they might have told men
not only with great plauſibility but truth (if this opinion were
true) that all thoſe <hi>accuſations of Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>anxieties of Mind,</hi>
which were occaſioned by the belief and dread of divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
were the effect only of <hi>fancy and deluſion,</hi> and did owe
their Original not to a divine <hi>Impreſs,</hi> but to the <hi>Craft and
Contrivance</hi> of Prieſts and Polititians, who inſtilled into the
minds of weak and unwary men, the vain fears of inviſible
powers; repreſenting them armed with Thunder and with the
Sword of Juſtice in their hands, whereas really there was no
ſuch thing; But all this they did to keep the world in awe,
and thereby to compaſs the deſigns of their <hi>intereſt and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What further deſign <hi>Socinus</hi> himſelf might have, or whether
he had any other deſign by advancing this Opinion, than the
overturning that great Article of our faith concerning the
ſatisfaction of Chriſt, I ſhall not poſitively determine. Only
this I cannot but acquaint the Reader with, which hath bin
long ſince obſerved likewiſe by others, that <hi>Socinus</hi> and his
followers in all their books and diſputations, have made it
their buſineſs chiefly to cavil and make exceptions to their
adverſaries, not careing what became of Religion, ſo that they
might with any colour avoid the Arguments with which they
were preſſed, as is in ſome meaſure made evident by ſeveral
paſſages which we have quoted out of their writings in the
foregoing diſcourſe. And I have this further to add, that as
<hi>Socinus,</hi> by denying the <hi>divinity and ſatisfaction of Chriſt,</hi> hath
plainly overturned the foundation upon which the Chriſtian
Church and Religion have bin built: ſo by this aſſertion about
Gods juſtice, and by ſeveral others diſperſed and ſlily inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated
through his writings, he hath given a ſhrewd blow to
all Religion whatſoever, whether natural, or revealed; ſo that
an unwary Reader, by peruſing his writings, may find himſelf
an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> before he well perceives how he comes to be ſo:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40896:30"/>
as he ſaith in another caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> his opinion againſt Hell Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that he had ſo contrived the matter, <hi>ut lector prius ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiat
doctrinam iſtam ſibi jam perſuaſam eſſe, quam ſuaderi animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertat</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Epiſt. 6. ad Volkel.</note>.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhould come to a conluſion of this diſcourſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Gods Juſtice, (which I have ſpun out to a greater length
then I at firſt intended;) But that I foreſee an objection will be
made againſt all that I have ſaid, by the <hi>Socinians</hi> and their
friends; who will be apt to ſay, that I have bin taking a
great deal of pains to no purpoſe, to aggravate the miſchiefs
of an Opinion, which admit it were falſe in ſpeculation, yet
as it is ſtated by them can in <hi>point of fact and practice,</hi> carry no
inconvenience imaginable along with it.</p>
            <p>For whatever God may do when left to his own liberty,
yet he hath thought fit to oblige himſelf by poſitive promiſes
and threatnings to reward the righteous and to puniſh the
wicked: ſo that now by the revelation of his will he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
abridged himſelf of his natural liberty, but hath thereby
taken effectual care to ſecure his own honour, and to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
Religion in the world, and all this is plainly acknowledged
by the <hi>Socinians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, 1<hi>ſt.</hi> that this doth not take off the falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
and Impiety of this <hi>Socinian</hi> opinion, which I was obliged
to diſcover; any more than if a man ſhould ſay, that God
hath indeed <hi>reſolved</hi> to act <hi>wiſely and righteouſly</hi> in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the World; but that neither <hi>wiſdom nor righteouſneſs
are neceſſary and eſſential Attributes</hi> perpetually reſiding in him,
but are only the effects of his free will: which were a moſt
irreligious and profane aſſertion, notwithſtanding the former
acknowledgment.</p>
            <p>2. Tho the <hi>Socinians</hi> hereby take care of revealed, yet they
overturn all natural Religion, as we ſhewed before, where
God hath made no ſuch Revelation of his will, or diſcovery
of his intentions how he doth deſign to deal with men;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40896:31"/>

1. 4. which exceed not only our <hi>deſerts,</hi> but our <hi>hopes:</hi> But
what abſolute aſſurance have we that they ſhall be made good
to us. They are only the effects as <hi>Socinus</hi> tells us <hi>Liberae,</hi>
or as <hi>Vorſtius</hi> explains it, <hi>vertibilis voluntatis,</hi> not only of a <hi>free,</hi>
(for therein we agree with them,) but of a mutable will: for
according to them, as was ſhewed before, God is <hi>liable to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations,</hi>
and may <hi>change</hi> his purpoſe as he doth the weather,
<hi>ſicut poteſt pluere vel non pluere:</hi> and tho the Morning proves never
ſo fair, yet the Heavens may be overcaſt; and the Sun that
roſe ſo gloriouſly, may ſet in a Cloud.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, if we believe the <hi>Socinians,</hi> the promiſes of God
conſidered barely in themſelves are not a ſufficient Baſis for a
Chriſtians hope and ſecurity; foraſmuch as God being<note n="2" place="bottom">Voluntas Dei eſt principium cujuſdam mutabilitatis in Deo, <hi>Vorſt. Diſp. p.</hi> 212.</note> 
               <hi>mutable
in his nature,</hi> he may <hi>repent</hi> of what he promiſed, and <hi>change
and alter</hi> his Reſolution. And that the Reader may not think
that I have wronged the <hi>Socinians</hi> in laying this to their charge,
I muſt refer him to a Treatiſe writ by <hi>Crellius, de Cauſis Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
Chriſti;</hi> where he will find this that I have affirmed of them
abundantly made good. For there he tells us that the true
reaſon of Chriſts dying for us, was that thereby he might be
a <hi>Mediator,</hi> and ſurety of the <hi>Covenant</hi> which God hath made
with men; for tho God had given men the promiſe of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of their ſins, yet that promiſe was no <hi>ſufficient ſecurity,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he might have receded or ſtarted from it: Therefore to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40896:31"/>
fix him as it were to his word, Chriſt was ſent as a ſponſor
and ſurety of the New Teſtament, which, in the name of his
Father, he did confirm and ratify, by ſealing it with his
Blood; whereupon now God is <hi>obliged</hi> to make good his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
ſo that if he had a mind to revoke it he cannot, the Death
of Chriſt <hi>compelling</hi> him to preſerve it<note n="1" place="bottom">Vis atque efficacia mortis Chriſti ad remiſſionem peccatorum comparandam tanta eſt, ut etiam Deum, ſi forte eum promiſſionis ſuae de remiſſione peccatorum, &amp; libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratione ab interitu nobis concedenda poeniteret (utimur phraſi ſacris literis uſitatâ) movere atque impellere poſſit, ne promiſſum ſuum reſcinderet, ſed quod pollicitus eſſet, reipſa praestaret <hi>Crell. de Cauſis Mortis Chriſti. p.</hi> 613.</note>.</p>
            <p>Indeed he could not but be ſenſible, that what he had thus
delivered, would ſound harſhly in the Ears of moſt Readers,
thoſe eſpecially who had any concern for the Honour of their
Maker, which by this ſuppoſition was ſo highly and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
invaded: therefore to mollify this matter he tells us,
that the efficacy which he aſcribes to Chriſts Death, was not
abſolutely neceſſary in reſpect of God; whoſe own Love,
Grace and Mercy, might <hi>move and encline him</hi> to make good
his promiſe; yet however this put him under no <hi>obligation;</hi>
for if it had, there had bin no need of the <hi>death of Chriſt,</hi>
either in <hi>reſpect of God, or our ſelves,</hi> either to have tyed him to
the performance, or to have afforded us ſecurity.</p>
            <p>Therefore he tells us<note n="2" place="bottom">Nam ut nos tanto cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius credere poſſemus, nobis in Chriſtum credentibus peccata remiſſum iri, plurimum referebat Deum ad id faciendum <hi>obligatum</hi> eſſe, &amp; nos jus ad illud obtinendum ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere; jus inquam manifeſtiſſimis ac certiſſimis documentis nixum, quod jam quicquid tandem interveniret, Deum non pateretur promiſſa ſua reſcindere, <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note>, that we might have a firm bottom
for our hope, that if we believed in Chriſt, that is, obeyed
his Goſpel, our ſins ſhould be forgiven us; it highly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us that God ſhould be <hi>obliged</hi> to perform what he had
promiſed; and not only ſo, but that we might acquire a <hi>Right</hi>
to pardon; which right he founds not in the <hi>promiſe of God</hi>
but the Death of Chriſt, which he ſaith gives us ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Title to Mercy, and that ſupported by ſuch a firm
and manifeſt aſſurance and proof, as will not ſuffer God what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
may happen, to <hi>break his word,</hi> and <hi>recall his promiſe.</hi>
               <note n="3" place="bottom">Hic revera finis ac ſcopus fuit, cur Deus Morte Christi ſe nobis <hi>obligare</hi> voluerit, ut porro ad Chriſtum morti tradendum impulſus fuerit, <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note> And
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40896:32"/>
this he tells us was the true reaſon of Chriſts coming into
the world, and of Gods delivering him up to death for our
ſakes.</p>
            <p>By all which it is evident, that in the opinion of this man,
the <hi>promiſes</hi> of God conſidered nakedly in themſelves, do
not afford us a <hi>ſufficient ſecurity;</hi> foraſmuch as ſomething may
intervene, which may cauſe God to <hi>repent</hi> of what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
and thereby hinder the performance: and that you may
not think that he had <hi>forgot himſelf,</hi> by making an <hi>impious or
impoſſible ſuppoſition,</hi> he tells us, <hi>utimur phraſi ſacris literis uſitata;</hi>
that he uſed a phraſe which was frequently made uſe of in
the Scripture it ſelf, which often mentions Gods ſorrow and
repentance, and therefore it can be no diſparagement to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God to aſcribe it to him, it being rather in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
an argument of his wiſdom, as was ſhewed before.</p>
            <p>I muſt indeed acknowledge that this very Author at another
time, <hi>Lib. De Deo. Cap. 25. de Sanctitate Dei. p.</hi> 241. affirms that
the promiſes of God put him under an obligation, and that
both his veracity and faithfulneſs engage him to make them
good. But it is as evident on the other hand, that here he
<hi>ſuppoſes the contrary,</hi> and that his Argument proceeds upon that
<hi>ſuppoſition.</hi> But by this time I hope the Reader will not be
much ſurpriſed to find Socinians <hi>contradicting themſelves,</hi> and he
need not be concerned at it; for I can aſſure him, whether
he will or no, they will take the liberty of ſo doing. And
hereby we find the obſervation which we a little before made
concerning them, confirmed; <hi>viz.</hi> that in their diſputations
and writings they care not what they ſay, having no regard
to the honour of God or Religion; being only concerned for
their own reputation, and to defend and maintain their own <hi>looſe
and unwarrantable Opinions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2<hi>ly,</hi> But let us admit that God by his <hi>promiſes</hi> puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
under an obligation to men, ſo that he cannot go from
his word, but is obliged to make it good; yet he may be at
<hi>greater liberty</hi> as to his <hi>threatnings.</hi> Indeed theſe, as the Goſpel
repreſents them to us, are very terrible, whether we conſider
the puniſhments threatned either as to their <hi>Intenſive pain,</hi> or
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40896:32"/>
as to the <hi>extent of their duration;</hi> for we are told that <hi>the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſhall go into everlaſting puniſhment; that the worm that gnaws
their Conſcience ſhall not dye, and the fire that torments them ſhall
never be extinguiſhed.</hi> This is indeed enough to make the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
look pale, and to fright him either out <hi>of his wits,</hi> or out
of his <hi>wicked courſe of living.</hi> But for all this he need not deſpair
of Mercy; for tho God hath <hi>threatned ſeverely,</hi> yet no man
living can abſolutely tell us, if we believe <hi>Socinus,</hi> whether he
is reſolved to <hi>execute his threatnings. For as at firſt God might
either not have puniſhed the Sinner at all, or not with eternal death,
ſo now tho he hath declared by his ſolemn Edict that he will do ſo,
yet for all that he may if he pleaſes not inflict the puniſhment.</hi>
Deus potuiſſet, idque jure, homines licet peccantes morti aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae
non mancipare, ſic poſtquam eos morti aeternae edicto ſuo
mancipavit, ex illius imperio eximere poteſt. <hi>Socin. de Chriſto
Serv. Lib. 1. p.</hi> 124.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eximere poteſt,</hi> ſaith Socinus, <hi>he may exempt the Sinner</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
his <hi>Decree</hi> of puniſhing him; and why may not he
hope that <hi>he will:</hi> the <hi>bare threatnings,</hi> according to <hi>Socinus,</hi> do
not <hi>oblige</hi> God to execute them: and the conſideration of Gods
Mercy and Juſtice, to which the Torments of Hell, as he may
imagine, can ſcarce be reconciled, may upon that ſcore afford
him ſome ground <hi>to hope</hi> that he doth not <hi>deſign to do ſo.</hi> We
know ſinners are apt to allow themſelves, as too great liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in ſinning, ſo to flatter themſelves with too great hopes of
Impunity; and if they meet with any ſuch compaſſionate Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſts
as <hi>Socinus,</hi> who will afford them any encouragement, they
are preſently apt to run away with it, and never look back,
to ſee that <hi>vengeance</hi> which purſues, and will at length certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
overtake them.</p>
            <p>But how comes this man to know any thing of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
what he hath revealed of himſelf in his word? muſt we
have recourſe to that exploded diſtinction of the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and
for which they have bin ſo much railed at by their adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
concerning the <hi>revealed, and the ſecret will of God?</hi> For tho
the queſtion in the caſe may ſeem to be about the <hi>power</hi> of
God, yet really and in truth it is about <hi>his will;</hi> foraſmuch
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40896:33"/>
as God <hi>cannot do</hi> what he hath ſolemnly declared he <hi>will not
do;</hi> and that for this <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>irrefragable reaſon,</hi> becauſe God
cannot deny himſelf.</p>
            <p>And now have we not reaſon to put the queſtion, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
whither went the Spirit of God from the <hi>Inſpired writers,</hi>
to reſt upon the head of this <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> who makes his <hi>excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
to what they have declared as the <hi>peremtory and unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
decree of God?</hi> Nay who boldly ventures to affirm that,
which <hi>Balaam</hi> could not be <hi>hired</hi> to utter, tho <hi>tempted to it by
the wages of unrighteouſneſs;</hi> but makes that pious acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>Numb. 23. God is not a man that he ſhould lie, nor the ſon of
man, that he ſhould repent: hath he ſaid, and ſhall he not do it?
hath he ſpoken, and ſhall he not make it good?</hi> Now if it be <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for God to lie,</hi> then it is not poſſible for him to alter
the ſentence concerning the final ſtate of men; which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in Scripture in ſuch terms, as plainly evince it to be
his <hi>peremptory and irrevocable decree:</hi> The happineſs of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
and the puniſhments of the wicked, as to the <hi>extent of their
duration,</hi> being expreſſed in the ſame words, and in the ſame
ſentence: and if it be poſſible to know any thing of the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute</hi>
and <hi>Immutable pleaſure</hi> of God; the <hi>wit</hi> of man could not
contrive any plainer words, then what the <hi>wiſdom of God</hi> hath
already made uſe of, to declare his final and unalterable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
concerning the everlaſting puniſhment of the wicked.</p>
            <p>Beſides it deſerves to be conſidered, that this Declaration is
not only delivered in the manner of a <hi>threatning,</hi> but likewiſe
by way of <hi>prediction,</hi> in the fulfilling of which, the veracity of
God may ſeem to be more particularly concerned, than in the
execution of a bare Threatning delivered in a Sermon, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,
or the like. Now in thoſe <hi>glorious viſions</hi> which were
communicated to St. <hi>John</hi> which he ſtiles <hi>the word of God, the
Teſtimony and Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, concerning the things which
were, and which ſhould be hereafter,</hi> Rev. 1. v. 1, 2, 19. which are
ſtyled the <hi>true ſayings of God,</hi> chap. 19. v. 9. <hi>the words that are
faithful and true</hi> ch. 21. v. 5. I ſay in theſe viſions are contained,
as the ſtate and events of the Church till the final diſſolution of all
things; ſo likewiſe the condition and fate of the Righteous and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40896:33"/>
Wicked, after the judgment of the laſt day. <hi>Ch.</hi> 20. 21. he tells
us that he <hi>ſaw the dead, both ſmall and great, ſtand before God,
and they were all judged according to their works, and whoever was
not found written in the Book of Life, was caſt into the Lake of
fire,</hi> ver. 15. called ver. 10. <hi>the lake of fire and brimſtone, where the
Devil, and the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet ſhall be tormented day
and night for ever and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what is ſaid in general of the wicked, we are aſſured
ſhall betide the <hi>fearful, and unbelievers, and the abominable and
murderers, and ſorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, who ſhall have
their part in that lake, which burneth with fire and brimſtone,</hi> Rev.
21. 8. this is that Furnace of fire which our bleſſed Saviour ſo
often mentioneth, Mat. 13. 42. 50. <hi>that everlaſting fire prepared
for the devil and his Angels,</hi> Mat. 25. 41. <hi>That fire,</hi> which again
and again he aſſures us Mark. 9. <hi>ſhall not be quenched,</hi> no leſs
then five times within the compaſs of ſix <hi>verſes,</hi> 43, 44, 45, 46,
47, 48. to declare unto us by this Repetition, the certainty of
this thing, as in the caſe of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Dream, which was doubled
to aſſure him that the <hi>thing was eſtabliſhed by God.</hi> Gen. 41. 32.</p>
            <p>The wit of man could not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ind out words more full and
ſignificant, to expreſs the <hi>eternal duration</hi> of theſe puniſhments,
and Gods <hi>unalterable purpoſe</hi> to inflict them. Now to ſay, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all this, that yet in the concluſion, things may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to be otherwiſe then what the <hi>Son of God</hi> hath declared,
and this <hi>ſervant of God</hi> hath foretold, is with great boldneſs
to contradict them both: and if it be <hi>poſſible</hi> that theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
may not be accompliſhed, then the words are not
<hi>faithful and true,</hi> that is, are not undoubtedly and abſolutely
true: ſo that at the ſame time, that <hi>Socinus</hi> puts an end to the
<hi>certainty</hi> of Hell Torments, he doth likewiſe put an end to
the <hi>certainty</hi> of the writings of the New Teſtament, and the
<hi>predictions</hi> that are contained there: which is highly deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
to the Authority of thoſe ſacred Writings, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
of the Revelation of St. <hi>Sohn;</hi> which looks too much like
the <hi>taking away from the words of the Prophecy of that Book;</hi>
which yet I hope it is not, becauſe of that dreadful puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which attends thoſe that do ſo, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 19. In ſhort, if
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40896:34"/>
things <hi>may happen</hi> otherwiſe than St. <hi>John</hi> foreſaw and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told,
ſome Scepticks and Infidels, which the age we live in
doth too much abound with, may be apt to account that a
<hi>dream,</hi> which he calls a <hi>viſion;</hi> and to think, the holy man was
was <hi>ſcarce awake</hi> when he pretended to <hi>foreſee</hi> theſe things.</p>
            <p>Neither ought the caſe of <hi>Temporal threatnings</hi> be objected
here in favour of <hi>Socinus</hi>'s aſſertion: foraſmuch as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
hath told us, that in all ſuch <hi>Threatnings,</hi> a condition is
to be <hi>ſuppoſed,</hi> tho it be not alwaies <hi>expreſſed;</hi> ſo that tho they
are delivered in terms <hi>ſeemingly abſolute,</hi> yet God without any
impeachment of his <hi>veracity,</hi> may upon the performance of the
condition <hi>revoke them. At what inſtant,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>I ſhall ſpeak
concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom, to pluck up, and
to pull down, and to deſtroy it: if that Nation againſt whom I have
pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil, that I
thought to do unto them,</hi> Jer. 18. 7. 8. and this was the caſe of
<hi>Niniveh,</hi> where tho the threatning was ſeemingly peremtory,
yet the execution was ſuſpended upon their <hi>Repentance,</hi> which
was the <hi>end</hi> of the threatning.</p>
            <p>But as to the puniſhments of the life to come, the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of them muſt be <hi>abſolute and unconditional,</hi> foraſmuch as
there can then be no room for <hi>Repentance and amendment:</hi>
every mans ſtate will then be finally determined: <hi>he that is
filthy will be filthy ſtill,</hi> without any poſſibility of change, or
hope of pardon: and this is that which fills up the meaſure
of the puniſhment of the damned: he that ſinned without the
<hi>fear of God</hi> in this life, ſhall be puniſhed <hi>without Mercy</hi> in the
next; and this deſpair will be that worm which will feed
upon him to all eternity, which ſhall ever torment, but never
devour the ſinner, who will then become a terror to himſelf
and an everlaſting amazement.</p>
            <p>In ſhort therefore, and to ſumm up all that remains to be ſaid
upon this ſubject; he that goes about to <hi>weaken the force</hi> of
thoſe declarations which God hath made concerning the <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
puniſhment</hi> of the wicked, gives a <hi>dangerous blow</hi> to all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
Religion, of which we can have no <hi>certainty,</hi> if once
we undermine the <hi>veracity of God,</hi> which is the <hi>foundation</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40896:34"/>
which it is built, and by which it is ſupported. But you
will ſay the hopes which <hi>Socinus</hi> gives the ſinner are but very
ſlender, and thoſe remote ones, which no man in point of
prudence or ſafety ſhould venture to rely upon. I confeſs I
think ſo too: but for all this ſinners will be bold and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumtuous:
and you cannot wonder that men ſhould graſp at
any thing; lay hold upon any the <hi>weakeſt twig,</hi> rather than
<hi>ſink</hi> into Hell. But if this be not enough, <hi>Socinus</hi> can give the
ſinner more poſitive and direct encouragement; ſuch as will
not only put and end to the <hi>Torments of Hell,</hi> but likewiſe to
his own <hi>vain and ſuperſtitious fears</hi> concerning them, and will
<hi>extinguiſh</hi> thoſe flames, which our bleſſed Saviour (who one
would think ſhould beſt know) hath aſſured us are <hi>unquenchable:</hi>
But of this more hereafter.</p>
            <p>Now if what hath bin hitherto ſaid is not ſufficient to ſhew
the <hi>impiety and deteſtableneſs</hi> of theſe <hi>Socinian</hi> notions, he that
will be at the pains to peruſe their writings, or will but have
the patience to read what is here tranſcribed out of them,
will find (if it were poſſible) yet greater abominations than
theſe: particularly in the account which they give of thoſe <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi>
and <hi>paſſions</hi> which they aſcribe to God, and with which
indeed the Scriptures repreſent him to us, but in a quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
ſenſe than they are underſtood and interpreted by the
<hi>Socinians;</hi> who give us ſuch a deſcription of Almighty God
as is <hi>repugnant to piety,</hi> and to the <hi>general ſentiments,</hi> not only
of all ſound Chriſtians, but even of Jews, and many ſober hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
who have had <hi>truer</hi> and <hi>more honourable</hi> conceptions of
the nature of God, than theſe men furniſh us with; who
cloath him with all the <hi>paſſions and weakneſſes of men,</hi> aſcribing
to him <hi>love and hatred, mercy and compaſſion, hope and deſire, joy
and ſorrow, fear and repentance,</hi> which they make to be <hi>truely and
properly</hi> in God, tho not exactly in the ſame manner as they
are in men, no more than they are in other created ſpirits,
or the Soul of man it ſelf in its ſtate of ſeparation from the
Body: that is, they are there, but without any motion, or <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
alteration</hi> of the <hi>Blood and Spirits,</hi> ſuch as is to be found
in men. But our Religion and right reaſon will inform us,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40896:35"/>
that theſe things are attributed to God, but it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
in a figurative ſenſe, repreſenting thereby to us the <hi>various
adminiſtrations</hi> of Gods providence towards divers objects, who
as they are endued with <hi>different qualities and diſpoſitions,</hi> ſo
God is pleaſed to exerciſe <hi>different actions</hi> towards them; which
<hi>actions</hi> in men indeed ariſe from <hi>different principles and paſſions,</hi>
but do not ſo in God, who amidſt the variety of the actions
and diſpoſitions of men, and his dealings ſuitably to them,
yet in his eſſence <hi>continues ſtill the ſame, without any pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
or the leaſt ſhadows of change.</hi> And therefore Divines tell us,
and particularly <hi>Limburg,</hi> that theſe things are aſcribed to God<note n="1" place="bottom">Non cum relatione ad ipſum Deum, ſed in ordine ad ipſa objecta, quae extra deum ſunt, circa quae Deus operatur <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 10.</note>,
not with reſpect to God, but with a regard to thoſe objects
about which the acts of his providence are converſant, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that known maxime of the School-men, <hi>affectus in

in the ſame Section he <hi>overthrows</hi> what but juſt before he
aſſerted, and ſo interprets and explains himſelf, that a <hi>Socinian</hi>
cannot be diſpleaſed with his Opinion.</p>
            <p>For firſt he makes theſe affections to be acts, or as <hi>Crellius</hi>
calls them commotions of Gods will, which ſome have thought
could not be properly aſcribed to him, without overthrowing
the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> as well as <hi>immutability</hi> of his divine nature. But

and here I think they perfectly agree. But for once we will
make ſo bold as to ask theſe Gentlemen, whether when the
Scriptures attribute <hi>hands and feet, and eies and ears</hi> to God,
they think that there is ſomething in the nature of God that
is <hi>Analogous,</hi> and bears any <hi>reſemblanee</hi> to theſe parts of a
mans Body, without which they could not with any reaſon
be applyed to him.</p>
            <p>Tho I have reaſon not to be over confident of a <hi>Socinian,</hi>
yet in this caſe I will take it for granted, they would both

nothing to be ſuppoſed in God by way of reſemblance, but
an exceeding great and adorable condeſcention in him, who

of his, by ſuch parts, which are the <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of the like

            <p>So with the ſame truth, and for the ſame reaſon it ſhould
be averred, when <hi>human paſſions</hi> are aſcribed to God, it is not
by reaſon of any <hi>reſemblance</hi> that is between God and Men
in <hi>theſe affections;</hi> but by reaſon of that <hi>Analogy or ſimilitude</hi>
that is to be found between the <hi>operations of God,</hi> and theſe
<hi>actions</hi> of men; which <hi>in them</hi> ariſe from ſuch <hi>commotions</hi> of the
Soul which we call paſſions, but <hi>in God</hi> proceed from his <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and uncompounded nature,</hi> who is Infinite and unchangable,
and therefore as our Church in conformity to the Scriptures
hath taught us to believe, <hi>is without parts and without paſſions.

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Impiety</hi> of this opinion will further appear from a
conſideration of thoſe <hi>particular paſſions</hi> which the <hi>Socinians</hi>
affirm to be in God; which cannot truly be aſcribed to him,
without a great <hi>diſparagement</hi> to his Infinite and adorable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and thoſe are <hi>Fear and Grief:</hi> under which we muſt
comprehend ſorrow and repentance, which properly reſpect
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40896:36"/>
               <hi>things paſt,</hi> whereas <hi>grief and trouble</hi> which alwaies attend it
indifferently reſpect things either <hi>paſt or preſent.</hi> And theſe
are paſſions which neceſſarily infer a <hi>weakneſs in God,</hi> ſuch as
a <hi>Stoick</hi> would not allow in his wiſe and virtuous man.</p>
            <p>And firſt <hi>for fear, Crellius</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Sapientiae ipſius, quatenus circa creaturas verſatur in peccata pronas, effectum eſſe prope neceſſarium, <hi>Cap. 31. p.</hi> 324.</note> will tell us that tho at firſt view
this paſſion cannot without a ſeeming abſurdity be attributed
to God, yet he is <hi>truly lyable</hi> to it, and indeed it <hi>is the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
effect of his wiſdom, as it is converſant about creatures
prone and lyable to ſin.</hi> And this he proves from <hi>Deut. 22. 26,
27. I ſaid I would ſcatter them into corners, I would make the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of them to ceaſe among men, were it not that I feared
the wrath of the Enemy, leaſt their adverſaries ſhould ſay, our hand
is high, and the Lord hath not done all this.</hi> And then refers you
to two other places before mentioned, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.
where we have inſtances, as he tells us, of Gods altering his
purpoſe of deſtroying the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> out of this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple

ſhould <hi>miſconſtrue</hi> his actions, and for want of knowing
the true reaſons which moved him to <hi>this ſeverity,</hi> impute it
either to a <hi>malicious deſign,</hi> as if he had reſcued them out of
the hands, and delivered them from the <hi>Tyranny of Pharaoh,</hi>
that he might have <hi>the Glory of</hi> their overthrow in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs:
or elſe to his <hi>Impotence</hi> that he was not able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
their deliverance, and to bring them into the Land which
he had ſo often promiſed them. Now God to <hi>ſave his honour</hi>
which elſe might have ſuffered by this action, and to prevent
the <hi>upbraidings</hi> of his Enemies, which he was <hi>extreamly afraid
of,</hi> was prevailed upon by the <hi>Entreaties of Moſes,</hi> and the
<hi>reaſons</hi> which he offered, to ſpare thoſe, whom in his thoughts
he had <hi>ſolemnly devoted to deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He further refers his reader to ſeveral other places where God
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40896:36"/>
is ſaid to do ſomething which otherwiſe he was unwilling to do,
or to <hi>omit the doing</hi> of ſomething which before he was <hi>reſolved upon,</hi>
as <hi>Gen. 5. 22. Exod. 15. 17. 35. 3. &amp;c.</hi> out of <hi>a juſt fear</hi> of what
might happen: and this is ſo far from being with him an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of Imperfection, that he ſaith it is the reſult of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and a juſt caution, in foreſeeing ſome probable events, and
thus wiſely preventing them. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. For <hi>grief and trouble,</hi> theſe likewiſe by the ſame Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor
are to be aſcribed to God, that is, ſaith <hi>Crellius,</hi> foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as all Metaphors ariſe from <hi>ſimilitude,</hi> ſomething <hi>like theſe</hi>
muſt be found in him. And for proof of this he quotes all
thoſe places of Scripture, where God is ſaid <hi>to be provoked, to
be diſpleaſed and grieved, Pſ. 78. 40, 46. Pſ. 106. 33. Eſay. 3. 8.
2 Sam.</hi> 11. 27. and particularly that memorable place, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 1. 14.
where God is ſaid to hate the New Moons and Feaſts of the
Jews, <hi>they are a trouble to me</hi> ſaith God, <hi>I am weary to bear them.</hi>
Where he hath this remark <hi>Cap. 31. p. 319. theſe things are then
ſaid to be troubleſome to us, and which we cannot well bear</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Ea Demum molesta ſunt, &amp; in illis ſustinendis laboramus, quae dolorem aliquem nobis afferunt.</note>,
which bring <hi>uneaſineſs</hi> and a certain <hi>diſquiet</hi> along with them.
And to ſay and think this of God, is ſo far from tending to
his diſhonour, that the contrary conceit would overthrow all
Religion, foraſmuch as it would introduce an Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
God fit only for <hi>Stoicks</hi> and <hi>Epicureans</hi> to entertain
of him: <hi>quis enim,</hi> ſaith he, who can form ſuch a notion
of God, as of one that is not <hi>affected with pleaſure, nor ſenſible
of pain, niſi qui ad Epicureorum vel Stoicorum ſaltem ſententiam
de Deo accedere vult? Loc. citat.</hi> 321. a God enjoying pure and
unmixed pleaſure, <hi>perfect reſt</hi> and an <hi>uninterrupted tranquillity,</hi>
never <hi>diſturbed with paſſions,</hi> nor <hi>diſordered</hi> by any of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men, or the changes and revolutions that happen in
the world; this doctrine concerning him is fit not to be
preached in the Temples of Chriſtians, but to be publiſhed
in the Schools of <hi>Zeno and Epicurus.</hi> Indeed we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
to him for that <hi>liberal conceſſion,</hi> that this <hi>trouble and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40896:37"/>
grief</hi> which he ſuppoſes to be in God, doth not ariſe from
any <hi>Internal cauſes,</hi> ſuch as are the indiſpoſitions of Body or
mind which occaſion grief in men, and make them uneaſy:
but only from <hi>external motives and reaſons, viz.</hi> the actions of
his creatures<note n="1" place="bottom">Ex rebus extra deum exiſtentibus, quas in creaturarum arbitrio poſuit, <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 320.</note> So that what God cannot do himſelf, he hath
put it into the <hi>power of his Creatures to effect,</hi> and that if it were
not for the <hi>follies and impieties of men</hi> he would be <hi>entirely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
perfectly at reſt;</hi> all that <hi>grief and trouble</hi> which affects him,
is ſolely owing to the actions of his creatures, and not to
any diſorder of his own nature: A very pious acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!</p>
            <p>Laſtly, for that ſort of <hi>grief</hi> which reſpects things paſt,
which we call <hi>Repentance,</hi> this likewiſe is to be found in God:
and not that only which ſignifies the <hi>alteration of his Counſels,</hi>
or a change of his will, of which we have ſpoken before;
(which may indeed be called Repentance, but that ſaith <hi>Crel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
is <hi>dilutior Metaphora</hi>
               <note n="2" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 322.</note>:) but as it betokens the <hi>paſſion and
affection</hi> it ſelf. And for this he quotes <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 7. where it is
ſaid, that God repented that he made man, and that it griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him at the heart. This is <hi>affectio in deo ingrata, Ibid.</hi> an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
that brings <hi>moleſtation</hi> with it, ariſing in God when he
ſees that thoſe his actions which were ſo well deſigned by him,
by the folly and malice of men, are ſo far perverted, as to
produce effects ſo contrary to his <hi>Intentions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now againſt all this it would be very natural for men to
object, and the <hi>Socinian</hi> eaſily foreſaw it, That what is thus
aſſerted, muſt be quite contrary to the ſenſe of mankind, and
to thoſe notions which <hi>naturally ariſe</hi> in mens minds concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>perfections of Almighty God;</hi> for to ſuppoſe ſuch <hi>varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of commotions</hi> in the mind of God, and theſe ſometime
<hi>oppoſite</hi> to ane another, which cannot but occaſion in him <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation
and trouble;</hi> which muſt be further increaſed, when he
finds his <hi>deſigns baffled,</hi> his <hi>Councils overthrown,</hi> his authority de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed;
which obliges him oftentimes to <hi>change</hi> his own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40896:37"/>
and <hi>revoke</hi> his decrees: one would think that all this
ſhould really be not only a <hi>derogation</hi> to his <hi>Infinite perfections,</hi>
but likewiſe a <hi>diminution</hi> of his <hi>happyneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1<hi>ſt.</hi> As to what concerns the <hi>perfections of God, Crellius</hi> will
tell you, that nothing of all this that is aſſerted of the nature
of God is an Argument of <hi>Imperfection.</hi> It is true, he hath not
the ſame notions of the perfections of God as you have. You
may perhaps think him Infinite, but that is a weakneſs in you
to think ſo: he is <hi>finite</hi> in his <hi>being,</hi> and conſequently muſt be
ſo in his <hi>Operations:</hi> he is <hi>limited</hi> in his preſence to certain
ſpaces: his knowledge hath its <hi>juſt bounds;</hi> he is mutable and
lyable to change: he is <hi>extended</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for that reaſon muſt be
made up of parts; in him you may find <hi>a compoſition</hi> of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
and accidents, and theſe oftentimes contrary to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother:
he is cloathed with paſſions, which have ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
to thoſe <hi>weakneſſes of our nature,</hi> that from a<note n="1" place="bottom">Ex affectuum humanorum natura, à quibus ipſe Dei ſpiritus ob Analogiam, ac ſimilitudinem voces ad Deum transfert, aeſtimanda nobis erit natura illorum vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatis Dei actuum. <hi>Cap. 29. de Affect. Dei. p.</hi> 297.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of humane paſſions, we muſt make a judgement and
frame our apprehenſions of thoſe motions which are to be
found in God.</p>
            <p>And theſe <hi>motions</hi> in God are ſometimes more <hi>calme,</hi> at other
times more <hi>violent and impetuous,</hi> the Impieties of men provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to that degree that he is earneſtly bent upon their
deſtruction, but afterwards calmed by their prayers: now <hi>angry</hi>
at men for their Sins, by and by <hi>appeaſed</hi> by their Repentance.
Sometimes you will find him doing a thing, by and by <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting</hi>
the doing of it; one while <hi>reſolved</hi> upon one action,
and anon reſolving the <hi>quite contrary:</hi> and all this to be found
truly and formally in God, and not in that figurative ſenſe
in which the Scriptures aſcribe them to him. For ſaith the
ſame Author, ſeparate all impurity from thoſe paſſions, all
<hi>corporeal mixture,</hi> nay it muſt be <hi>concretio terreni corporis,</hi> the
mixture of a terreſtrial body, that you may not miſtake him:
for there is a <hi>ſpiritual Body,</hi> and <hi>Coeleſtial matter</hi> which may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40896:38"/>
to God himſelf: in ſhort exclude all Impotence and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
from theſe affections, (and indeed it muſt be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
nice and Metaphyſical abſtraction that is able to do it) and
then whatever remains in the <hi>true notion</hi> and <hi>formal conception</hi>
of theſe paſſions, are ſtill to be ſuppoſed and muſt be left
there, when applyed to God himſelf. <hi>Sejungenda quaecunque Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectionem
aut Imbecillitatem reſipiunt, caetera, quae in natura cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntur
affectuum illorum, quorum nomina deo tribuuntur, eſſe relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenda.</hi>
Ibid.</p>
            <p>But however tho this ſhould prove no <hi>Imperfection,</hi> yet the
<hi>uneaſineſs and diſquiet,</hi> that is the inſeparable attendant on grief,
and fear, and ſorrow, thoſe <hi>tormenting paſſions,</hi> muſt, one would
think, <hi>interrupt that tranquillity</hi> which we ſuppoſe God to be
poſſeſt of, and conſequently be an <hi>abatement of his happineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which he anſwers firſt in general,<note n="1" place="bottom">Ut jucundum quendam rerum malarum ſenſum ei tribuere non liceat. <hi>Idem Cap. 31. p.</hi> 321.</note> that as we ought not
indeed to urge any expreſſions in Scripture, ſo far as to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the <hi>happyneſs of God;</hi> ſo neither on the other hand ought
we to urge the <hi>belief of his happyneſs,</hi> ſo as to affirm him not
to have a true ſenſe of evil, mixt with <hi>uneaſineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But more particularly, you muſt conſider in this caſe that
tho men by their Sins<note n="2" place="bottom">Ea quae voluntati divinae adverſa ſunt, illius beatitudinem non evertunt aut laedunt. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note> may <hi>grieve</hi> God, yet they cannot <hi>hurt
him:</hi> tho they may diſturb, yet they cannot deprive him, of
any of his eſſential perfections. That is ſomething, but not
enough; for among men we are apt to account it an <hi>unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyneſs</hi>
to be robbed of our eaſe and quiet, tho they that do
ſo ſhould not have it in their power to deprive us of any
thing elſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore 2<hi>ly,</hi> tho there are ſome things of that force as to
be able to create <hi>dolorem &amp; moleſtiam, grief and moleſtation to God;</hi>
yet the number of thoſe other things which afforde him ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
and pleaſure, do ſo far exceed and overballance them<note n="3" place="bottom">Ut vim ingratarum rerum &amp; molestiam quam parere poſſunt, aut tollant, aut imminuunt, <hi>p.</hi> 321.</note>,
that they do much <hi>abate</hi> the trouble and uneaſineſs that is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40896:38"/>
by them: a Bleſſed Apology for the <hi>perfections and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyneſs</hi>
of Allmighty God!</p>
            <p>And thus much ſhall ſerve to be ſaid upon the firſt head,
concerning the nature of God conſidered abſolutely in himſelf,
and his divine attributes; by which we may ſee the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
between what the <hi>Scriptures</hi> ſay, and what the <hi>Socinians</hi>
affirme of him: and I doubt not but the pious Reader, will
not only be <hi>offended,</hi> but ſtruck with a <hi>juſt horror and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
at the boldneſs and impiety of theſe blaſphemers, who are
thus injurious to their maker, and think and ſpeak thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourably
of him. But how little regard, and how mean ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
their <hi>conceptions</hi> be of God, yet they have a <hi>good opinion</hi>
of themſelves; in that they make not only their <hi>reaſon</hi> to be
the <hi>adequate Judge</hi> of his revelations, but even their own <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and weakneſs, the rule</hi> by which they meaſure, at leaſt make
an eſtimate of his <hi>infinite nature</hi> and moſt <hi>adorable perfections;</hi>
an attempt, beſides the impiety of it, more ridiculous, then if
a man ſhould endeavour to take the dimenſions of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
with a ſingle ſpan, or to fathome the depth and reach the
bottome of the Ocean with his little finger.</p>
            <p>In the next place we muſt conſider God <hi>Relatively</hi> in the
great myſtery of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> And that which the Scriptures
teach us to believe of this matter, is briefly ſummed up in
the firſt Article of our Religion eſtabliſhed in this Church
concerning faith in the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> in theſe words; <hi>In the
unity of the Godhead there be three perſons, of one ſubſtance, Power
and Eternity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Or as it is with
ſome alteration of words, but to the ſame purpoſe expreſſed,
in the Doxology to be repeated upon Trinity Sunday; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we are taught to make this acknowledgement of Almighty
God, <hi>That he is one God, one Lord, not one only perſon, but three
perſons in one ſubſtance; for that which we believe of the Glory of
the Father, the ſame we believe of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt,
without any difference or inequality.</hi> A brief but <hi>comprehenſive</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
of what is more largely declared and explained, in the
Creed, which the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> have ſo great a
ſpight againſt, commonly called the <hi>Athanaſian Creed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:40896:39"/>
This is the Faith of all the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> being herein
Agreeable to the doctrine held by the Church of God in all
Ages, ever ſince the firſt planting of Chriſtianity in the world;
what we and they believe of this matter, being conformable
to the plain and expreſs declarations of Scripture, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of what Chriſt and his Apoſtles have delivered to us
concerning this matter, in the writings of the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi>
For this you may conſult the <hi>Harmony of their Confeſſions;</hi> both
<hi>Lutheran and Calviniſt</hi> all exactly agreeing in this doctrine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any the leaſt difference or variety: where you may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſee the conſent of the Catholick Church from the firſt
Ages next to that of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> from whoſe inſpired <hi>writings</hi>
the Fathers received this Doctrine, which by an <hi>uninterrupted
Tradition,</hi> thro all the ſucceſſive Ages of the Church, hath bin
delivered and brought down to the times we live in: In this
Faith we have all bin <hi>baptized,</hi> being at our firſt admiſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Chriſtian Church, ſolemnly <hi>conſecrated</hi> to the worſhip
and ſervice of thoſe three ever bleſſed and glorious perſons,
<hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt Mat.</hi> 28. Theſe being the three that
bear witneſs in Heaven, and theſe three are one, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
            <p>For that Text we ſhall not eaſily part with, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Cavils of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and the <hi>over officious endeavours</hi>
of ſome others, whether <hi>Papiſts or Proteſtants,</hi> who would
weaken the Authority of that Teſtimony, and thereby rob us
of the advantage of it. For tho ſome Greek MSS. want it,
yet there are others more approved and of greater antiquity
in which you may meet with it. Beſides it is to be found
in the writings of the Ancients, <hi>Tertull. Cypr. Athanaſius,</hi> and
<hi>Jerome</hi> who quote theſe very words: and if you have a mind
to know more of this matter, without going any further,
you may peruſe what Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> in his <hi>Synopſis</hi> hath quoted out
of <hi>Gerhard,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hamond</hi> and other Writers in vindication of
this Text.</p>
            <p>From which, I think, it will appear, that the <hi>Authority</hi> of this
place remains clear and in full force, notwithſtanding the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
that have bin made to overthrow it. Tho if we gave
up this Text, yet we ſhould not the holy Doctrine contained
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40896:39"/>
in it, which is ſo plainly delivered in other places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and ſhines there with ſo <hi>bright a luſtre,</hi> that a man had
need wink hard, who would avoid the conviction; or elſe muſt
have ſo great a confidence in his Eyes, that he may hope in
time to ſtare the Sun it ſelf out of countenance.</p>
            <p>For as in ſome places of Scripture he will find the <hi>unity
of the Godhead</hi> aſſerted; ſo in others he will find the name, and
not only ſo, but to avoid any Cavils and exceptions that may
be made about the ambiguous ſignification of that word: he
will find the <hi>ſame divine Attributes, and Operations,</hi> on all hands
acknowledged to belong to God the Father, aſcribed likewiſe
to the Son and the Holy Ghoſt; who yet are allwaies men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
as diſtinct from one another: from whence by an eaſie
and a <hi>neceſſary deduction,</hi> it muſt unavoidably follow, that ſince
they are <hi>really diſtinguiſhed</hi> from each other, and yet agree in
the ſame <hi>common nature,</hi> as the <hi>ſame properties</hi> and the ſame
<hi>operations</hi> irrefragably evince; they muſt be, what we have bin
taught hitherto to believe and profeſs of them, in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the Church, three Perſons and one God. And as
we pretend to agree in the ſame doctrine with the Ancient
Church, ſo I think it is highly fitting, and for many juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in a manner neceſſary, to preſerve the ſame words in
which it hath bin delivered down to us, in oppoſition to any
new modes of ſpeaking. For the Ancient words by <hi>preſcription</hi>
and long uſe, have obtained both a <hi>juſt Authority</hi> among
Chriſtians, and a <hi>ſetled and determinate ſignification:</hi> whereas new
phraſes may be liable to great exceptions, and introductive at
long run of new and unwarrantable opinions about theſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries;
beyond the intention of them who firſt made uſe of
them.</p>
            <p>Now againſt all this the <hi>Socinians</hi> will tell you, that this
doctrine concerning the Trinity is ſo far from being a <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
truth,</hi> that it is indeed the <hi>foundation</hi> of all the errors
that have crept into the Chriſtian Church; as being oppoſite
to the Scriptures, and plainly repugnant to reaſon: it is a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
doctrine,</hi> ſo ſaith <hi>Socinus</hi> Lib. <hi>quod Regm Polon.</hi> &amp;c. cap. 4. ſo

Inſt. Rel. Chriſtianae Cap. 4. that is, ſure it could never
have entred into any mans head, that ever had any brains
there. Nay it is not only a very fooliſh, but a very dangerous
error, that puts a ſtumbling block, and rub in mens way to
Heaven. Strange that that doctrine ſhould be thought an hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance

            <p>And indeed it is no wonder it ſhould hinder men from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of the Trinity is not an Error that is owing to the
ignorance and miſtakes of Men, but to the deluſion of the
Devil<note n="1" place="bottom">Volkel. de Vera Relig. Lib. 5. Cap. 9.</note>. That it is a blaſphemous Doctrine as another of them

for the <hi>operations</hi> that proceed from that virtue and faculty<note n="3" place="bottom">Vid Smal. Refut. Lib. de Incarn. cap. 27. Socin. Tract. de Deo, &amp;

<hi>Crellius</hi> hath written a particular Treatiſe <hi>de Spiritu Sancto,</hi> and

ſignification, denotes<note n="4" place="bottom">Flatum exore Animalis expreſſum. p. 455.</note> that breath which is expired out of the
mouths of Men or other Animals; and from the <hi>reſemblance</hi>
that is to be found between them, it is transferred to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
that divine virtue in God which we call the Holy Ghoſt:
and therefore when Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 22. breathed on his Diſciples,
and thereby conferred upon them the Holy Ghoſt;<note n="5" place="bottom">In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicavit Spiritum Sanctum ejuſque à Deo &amp; Chriſto Emanationem ſeu Emiſſionem, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>latui ſive ſpiraculo eſſe ſimilem, <hi>Proleg. de Spiritu Sancto</hi> Ibid.</note> he did
thereby give them to underſtand, that the holy ſpirit was an
<hi>Emanation from God, not unlike a vapour or breathing.</hi> At this
rate the Holy Ghoſt ſhould it ſeems be a ſubtile and tenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſubſtance, contrary to what he aſſerts <hi>cap.</hi> 1. where he
plainly tells us that the Spirit of God is not properly <hi>a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>
but <hi>a quality,</hi> therefore called in the Scripture the power
of the moſt High, <hi>&amp; virtus proprie qualitas eſt,</hi> p. 466.</p>
            <p>But foraſmuch as many things, by his own acknowledgment,
are affirmed of, and actions aſcribed to the Holy Ghoſt, which
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40896:41"/>
cannot well agree to qualities, but muſt ſuppoſe the thing to
which they are aſcribed to be a ſubſtance; ſuch as are <hi>Local
motion, Bodily ſhape, diviſion and the like:</hi> to reconcile therefore
theſe ſeeming differences he is of Opinion, that the Spirit of
God conſider'd abſtractedly in it ſelf, is a meere quality; but yet
this vertue may be impreſſed upon, and conveighed into ſome
ſubtile and coeleſtial matter, <hi>&amp; ejus naturae valde congruae,</hi> which
is agreeable to its nature, <hi>Ibid.</hi> As we find the vital energy of
the Soul communicated firſt to the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> and by them
to all the other parts of the Body: and as we find the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of the <hi>Coeleſtial Bodies,</hi> and qualities of <hi>Terreſtrial ones,
Heat, Light and Odors,</hi> conveighed in ſome ſubtile effluvium's,
from the Bodies in which they are, into the Air, and ſome other
ſubjects at a great diſtance. So ſaith he, by the Spirit of God
is ſometimes meant that<note n="1" place="bottom">Materia ſubtilis, quae qualitatem divinam in ſe habet, &amp; per quam in hominum pectora deferri ſolet. <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 476.</note> tenuious matter which contains a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
quality in it, and by which it is conveighed into the
minds of men: and in this ſenſe he conceives the ſpirit of
God, may be called a <hi>Corporeal ſubſtance,</hi> which hath extenſion,
and is capable of diviſion, as other Bodies tho ſpiritual are<note n="2" place="bottom">Isto modo Spiritum Sanctum ſubstantiam quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam eſſe, eamque corpoream non eſt negandum, <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>And by this notion he thinks he hath found out an eaſy
way, to ſolve the former difficulties concerning the <hi>Local mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the Holy Ghoſt, and particularly, his deſcent upon our
Saviour at the time of his Baptiſm, and upon the Apoſtles
in the <hi>day of Pentecoſt.</hi> Of his being poured out, of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
given, ſometimes in meaſure, and ſometimes without it: of
his being divided and diſtributed and the like: which tho we
interpret of the <hi>gifts,</hi> he doth of the <hi>nature and eſſence of the
Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which according to this account he gives of it,
may like other <hi>ſteams and vapors</hi> be carry'd here and there, and
may be divided and diſtributed in greater and leſſer quantities
as there is occaſion. And thus God took ſome part of this <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial
matter,</hi> which contained that divine virtue with which
<hi>Moſes</hi> was endued, and put it into the 70 Elders <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 25.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40896:41"/>
and in the ſame ſenſe <hi>Eliſha</hi> had <hi>a double portion</hi> of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of <hi>Elias,</hi> that is, of that divine <hi>ſteam and vapor</hi> which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
him to do wonders.</p>
            <p>Now if we ſhall further enquire what that Coeleſtial matter
is, by which this divine quality which he makes to be the Holy
Ghoſt, is conveighed and diſtributed among men; he hath not
determined, but hath left it to the Readers diſcretion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture:
tho he hath given ſufficient intimation how he would
have him govern his Opinion. For in the other inſtances
which he produces, the <hi>quality</hi> and the <hi>effluvium's,</hi> proceed from
the ſame <hi>ſubject;</hi> and he gives you no limitation, no caution
in the leaſt to think otherwiſe in this caſe: it is plain that
ſome of his friends as he tell us, were of that Opinion, that
the Spirit of God, was nothing but an <hi>Emanation, a tenuious
ſteam flowing from the very ſubſtance of God,</hi> as the breath doth
out of our mouths and noſtrils<note n="1" place="bottom">

it being but fit that in <hi>matters of Religion,</hi> every man ſhould be
left to his own freedom, and therefore he fairly leaves you
to your own. It is plain, if he were not himſelf of that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
yet he thought there was no harm in it; otherwiſe he
would have given his Reader ſome caution about it, which he
hath not in the leaſt done.</p>
            <p>And now we are come to the <hi>Bottome,</hi> or if you pleaſe, to

a <hi>Spirit,</hi> but it is as certain that they mean <hi>a ſpiritual Body;</hi> as
appears by what <hi>Crellius</hi> tells us when he comes to deſcribe God,
and to give the<note n="2" place="bottom">Deus eſt Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus Aeternus; Spiritum autem cum nominamus, ſubstantiam intelligimus ab omni craſſitie, qualem in Corporibus oculorum arbitrio ſubjectis cernimus, alienam.

deſcription. When we call God a Spirit, ſaith he, we mean
a ſubſtance free from all that <hi>thick groſs matter</hi> which is the
<hi>object of our ſenſes</hi> ſhall I ſay? no that's too much, but which
can <hi>terminate our ſight;</hi> for a Spirit tho it be <hi>inviſible,</hi> you muſt
know it may be <hi>palbable;</hi> and ſuch is the aer ſaith he, to which
the word Spirit is a <hi>genus,</hi> common to it, to God and Angels<note n="1" place="bottom">Quorum unumquodque hoc nomen tanto magis ſortitur, quanto eſt ſubtilius, <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note>:
each of which are ſpirits, but that which is moſt ſubtile is
likewiſe moſt ſpirituous.</p>
            <p>And by this explication of the nature of a ſpirit, <hi>Crellius</hi>
who calls God a ſpirit, and <hi>Socinus</hi> who plainly thought he was
none, (as appears by his<note n="2" place="bottom">Vid. Vorſt. Not. ad Diſp. 3. de Natura Dei p. 200.</note> forced and perverſe Interpretation of
thoſe words of Chriſt <hi>Jo.</hi> 4. 24. which contain as <hi>plain</hi> and
<hi>clear</hi> a declaration of this great truth, as could be expreſſed
in words,) may very eaſily be reconciled. For whereas the
<hi>Maſter</hi> denies God to be a ſpirit, he might by ſpirit mean an
<hi>incorporeal, immaterial being;</hi> and the <hi>Scholar</hi> by acknowledging
him to be one, did not intend to exclude <hi>matter from his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution;</hi>
but that he was not compoſed of ſuch <hi>thick groſs parts
of matter</hi> as our Bodies are, which can terminate the ſight; but
of matter of a more <hi>tenuious and refined Contexture,</hi> more <hi>ſubtile</hi>
perhaps, but of the <hi>ſame nature</hi> with Aer or Aether.</p>
            <p>And from hence reſult all their <hi>Impious Opinions</hi> about God,
in oppoſition to his Immenſity, ſimplicity, Omnipreſence: Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

ſo far from denoting a perfection, that it implies a plain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.
And among other Arguments which he makes uſe of
to prove God not to be Infinite, this is remarkable <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 237.
Becauſe God at preſent, ſaith he, is ſeen by the Angels, and ſhall
be ſo hereafter by us, with our Bodily Eies; and therefore not
Infinite. For what is ſo cannot be comprehended by any ſenſe,
as he rightly upon this ſuppoſition argues: <hi>Quia debet eſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portio
inter objectum percipiendum, &amp; perſonam percipientem:</hi> and
whereas it may be objected that the <hi>Beatifick viſion</hi> reſpects the
<hi>inward ſpeculation</hi> of the mind, and not the <hi>external perception</hi>
of the Eies; ſome indeed ſo interpret it, ſaith he, <hi>Sed neſcio an
ſacris literis conſentaneum ſit; certe magnam futurae noſtrae foelicitatis
partem hac explicatione tollere videntur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if God be finite, it muſt further follow, and is plainly
acknowledged by theſe men, <hi>that magnitude and extenſion, and a
true local preſence</hi> may and muſt be aſcribed to God: and this
is ſo far from being by them looked upon to be derogatory to
the nature and perfection of God; that the contrary notion is
ſcouted by them, not only as falſe, but as abſurd and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
which aſſerts ſuch a preſence of God, as obliges us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him not be confined to any certain place, neither to have
any parts commenſurate to the parts of that place in which he is.
For this if any thing muſt be the meaning of<note n="1" place="bottom">Exam. Cenſurae in Conf. Rem. Cap. 2. p. 43.</note> 
               <hi>Epiſcopius</hi>'s
<hi>Atomica &amp; Atopica eſſentiae divinae praeſentia;</hi> which he rails and
exclaims againſt, and can ſcarce think of without horror and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment.</p>
            <p>But further, if <hi>Local preſence</hi> be aſcribed to God, I think
<hi>Local motion</hi> may with good reaſon be ſo likewiſe; foraſmuch
as it may be more honourable to God to Imagine that he may
ſometimes change, then that he ſhould allwaies be Immoveably
fixed and conſined to one certain place. Laſtly if <hi>extenſion</hi> may be
attributed to God, and ſuch an extenſion as was ſaid before,
which hath its certain <hi>bounds and limits,</hi> by an unavoidable
conſequence, <hi>Figure</hi> muſt be aſcribed to him alſo: foraſmuch
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40896:44"/>
as figure doth naturally and neceſſarily reſult from the <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of extenſion:</hi> this being the definition of a figure, <hi>quae ſub
aliquo vel aliquibus terminis comprehenditur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now at length we ſee what a bleſſed notion of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God the <hi>Socinians</hi> have furniſhed us with; how <hi>ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous</hi>
and <hi>diſhonourable</hi> to God, how <hi>repugnant to piety,</hi> how
oppoſite to <hi>right reaſon,</hi> and to thoſe ſober and juſt apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
which <hi>that</hi> hath furniſhed many wiſe heathens with, who
I am afraid may one day riſe up in Judgement againſt theſe
men and condemn them.</p>
            <p>It may be now time to draw towards a concluſion of this
Diſcourſe, therefore I ſhall briefly ſumme up what hath been
ſaid upon this ſubject: that the Readers memory may be refreſhed
with the account which hath bin given him, both of what
the Scripture affirms of God, and what the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay of him.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures have informed us that our God is <hi>Infinite,</hi>
they ſay he is <hi>Finite,</hi> ours is <hi>Omnipreſent,</hi> theirs <hi>Limited</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to a certain place: ours <hi>Immutable,</hi> theirs <hi>Liable to
change;</hi> ours is <hi>naturally juſt,</hi> theirs <hi>contingently</hi> ſo: ours <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily</hi>
concerned in the government of the World, and taking
care of humane affairs; theirs might, like <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Deity,
ſit at eaſe in the enjoyment of his own happyneſs, leaving the
world to the <hi>conduct of chance;</hi> and men to the <hi>guidance</hi> of that
which is <hi>equally uncertain,</hi> their own giddy and unſtable paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
neither giving them <hi>Laws</hi> for the regulating of their
actions, nor aſſigning any <hi>puniſhments</hi> to the violation of them.
Our God is <hi>Omniſcient,</hi> theirs <hi>ignorant of future and contingent
events:</hi> ours <hi>without parts or paſſions,</hi> theirs <hi>compounded of one,</hi>
and <hi>lyable</hi> to the other; even to thoſe which argue the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
weakneſs and infirmity, and which ſome of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
thought inconſiſtent with the bravery and reſolution of
a wiſe and virtuous man. In ſhort, our God conſiſts of three
bleſſed and glorious perſons, ſubſiſting in the ſame undivided
eſſence: They deny the divine nature of the Son, and yet by
an unpardonable contradiction, ſay that he is <hi>a true God;</hi> and
diſown the perſonality of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>From all which I think it will appear very evident, what
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40896:44"/>
we undertook to make out at the beginning of this diſcourſe,
that the <hi>Object</hi> of their Religion and ours is different; and
that will go a great way to prove that the <hi>Religions themſelves</hi>
are ſo too. In ſhort, the difference between us is not ſo ſmall
as ſome <hi>ignorant</hi> people may <hi>imagine,</hi> and ſome <hi>crafty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
perſons may pretend;</hi> among whom I cannot but reckon
<hi>Curcellaeus,</hi> who moſt falſely and impudently againſt common
<hi>ſenſe and reaſon,</hi> and therefore one might be tempted to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
againſt <hi>his Conſcience,</hi> would perſwade the world to believe,
that the difference between us and the <hi>Socinians,</hi> in the point
of the Divinity of the ſon of God, was a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<hi>about words</hi> rather then any <hi>real difference,</hi> in a matter
of faith: which is quite contrary to the notion that either the
Orthodox or the <hi>Socinians</hi> have of this matter: who lay a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and truer ſtreſs upon their Opinions, then this man doth,
who pretends to bleſs the world with a diſcovery of what
no body ever knew before.</p>
            <p>But I believe the Reader who hath peruſed the foregoing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
will be induced to believe that either the <hi>Socinians</hi> or we
are in a very great miſtake, the diſtance between us being wider
then that between <hi>Heaven and Earth:</hi> and indeed no leſs then
between <hi>Finite and Infinite.</hi> So that upon a true ſtate of things,
I believe it will be found that our Opinions are not only ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<hi>inconſiſtent,</hi> but abſolutely <hi>irreconcileable;</hi> foraſmuch as in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to reconcile them, we muſt part with the <hi>Infinite nature</hi> of God
the Father, and the Divinity of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.
And ſurely that man muſt be very <hi>fond,</hi> nay he muſt be <hi>mad</hi> for
peace, that can be content, to ſacrifice both <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>the Divine
Author</hi> of it, in order to purchaſe it. Once indeed our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
came down among men, and <hi>offered up himſelf</hi> upon the Croſs
in order to <hi>reconcile the two greateſt Enemies,</hi> God and Man: but it is
too much in all Conſcience which is expected of us, that we
ſhould make <hi>a new Oblation of our Saviour:</hi> and not only as the Jews
<note n="1" place="bottom">

               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:40896:45"/>
did, nail his Body to the Croſs, but <hi>ſacrifice even his Divinity,</hi> to
compoſe the differences in Religion.</p>
            <p>But perhaps ſome may ſay the <hi>Socinians</hi> are men of more <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
and <hi>moderation,</hi> then to deſire us preſently to part with all our
Religion to gratifie them: They only plead <hi>for liberty,</hi> and in
order to their joyning with us, that we would remove thoſe
<hi>obſtacles</hi> of communion, <hi>viz. Articles, Creeds, Confeſſions of Faith,</hi>
ſome <hi>uſeleſs expreſſions</hi> in our Common Prayer, which contain
too plain and <hi>uncharitable</hi> acknowledgments of the Trinity;
which hinder many pious, uſeful and excellent perſons from
coming to our Churches. Why ſhould we not ſtrip our Faith
of all thoſe larger and unwarrantable explications which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
and Fathers have made of it; and reduce all to the <hi>naked
expreſſions</hi> of Scripture: that is, content our ſelves with a few
Ambiguous words, (which the perverſe and ſubtile Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Hereticks have made ſo) and let every man abound in
his own ſenſe.</p>
            <p>They believe Chriſt to be the Son of God, ſo as to be true
God likewiſe: what need we trouble our ſelves or them with
the word <hi>Conſubſtantial;</hi> pity it is, that a word, nay a <hi>Letter</hi>
ſhould divide men in their Opinions and Affections. To all
which, tho I have a great deal that I could anſwer, yet at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
all that I ſhall ſay ſhall be this: That the <hi>Socinians</hi> are <hi>wiſe</hi>
men, perſons of a deep reach; but they muſt not think that all the
reſt of the World <hi>are fools.</hi> It were too much in all Conſcience
to deſire us to part with all at firſt: but they know what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to make of our Conceſſions: if they can perſwade us with
that fooliſh woman <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 1. to pull down our houſe with
our own hands, it will ſave them the toyl and drudgery of
ſo doing: at leaſt if they can prevail with us to demoliſh our
<hi>Outworks,</hi> then they will be able as with greater eaſe, ſo likewiſe
with greater hopes of ſucceſs, to <hi>attack the main Fort.</hi> In ſhort,
the <hi>Ancient Creeds and Confeſſions,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Ancient words</hi> in
which the Doctrine of Faith hath bin conveyed down to us;
are only<note n="1" place="bottom">Dr. Sherlocks Apol.</note> an <hi>Hedge of Thornes,</hi> as they have bin truly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently
ſtyled, with which the Chriſtian Faith hath bin guarded
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40896:45"/>
againſt the deſigns of <hi>diſguiſed Hereticks,</hi> and I hope they will
prick their fingers, who ſhall attempt the removing of them.</p>
            <p>And thus much ſhall ſerve to be ſaid upon the firſt Head, of
the great difference there is between what the Scriptures affirme,
and what the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay of the great object of our Religion
God Allmighty. And if there were only this in the caſe, I hope
it might prove ſufficient to guard any pious well meaning Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
from the <hi>Infection</hi> of their Impious Opinions, which furniſh
him with notions ſo <hi>diſhonorable</hi> and injurious to his maker:
and who by denying the bleſſed Trinity, and the Divinity of our
Saviour, have ſubverted the very foundations of Chriſtianity,
altered the whole Oeconomy of mans Salvation: ſo that they
and we muſt go different waies to Heaven, as having neither
the ſame meanes of Grace, nor the ſame hopes of Glory.</p>
            <p>I ſhould now proceede to ſhew the Oppoſition between the
<hi>Socinian</hi> tenets, and the other parts of the Chriſtian Doctrine,
which are thereby contradicted, and overthrown. But this
muſt be referred till a time of further and better leaſure: But
by this Taſte which I have given the Reader of <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi>
I may have reaſon to hope that he will be of the Opinion,
that Religion is like Wine, the older, the more excellent and
deſireable. And therefore that no man of <hi>wiſdome,</hi> or indeed of
<hi>common ſenſe,</hi> who hath not <hi>loſt all Reliſh of divine things,</hi> when
he hath taſted of the old Religion, will ſtraightly deſire the
New, becauſe he will find that the Old is much better.</p>
            <p>Now to the Holy Bleſſed and undivided Trinity, three Perſons and
one God, be all Honour, Glory, and Praiſe both now and for
evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
