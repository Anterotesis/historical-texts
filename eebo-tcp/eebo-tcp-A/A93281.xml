            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>GOING NAKED,
A
SIGNE.</head>
            <p>OH Church of <hi>England!</hi> This is unto thee, who liveſt in oppreſſion and cruelty,
pride and covetouſneſſe, a day of miſery is coming upon thee, thy nakedneſſe
and shame is coming upon thee as an armed Man, from which no Man can hide
thee, neither Hills nor Mountaines shall be able to hide thee in this the Day of
the Lord, neither shall the Clefts of the Rocks preſerve thee from the Day of the
Lords Controverſy with thee; Thy nakedneſſe and thy shame is near to come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thee, from it thou shalt not fly: Oppreſſion and cruelty hath been as a Staff
for thee, but the Lord is riſen to break thy Staff of oppreſſion, and thou shalt be
left naked though thou haſt ſeemed to be the glory of the Nations with thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
Covers, but now thou shalt be left naked, and Nations shall be ashamed
of thee: Howl and weep ye Teachers, for the Lord is gathering his people from
you, and ye shall devour his flock no more; The Day is coming upon you that
none shall buy your Wares any more, ye Merchants of <hi>Babylon:</hi> All your ſcarlet
colours the Lord our God is coming to take off: Then your nakedneſſe shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to many Nations, and you shall ſit as a widdow, and there shall be none to
comfort you; Diſtreſſe and anguish shall take hold upon you, and pain as a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in travel, and is not able to bring forth, ſo shall your miſery come upon you:
The Decree of the Lord is gone out againſt all unrighteouſneſs, he will ſurely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
every one according to their works; for as a Troop of Robbers lye in wait for
a Man, ſo a company of Prieſts by conſent lye in wait to murther the Innocent Lambs
of God, and for their ſakes the Lord is riſen in his mighty power to break the bonds
of wickedneſſe, and to ſet the oppreſſed free, for the Lord hath heard the groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his ſeed, and he is riſen to deliver to bring it out of Captivity, and from
under the Taſkmaſters, where his ſeed hath been long oppreſſed by unreaſonable
Men: But the Lord will ſpare no longer, but he will reward the Oppreſſors double
into their boſoms, and his ſeed he will deliver.</p>
            <p>Oh howl and weep, your day is far ſpent, Night is coming upon you that you shall
not have a Viſion, and nothing shall be left to cover you: As naked shall you be
ſpiritually, as my body hath been temporally naked in many places in <hi>England,</hi> as
a ſigne of the nakedneſſe and shame that is coming upon the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
who liveth in Oppreſſion and cruelty, and all who lift up a weapon for her shall
fall in the shame with her, which will ſurely come to paſſe, So all ſober people
conſider your wayes, and turn to the light which comes from <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that with it
you may be gathered unto the Lord from the falſe Teachers to the teaching of the
Lord, from the falſe worships to the worship of the Lord in ſpirit and in truth;
For a neceſſity was laid upon me from the Lord God of life to be a ſigne: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I was given up to the thing it was as death unto me, and I had rather, if it had
been the Lords will, have dyed then gone on in this ſervice; But when the Word
of the Lord came unto me, ſaying, Go on and proſper, It was ſweet unto me, as
the honey and the honey Comb. And bleſſed ſaith Chriſt are thoſe that heares my
Word and keeps it.</p>
