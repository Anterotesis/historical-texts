            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and hath billetted his Troops in the Town; who have since their entrance, plundered divers houses of well-affected men in the Town and Country, which hath put the people round about into such a fear, that many flie from the country to the city, &amp; take houses, and carry their best goods thither; I my self am come this last week to live in <hi>Chester,</hi> and have left my servants to look to businesse in the Country. Since my coming hither, there were 200 souldiers billetted in our little village, and 13 of them appointed to my house, who, I thank God, departed without doing any more hurt, then what victualls they eat, which they took in an orderly manner: His Majesty departed <hi>Chester</hi> on Tuesday, and went hence by <hi>Wregham</hi> to <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> whence he came: At his departure from us, he put 100 men for a Garrison into the Castle, and commanded Sir <hi>Thomas Delves,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Wilbraham,</hi> M. <hi>Philip Manwaring</hi> of <hi>Badely,</hi> and M. <hi>Berkind</hi> the Pronotary, and his son, to wait upon His Majesty, and to be confined to Court. The same day the King went, Captain <hi>Salisbury</hi> and his men did burn Sir <hi>William Bruertons</hi> Decoy; and the Kings Souldiers in all places where they come, grow very insolent, and do much spoyl and mischief; the Commissioners of Array by the Kings coming hither are much strengthned in these parts, for the aforesaid men which the King hath taken away with him; were the chief of those that attempted to put the <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>

in execution. The report is here, that the King likes the City so well, he intends shortly to return and winter with us. My Lord <hi>Strange,</hi> now Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> (for on Munday last his father died here in <hi>Chester</hi>) is gone with great Forces against <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> who have fortified themselves, and resolve to keep him out with all the might they can; they have three Pieces of Ordnance; my Lord <hi>Strange</hi> hath six Pieces; Bullets have been exchanged on both sides, and two of my Lords men slain, and some Commanders; which hath so far incensed him, that he is resolved to have the Town, or to die before it. The times are like to be miserable, God grant a happy Reconcilement.</p>

with their losse departed the City, and made good their retreat towards <hi>Bewdley,</hi> and no living soul would give us the least notice of the same.

Next morning was found dead 24. but all not known when they were viewed; Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly reported to be shot through the jaws, and Prince <hi>Robert</hi> in the heel: Some two more of the great ones amongst them were buried the same Friday evening ere they departed: <hi>Wilmot</hi> is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly run through the body, and it is said divers of them dyed upon the way, but certain it is that their losse was full as great as ours, which had been more, could we have had any Intelligence out of the City, which is desperately Malignant, and the Country also. Of our side onely of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Officers, Sargeant Major <hi>Douglas</hi> was slain, and Colonell <hi>Sands</hi> sore wounded.
