            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Week before <hi>Easter,</hi> when School-boys plead their old Charter of <hi>Omnia Bene,</hi> in opposition to the Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Injunction of <hi>Buttock-Pennance,</hi> inflicted according to the Arbitrary Wills of those Grammarian Monarchs, who Govern absolute in their Kingdoms of Instruction, who now, pursuant to an old Custome, submit to a Cessation of Birch Arms, by which they us'd to Rule, Awe, and Terrifie their Infant Subjects; and when Womens Taylors were as busie in Turning of old Gowns, and Repairing the Decay'd Ornaments of Maids, Wives, and Widows, to set them off, as Nature does the Season of the Year, to the best advantage, that they may walk with their Gallants to <hi>Islington,</hi> and there make as great a Consumption of Bottle-Ale and Plumb-Cakes, as ever was made of Pig, Pork, and prick'd Wines, during the Revels of St. <hi>Bartholomew:</hi> 'Twas then I found my Blood had acquir'd a pleasing warmth, and as it Circulated thro' its Channels, gave to each Vein a Voluntary Titillation, without either Female Dalliance, or the force of Imagination; that I began to be as Rampant as a Parsons Bull in the Spring, turn'd into new Pasture; and could think of nothing but fine Faces, Charming Bubbies, Plump Hips, Soft Bellies, Condescending Mo-Mo-Modicums, and such sort of strange Whimsies; that I found my self almost as Mad as Women Troubled with a <hi>Fura Matricis,</hi> and could not any longer be without the <hi>Nocturnal,</hi> as well as <hi>Diurnal</hi> Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Female Conversation.</p>
            <p>In order to Lawfully procure to my self this mistaken Blessing, which every Fool Admires till he Enjoys, and Enjoys till he Despises, I began to consider the easiest and most probable means of obtaining this delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fangle, or Modish Bauble, call'd a Woman; and such an one as a Man might be Content to be Plagu'd with all days of his Life, for the sake only of the Old Trade of Basket-making; at last, I made this Result, from some hours Deliberation, That the common Method Citizens take to be made <hi>Cuckolds,</hi> might be as ready a Road to <hi>Matrimony,</hi> as any Man could think on: Upon which I bought me about two Pound and a half of <hi>Wig,</hi> two or three Ells of <hi>Cravat,</hi> had a Gold Hat-band Stich'd cross the Crown of my <hi>Hat,</hi> and the Frogs of my Belt let down as low as the Rowls of my Stockins: Thus at a few Guineas Expence, made my self as pretty a Fool in Fashion, as any's to be seen at <hi>Fop</hi>'s <hi>Coffee-house,</hi> or amongst the Audience at a New Play.</p>

When thus Equip'd, it being a great Ball-Week, I had recourse to a Dancing-School, which I thought was the best Rendesvouz of willing Tits, that a Man under my Circumstance could desire to shake his Breech amongst, by a little Seal'd Warrant, commonly call'd a Ticket, which I had procur'd from the Lord <hi>Caperer Paramount,</hi> of <hi>Currant, Minuet,</hi> and <hi>Bory;</hi> I obtain'd admittance, Crowding in with a parcel of Grave Matrons, who had left their Husbands at home, some to keep Shop, and othres to keep Bars, whilst themselves became Spectators of their pretty Daughters Perfections. I had not been long settled amidst the Motherly Assembly of <hi>Cheapside-Quality,</hi> but I found my self as Warm as a <hi>Dutch</hi> Womans Honour, when a Stove's under her Petticoats; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quickly brought into such a fine Breathing Sweat, that I began to be much about as easie under the Heat, as a new Marry'd Man under Matrimony at Midsummer, that like him what I expected would have prov'd a Pleasure, I found now to be down-right Drudgery; as soon as the Room was fully furnish'd with fine Ladys, who were rang'd by the Master of the Revels, in as regular an order, as Painted Gallipots in an Apothecary's Shop; the pretty Female Poppets who were to Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Company with some new French Figaries, and feats of Activity, were Usher'd into Publick View, adorn'd with precious Stones, collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from several parts of the Town, to set off their Nursery of <hi>Bellfa</hi>'s to the best Advantage; who came in by two, and two, as exactly Pair'd as ever I saw Coach Horses; and droping their Honours to the Assembly, mov'd cross the Room to their Places, as Formal, and as Stiff, as Figures in a <hi>Raree-show,</hi> or a Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen, going to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver an Adress to show the City's Loyalty; several Branches as well as Sconces of Candles being lighted, and the Room being Cramm'd as full of Company, as St. <hi>Brides</hi> Church, upon a <hi>Spittle</hi> Psalm at <hi>Easter,</hi> or an Anthem on <hi>Cicelia</hi>'s Day: The Schollars being rang'd upon Forms or Shelves in several Degrees, one above another, the biggest being seated uppermost, like the great Dishes in a Kitchen above the Plates; but were so mightily infected with the Green Sickness, that the paleness of their Faces made their Heads look in rows like the Poor's Whiteloaves in a Church: A Concert of <hi>Coleyard-Musick</hi> was thrust up into a Bow-Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, where they sat thrashing of <hi>Minuets</hi> and <hi>Bories,</hi> till their Faces Rain'd Sweat upon their Papers and their Instruments, and made 'em look with as good a Gloss, as if they had been new Varnish'd; but stoping the Pores of the Wood, so Damp'd the sound, that had they strung up an old Butter-firkin for a Base, and made their Trebles of <hi>Lignum Vitae,</hi> they could not have impos'd a worse Sound upon the Ears of the Audience than they did: I look'd about me, like a Beau in a Play-House, to take a general Survey of the Ladies round me, and thought my self as happy in my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as the Great <hi>Turk</hi> amidst his Seraglio, and pleas'd my self with the Thoughts of having the Power to choose any one out of the Fair Number.</p>
            <p>All things being now in order to begin to show, Monsieur <hi>Shake-legs</hi> Faces about to his fair Company of Female Pupils, whom he had brought under such Discipline, that at one Word of Command, they advanc'd for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from their Seats, seeming all to be as ready to put themselves upon
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62057:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a Gallop, as so many Post Horses; when they had put themselves in a Ring, like so many Country People going to Play at <hi>Drop-Glove,</hi> very concise Orders were dispatch'd to the Listening Crowdero's to play the <hi>Brawles;</hi> which being done, the Cock led up the Chickens, and away they scoured Round the Room after one another as if they were play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Train-Tro;</hi> at which kind of Sport they continued till they had tired the Company, much worse than themselves, before they chang'd into Variety; and than we had as many Changes given us upon <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, Bory Minuet,</hi> and <hi>Fig,</hi> as could be rung upon four Bells, now and then intermix'd with a Figure-Dance, where they look'd like so many Girles running the Mazes in <hi>Tuttle-Fields,</hi> and she that run thro' with the least faults, should have a Ginger-Bread Husband for her Reward: Every Dance I perceiv'd, prov'd an excellent <hi>Sudorisick</hi> to the Master, who now look'd as Red in the Face, as if his Head had Blush'd for his Heels, and that he thought in his own Conscience, it was too Effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate a Profession to raise a Man to the Dignity of <hi>Lord-Mayor,</hi> or to be the Study of a <hi>Philosopher,</hi> that had any Guts in his Brains, to make himself Learned in the sundry Motions and Measures of the Foot. I could not forbear thinking it might be properly enough said, that a <hi>Dancing-Master,</hi> is the only Creature in the Creation that Walks with his Heels upwards; for no doubt on't, for the great Service they do him, he prefers them in his own Opinion above his Head; and things are to Mankind, not as they really are, but as we make 'em, and believe 'em.</p>
            <p>By this time, some Brother Professors of the Step, were hopp'd into his Assistance, and gave him the Opportunity of retiring, partly thro' Ostentation, and partly for refreshment, to change his Dancing Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couterments, and Entertain the Eyes of the Spectators with a new piece of Prodigality; making his Re-Entrance as fresh upon the Stage of his Theatre in <hi>Epitomy,</hi> as a <hi>Lincolns-Inn-Field Wrastler,</hi> after he has recover'd new Vigour from the Sucking of two or three <hi>China Oranges;</hi> and then amongst 'em the poor Girles were so throughly Exercis'd, that some of them began to hobble like a Woman just lifted off a Horse-back, who has lost Leather by the Fatigue of a long Journey. The Candles now began, for want of Snuffing, to burn as dim as if the Room had been Haunted with Evil Spirits, so that there was a short Cessation of Dancing for a time; and the Activity of the Foot was forc'd to give way to the Imployment of the Hands, which Danc'd round the Branches with such wonderful Expedition, that I could not forbear thinking the Man that Snuff'd the Candles, was as great a Proficient in his way, as he that had hired him for that purpose; in every Interval the Quarteridges flow'd so fast into the Masters Pocket, that the Money chinck'd as he Caper'd, almost as loud as the Bells of a <hi>Morice-Dancer,</hi> when he is hopping about the Hay; and I suppose, was much Pleasanter Musick to his Ears, than that he Danc'd to. The Tattles of the Motherly Spectators, began now to swell into great Emulation, every one giving her own Female Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring so large a Character of the sweet humour and Disposition of her Child, that it is scarce to be Credited; and so highly Commended the Docibility of the poor Lamb, that she had not gone to School above a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, but she begun and made her Father a Band of as good Point as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62057:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ever was brought from <hi>Venice. Ay truly, I believe in my Conscience, 'tis one of the Tractablest Children, I must say that for her, that ever poor Woman brought into the World; and truly, as long as I and her Father are able to give it her, she shall want no Education to make her a Gentlewoman; for tho' we Sell Ale, 'tis true, yet, we bless God for it, we get our Money as Honestly, and Enjoy our selves as Comfortably as any People in our Station throughout the whole Parish, Marry do we, and I don't know why, if we are able, we should not give our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as good Breeding as any Body.

            <p>The rest of the Spectators, as well as my self, began now, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, to be pretty well tired with the dull Swimming, and Capering, of ev'ry Sweating Salatrix. The whole Company being made as hot and as wet, by Crowding so close, and Sucking in one anothers Breaths, that had a Batch of hot Rye-Bread been Anointed with Whey-Butter, just under our Noses, they could not have prov'd a Sourer Nosegay, than what sprang out of the Pores of the Melting Assembly, during the Time we were under this uneasie Confinement; for there was no stirring without a general Consent; People were thumping at the Door, as if Distracted, for admittance, like so many Batchelours strugling to Enter into the State of Matrimony, not at all considering the wonderful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies the many People were under, who had fallen into it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and would as gladly get out on't, could they break those Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Fetters which bind them to their Bargains.</p>
            <p>At last the Door being opened to let out some-body, who was, or as least plaid the Hypocrite for their Ease, and pretended to be Fainting, In broke a Rabble of People from without, of all Ages, both Sexes, and divers Qualities, from the <hi>Inns-of-Court Clark,</hi> to the <hi>Footman,</hi> and the <hi>Town-Lady,</hi> to the <hi>Tavern Kitchen-Wench,</hi> that like so many Wheat Eares cramm'd into a <hi>Tunbridge</hi> Pye, we Stew'd, Cocks and Hens together, till we were throughly Bak'd in our own Fat and Gravy.

the great satisfaction of all those who had been long Sitters, was some occasion of shortning our Pennance; so that the remainder of our Foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries was order'd, first to be a Figure and a Song; and then the whole Entertainment to be turn'd up in a few Country Dances, that the Ladies, I suppose, might Couple themselves at last with Partners, who at least would be so Civil to see them safe Home to their several Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, if not make an Amour to 'em, and give 'em some Hopes of a further satisfaction: The Song that they Sung was, I suppose, in Praise of Singing and Dancing; there was something in't, of <hi>Come let's Trip it o'er the Plain, And Sing and Dance a Main,</hi> or such sort of stuff, which I don't think worth Representing to the Reader: I have given instead, one of my own as applicable to the purpose, which I hope will give him greater Diversion.

as so many Faries could possibly Enjoy in a Midnight Dance, upon a Lonely Plain in the Moon-shine.</p>
            <p>By this time I was thoroughly tired, as ever was poor God-Father at a Christening, and having next to me a pretty kind of a Woman, at the full Age of Maturity; who look'd Modest enough, as times go, to refuse a Man to be a Mistress, without a very close Siege, long Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, large Expence, lavish Promises, and the like; which I had no great Mind to be at the Trouble of, but rather to Endeavour to Discover whether she had Virtue and Money enough, answerable to her out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Perfections, to make a Wife on: Accordingly I withdrew my Eyes from the Dancers, and apply'd a Succeeding Number of Affectionate Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to my Charming Neighbour, as the best Preface I thought I could use to my following Solicitations, considering our Looks render our Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as Intelligible as Words, and oftentimes leave behind 'em a far dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Impression. When I had practised this sort of Ogling for a few Minutes, and gave her Signal Reasons to believe my Eyes meant some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which my Modesty hitherto, or some other Difficiency, had hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd my Tongue from more plainly Expressing, I began to break out into such sort of Impertinence, as Lovers usually Preamble with to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce an Amour, to which she gave her Attention, with as Modest an Indifference as becomes a Woman of Discretion.</p>
            <p>This Heighten'd the good Opinion I had conceiv'd, tho' it put me to a greater puzzle to find Talk to Entertain her; for the less free a Woman is, the more it puts a Man upon his Guard, and gives him the Trouble of Placing his Words under greater Discipline, for fear he should be Laugh'd at; it being Natural for Persons who say but little, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve much, and take the greater Advantage of others Failings. At last I proceeded to an Encomium on her Beauty, which I found after the first Trembling on-set, had inspir'd me with such Eloquence that my Fancy Soar'd to more Hyperbole's than ever were stuff'd into an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademy of Compliments: These I perceiv'd gave the Eares of my new unknown Mistress a little Titillation, and made her begin to Talk as fast in Contradiction of my Flatteries, as she term'd 'em, as I could find words to Exhibit those Sentiments which the seeming Innocence of her Charms had influenc'd me to conceive of her pretty Person.</p>
            <p>By this time, being as much pleas'd with her Witty Conversation, as I was before with her outward Appearances; I began to press hard to inform me by which of these three Titles she distinguish'd herself, <hi>viz. Maid, Wife,</hi> or <hi>Widdow;</hi> considering with my self, in this Ripe and forward Age, she was scarce Young enough to be the former, and full Old enough to be either of the latter; at last after much Pains and Entreaties, I extorted a Confession of her Circumstance, from her Sweet and Alluring Lips, which was attended with so Innocent a Blush, when she told me <hi>a Maid,</hi> that none could have exprest, but she that deserv'd the Title. Having thus far proceeded to my Satisfaction, I had great hopes she would prove in reality, what her Carriage, as well as own report, represented her to be; and now chang'd the former method of my Talk, into im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunies
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62057:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of waiting on her Home, to Protect her from the Accidents and Insolencies of the Night, so Beautiful a Creature was liable to in the Street; which after many Humble Solicitations, as well as Arguments, I prevail'd with her to Consent to: My Happiness now began to swell in Proportion to the Favour she had granted me, reflecting at the same time on her Sweet Beauty and Deportment to heighten the Obligation, till I was grown as over-Joyful at these my first Successes, as a Young Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel that had carry'd a Cause, or a Young Duellist that had Disarm'd his Adversary.</p>
            <p>By this time the Dancers having tired their Legs, as much at their Pastime, as the Fidlers had their Arms in Playing to 'em, the Master changing his <hi>Spanish-</hi>Leather Shooes, for <hi>French-</hi>Wax, and the City Beaus having buckled on their Street-Travelling <hi>Neats-</hi>Leather, and put their Pumps into their Pockets, whilst the Ticklers of Cats Guts were Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Casing up their Musical Handsaws, together with their instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Dancing Masters Equipage, were Poisoning out the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany by Extinguishing the Lights, and saving the Candles-Ends, to show their Masters good Husbandry; so that the People began to Crowd out as fast into the Air for Refreshment, as they Throng'd in for Diversion; till it came to my Mistresses turn and mine, to relieve our Nostrils from a mixture of ill Scents, and squeez our selves out of the Door, thro' which Men, Women, and Children, Ebb'd out as fast as Water thro' <hi>London-Bridge</hi> at a Spring Tide; till at last without use of our Legs, we were carry'd into the Street with the force of the Current, like a Chip along a Kennel after a Showr of Rain; where I call'd a Coach, and handed her in with as much Delight, as ever an Old Miser thrust Gold into his Hoard, or a Usurer a Bond and Judgment into the Drawer of his Closet. I now improv'd every minute to the utmost, and was so all over Love, that I was afraid the Flame in my Breast, would have Consum'd my willing Carcase in as little time as Fire does a Brush Faggot, in a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern: I now having gather'd from her, who she was, and where she Liv'd, and a Promise of her Company on <hi>Easter-Monday,</hi> upon large Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my Civil Behaviour towards her, which she had ty'd me up to, with all imaginable Strictness; and setting her down at the distance she requested from the Habitation of her Friends, I Modestly wish'd her all Happiness, till our next merry Meeting according to appointment; and so we parted.</p>
            <p>I was mighty well pleas'd with reflecting, on the fair Progress I had thus succesfully made in my new Intrigue: Which according to the good Opinion I was willing to have of my pretty Mistress, I thought well worth Mannaging, and resolv'd with my self, since I had made so fair a Beginning, I would pursue it to some End or other, without foul reasons to the Contrary.</p>
            <p>Having thus parted with my <hi>Cherubimical</hi> Acquaintance, I retir'd home to my Lodging, being under too great an Amorous Inflamation for any thing to cool, as I thought, but a secure possession of her sweet Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, and Dilectable Conversation; of which I had such extravagant Conceptions, that I had rais'd her Perfections in my Opinion above

Humanity. Sleep, which we find by experience is the best and most Natural Relief for an Intoxicated Mortal, under the Enchantments of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> had no manner of Effect upon my more dangerous Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>Love;</hi> for when I arose in the Morning, after a Nights repose, I found as great a refreshment of my <hi>Passion,</hi> as I did of my <hi>Body;</hi> and could foresee no other measures to prevent the re-encrease, or check the violence of my Flame, but the means Nature has appointed for the relief of both Sexes under so intollerable a Condition. I therefore thought it necessary to employ Loves common Confident, the Pen, and try if the trusty Conveyance of my Affection by a Letter, might not be a means of kindling the like Desires in my new-found Angel, which her prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Beauty had rais'd in her Languishing Admirer to so Superlative a Degree. Accordingly I adjourn'd from home, to the next Coffee-house, where, after I had wish'd her all Happiness, equal to her Perfection, in a large Glass of cold <hi>Tea,</hi> which I accounted the best Liquor to inspire a young Lover, with extravagant Thoughts and apt Phrases, for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of so stubborn a Disease; which nothing could <hi>palliate,</hi> but her <hi>Company;</hi> and nothing <hi>Cure,</hi> but the <hi>Embraces</hi> of her who had thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected me; I apply'd Pen to Paper, and dispatch'd this following Epistle to the Lady; which, because I found her wittily inclin'd, I digested in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Comical Stile, that she might at once be Diverted with my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and pleas'd with her own Conquest.

            <p>Having thus concluded this first Draught of Affection, I call'd for one of Loves Messengers, a Porter, and dispatch'd him to my Lady, expecting no Answer by the Bearer; believing she would take more time to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate on the matter: My new method of Courtship, being enough to surprize any Woman at first Sight, who had not been accustom'd to so Comical a Dialect; the Nimble Footed Emissary, having sucessfully discharg'd his Business, made a speedy return with a satisfactory Answer, by Word of Mouth; which was, That I should hear further from her in the Afternoon; till which time, I was as uneasie as an Offender at the Bar, during the Absence of the Jury to Consult their Verdict, Labouring under as many various and Opposite Suggestions, and Delusions as a true Cocker at a Cock Match, fancying one Minute would go for me, another Minute against me; sometimes that she'd be pleas'd with my Letter; sometimes that she'd be Angry; and under this sublunary Frenzy I remain'd till I was better satisfi'd by her Answer: Having no more Stomach to my Dinner, than a Woman has to her Breakfast that Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning she's to be Marry'd.</p>

Or am I a Woman that can Gape so wide, as to swallow any such Windfalls? In the succeeding Sentence, you say something of a Cuckold, if you think your Stars have decreed you to be the Monster you talk on, I desire you would trouble your self no further; for I should hate a Husband with Horns, were they even of my own Graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and therefore I desire you would apply your self to some-body more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for your purpose. The old Maid that has Marry'd an</hi> Eunuch, <hi>I am heartily sorry for her; as for my part, I hope you can see by my Looks I am none of the one, and if you find your self the other, I desire you would rest your self contented, and think no more of a Wife, than a Blind-man ought to do of Spectacles: For why should a Man have the Vanity to covet that which its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible he should use when he has got it in possession? Therefore I advise you as a Friend, if you are in any such condition, to turn your Back upon Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and think no more of a Wife, then a Lawyer Cares to do of the next World; or a Cittizen, of Horn-Fair. I am sorry my Eyes have put you into the Condition of a</hi> Taylors-Goose, <hi>if you had not</hi> Cackled <hi>I should never have known it; and since you could not keep your self Two Days under your Distemper without divulging it, I am fearful if I should Administer to you the Remedy</hi> I <hi>believe you want, you could never conceal the Cure. You acknowledge you have nothing to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you to my Affections; and I must honestly confess, for I hate Flattery, He that has nothing to say for himself, or can nothing do to oblige his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress to Love him, is a Man likely to procure but a small share in my Affections; for</hi> I <hi>can never Esteem a Man much, that is furnish'd with so little. In the next place, you insist upon a Title which you plead to my affections, which</hi> I <hi>cannot reconcile to your foregoing acknowledgment; For how can a Man have a Title to any Womans Esteem, when he has nothing to Recommend him? You promise me, like a good Hearty Lover, if</hi> I <hi>admit you into my Favour, you'll be as Constant to me, as a Hypocrite to her Prayers. In answer to which High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown Compliment,</hi> I <hi>think my self Oblig'd to do you just as much good, as Prayers do such a Hyppocrite. You tell me also, you'll stick as close to me as a</hi> Virginia-<hi>Creeper to an Old Fabrick; since you are so very Complesant to make an Old Wall of me, tis but just Reason you should find my Heart as Obdurate, as a Brickbat. You desire me, what you have spoke in</hi> Jest, <hi>that</hi> I <hi>would take in</hi> Earnest: I <hi>like not such a method of Construction; for if</hi> I <hi>should Encourage you in good</hi> Earnest, <hi>by the same Rule,</hi> I <hi>suppose you would make a</hi> Jest <hi>on't. As for the Old Stile of</hi> Hanging <hi>and</hi> Drowning, I <hi>think they are both too shameful Deaths for a Lover to make mention of; and the poor Spirited Wretch who had no more Wit than to do either for a Mistress, I should think had never Courage enough to win one; for nothing but Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice is the Cause of Despair; and a Contemptible Death is but the just reward of Cowardise: So as for your Book of Martyrs you may keep it for a better use, for the most Religious are now a days grown more wise than to follow their Examples; and as for Lovers in this Age, I would not have 'em pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to't. I like your Drolling Method of Courtship much better, and should

much rather play the part of a Comick Stage-Lover in Iest, than prove your self a Tragick Fool in good Earnest, of which I am very sensible there's no great danger. According to my Promise, I will meet you at the place appointed, where I expect, according to yours, I shall meet with nothing but Civility, and you will Oblige,</hi>

            <p>Whether I had reason to like or dislike this pert Answer to my Letter, I'll leave the Reader to judge; I conn'd it over and over, as often as a young Priest does a Sermon, he designs to Preach without Book; and was mightily pleas'd to find my Mistress so witty; I hugg'd and Kiss'd it with as much pleasure as a <hi>Monkey</hi> would a <hi>Kitten,</hi> or an <hi>Old Woman</hi> her <hi>Grand-child;</hi> and was so wonderful fond of this new Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that I could have swallow'd it, as people do Charms, for an Ague, had it not been a dishonour to so sweet an Epistle, to have been convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a S—ce. I open'd it, and shut it, as often in a Day, as a <hi>Beau</hi> does his Snush-Box; and could no more think of Eating and Drinking till I see her again, than a Crying-out-Woman can of Copulation in the heighth of her Labour. In this kind of Intoxicated Condition, drunk between Love and Joy, I remain'd till the <hi>Monday</hi> Morning in <hi>Easter</hi> Week, when near the time of meeting, I posted to the place appointed, with as good a Will as ever a Coward run from danger, or a Fool into it: where I had not spent above as much time as a lusty Fellow requires to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a Charge to the Parish, but in comes my Lady, with such an Awful Presence, that the sight of her, as powerful as the Wind of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Bullet, had like to have knock'd me backwards, and struck me as dumb, that I was no more able to deliver the fine Speech I intended for her, without abundance of Hesitation, than <hi>Iockimo</hi> in Don <hi>Iohn</hi> was able without stammering to invite the Ghosts to Dinner with his Master; till after I had a little recover'd my self, like a Soldier after the first Onset, and then I began to be as Bold, as a Lover could well be with so much Beauty, upon so slender Acquaintance. 'Twill be a little too tedious to tell you in particular what past between us, Kisses and kind Words I apply'd with Eagerness, which on her part were received with a becoming Coyness. After we had prattled away, and spent a little time in these sort of Love-Toys, we determin'd to take Coach, being Holyday time, and go up to <hi>Highgate;</hi> proposing in our Journey to be greatly diverted with the humours of the Mob, as we pass'd along the Road, it being a Season of the Year, when Petty-Tradesmen and their, Wives, Prentices and Servant Wenches, Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys Clerks and School-Boys, Journey-men Shooemakers, and Taylor's with their Mates, Soldiers with their Trulls, in short, Tag, Rag, and Bobtail, all have recourse into the Fields, to recover the poor out-lying Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house-keepers from the hardships brought upon 'em by the past Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. As soon as we had fitted our selves with that Love, as well as Lazy Convenience, a Coach; I handed in my Mistress, and taking the

advantage of her Stride, blest my Eyes with a Glance of her Green Silk Stockins, and pretty Pettitoes, which my Chops water much more than the Cutting of a Lemon; and made my Heart go pit-a-pat, like a young Girle's that had stumbled in an Alley upon a pair of Active Lovers recreating themselves by Moonshine. Having thus put our selves in order to proceed our little Journey, for varieties sake, I'll give you the remainder in Verse, in hopes it may better please the Reader.</p>

               <l>In little time, to <hi>Islington</hi> we came;</l>
               <l>For Cakes and Ale, a Town of Ancient Fame;</l>
               <l>Which to this day's frequented for the same.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Where Whiffs so Sav'ry did our Nostrills Fan,</l>
               <l>From Cakes, Eel-Pies, and Tarts in Patti-Pan,</l>
               <l>Like Twelf-tide Air, in <hi>Wood-street</hi> newly drawn.</l>

               <l>At ev'ry Door, as we the Town pass'd thro',</l>
               <l>A basket of hot Buns was set in View;</l>
               <l>No doubt but some within were Butter'd too.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Those set without were to make Children Cry,</l>

               </l>
               <l>And when we pleas'd, Contemptibly look'd out</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Sometime drew up our Sashes made of Tin,</l>
               <l>To hide from Vulgars Eyes Loves Toys within;</l>
               <l>And when we'd done, we dropt 'em down agin.</l>

               <l>Our minutes might have been much more improv'd,</l>

               <l>The Coachman light to give his Carrion ease,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For all they kneel'd, his whip he would not spare,</l>
               <l>But Cut 'em up, and Curs'd the Lazy pair;</l>
               <l>And in his Thoughts pray'd backwards for his Fare.</l>

               <l>No Loaded Waggon in a soft deep Snow,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Others were Crowded into Ale-house yards,</l>
