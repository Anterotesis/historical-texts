         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>ARchbiſhop</hi>;</speaker>
               <p> SIR, Will you grant and keep, and by your Oath confirm to the people of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Laws and Cuſtoms to them granted by the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> your lawful and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Predeceſſors; And namely, the Laws, Cuſtoms and Franchiſes granted to the Clergy, by the Glorious King <hi>St. Edward</hi> your predeceſſor, according to the Laws of God, the true profeſſion of the Goſpel eſtabliſhed in this Kingdome, agreeable to the prerogative of the Kings thereof, and the ancient Cuſtomes of the Realm?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>KING,</speaker>
               <p> I grant and promiſe to keep them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p> SIR, Will you keep peace and Godly Agreement (according to your power) both to God, the holy Church, the Clergy, and the People?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>K.</speaker>
               <p> I will keep it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p> SIR, Will you to your power cauſe Law, Juſtice, and Diſcretion, Mercy and Truth to be executed to your Judgement?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>K.</speaker>
               <p> I will.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p> SIR, Will you grant to hold and keep the Laws, and rightful Cuſtomes which the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of this your Kingdome have? and will you defend and uphold them to the honour of God as much as in you lyeth?</p>

               <speaker>K.</speaker>
               <p> I grant and promiſe ſo to do.</p>

            <p>Then one of the Biſhops with a loud Voice before the people read to the King this following Admonition.</p>
            <p>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r Lord and King, VVe beſeech you to pardon, and to grant, and preſerve unto us and to the Churches committed to your Charge, all Canonicall priviledges, and to do Law and Juſtice; And that you would protect and defend us, as every good King to his Kingdomes ought to be <hi>Protector, and Defender</hi> of the Biſhops, and the Churches under their Government.</p>
            <p>The King anſwereth with a willing and devout Heart,</p>
            <p>I Promiſe and grant my pardon, and that I will preſerve and maintain to you, and the Churches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to your Charge, all Canonicall priviledges, and due Law and Juſtice; And that I will be your <hi>Protector,</hi> and <hi>Defender</hi> to my power, by the Aſſurance of God, as every good King in his Kingdome in right ought to protect and defend the Biſhops and Churches under their Government.</p>
            <p>Then the King ariſing was led to the Communion Table, where laying his hand upon the <hi>Bible,</hi> He, in the ſight of all people made a ſolemn Oath (to obſerve the premiſſes) which was as followeth;</p>
            <p>THe <hi>Things which I have promiſed, I ſhall perform and keep</hi>; So help Me God, and the Contents of this Book.</p>
            <p>Afterwards his Robes being taken off, and offered at the Alter, the King ſtood for a while ſtripped of his Dublet and Hoſe, of Sattin: then led by the Archbiſhop, and the Biſhop of <hi>St. Davids,</hi> he was placed in <hi>the chair of Coronatoin,</hi> having a cloſe Canopy ſpread over him, and while the Archbiſhop Anointed his Head, Shoulders, Armes, and Hands with a coſtly Oyntment, the Quire ſung an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them of theſe words; Zadock <hi>the Prieſt Anointed King</hi> Solomon.—</p>
            <p>Thence in his Doublet and Hoſe, with a white Coif on his Head, he was led back again to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion-table, where Doctor <hi>Laud</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>St. Davids,</hi> who ſupplyed the Dean of <hi>Weſtminſters</hi> place, Veſted him with the ancient Habiliments of King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> and conducting him back to the Chair of <hi>Coronation,</hi> preſented him with King <hi>Edwards</hi> Crown, which the Archbiſhop put upon his Head, and in the mean time the Quire ſung this Anthem;</p>
            <p>Thou ſhalt put a crown of pure Gold upon his Head.</p>
            <p>After which, the Earls and Viſ-counts put on their Coronetted Caps of Crimſon Velvet; then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Biſhop came ſeverally to the King, and gave him their <hi>Benediction</hi> and he riſing from his Chair bowed to each of them apart. Next King <hi>Edwards</hi> Sword was girt about him, which he took off himſelf, and offer'd at the Communion-table, with two ſwords more, in relation to <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>: His ſpurs were put on by the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> as Maſter of the Horſe; which done he offer'd firſt gold and ſilver, then bread and wine, to be uſed at the Communion.</p>
            <p>Thus compleatly Crown'd, the King was conducted by the Nobility to his Throne, where he receav'd the Oath of Homage, (the Quire in the mean time ſinging <hi>Te Deum</hi>) The Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> as Lord high Conſtable for that Day, who alſo ſwore the reſt of the Nobility at the Kings Knee, to be <hi>Homagers</hi> to his Majeſty; then the Earls and Barons laid their hands upon the Crown, as it was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Kings Head, making a ſolemn proteſtation to ſpend their blood to maintain it to him, and his poſterity: the Biſhops took no Oath, but kneeling down the King kiſſed each of them; then the King taking out of his boſome a ſcrowl of parchment, the effect of which was a promiſe of pardon under his broad Seal to all that accept it; gave the ſcrowl to the Lord Keeper, who read it four times, <hi>Eaſt, Weſt, North,</hi> and <hi>South.</hi> From the <hi>Throne</hi> the King went to the Communion-table, and after pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers had been read by the Archbiſhop, the <hi>Nicene Creed</hi> ſung by the Quire; and the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> and <hi>Goſpel</hi> read by the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Landaff,</hi> and <hi>Norwich</hi>; his Majeſty recev'd the Communion, the bread from the Archbiſhop, the Wine from the Biſhop of <hi>St. Davids</hi>: and at the ſame time, <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> was ſung; which being ended, the Archbiſhop reading certain prayers, concluded the <hi>Ceremony.</hi> After which, the King diſrobed himſelf in King <hi>Edwards</hi> Chappel, and came forth in a ſhort Robe girt of red Velvet; lin'd with <hi>Ermins</hi> and a leſſer <hi>Crown</hi> upon his head ſet with previous <hi>Stones,</hi> and taking barge with all his Train of Nobles at <hi>VVeſtminſter</hi> ſtairs, He returned to <hi>VVhitehall.</hi>
