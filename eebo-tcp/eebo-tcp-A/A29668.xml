         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lord Maior and Aldermen, and
the rest of the Gentlemen all here
assembled, I am to deliver a Message
to you from the Lords and Commons
now assembled in Parliament; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I shall do that, shall crave leave
to excuse something that hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
There should have been divers
Lords, and some Gentlemen of the
House of Commons here, far fitter
to have done this work, that is now
put upon me, if they could possibly
have attended the service, that were appointed by the House, as the
Lord Generall of the Horse, the Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> and some other
Lords, but you will all conceive, that they being all men imployed
in the Army, they could not attend this your service, but they are
about your service, and the good of the Kingdom, which is giving
order for your safety, and theirs; and therefore I hope you will take
it in good part, that there is no other appearance here. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that I have to say to you, in short is this, I suppose at this time
of action, you will not expect long prefacings; if you do, I am
the unfitteast man in the world to do it: I shall therefore shortly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
my Message; I doubt not but you have heard some whisperings
of an Accommodation, no doubt of that, and no man that is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
man, a Religious man, a Freeman, that loves Religion, and the
Kingdom, but would have an Accommodation, for nothing is more
miserable, and nothing is more distracting then War, but that an
Accommodation should come upon terms ignoble, and disadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
that never was in the thought of either House; and I hope
never will be; And I am to tell you, never shall be: I am at this time
to intreat you, in the name of both the Houses of Parliament, to go
on couragiously, and fight, and prepare your selves for that that is at
hand; we hear, the Enemies approach neerer every day, who aim at


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61271:3"/>
nothing else, but to swallow up our Religion, Lives, Liberties, and
Estates, and therefore it becomes you to labour to defend them all.
I have more to say, but it is better said here, they are the Votes of
the House of the Lords and Commons, I desire they should be read
unto you, and therein you will fully understand what their sense is,

               <p>THat was in the House of Commons, the meaning of this Vote
is, There was a safe Conduct sent by His Maiesty, to six persons;
two of the House of Lords, <hi>viz.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> and the
Earl of <hi>Northumberland;</hi> and four of the House of Commons;
among these there was one Sir <hi>Iohn Evelin</hi> of <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> the King
would not let him have a safe Conduct, because he was one that was
named by him a Traitor the day before, and that was (as is thought)
done on purpose to take him off from being one; therefore the
House of Commons did look upon that, as that he could not have a
safe Conduct: This Vote of theirs was presented to the House of
the Lords, and they concurr'd with it.</p>

which you may very well take notice of, His Majesty
will not, but upon termes altogether unfitting, accept of any Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from us, but at the same time is willing to receive a Petition
from the Rebells in Ireland; We are no Rebels, but dutifull in

            <sp>
               <p>MY Lord Maior, and Aldermen, and the rest of the Gentlemen
here assentbled, it is not unknown to you, with what difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
with what dangers both Houses of Parliament have a long time
conflicted, for to bring the Liberties, and the Religion, and the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of this Kingdom into such a posture, as might give all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
thereof full satisfaction: It is not unknown likewise, how
busie the Enemies of this great work have been, to cast Scandals, to
cast false Aspersions upon the proceedings, upon the carriages of
Parliament; They therefore thought fit (that they might undeceive
all persons of the greatest malice, and of the greatest opposition,
of their endeavours) not long since to frame a Petition, a Petition
full of humility, a Petition full of modesty, whereby they did desire
His Maiestie, that they might apply themselves to make Propositions
to him, as might effect this great work: This Petition, that it might
be delivered, they thought fit for to name (as this Noble Lord hath
told you) six persons, two of the Lords house, and four of the house


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61271:4"/>
of Commons; men that they though altogether without the least
scruple, without the least exceptions, knowing that nothing in the
carriage of these perfons could render them liable to exception, but
their duty, and their observance to the Commands of both houses;
when that these persons, the Names of them were sent to his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
for to have safe Conduct, immediately, I think the very day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
there came out a Proclamation against one of them, excepting
him out of the grace and favour of his Maiesty, (as it is termed) and
laying him in the condition of a Rebell, and of a Traytor against
him, for the obedience, and the observance of that he had perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Commands of Parliament: This being brought to both
houses, they looked at it as a businesse of such great importance, that
if they should suffer any one Member, or any one person, that
through his dutifulnesse and observing of their Commands, should
lye under a cloud with his Maiesty, should not be admited to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
but be looked at in such a condition, as this Proclamation put
him in; they looked at it as the greatest indignity, and the greatest
calumny that could befall a Parliament, and the greatest discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that should lye upon all men to stand to a Parliament, if they
should not be defended and protected. Hereupon they resolved
to declare, that the unwillingnesse lay not in them to make peace,
but it lay in that ill Counsell, and that desperate Counsell that hath
hemm'd in his Maiesty, and will not suffer such points, will not suffer
such Propositions as these to take effect with him, but will labour to
destroy all the Estates and Properties, and all that is neer and dear
to you in this Kingdom; therefore the house of Commons have
thought it fit to acquaint you with these proceedings, to let you
know how carefull they are by all good wayes, and by all good
means to present their loyalty, and duty to his Maiesty, to take care
of themselves, and all that belongs to you; but when they see all
will not take effect, they doubt not but you will ioyn cordially, and
ioyn resolutely, with your purses, with your endeavours, and all
that lyes in your power, to acquit your selves like men, to defend
your selves, to defend them that have labour'd in your work, in your
cause, and who are willing to spend their lives and blood in your
service to the utmost man; therefore they desire this of you, that
since they have taken this care, that you will hearken to no Reports
that shall tend to the disparagement of their proceedings; but will
unanimously concur, to defend your selves against that violence and

from you: I came this day to this place, to this house about a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
businesse, I have already communicated to my Lord Maior,
and the Aldermen, and the Committee, I think it will not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
you should know it; I have the consent of some that understand
this businesse very well to this I now shall do; Gentlemen the
message was this, it was a message from his Excellencie, it is to let
you know how neer the danger is at hand, that so you may gird
up the loynes of your Resolution, and do l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ke men of courage;
Gentlemen, Citizens of London, (better then whom, no man did
in that Army we had abroad) the Enemies, the Foot as we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
are very neer Stains, the horse they are about Kingston, we
cannot tell you that all are there, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>at there are both horse and
foot too, and it is certain our foot are going to it, so that the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is now, what is to be done? certainly, this is a certain truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all Souldiers, that you mnst keep evill as farre off you as you
can, you must not let it come neer your doores, you must not think
to fight in the sights, and teares, and eyes, and d'stractions of your
wives and children, but to go out, and meet it valiantly as you have
done: God hath shewed himself a God of love and mercy, and
truly we must give him all the honour of that day, certainly it is
the greatest Victory that ever was gotten: neer 2000. (I love to
speake with the least) on their side slain; and I am confident not
100 on our side, unlesse you will take in women and children, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and doggs (for they slew the very dogs and all) if you take in
women children and Carmen and dogs, then they slew about 200.
But that a 100 should be slain on one side, and 2000. on the other
side, is a very miraculous thing; he that dealt so wonderfully here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
it were to distrust him, if we did not think he would do so
again. Truly he hath a people among us exceedingly beloved, and


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61271:5"/>
what is it we fight for? it is for our Religion, for God, for liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and all, and what is it they fight for? for their lust, their will,
for tyrranny, to make us slaves, and to overthrow all; Gentlemen,
me thinks I see a face, and spy you ready to do any thing, and the
Generalls Resolution is, to go out to morrow, and do as a man of
courage and resolution, and never man did like him, for he was not
only Generall, but Common Souldier, for he led up his own Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and he led up his own Troop with his own person, and when
the left Troops of horse deceived him, he brought up the right
Troops; he himself will go out again and do again as much as he
hath done, and all this is for your sakes, for he can be a free-man,
he can be a Gentleman, he can be a great man, go where he will,
therefore it is onely for your sakes; he is resolved to go out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morow,
his forces are weary, his forces are spent, some came but
last night into town, some marched 20 miles march which is a great
march (as some that know what it is can tell) but as weary as they
are, he is resolved to go out, but if you will affect the cause, and
ioyne with him, hand and heart and sword, he will take it for a
savour, but if you will not he doubts not but Gideons sword will
do the work alone; I speake not it that I doubt you, but that you
would resolve, that when you here the drums beate, (for it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
that the drums shall beat to morow, our drums shall beat to
lead out our men, and the Committees drums shall beat to lead out
their men) say not (I beseech you) I am not of the Trained-band,
nor this, nor that, but doubt not to go out to worke and fight cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously,
and this shall be the day of your deliverance.</p>
