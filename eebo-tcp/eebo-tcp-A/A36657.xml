            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THOUGH it be dangerous to raise too great an expectation, especially in works of this Nature, where we are to please an unsatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Audience, yet 'tis reasonable to prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess them in favour of an Author, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both the <hi>Prologue</hi> and <hi>Epilogue</hi> inform'd you, that <hi>Oedipus</hi> was the most celebrated piece of all Antiquity. That <hi>Sophocles,</hi> not only the greatest Wit, but one of the greatest Men in <hi>Athens,</hi> made it for the Stage at the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Cost, and that it had the reputation of being his Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, not only amongst the Seven of his which are still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, but of the greater Number which are perish'd. <hi>Aristole</hi> has more than once admir'd it in his Book of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry, <hi>Horace</hi> has mention'd it: <hi>Lucullus, Julius Caesar,</hi> and other noble <hi>Romans,</hi> have written on the same Subject, though their Poems are wholly lost; but <hi>Seneca's</hi> is still pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd. In our own Age, <hi>Corneille</hi> has attempted it, and it appears by his Preface, with great success: But a judicious Reader will easily observe, how much the Copy is inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the Original. He tells you himself, that he owes a great part of his success to the happy Episode of <hi>Theseus</hi> and <hi>Dirce;</hi> which is the same thing, as if we should acknowledge, that we were indebted for our good fortune, to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plot of <hi>Adrastus, Eurydice,</hi> and <hi>Creon.</hi> The truth is, he
<pb facs="tcp:54480:3"/>
miserably fail'd in the Character of his Hero: if he desir'd that <hi>Oedipus</hi> should be pitied, he shou'd have made him a better man. He forgot that <hi>Sophocles</hi> had taken care to shew him in his first entrance, a just, a merciful, a success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, a Religious Prince, and in short, a Father of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: instead of these, he has drawn him suspicious, designing, more anxious of keeping the <hi>Theban</hi> Crown, than solicitous for the safety of his People: Hector'd by <hi>Theseus,</hi> contemn'd by <hi>Dirce,</hi> and scarce maintaining a second part in his own Tragedie. This was an errour in the first concoction; and therefore never to be mended in the second or the third: He introduc'd a greater Heroe than <hi>Oedipus</hi> himself: for when <hi>Theseus</hi> was once there, that Companion of <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> must yield to none: The Poet was oblig'd to furnish him with business, to make him an Equipage suitable to his digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and by following him too close, to lose his other King of <hi>Branford</hi> in the Crowd. <hi>Seneca</hi> on the other side, as if there were no such thing as Nature to be minded in a Play, is always running after pompous expression, pointed sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and Philosophical notions, more proper for the Study than the Stage: The <hi>French-man</hi> follow'd a wrong scent; and the <hi>Roman</hi> was absolutely at cold Hunting. All we cou'd gather out of <hi>Corneille,</hi> was, that an Episode must be, but not his way: and <hi>Seneca</hi> supply'd us with no new hint, but only a Relation which he makes of his <hi>Tiresias</hi> raising the Ghost of <hi>Lajus:</hi> which is here perform'd in view of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, the Rites and Ceremonies so far his, as he agreed with Antiquity, and the Religion of the <hi>Greeks:</hi> but he himself was beholding to <hi>Homer'</hi>s <hi>Tiresias</hi> in the <hi>Odysses</hi> for some of them: and the rest have been collected from <hi>Heliodore's, AEthiopiques,</hi> and <hi>Lucan's Erictho. Sophocles</hi> indeed is
<pb facs="tcp:54480:3"/>
admirable every where: And therefore we have follow'd him as close as possibly we cou'd: But the <hi>Athenian</hi> Theater, (whether more perfect than ours is not now disputed) had a perfection differing from ours. You see there in every Act a single Scene, (or two at most) which manage the business of the Play, and after that succeeds the <hi>Chorus,</hi> which commonly takes up more time in Singing, than there has been employ'd in speaking. The Principal person appears almost constantly through the Play; but the inferiour parts seldome above once in the whole Tragedie. The conduct of our Stage is much more difficult, where we are oblig'd never to lose any considerable character which we have once present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Custom likewise has obtain'd, that we must form an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-plot of second Persons, which must be depending on the first, and their by-walks must be like those in a Labyrinth, which all of 'em-lead into the great Parterre: or like so many several lodging Chambers, which have their out-lets in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same Gallery. Perhaps after all, if we could think so, the ancient method, as 'tis the easiest, is also the most Natural, and the best. For variety, as 'tis manag'd, is too often subject to breed distraction: and while we would please too many ways, for want of art in the conduct, we please in none. But we have given you more already than was necessary for a Preface, and for ought we know, may gain no more by our instructions, than that Politick Naton is like to do, who have taught their Enemies to fight so long, that at last they are in a condition to invade them.</p>

            <head>PROLOGUE.</head>
            <l>WHEN <hi>Athens</hi> all the <hi>Graecian</hi> State did guide,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Greece</hi> gave Laws to all the World beside,</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Sophocles</hi> with <hi>Socrates</hi> did sit,</l>
            <l>Supreme in Wisdom one, and one in Wit:</l>
            <l>And Wit from Wisdom differ'd not in those,</l>
            <l>But as 'twas Sung inVerse, or said in Prose.</l>
            <l>Then, <hi>Oedipus,</hi> on Crowded Theaters,</l>
            <l>Drew all admiring Eyes and listning Ears;</l>
            <l>The pleas'd Spectator shouted every Line,</l>
            <l>The noblest, manliest, and the best Design!</l>
            <l>And every Critick of each learned Age</l>
            <l>By this just Model has reform'd the Stage.</l>
            <l>Now, should it fail, (as Heav'n avert our fear!)</l>
            <l>Damn it in silence, lest the World should hear.</l>
            <l>For were it known this Poem did not please,</l>
            <l>You might set up for perfect Salvages:</l>
            <l>Your Neighbours would not look on you as men:</l>
            <l>But think the Nation all turn'd <hi>Picts</hi> agen.</l>
            <l>Faith, as you manage matters, 'tis not fit</l>
            <l>You should suspect your selves of too much Wit.</l>
            <l>Drive not the jeast too far, but spare this piece;</l>
            <l>And, for this once, be not more Wise than <hi>Greece.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:54480:5"/>See twice! Do not pell-mell to Damning fall,</l>
            <l>Like true born <hi>Brittains,</hi> who ne're think at all:</l>
            <l>Pray be advis'd; and though at <hi>Mons</hi> you won,</l>
            <l>On pointed Cannon do not always run.</l>
            <l>With some respect to antient Wit proceed;</l>
            <l>You take the four first Councils for your Creed.</l>
            <l>But, when you lay Tradition wholly by,</l>
            <l>And on the private Spirit alone relye,</l>
            <l>You turn Fanaticks in your Poetry.</l>
            <l>If, notwithstanding all that we can say,</l>
            <l>You needs will have your pen'worths of the Play:</l>
            <l>And come resolv'd to Damn, because you pay,</l>
            <l>Record it, in memorial of the Fact,</l>
            <l>The first Play bury'd since the Wollen Act.</l>

            <l>WHAT <hi>Sophocles</hi> could undertake alone,</l>
            <l>Our Poets found a Work for more than one;</l>
            <l>And therefore Two lay tugging at the piece,</l>
            <l>With all their force, to draw the pondrous Mass from <hi>Greece.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>A weight that bent ev'n <hi>Seneca's</hi> strong Muse,</l>
            <l>And which <hi>Corneille's</hi> Shoulders did refuse.</l>
            <l>So hard it is th' <hi>Athenian</hi> Harp to string!</l>
            <l>So much two Consuls yield to one just King.</l>
            <l>Terrour and pity this whole Poem sway;</l>
            <l>The mightiest Machines that can mount a Play;</l>
            <l>How heavy will those Vulgar Souls be found,</l>
            <l>Whom two such Engines cannot move from ground?</l>
            <l>When <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> have smil'd upon this Birth,</l>
            <l>You can but Damn for one poor spot of Earth;</l>
            <l>And when your Children find your judgment such,</l>
            <l>They'll scorn their Sires, and wish themselves born <hi>Dutch;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Each haughty Poet will infer with ease,</l>
            <l>How much his Wit must under-write to please.</l>
            <l>As some strong Churle would brandishing advance</l>
            <l>The monumental Sword that conquer'd <hi>France;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>So you, by judging this, your judgments teach</l>
            <l>Thus far you like, that is, thus far you reach.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:54480:45"/>Since then the Vote of full two Thousand years</l>
            <l>Has Crown'd this Plot, and all the Dead are theirs.</l>
            <l>Think it a Debt you pay, not Alms you give,</l>
            <l>And in your own defence, let this Play live.</l>
            <l>Think 'em not vain, when <hi>Sophocles</hi> is shown,</l>
            <l>To praise his worth, they humbly doubt their own.</l>
            <l>Yet as weak States each others pow'r assure,</l>
            <l>Weak Poets by Conjunction are secure.</l>
            <l>Their Treat is what your Pallats rellish most,</l>
            <l>Charm! Song! and Show! a Murder and a Ghost!</l>
            <l>We know not what you can desire or hope,</l>
            <l>To please you more, but burning of a <hi>Pope.</hi>
