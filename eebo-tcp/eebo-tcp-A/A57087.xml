            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>IT</hi> wou'd be almost a ridiculous excuse for a Satyr, that it is rough and undress'd, since in my Judgment that is one of the principal Characters of that way of writing. At least, what <hi>Spencer</hi> says of Love, is true of Grief, that 'tis <hi>nothing nice;</hi> and the more carelesly the Flowers are strow'd on the Herse of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd, the more natural and gracefully they'll appear. Were I in a humour to make Excuses, the next shou'd be, for some strokes here, severe enough on the fair Sex; for which they may, if they please, be angry without weighing the high occasion: But those who are so just to do so, I shall be so civil to own I except them out of those General Rules hereafter deliver'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100390:3"/>
As for those concern'd; if they are angry, I'm glad on't; if they rave, 'tis what I desire; and if they hang themselves, 'twou'd be the best action they ever did in their Lives; and, I believe, the only good one. Friends or Enemies be they, I'll detain 'em no longer in the Preface, but fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish that, and fall to work on the main business.</p>

               <l>In <hi>Tears</hi> or <hi>Blood</hi> thy Loud-tongu'd Wronges we'll write.</l>
               <l>Whilst ev'n thy <hi>Step-dame England</hi> pities thee,</l>

               <l>Her Groans are heard to both her distant Seas,</l>
               <l>From the <hi>Picts-wall</hi> to frozen <hi>Orcades;</hi>

               <l>Beyond black <hi>Styx</hi> and <hi>Lethe's</hi> lazy Stream:</l>
               <l>If Innocent <hi>Polixena</hi> must fall,</l>
               <l>O <hi>Thetis</hi> Son! to attend thy Funeral;</l>

               <l>More justly we to Satyrs rage expose</l>

               <l>Nay, her whole treach'rous perjur'd <hi>Sex</hi> comes in,</l>
               <l>Those Serpents made to <hi>tempt</hi> the World to Sin;</l>
               <l>Then <hi>damn</hi> 'em, and despise 'em for't—O why,</l>
               <l>(Might we thus reason with the Deity?)</l>
               <l>Are the less harmless <hi>Fiends</hi> in Darkness chain'd,</l>

               <l>To plague the World, yet still as <hi>fair,</hi> as bright</l>
               <l>As all their kindred Devils in <hi>Robes of Light?</hi>

               <l>All shapes they take, but all, alike, to vent</l>
               <l>Their malice deep, and gloomy discontent;</l>
               <l>And whom they can't <hi>destroy,</hi> at least <hi>torment.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>How blest were <hi>Man,</hi> how free from Pain and Vice</l>
               <l>And all the Earth ev'n yet one Paradice,</l>
               <l>Had not hard Fate for the <hi>alloy</hi> of Life</l>
               <l>Doom'd him to that <hi>Familiar Devil,</hi> a Wife;</l>
               <l>Condemn'd to th' <hi>Mines</hi> in that unhappy Ground,</l>
               <l>Where restless <hi>Sprites</hi> are ever hov'ring round</l>
               <l>'Tis true, when first the <hi>fatal Contract</hi>'s made,</l>

               <l>The miserable Captive hopes to find</l>
               <l>A long long happy <hi>Term of years</hi> behind:</l>
               <l>Happy as now his hasty Moments move,</l>

               <l>It mayn't, it can't, it shan't be otherwise.</l>

               </l>
               <l>O how th' enchanted heaps of <hi>Gold</hi> decay,</l>

               <l>Too late the Wretch repents, he grieves too late</l>
               <l>His desp'rate Fortunes, and his lost Estate,</l>
