            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Third Addreſs directed to his Excellency the Lord Generall <hi>CROMWELL,</hi> and the Right Honourable the <hi>Councell of State</hi> ſitting at WHITE-HALL: Being, The humble Petition of Lieutenant-Colonell <hi>John Lilburne</hi> Priſoner in <hi>Newgate.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat ſince your Petitioner in the confidence of your goodneſs and righteouſneſs caſt his life at your feet, he hath truly ſhewed by his humble Addreſſes to your Honours, that whilſt he lived in baniſhment, his life was no better then a conſtant dying unto him, beſides other ſtraits and extremities; his life being daily ſought for, and expoſed to conſtant and deſperate hazards by his enemies. And upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, together with the unwearied importunities and tears of his tender Wife, he was induced to come into <hi>England,</hi> being neither in the leaſt invited nor incouraged thereunto by any other but ſhe alone. Only he believed it better and more ſafe for him to caſt his life (notwithſtanding any prejudices of ſpirit whatſoever againſt him) upon the mercy and favour of thoſe, who zealouſly profeſs the fear of the Lord, and faith in the tender mercies of God in Chriſt, and had engaged in the ſame publike Cauſe with him againſt Tyrannie and Oppreſſion; then to be at the mercy of his falſe, cruel, and bloody Enemies beyond the Seas, who have no ſuch bonds upon their ſpirits.</p>
            <p>Yet to his grief, he finds no effect of his former addreſſes but his Impriſonment, in the moſt diſhonorable Goal; and as he is informed, an Order for his ſpeedy Trial upon the Act for his Baniſhment; without any the leaſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice taken of what he hath humbly offered to your Honours in his ſaid former addreſſes, concerning the illegality of the ſaid Act and all the proceedings thereupon.</p>
            <p>That upon a moſt ſerious ſearch into his own actions, and the very intentions of his heart, your Petitioner can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find the leaſt cauſe why he ſhould be rendred a perſon ſo abominable, that he is unfit to live or breath in this Commonwealth; only he feares that his intentions in comming hither in this juncture of time may be miſrepreſented to your Honours. Whereas he doth ſeriouſly and really profeſs as in the ſight of the Lord (that ſearcheth all hearts) that he hath herein truely and in the integrity of his ſoul, without deceit or guile in the leaſt, clearly declared the occaſion of his coming; and that he had no deſigne, end, or intention, but meerly to crave the protection of the preſent Power in all humility, and a peaceable and quiet ſubmiſſion to their Government, and to endeavour in all peaceable ways, that the juſtice of the ſentence paſſed againſt him might be legally and judicially examined, and the judgement revoked, that he might quietly live a private life, and enjoy the fellowſhip of his Chriſtian friends, and the ſociety of his deareſt wife, and tender babes: and unto this kind of life he is ready moſt ſolemnly to bind and ingage himſelf, and he believes many of his friends will free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ingage for his truth and integrity of real performance of his promiſe therein; and that he ſhall neither di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly nor indirectly diſturb, or in the leaſt moleſt the preſent Power and Government.</p>
            <p>That your Petitioner having never in the leaſt been charged nor accuſed of any Capital Crime in reference to his baniſhment, humbly craves your Honours ſeriouſly to conſider, wherein God ſhall be diſhonoured, or the Commonwealth damnified, or any honeſt member thereof prejudiced by his living and breathing in <hi>England;</hi> for whoſe real welfare, and the honeſt Inhabitants thereof, and their true tranquility, he hath for many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther run moſt real and apparent hazards, and that without eying in the leaſt any mercinary or pecuniary advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious ends unto himſelf.</p>
            <p>And likewiſe he moſt humbly intreats you ſeriouſly to conſider, wherein God ſhall be glorified, and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple comforted, the Commonwealth advantaged, or any Capital offenders terrified, by ſhedding your Petitioners innocent bloud, upon the breach of the ſaid Act for his baniſhment. And therefore if God ſhall ſo incline your hearts, he humbly prays,<lb/>
               <hi>That all Proceedings againſt him upon the ſaid Act may forthwith be ſuſpended; and that he may have free liberty to make his humble Addreſſes in a peaceable ſubmiſſive manner to thoſe that are and ſhall be intruſted with the Supreme Authority, for the repealing the ſaid Act. And that in the interim he may be freed from his chargeable Impriſonment, upon his moſt ſolemn engagement and ſecurity to live peaceably and quietly with his poor Family, in all obedience and ſubmiſſion to the preſent Power and Government.</hi>
