            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But then you ought to consider, what the <hi>import,</hi> and <hi>meaning</hi> was <hi>of that your Covenant,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you <hi>accepted God in Christ to be the God of your Son;</hi> and dedicated him <hi>to God</hi> through Christ <hi>to be his.</hi> Was it not absolute, and without limitation? that God should be a God to him entirely, and without reserve? and that he should be <hi>his,</hi> absolutely, and be dispos'd of by him, <hi>at his Pleasure?</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, there was a repugnancy, and contradiction, in <hi>the very terms</hi> of your Covenant. To be a God to him! Is not, <hi>God,</hi> the name of a Being incapable of limitation? Doth it not signify <hi>infinite unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Power, and Goodness?</hi> To be a God to any one, therefore, <hi>under restriction,</hi> is to be <hi>a God</hi> to him, and <hi>no God.</hi> And so to

Covenant with God, can neither have <hi>sincerity</hi> in it, nor <hi>good sense.</hi> He can be under no restraint, in the exercises of his <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> towards any, to whom he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safes to be <hi>their God in Covenant;</hi> but <hi>what</hi> he is pleased to lay upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; which must be from his <hi>own Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>good Pleasure,</hi> to which in covenanting we refer our selves; with <hi>particular Faith,</hi> in reference to what he hath expresly promis'd; and with <hi>general,</hi> that all <hi>shall be well,</hi> where his <hi>Promise</hi> is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press. But from our <hi>selves,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be prescribed to him. He must be <hi>our all,</hi> or <hi>nothing;</hi> in point of <hi>Enjoyment</hi> as our <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, all-comprehending Good; in point of Government,</hi> as our <hi>Sovereign all-disposing Lord.</hi> So we take him, <hi>in Covenanting with him,</hi> for <hi>our selves,</hi> and <hi>ours. For</hi> he <hi>so propounds,</hi> and offers


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48663:6"/>
himself, to us; If we <hi>accept,</hi> and take him accordingly, there is a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant between him and us, otherwise we <hi>refuse</hi> him; and there is no Covenant. <hi>When he promises,</hi> as to <hi>his part,</hi> he promises <hi>his all;</hi> to be <hi>God all-sufficient</hi> to us; to be <hi>ours</hi> in <hi>all his Fulness,</hi> according to our measure, and capacity: we are not straitned in him, but in our selves.

            <p>And whereas he is described by very distinct <hi>Titles,</hi> and <hi>Attributes,</hi> promiscuously interwoven in the preceding <hi>verses of the chapter, viz.</hi> that sometimes he is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced speaking <hi>in the stile of a God</hi>; as <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>I am</hi> Alpha, <hi>and Omega, the beginning, and the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.</hi> And again, <hi>v</hi> 11. <hi>I am</hi> Alpha, <hi>and</hi> Omega.

            <p>What an endearing obligation is this to obey! <hi>That he will be the Author of Eternal Salvation to them that obey him</hi>!

               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:48663:96"/>'Tis true, that service to God and our Redeemer in this present state, is <hi>necessary in its own kind,</hi> highly acceptable <hi>to God,</hi> and justly much valued by <hi>good Men.</hi> And we ought our selves willingly to submit to serve God in a meaner capacity in this World, while it is his pleasure we shall do so, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if God should have given any signification of his mind, concerning <hi>our abode in the Flesh,</hi> some longer time, as 'tis likely he had done to the Apostle <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 1.24. because he says, <hi>he was confident, and did know</hi> that so it should be, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. we should be abundantly satisfied with it, as he was.

because he was useeful in some obscure Country Village, is to be looked upon as lost, because his Prince, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of his great worth, calls him up to his Court, and finding him every way fit, employs him in the greatest affairs of State!</p>

that will soon be over, greater than those of our fixed, perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, everlasting State, that will never be over.</p>
            <p>If we would allow our selves the liberty of reasoning, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the measure and compass of our narrow minds, byast, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by private interest, and inclination, we should have the like plausible things to think, concerning <hi>such of ours as Die in Infancy,</hi> and that when they have but newly look't into this World, are presently again caught out of it; that if they had lived, what might they have come to? How pleasant and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting might their Childhood have been? How hopeful their Youth? How useful their Riper Age? But these are commonly thoughts little wiser than <hi>theirs,</hi> and proceed from a general infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,


<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48663:97"/>
or misbelief, that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not within the compass of this little, sorry, World, is all emptiness, and nullity! Or if such be pious and more conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, 'tis too plain they do not, however, consider enough, how great a part it is, of Divine mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, to take a reasonable immortal Spirit from animating a piece of well figured Clay, and presently adjoyn it to the general assembly above! How glorious a a change is made upon their Child in a moment! How much greater a thing it is to be adoring God above, in the Society of Angels, than to be dandled on their knee, or enjoy the best pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions they can make for them on Earth! That they have a part to act upon an Eternal Stage! and though they are but lately come into Being, are never to go

out of being more, but to be everlasting Monuments, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of the glory of their great Creator and Lord!</p>
            <p>Nor, perhaps, is it considered so deeply as it ought, that it hath seemed meet to the Supream Wisdom, upon a most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant reason, in the case of length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or shortning the Lives of Men, not ordinarily, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, than upon a great occasion, to interrupt the tendencies of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Causes, But let Nature run its Course: For otherwise, very frequent innovations upon Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, would make <hi>Miracles</hi> cheap, and common, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, useless to their proper, great ends, which may be of greater sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificancy in the course of Gods Government over the World, than some addition to this, or that Life can be worth. And


<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48663:98"/>
therefore should this consideration repress our wonderment, why God doth not, when he so easily can, by one touch upon this, or that second Cause, prevent, or ease the grievous pains, which they often suffer that love him, and whom he loves. He reckons it fitter, and they will in due time reckon so too themselves, when the wise methods of his Government come to be unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and understood, that we should any of us bear what is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to us, in point of pain, loss of Friends, or other unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing events of providence, than that he should make frequent, and less necessary breaches upon the common order, and course of Government which he hath establish't over a delinquent, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, World.</p>

            <p>A Family of eminent Note in that Northern part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for its antiquity, opulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and interest in the Country where it is seated; and which hath intermarried with some or other of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> one Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration after another. But hath been most of all considerable, and illustrious, <hi>as</hi> having been it self, long, the immemorial known seat of <hi>Religion, Sobriety,</hi> and <hi>Good Order,</hi> from <hi>Father,</hi> to <hi>Son</hi>; giving <hi>Example, Countenance,</hi> and <hi>Patronage</hi> to these praise-worthy things to the Country round about. And wherein, hitherto (through the singular favour and blessing of Heaven) there hath not been that visible dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy,


<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48663:100"/>
that might be so plainly observed, and sadly deplored, in divers great Families. As if it were an exemption from what was so anciently remarked by the <hi>Poet, Aetas Parentum, pejor avis,</hi> — &amp;c. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, such as have succeeded, have, by a laudable ambition, and emulation, as it were, striven to outshine such as have gone before them in <hi>Piety,</hi> and <hi>vertue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this bright and lucid tract and line, was this most hopeful young Gentleman, now arrived to the Age wherein we use to write Man, beginning to stand up in view, and to draw the Eyes, and raise the hopes of observers, and well-wishers, as not likely to come short of any of his worthy Ancestors, and Predecessors. But <hi>Heaven</hi> had its Eye upon him too, and both made and judg'd

him meet for an Earlier translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to a more eminent Station <hi>there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was from his childhood ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to be above the common rate, <hi>docile,</hi> of <hi>quick apprehension, solid judgment,</hi> and <hi>retentive me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mory,</hi> and, betimes, a lover of Books and Learning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For Religion; his knowledge of the Principles of it,</hi> continually grew, as his capacity did more &amp; more admit, under the Eye and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of his Parents, and such other Instructors, as they took care he should never want. But <hi>his Savour and Relish thereof,</hi> and the <hi>impression</hi> made thereby up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n his Soul, was so deep, and so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as to be apparently owing to an <hi>higher cause,</hi> the gracious ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Holy Spirit, and a singular blessing thereby, upon his pious Education. And in


<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48663:101"/>
this way, it could not be easie to such as were his most diligent, &amp; constant observers, to conclude, or conjecture, when God first began to deal with his Spirit.</p>
            <p>Above ten years ago, I had opportunity for a few days, to have some converse with him, in his Fathers House. And, as I could then perceive, his Spirit was much tinctured with Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; so I received information, that for a considerable time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there constantly appeared in him such <hi>specimina</hi> of serious Piety, as were very <hi>comfortable</hi> to his <hi>Parents,</hi> and might be <hi>instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> to <hi>others,</hi> that took notice of them.</p>
            <p>In the course of divers follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing years, he greatly improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, under Domestick, and Private Instruction, both in Grammar-Learning, and Academical Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48663:102"/>
for which he wanted not apt helps. When there was great reason to hope he was so well establish't in Religion and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as neither to be shock't by the importunate temptations of a <hi>sceptical vicious Age in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> or betrayed by the facility of his <hi>own youthful Age.</hi> His prudent, worthy Father, judged it requisite, and not unsafe, to adventure him into a place of more hazard, but greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, for his accomplishment in that sort of culture, and polish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that might, in due time, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him both in <hi>reality,</hi> and with <hi>better reputation,</hi> serviceable in a Publick Station, <hi>i. e.</hi> where he might gain such knowledge of <hi>the World,</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> and of the <hi>Laws of his Country,</hi> as were proper for his rank, and one that was to make such a figure in the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,


<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48663:102"/>
as it was to be hoped he might. And upon that Account, not yet a year agoe, brought him up to <hi>London,</hi> entered him in the <hi>Temple,</hi> took for him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Lodgings there, and left him settled, unto mutual satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p>He was little diverted by the noise, novelties, or the gaities of the Town, but soon betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to a course of close Study; discontinued not his converse with God, and thereby learn't, and was enabled, to converse with Men, warily, and with caution; so as he might be continually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving and gaining good, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing, or receiving hurt.</p>
            <p>The Substance of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Account, I received from a pious intelligent young Man, who several years attended him before his coming to Town, and


<pb n="172" facs="tcp:48663:103"/>
afterwards, to the finishing of his course.</p>

               <hi>Mr.</hi> Hoghton<hi>'s early Seriousness, increased with his years.

            <p>
               <hi>Vpon his apprehension of Death, he seemed very little discouraged, but quietly resigned himself into the hands of the all-wise Disposer of All things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some time before his Sickness, and in the time of it, he said, Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were very proper for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>He often repeated those words, in the beginning of his illness.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:48663:104"/>— <hi>'Tis an hard thing to make</hi> our Calling, and our Election sure.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>When he understood, from some expressions of his</hi> Physician, <hi>how dangerous his Distemper was, he said, he knew very well the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his</hi> Physicians <hi>words; But that however it proved, he hoped he was safe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He was so strict in the observation of the Lords day, that if he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to lie longer than ordinary in the Morning, he would continue the later in Duties, in the Evening; saying, we ought not to make that Day shorter than other Days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Though he was very intent on his Studies, yet on</hi> Saturdays <hi>he always broke them off at Noon, and spent the Afternoon in reading Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and preparing himself for the Lords Day.</hi>

               <hi>He was always constant in his secret Duties, and suffered nothing to hinder him from the performing of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Before he expired, he spoke with great assurance of his Future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, and hopes of meeting his Relations in Glory. Thus far goes that Account.</hi>

            <p>His Sickness was short. When, hearing of it, I went to visit him, I was met in an Ante-chamber, by his ingenious, dear, Brother, to whom it is no reproach to be <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> to him, and who, it is to be hoped, will be at least, truly so; making him, though a <hi>fair Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> yet not a <hi>Standard</hi>; who hath for divers years, been most intimately conjunct, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant with him, <hi>known his way, his Spirit, his manner of Life, his purity</hi>: And may be led on, and

excited thereby, wherein he hath observed him to <hi>excel others,</hi> to endeavour not to come short, but, if it were possible, to <hi>excel him</hi>; remembring, he is to be the next <hi>solace</hi> of his Parents, <hi>hope</hi> of his Family, and resort of his Country (if God shall vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to continue him) in succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time.</p>

            <p>Nor now will it be unfit, to shut up <hi>the Discourse,</hi> with some few, suitable <hi>Reflections,</hi> upon this double Subject. The <hi>Text,</hi> and <hi>This Providence,</hi> taken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:48663:106"/>1. How happy is it! when <hi>this Power,</hi> of our Great Redeemer, and Lord, mention'd in <hi>the Text,</hi> and a <hi>preparation,</hi> with <hi>chearful willingness,</hi> dutifully to comport with it, concur and meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as they have done <hi>in this instance.</hi> Our Lord hath shewn his Power. He <hi>asserted it,</hi> in the Text. In this Instance he <hi>used</hi> it, giving an open Testimony, that he takes it to belong to him, to make such translations from <hi>one</hi> World, to <hi>another,</hi> whensoever he judges it a fit season. Nor is so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous, whether men acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his <hi>right,</hi> so to do, or no; or what Censures they will pass upon what he hath done. He doth his <hi>own work,</hi> and leaves men to their <hi>own talk,</hi> or mutterings, or wonder, or amusement at it, as they will. So it becomes <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power</hi> to do, <hi>establish't</hi> upon


<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48663:106"/>
the most <hi>unquestionable founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; exercis'd</hi> according to the <hi>wisest and most righteous Measures.</hi> He hath used his <hi>own right,</hi> and satisfied himself in the use of it. He thought not himself concern'd to advise with any of us, about it, <hi>who, as his Counsellor, should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct him</hi>? Isa. 40.13. Rom. 11. v. 34. He <hi>owes</hi> so much <hi>to himself,</hi> to act as <hi>unaccountable</hi> to no one, nor liable to any ones <hi>controll.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is most rightful, resistless Power, justly and kindly us'd <hi>on the one hand</hi>;</p>
            <p>And, <hi>on the other,</hi> how placid, how calm, a resignation! Here was no striving! no crying! no reluctant motion, no querulous, repining voice. Nothing but peaceful, filial submission; a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness to obey the Summons given.</p>
            <p>This was an happy accord, the


<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48663:107"/>
               <hi>willingness</hi> of this departing Soul, proceeding not from <hi>stupidity,</hi> but <hi>trust, in him who kept these Keys</hi>; and such <hi>preparedness</hi> for removal, as the Gospel requir'd. O happy Souls! that finding the Key is turning, and opening the door for them, are willing to <hi>go forth</hi> upon <hi>such</hi> terms, as <hi>knowing whom they have believed,</hi> &amp;c. And that neither <hi>principalities or powers —life or death</hi>— &amp;c. <hi>can ever se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate them from the Love of God in Christ Jesus their Lord. Life,</hi> they find, hath not separated—where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was the greater danger; and <hi>Death</hi> is so far from making <hi>this separation,</hi> that it shall compleat their <hi>Vnion</hi> with the blessed God in Christ, and lay them infolded in the everlasting Embraces of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love!

            <p>O the transports of Joy that do now most rationally result from <hi>this state of the Case</hi>! when there is nothing left, lying between the dislodging Soul, and the <hi>glorious unseen World,</hi> but only the <hi>dark passage of Death</hi>; and <hi>that</hi> so little formidable; considering who hath the Keys of the <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>the other.</hi> How reasonable is it upon the account of somewhat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon herein, to the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and the <hi>Redeemed,</hi> (altho' every thing

For thou wilt not leave my Soul in</hi> Sheol, <hi>or Hades</hi>; thou wilt not forsake, or abandon it in that wide World, <hi>neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption.</hi> Thou wilt shew me the path of Life; the path that leads unto that <hi>presence of thine,</hi> where is fulness of Joy; and <hi>to those pleasures which are at thy right hand</hi>; or in thy power, and which are for <hi>evermore</hi>; and shall never admit either of end, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>Now, what do we mean to let our Souls hang in doubt? why do we not drive things for them, to an issue? Put them into those <hi>same safe hands</hi> that <hi>holds these Keys</hi>; absolutely resign, devote,

That the most spiteful Enemy we have in all the World, cannot do us that spite, to keep us from dying! How gloriously may good Men triumph, over the impotent malice of their most mischievous enemies, <hi>viz.</hi> that the greatest mischief, even in their own Account, that it can ever be <hi>in their power</hi> to do them, is to put it out of their <hi>own power</hi> ever to hurt them more (for they now go quite out of
