            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For thereby founde I great soule profite, a little minde knowlage, some holow hertes, and a few feith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full freendes. Wherby I tried prisonment of the body, to be
<pb facs="tcp:11595:3"/>
the libertee of spirite: aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of fortune: the touche stone of freendship, exempcion from the world, to be a contempt of vanitees: and in the ende qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes of mind, the occasion of study. And thus somewhat al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, to auoide my olde idel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to recompense my lost time, and to take profite of my calamitee, I gaue my selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other thynges to study and learne the Frenche tonge, hauyng both skilful prisoners to enstruct me, and therto plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of bookes to learne the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. Among whiche as there were dyuerse notable, and for their sondry mattier woorthy readyng, so none liked me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue this Tullius booke of

freendship, nor for the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment any with it to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The whole wherof whan I had perused, and saw the goodly rules, the naturall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ciuile vse of freend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, where before I but liked, than was I rauished, and in a certaine wonder with the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then lernyng, which chiefly for it selfe I phantasied, and for my state I deemed good to be embraced, as a glasse to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne my freendes in, and a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile rule to leade my life by. These causes moued me to thinke it mete for moe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apon I (as I coulde) transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, and though not so liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor yet so aptly, as some wold loke for, and many culd

doe, yet I trust thei will rather beare with my good will, then rebuke my boldnes, for that it proceded more of a good mind than of any presumpcion of knowlage: and so my enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise is to be enterpreted rather by freendes, as a treatise of frendship, then by lerned clerkꝭ in an argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of translacion. Well, how so euer it shalbe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of the learned, I hope it shalbe allowed of the vnlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Whose capacitees by my owne I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider, and for lacke of a fine and flowyng stile, I haue vsed the plaine and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon speache. and to thende the sence might not be chaunged, nor the goodnes of the matter by shift of tounges, muche mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
<pb facs="tcp:11595:4"/>
I caused it to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred with the latine auctor, and so by the knowen wel ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be corrected: after whose handelyng me thought a new spirite and life was geuen it, and many partes semed as it were with a new cote araied, aswell for the orderly placyng and eloquently changeyng of some woordes, as also for the plainly openyng and learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amending of the sence, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che in the Freenche translaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was somewhat darkened, and by me for lacke of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage in many places missed.</p>
            <p>¶Thus whan the thing was perfected, and I behelde the fame of the auctor, the nature of the treatise, and the clere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb facs="tcp:11595:5"/>
of his teachyng, I coulde not iudge to whom I shoulde rather offre it, than vnto your grace, whom the freendelesse dayly find their defence, and the helples repaire to as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge. This did I not to teache you, but to let you see in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng auncient, that you haue by nature vsed: nor to warne you of ought you lacked, but to sette forth your perfection: the proufe wherof the deade might witnesse, and their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring hath iust cause to know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lage it, as mo can record it, then can requite it.

Yet to withstande the earnest desires of a mans freendes, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in an honeste matter, partlie it is an harde thyng to doe, and partly not well stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng with reason. Wherfore many times thinkyng of frend shippe, this was woont to be chiefly weighed of me, whether for staie and for neede, menne ought to seeke for fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dship, to thentent that in doyng and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng of pleasures, one mighte

receiue of another,<note place="margin">Wherfore freendes are sought</note> that he told not come to by him selfe, and after that sorte mighte requite others: and whether this were the very propertee of fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dship, or elles there were some other cause more ancient, more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, and more proceding of nature. For loue, wherof freendly loue and freendshippe commeth, is the chiefe cause, to fasten good willes together.
