            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>how much more when I ſend my foure ſore Iudgments upon</hi> Ieruſalem, <hi>the ſword, and the famine, and the noyſome Beaſt, and the Peſtilence, to cut off from it man and Beaſt?</hi> Where you may be pleaſed to obſerve, the ſword is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one of the foure, but the firſt of the foure; the moſt devouring, the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying, God uſually ſendeth none of theſe judgments, but when his patience is much wounded, when his Royall Indignation is kindled, when his Iuſtice
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44248:19"/>
is forced, when his mercy hath no more to ſay. God hath a ſtore houſe, a rich treaſury, a Magazen of judgments, there are all Inſtruments of death, and bloud, ſickneſſe to death, and ſickneſſes not to death, Agues and Feavours and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, and theſe God uſually ſends before the deſtroying Peſtilence, God hath his Staffe, and his Rod, his Bow and his Arrowes, with theſe he corrects the ſons of men, before he drawes his ſword, his ſword furbiſhed and glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, to make a ſore deſtruction, Iupiter throwes not at firſt his dreadfull Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolts, The heavens uſually grow darke and blacke, the clouds gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the raine falls, the lightning breaketh forth, the ſword, the famine, the noyſome beaſt, and the Peſtilence, they are in the darkeſt, in the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward roome of the Caſtle and Tower, which God never opens till he be hard put to it, till his leſſer judgments are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed: ſee the method of Gods procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,<note place="margin">Lev. 26.18, 28.</note>
he will proceed from few to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, from leſſe to greater, he will puniſh us <hi>ſeaven times more for our ſinnes,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:44248:20"/>
when the foure winds breake looſe, when any of theſe foure judgements come, then God is angry indeed; of theſe foure judgments, the ſword; the famine, the peſtilence, and noyſome beaſts, the ſword is the worſt of the foure, that which God reſerveth till the laſt, as the greateſt witneſſe of his diſpleaſure, and the ſwifteſt meſſenger for our deſtruction: any one of theſe foure, brings feare and trembling, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and terror, paleneſſe and death: if the peſtilence, which is but Gods Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, if that bee let off of the ſtring, though in any part of the kingdome, the Arrow that flyes in the darke, that uſually poyſons moſt in the darke cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the land, amongſt the pooreſt ſort of people, yet what a feare it ſtrikes into the body of the whole kingdome; if but one Citie be infected, what flying out of the Citie, what watch and ward, what ſtrict examination and doings of all that come from that Citie, every one being like <hi>Cain,</hi> afraid of every one that meete them leaſt they ſhould kill them, runnagates upon the face of the earth,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44248:20"/>
Remember the feare that ſurpriſed you, when GOD ſhot this Arrow but into one houſe of this Towne, when it fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the heart-bloud but from a few, what flying, what poſting away, your ſelves, your houſeholds? my Brethren, if the plague bee ſo terrible, what will the ſword bee, that comes after the plague, more fierce, more terrible, by how much the mercies of man, are leſſe then the mercies of <hi>God,</hi> yea when the ſword comes the reſt of theſe foure Iudgements attend on it, The plague may come alone, and the famine may come alone, and noyſome beaſts may come alone, theſe oftentimes come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſword, if poſſible, to prevent it, but when they cannot doe the work, the ſword will then contemne the rod,<note place="margin">Eze 21.10</note>
ſet at naught what ever the former judgments have done, it will come fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhed and ſharpened, and this blacke guard of peſtilence, famine, noyſome beaſts, will be at the heeles of it, The ſword layes men dead in the fields, it ruines Townes and houſes, it leaves the fields unplowed, unharrowed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſowed,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44248:21"/>
hence famine growes grievous, that kills whom the ſword eſcapes, the noyſome ſtinch of the dead begets plagues, that and the famine together poyſonous beaſts, travell over thoſe parts of <hi>Germany</hi> where the ſword hath raged, and tell me if the plague, the famine and the peſtilence, if one of theſe plagues be ſo terrible, what will they all be, when they are confederate and joyn'd in one, when the ſword comes there will be no eſcape, for hee that flyes the one ſhall bee overtaken with the other, The ſword is one of Gods foure laſt judgments, the laſt of the foure, that which hath the reſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on it.</p>
            <p>Secondly the miſery that war brings is of that nature, that the ſpirit of inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous and free borne men (of which we are, if any nation under heaven be) can the leaſt brook it, of any judgment, <hi>Goe</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Gad,</hi>

               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:44248:21"/>
that he never did (as I read of) to any beſide, that hee ſhould chooſe the rod, <hi>David</hi> had offended, there was ſome ranke bloud in his veines, GOD muſt let him bloud, or he muſt dye, and better hee muſt looſe his corruption, then GOD loſe him; purge him God will, but whether with Pills, or with Potions, or with ſome Chymicall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, <hi>David</hi> hath the choiſe, <hi>chooſe thee one of them:</hi> there was three evils propoſed unto him, three of the greateſt evils, three of thoſe foure evils which God uſually reſerves to the laſt, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, <hi>David</hi> muſt chooſe one, and by this he was ſure, he ſhould not be afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all, <hi>I am in a great ſtraite,</hi> Hee was much troubled, terrified, affrighted,<note place="margin">Verſe 14.</note>
whereever he ſhould make his choiſe, miſery would follow his election; the leaſt of the three judgments was plague enough, yet he reſolves, <hi>Let us fall now into the hand of the Lord, (for his mercies are great) and let me not fall into the hand of man,</hi> It is uncertaine what Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>DAVID</hi> made choiſe of, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the plague or the famine, 'tis

certaine he would not have the ſword, hee had rather have any Iudgement then to flye before his enemies, Indeed of all judgments it is the judgement of judgments, I may call it the plague of plagues, which an ingenuous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can leaſt ſtoope to. <hi>Iob</hi> the mirror, the miracle of patience,<note place="margin">Iob 30 1, 8.</note> ſhewed as much impatience in this temptation as in any, <hi>I am in deriſion with them that are yonger then I, whoſe fathers I would have diſdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to have ſet with the dogs of my flocke, yea whereto might the ſtrength of their hands profit mee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they were children of fooles, children of baſe men, they were viler then the earth, they made mee their ſong:</hi> peruſe <hi>Habacuk</hi> the firſt, from the fifth verſe to the eleaventh, <hi>Behold yee among the heathen, and regard and wonder marveilouſly, for I will worke a worke in your dayes, which you will not believe though it bee told you.

            <p>Thirdly, this judgment, of all judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, God is the moſt backwards, the moſt unwilling to bring upon his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, this ſhowes the greatneſſe of it, Phyſitians will try all meanes, before they will cut off, they will let bloud, preſcribe Pills and Potions, <hi>Sed ſi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuerit malum, &amp; ignis adhibetur &amp; ferrum.</hi> The ſword is the laſt thing that God will uſe, yea God ſeemes to be afraid to uſe it, and therefore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres it from day to day, from yeare to yeare.

            <p>Laſtly, ſee ſome aggravating circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this judgment, men are ever

made the inſtruments of warre, and therefore this judgment is greater then that immediately comes from GOD, thoſe inſtruments of cruelty, the leſſe they have of reaſon, the more unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, the more fierce in their cruelties, hence the mercies of man are cruelty in reſpect of God, the cruelties of beaſts farre worſe than the rage of man, the warre of Inanimate creatures, more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging then that of the beaſt, The <hi>Lion,</hi> the <hi>Tyger</hi> know their bounds better then the fire, the water, yet the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation of the more eminent and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, is worſe then the meere nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the other: when patience is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed in GOD it turnes into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt fury, the leaſt ſparke of his hell, is greater than the greateſt fire on earth: when men loſe their reaſon, they are more mad then the beaſt that never had it; bloudy minded men are the Inſtruments of this puniſhment, and of them, the moſt ſtrong and ſtout and luſty, the moſt irreligious, licentious, and violent perſons, the moſt baſe, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and dung-hill people; Againe in

            <p>Secondly, conſider the great danger we are in, of looſing our peace, of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into the miſery of warre; GOD deales fairely in the adminiſtration and

            <p>Firſt, lay to heart that God hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready viſited us with all other plagues and judgements, yea hee hath gone them over againe and againe: how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hath the Land groaned under the plague; what dearths and ſcarcities have we had: what ſecret and waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judgments have beene conſuming of us?

               <hi>And becauſe I will come, prepare to meete thy God, O Iſrael,</hi> God will come like a man of warre, prepare to meete the Lord; See if thou be able to ſtand againſt him with his ſword drawne, furbiſhed and ſharpened, ready to make a ſore deſtruction, God hath gone over other Iudgments againe and againe, therefore we may well feare the ſword is now comming.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God hath ſent the ſword amongſt other nations, wee hitherto
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44248:27"/>
(like <hi>Gideons</hi> fleece) have beene dry, when all the earth about us hath beene drencht with bloud; the ſword hath beene in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> in the Palatinate, in <hi>Denmarke;</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Holland.</hi> The Cloud hitherto hath bin violently carryed from us, and hath emptyed it ſelfe in other parts; The ſword hath beene filled with bloud and hath beene made fat with fatneſſe, drunke with bloud: when the Angell of the Lord with his drawne ſword had viſited other places of the kingdome, at laſt he came and ſtood over <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> when God hath gone through other Lands, and Countryes, through other kingdomes and Churches, he will then ſheath his ſword upon us. The Iudges they are now in their Circuit, they have their Commiſſion from the King, to goe from one County to another, the Iudges before they have done they will come in their Circuit to us, wee muſt have our Aſſizes, God hath given his ſword a Commiſſion, it hath beene ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares in the Circuite, 'tis now come neere unto us: The ſword cannot bee
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44248:28"/>
quiet, See <hi>Ieremy</hi> 47.6, 7. <hi>O thou ſword of the Lord, how long will it bee ere thou be quiet? put up thy ſelfe into thy ſcab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berd, rest and bee ſtill; How can it bee quiet, ſeeing the LORD hath given it a charge againſt ASKELON, and againſt the Sea-ſhore? there hath hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſword hath beene long unſhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, and hath gone in triumph over all the world, beſides, how can it bee quiet, till it come among us? See what danger we are in, the ſword hath beene in other parts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, conſider warre hath beene at our very doores, we have not only heard of it with our eares, but our eyes have ſeene the ſmoake, the fire of it hath toucht our bodies, the enemy hath beene as neere us as <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Saul</hi> when he cut off the lap of his garment. The laſt yeare was not the enemy ſtrong up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our coaſt, a Potent, a powerful, a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious enemy? I queſtion not the end of their comming, God and they know it, but was not the warre at our gates, did not the States, and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:44248:28"/>
fight before our eyes when wee ſtood ſtill and looked on? God might have joyned them together againſt <hi>England.</hi> But he made their ſword drunke in the bloud one of another, as the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> made their ſervants, and ſlaves drunke, that we might ſee it, and feare. Againe was not the Trumpet the laſt yeare blowne, was not a Generall made choiſe of, Leivtenants, Coronels, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and all officers, were there not many horſe and foote, they that went voluntary, and they that were preſſed? did not the King goe himſelfe, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſet up his Royall ſtanderds, lye in the eye, in the ſight of the enemy, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſword was then drawne, the knife was at the throate, the men of warre were prepared for the fight, there was great expence of men, time and money, yet then the Lord delivered us, he returned the King backe again, and we had peace, <hi>David</hi> was in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger when <hi>Saul</hi> and his men of warre en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed him about, yet then GOD brought <hi>Saul</hi> backe againe, <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was ſtraitly beſieged by the <hi>Caldeans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 37.5.</note>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:44248:29"/>
yet God haſted them away, warre was at the back-doore.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, conſider the warre is now begun, the ſword hath begun to eate and drinke our fleſh and bloud, now is the time that Kings goe forth unto war, Our preparations are farre greater, our hope of preſervation farre leſſe, relapſe is the moſt dangerous; The ſecond wrath is ſeldome appeaſed, God is now ingaged in the warre, the meanes of deliverance became vaine and empty, there hath beene ryſings and rebellions in the chiefe Citie of the Kingdome, the Ordinances of warre are in print a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, the men of warre are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, wee waite daily to heare of ſome bloudy encounter, of ſome fearefull Stratagem, of ſome devilliſh damnable Maſſacre, ſome horrid and dreadfull Tragedy;<note place="margin">Mat. 16.3.</note> The Phariſees were weather-wiſe, it will bee foule weather to day, the skie is red and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, they could diſcerne the face of the sky, but they could not diſcerne the ſignes of the times, caſt up your eyes and you ſhall ſee a Cloud comming
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44248:29"/>
from the Sea, black and dreadfull, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the face of the heaven; hearken a little, and you ſhall heare a ſound of abundance of Raine, yea the drops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to fall upon your faces, ſtand ſtill and be quiet, and you may behold the approach of the enemy, the horror, the terror they bring with it, certainely he that ſees not that there is but one ſtep betwixt him and death, that we are all but dead men, hee is either blind or ſtarke madde; for the Sword is drawn, Warre is fully prepared, War is ready.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, conſider what poſſibility there is yet of eſcape, what probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, what hope, what comfort remaines; Is there no balme in <hi>Gilead?</hi> Is there no Phyſitian there? <hi>Iacob</hi> was almoſt deſperate, the famine was ſore in the Land; <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was not, <hi>Simeon</hi> was not, they were taking away <hi>Benjamin</hi> alſo. The Chiefe Governour of <hi>Egypt,</hi> hee ſpake roughly to them, he impriſoned them as ſpies, hee conjures them that they ſhould not ſee his face without their brother <hi>Benjamin, Iacob</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved hee ſhould not goe, his ſonnes

would not goe without him, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine encreaſed upon them, ſomething therefore <hi>Iacob</hi> muſt doe,<note place="margin">Gen. 43.11</note> 
               <hi>If it muſt bee ſo now</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>doe thus, take of the beſt fruits of the Land in your veſſels, and bring the man a preſent, a little Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and a little hony, ſpices, and Myrrhe, Nutts and Almonds, and take double money in your hand, and the money that was brought againe in your ſackes mouthes, carry it againe in your hands, leſt it were ſome overſight, Take alſo your Brother and ariſe, and goe againe to the man; And God Almighty give you mercy in the ſight of the man, that hee may deliver you your other Brother and Benjamin, &amp;c.</hi> There is the ſame beame of light and comfort left to us as was to <hi>Iacob,</hi> there lyes a neceſſitie upon us, it muſt bee ſo, wee muſt downe into Egypt, there is yet a little Balme in <hi>Gilead,</hi> we muſt take double money, increaſe our prayers to God, wee muſt pray, <hi>God Almighty give us mercy, &amp;c. David</hi> was exceedingly diſtreſſed when the <hi>Amalekites</hi> burnt <hi>Ziklag,</hi> and had carried their wives and al that they

had, captive, when all his people were diſheartened and diſcouraged, when they lift up their voyces and wept, when they mutined againſt <hi>David,</hi> and ſpake of Stoning of him, yet then <hi>David</hi> encouraged himſelfe in the <hi>Lord,</hi> there is yet this left,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 30.8.</note> how ever wee are ſore diſtreſſed, yet we may encourage our ſelves in the Lord, we may enquire of the Lord; Conſider therefore (to encourage you to this duty) this leading mercy that God hath vouchſafed unto us, this libertie and opportunitie, that God hath given unto us, this price that God hath put into our hands, that the whole kingdome may yet appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and cry unto GOD: my Brethren, this is not a little mercy. In the Prophet <hi>Malachy's</hi> time, when the ſtate of Gods Church and people was as deſperate as now, both in reſpect of ſinne, and in reſpect of judgment,<note place="margin">Mal. 3.16.</note> they that feared the Lord ſpake often one to another; It was a priviledge, they might have ſuch free acceſſe, ſuch communion, ſuch fellowſhip together, the times have beene, when the people
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44248:31"/>
of God have fled into the wilderneſſe, into the deſerts, into dens and caves, when they could not meete to faſt and pray, without great danger of diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of diſcovering, of preſenting, of impriſoning. The laſt yeare I heard it often whiſpered in the eare, and ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muttered, that the kingdome ſhould prepare to warre, and that God ſhould not be called in to the warre, that there was no prayer, no faſt injoyned, this made ſome to feare, leaſt God would joyne againſt us; See (my brethren) the King, to whom alone it belongs to proclaime publike Faſts, hath in his pietie to GOD proclaimed a day of humbling our ſoules, and of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our ſelves to God, this promiſeth ſome good unto us, it is an argument, that we are priſoners of hope, when the enemy doth parley with us: there is ſome ſigne of yeelding, when there is liberty of parley: God doth never reaſon with them for whom he hath no mercy; Hee reaſoned with <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> he did not with the Serpent. God cannot be angry with the prayers of his
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44248:31"/>
people, hee is then angry indeed when he forbids his people to pray, when he takes away their hearts from prayer, when hee denyes them liberty to pray, when they are reſtrained from prayer, but when GOD calls them to pray, when hee commands them to pray, when he ſtirres up a whole kingdome to pray, when hee makes thoſe men, that have prayers in abomination, and the people of God for their praying in abomination alſo, to countenance pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to joyne with the people of GOD in prayer, to be of one heart with them, O what a glimpſe of mercy is this, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there is hope, whilſt there is but one praying Chriſtian, amongſt us, whilſt any one that hath a publike ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whilſt <hi>Moſes</hi> prayes, the enemy cannot prevaile, whilſt <hi>Luther</hi> lived, the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, yea there is hope, if there were not one praying Chriſtian in the midſt of us, if there be any of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kingdome, that pray for us. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> that was a very ſtranger to <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> prevailed farre with <hi>God,</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:44248:32"/>
for them, his prayer ſaved his nephew <hi>Lot,</hi> his Wife and daughters: we have a multitude of prayerfull Chriſtians, that pray daily for us, that are not amongſt us: all the reformed Churches abroad, eſpecially our friends and kindred, that are lately ſeparated from us in <hi>Holland,</hi> in New England: Yea let me appeale unto your ſelves, have not moſt of you, as <hi>Daniel</hi> did, in your Chambers faſted and prayed? have you not in your families, have not the men faſted apart, and the women apart? hath there not been private notice given, as <hi>Esther</hi> to <hi>Mordecai, Mordecai</hi> to the <hi>Iewes</hi> in <hi>Shuſan?</hi> Yea that which Crownes all, is there not now a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation gone forth, through all Countries, to command every one, Church and Chappell, to faſt? my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, a little encourage your ſelves in the Lord; The God of Iſrael is a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull God, wee cannot come with hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters about our necks, but he will have mercy on us.

            <p>Againe conſider what great things, faſting and praying have done, the prayers of one man, of one family, of one Citie, of one Kingdome, God is the ſame GOD as ever, the father of mercy, the God of compaſſion: we are not confirmed, becauſe hee changeth not: faſting and prayer have prevailed, why not ſtill?

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44248:43"/>
Apoſtle and the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> were not brethren in nature, but brethren in grace, <hi>&amp; ſanctior eſt copula cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, quam corporum:</hi> This compellation carries much affection with it, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports thus much, that he tendered the beleeving <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> as his mothers wombe, or his own bowels, even as his brethren, therefore he gives them this neceſſary exhortation in all brotherly love and earneſtneſſe,</p>
            <q>Stand faſt:</q>
            <p>The reaſons that enforce it, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in this word, <hi>Therefore,</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Wherefore? Two Reaſons may bee gathered from the coherence of theſe words.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Apoſtle tells them, there will be an Apoſtacy, a falling away; <hi>Therefore ſtand fast.</hi> Of which Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy you may read from the third verſe to the thirteenth verſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, hee remembers them of Gods mercy to them in bringing them to the knowledge of the Goſpell, from
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44248:44"/>
the thirteenth verſe to the fifteenth;</p>
            <q>Therefore (Brethren) ſtand faſt.</q>
            <p>Theſe are the Reaſons to enforce this duty, and of theſe in their order plainly.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Reaſ. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note>And firſt, <hi>Therefore ſtand faſt;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there will bee an Apoſtacy, and a falling away; That there will bee an Apoſtacy and a falling away, all muſt, all do confeſſe, our times and the times of our fore-fathers are ſad witneſſes of the accompliſhment of this Prophecy. The Apoſtle ſpeakes it in expreſſe termes, there muſt be an Apoſtacy and a falling away firſt; That this Captaine Apoſtate (whom the Apoſtle v. 3. cals the man of ſinne, and doth ſo exactly deſcribe) is the ſame with the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt of whom Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> writes in his Epiſtle, and the falſe Prophet you read of in the Revelation, for ought I know wee have unanimous conſent. But who this man of ſinne is, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, the falſe Prophet, there's the difference; Not to ſpend much time
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44248:44"/>
in the ſearching out thereof, or in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to this quaere; The Fathers are not competent Iudges in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: The Papiſts themſelves, thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended adorers of them, yet in this leave them and refuſe them,<note place="margin">Dan. 12.9.</note> 
               <hi>Daniel</hi> tells us that the Prophecy is ſealed to the end, Saint <hi>Auſten</hi> ſaith ingenuouſly, that concerning this chapter hee could not underſtand the meaning of it; To the Fathers theſe Prophecies were riddles and darke ſayings, yet by that glimer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing light they had, the myſtery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity beginning in the Apoſtles time, they could, they did point out the time, the place, and ſome the perſon. The Fathers could not tell who this man of ſinne was; Our adverſaries of the Church of Rome will not tell us, they labour to free the Pope from it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to faſten it upon any other; And while they labour to build new Babel, Lord how are they confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded! The Rhemiſts confeſſe that <hi>Rome</hi> is the place, yea <hi>Bellarmine, Ribera,</hi> and others ſay, certainely <hi>Rome</hi> is the ſeate; The Sunne ſhines cleare as at noone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44248:45"/>
they can, but will not ſee; I could muſter whole Armies of the reformed Churches, produce a cloud of witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, empannell many grand-Iuries, of our owne learned men, that readily will anſwer to this quaere: the Papacy is this Apoſtacy, the Pope this man of ſinne, the Antichriſt the falſe Prophet: the time would faile me to bring forth King <hi>David</hi> and all his worthies, King <hi>Iames,</hi> the Biſhops, and Profeſſors and learned men of that learned age, all which plainly and freely confeſſe and anſwer that the Papacy is this Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, the Pope this man of ſinne, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, the falſe Prophet; In this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular I may truly ſay of that King of Schollars, what the ſervants of King <hi>David</hi> ſaid, he is worth tenne thouſand: how plainely hath hee publiſht to the whole world, and ſent it abroad to the Emperor, to Chriſtian Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, wherein he hath declared his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning this thing, how plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his paraphraſe upon the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in his meditation upon the twentieth Chapter; in his Apologie to Kings
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44248:45"/>
and Princes; For my part I will walke under the protection of this great King, and follow the ſteppes of thoſe lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, backt with the authority of the booke of Homilies, and take it for granted indeed which cannot reaſonab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee denyed, it may eaſily bee made good that the Papacy is this Apoſtacy, the Pope this man of ſinne, the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt the falſe Prophet; Then my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to you, is the ſame with <hi>Paul</hi> to his <hi>Theſſalonians. Therefore (Brethren) ſtand fast,</hi> that you be not entangled and drawne away to Popery. If Saint <hi>Paul</hi> thought it neceſſary in his time, when the myſtery of iniquity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to worke, and the man of ſinne was not revealed, when the Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice Egges were not hatched, and the Pope had no being in the world, to exhort the believing <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> to ſtand faſt, that they might not bee drawne away with that falling away, how neceſſary is it for us, and at this time ſeaſonable for mee to exhort you (beloved) now that the myſtery of Iniquity is ſtrongly working and the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44248:46"/>
man of ſin clearely revealed now that the Pope is regnant in full power and ſtrength, to exhort you in the words of the Apoſtle.</p>
            <q>Therefore (Brethren) ſtand faſt.</q>
            <p>Firſt, conſider if you ſtand not faſt indeed, you may be drawne away to Popery.</p>
            <p>Secondly conſider, It's a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thing to bee drawne away to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</p>
            <p>Firſt, you may eaſily be drawne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: The Papacy is an alluring, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, tempting, bewitching Religion. Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> knew what hee ſaid, and he ſpake truth when hee ſaid it, that were hee to chooſe a Religion for licentious libertie and laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he would chooſe the Popiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; No Religion under Heaven ſo conſonant, ſo congruous, ſo ſutable, ſo agreeable to corrupted nature, to fleſh and bloud, as the Religion of the Church of Rome; ſee I beſeech you what the ſpirit of God faith of it in the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44248:46"/>
ſeaventeenth of the <hi>Revelations</hi> and the firſt, and ſo forth to the ſixth verſe, you muſt have patience that I may read the words to you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And there came one of the ſeaven An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels which had the ſeaven Vials, and talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with mee, ſaying, come hither I will ſhew unto thee the judgement of the great whore that ſitteth upon many waters, with whom the Kings of the earth have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fornication, &amp; the Inhabiters of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication, ſo hee carryed me away in the ſpirit into the wilderneſſe, And I ſaw a woman ſit upon a ſcarlet coloured beaſt, full of names of Blaſphemy, having ſeaven heads and ten hornes, and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was arrayed in purple and ſcarlet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and decked with gold and precious ſtones and pearles having a golden cup in her handfull of Abominations and filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of her fornication, and upon her fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head was a name written, Myſtery, Babylon the great, the mother of harlots, and the abominations of the Earth, and I ſaw the woman drunken with the blood of the ſaints and with the blood of the Martyrs of Ieſus,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44248:47"/>
and when I ſaw her I wondred with great admiration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That by the great whore, that by <hi>Babylon</hi> here ſpoken of, <hi>Rome</hi> is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, the <hi>Romanists</hi> themſelves doe freely confeſſe, the <hi>Rhemists</hi> doe not peremptorily but faintly deny it, they diſtinguiſh indeed of <hi>Babylon</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Church in <hi>Rome,</hi> they tell us Saint <hi>Ambroſe, Tertullian, Ierome,</hi> theſe confeſſe it, I could adde ſome more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> freely acknowledgeth it; Indeed they ſay Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh of <hi>Rome</hi> Ethnick, not of <hi>Rome</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; <hi>Rome</hi> under the perſecuting Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, not of <hi>Rome</hi> under the Chriſtian Pope: It is enough, they confeſſe that <hi>Babylon</hi> is <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> the ſeate of Antichriſt, and we all know Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> writes a Prophecy, not a Hiſtory; Hee tell us what ſhould bee, not what then was, and if Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpake of <hi>Rome,</hi> it muſt neceſſarily follow, that he ſpake of <hi>Rome</hi> as now it is, not of <hi>Rome</hi> as then it was; of <hi>Rome</hi> Chriſtian, not <hi>Rome</hi> Ethnicke; of <hi>Rome</hi> under the Pope, not under the Emperor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:44248:47"/>Thus you ſee <hi>Rome</hi> is compared to a Whore, to a great whore that ſits upon many waters, rules many nations, who made the Kings of the earth drunke with the wine of her fornication, that is clothed in Scarlet, Purple, Gold, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, precious ſtones and the like, and now mark how eaſie a thing it is to bee ſeduced, inticed, bewitched by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> what an alluring, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing, tempting Religion it is, you ſee it is compared to a Whore, to a great Whore, to the chiefeſt of whores, to the mother of Harlots, ſhe hath in her hand a Violl of Gould full of abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; You that are not acquainted with the Arts and Crafts and ſubtilties of Whores, read what <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Pro. 7.10.</note>
who was the wiſeſt of men, yet ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully befooled by them; A thouſand women took hold of him, and of them all he profeſſed he found not one good: hee ſpake much of them becauſe hee was much abuſed by them, and knew much by them, as in other places, ſo in the ſeaventh of the <hi>Proverbs:</hi> The Whore there ſpoken of makes Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44248:48"/>
her pretext, uſes much art, flattery, and impudency; This great Whore, that bewitcheth the ſoules of men, ſhe pretends Religion, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, She had in her hand a golden Cup, though in that Cup was abundance of abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, yet the Cup was of Gold. There are in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> many ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, excellent, and admirable truths and things which as a golden cup ſhe holds forth; She hath the Scripture, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, the Articles of the Creed, the Lords Prayer, the Tenne Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, many excellent things, whatſoever the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holds with the Church of England is pure ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and pure gold: All that ſhe adores beſides, is at the beſt hay and ſtubble, yea much poyſon, and abominations, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, verſe the fourth, the man of ſin ſits in the Temple of God, not in that materiall Temple, which was at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> (a fond conceit of ſome of the Ancients) The Papiſts themſelves how willing ſoever they are to embrace any thing that may take it from <hi>Rome,</hi> yet they themſelves refuſe
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44248:48"/>
it,<note place="margin">Dan. 9. and the laſt.</note> that Temple (<hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith) ſhall never be reſtored; Chriſt ſaith, not one ſtone ſhall be left upon another, and Hiſtory reports, that when they went about to build that Temple again, GOD from heaven by fire deſtroyed it; But in the Temple of God, that's the man of ſin, that ſits in the Church of God, the moſt eminent of all the Churches of God, where God had a great people, and whence God gathered his people; Antichriſt though he be an Adverſary and the adverſary Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, the greateſt adverſary that ever the Church had, yet notwithſtanding is no open profeſt adverſary, as the Turke and Iew, but a ſecret, cloſe, myſterious adverſary, that ſits in the Temple of God.</p>
            <p>In that Temple, ſee what bewty and glory to dazle the eye, and to charme the mind of the beholder; This great Whore is not only arrayed in gold and ſilver, Scarlet, Purple, and precious ſtones, as a woman may be, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is called a woman alſo, but hath the attire of an Harlot, wanton, laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44248:49"/>
attire, a ſuperſtitious and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous dreſſe; look into their Churches and ſee, not only the bewty and glory of them, as a woman may have, but a ſuperſtitious, Idolatrous dreſſe, as their Images, Crucifixes, Altars, Croſſes, and burning Tapers, all ſet forth lively to ſight; Looke into their ſervice and ſee what Pompe and glory and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtate, What rich Robes, what Mucſicke, what ſinging, what ſweet and burning Incenſe, and the like. The Temple in Ieruſalem was not more glorious in outward Pompe, more gloriouſly arrayed, there were not more ſacrifices and ceremonies, then there are in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day; It was neceſſary to bee ſo at Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, God would have it ſo, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were a carnall people, meere chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in underſtanding, God led them as a Nurſe by the hand, pleaſed them with carnall objects, with glorious buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, with multitude of ſignificant Ceremonies, with terrene and earthly delights, God did it to this end, that hee might wooe and invite them to his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44248:49"/>
ſervice. The Church was then in its Infancy; but now the Church is growne neere unto perfection, in it's laſt age, therefore they are not now neceſſary, Gods people how are a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall people; The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> uſeth now, what <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> did then, what then God commanded now hee forbids, what then hee bleſſed now hee curſes; To draw them to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and Idolatry, both which are ever beutifull and ſpecious, full of pomp and ceremony.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in the Papacy there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hard nor difficult, nothing which a meere Carnall man, which a voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon, a very Epicure and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine cannot eaſily digeſt; All the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is like the Religion of the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, the true fathers of them, a very outward Religion, an empty Casket, a dead and naked Carkas, what is Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry but a painted outſide: Their Church prayers they doe not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, their private prayers they mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by weight, their Repentance
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44248:50"/>
and confeſſion, it is in ſome ſmall pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, their faith is the faith of the Church, they live not by their owne faith; Their Obedience is to the Pope, not to God; They have their pardons, their indulgences, their Purgatory, their ſupererogations; and I know not what, no ſinne that they can commit, but the Pope will pardon, no ſinne that they would commit, but the Pope can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe withall, no matter how long they have lived in ſinne, in any ſinne, though the ſin againſt the HOLY GHOST; yet extreme unction at the laſt wil ſalve all: I know they make a great cry, and clamor; and tell us, as the Prieſts of <hi>Baal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> they cut themſelves with Knives and Launcers till the bloud guſh out, they tell us of their frequent faſtings, of their often watchings, of their blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy whippings, of their long Pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, their Rigorous diſcipline, their voluntary poverty, their ſimple obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, their Maſſacring the body, their lying in the duſt, and endangering of their lives, and a great deale more and could anſwer all theſe with the firſt of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44248:50"/>
               <hi>Iſay: Who hath required theſe things at your hand,</hi> what are theſe their ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? trifles, nothing in compariſon of that great worke God doth require: were all theſe true, reall and not fained, did they the ſame things indeed which they ſeeme to doe, were there no Iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling nor no deluſion, nor mitigation, nor diſpenſation, yet all theſe and more in the extremity and height, were nothing to the crucifying of the fleſh with the affections of it, to the mortifying of earthly members, ſinnes as deere as the bodily members, to the killing of the old man, to the breaking of the heart, to the wounding of the ſoule, to the ſpirituall obſervation of the Law, and to the beliefe in Chriſt Ieſus; what is it for a man to give the firſt borne of his body for the ſinne of his ſoule? to give his goods to the poore, and his body to bee burned to ſave his ſoule? Yea what is it to lye in their Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their Purgatory, in hell a thouſand yeares, and to purchaſe Chriſt by this? all this were nothing, what the ſervants of <hi>Naaman</hi> ſaid, <hi>My Father,</hi> If the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44248:51"/>
had commanded thee a greater thing, wouldſt thou not have done it? how much more, when he ſaith, <hi>Waſh and bee cleane;</hi> If the Pope command greater things to purchaſe Heaven, would they not doe it, how much more theſe ſmall things? There's nothing hard in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which a meere Carnall man, a voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Epicure, a Libertine cannot eaſily digeſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in the Papacy there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Arts, and Crafts, and ſubtilties and deviſes to deceive and entice people withall; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, verſe 9. that the man of ſinne his comming is after the working of Sathan, with all power and ſignes, and lying miracles, and the like; Antichriſt hath his hookes, his ſnares, his ginnes, his temptations and deluſions, ſutable to every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion and condition of man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; If hee ſees any Ambitious, hee tempts them, as his father did our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt, when he ſhewed him all the kingdomes of the world, and the glory of them, great preferments and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44248:51"/>
dignities there are in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> more preferments and greater than are in the true Church of God: nor are they ſparing to promiſe to give them: <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne cleaves to all <hi>Adams</hi> ſonnes, we would bee above, this is a peſtilent baite, and by this
they draw many Schollers from us; If they meete with any covetous, they have their ſilver and golden Balls, the golden wedge and Babyloniſh gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they will ſhowre gold into their lappes, and by this they draw Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Tradeſmen from us; If they meete with any credulous and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious, they have their ſignes and wonders and lying miracles. I know no Religion extant in the world, that challenges wonders and miracles but the Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> they object againſt us, and upbraid us with it, that we have no wonders and miracles, they have, much good may it do them. Antichriſt comes in all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveablenes of unrighteouſneſſe with ſignes and lying wonders to deceive them that periſh; If they meete with
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44248:52"/>
any fearefull by nature, and ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of hell, they have their appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions and viſions, make them heare ſcriekings and howlings, preach no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but horror and terror, hell, death and damnation; If they meete with any ſicke, they excerciſe their charms and ſpells, and can and do caſt out de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils through the power of the devill. If they meete with any conſtant in Religion, they have their torments, their tortures, their purgatories, their hel, their Inquiſition; Satan (ſaith one) doth not alwayes appeare in one and the ſame faſhion, but hath as many ſeverall changes, as <hi>Proteus</hi> among the Poets: At <hi>Liſtra</hi> hee appeares like a Comoedian, as if a ſcene of <hi>Plautus</hi> were to be preſented upon the Stage, at <hi>Antioch</hi> like a Ieſuite with traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in his mouth. At <hi>Athens</hi> hee fallies out like a Philoſopher; At <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> like an Artificer in his Apron: And as Sathan, ſo the eldeſt ſonne of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, ſo in the manner, with ſignes and lying wonders, he hath his
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44248:52"/>
profound Plots, his lying and ſubtill deviſes, his wiles and ſtratagems, to deceive them that are ſtedfaſt: It's eaſie to be drawne away, then</p>
            <q>Stand fast:</q>
            <p>Laſtly, in the Papacy, conſider the agents the inſtruments, <hi>Romes</hi> factors, the great Whores Pandors are crafty to inveagle and betray me to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, they are crafty, ſubtill, baſe and impudent. Read how the ſpirit of God deſcribes them in the ninth of the <hi>Revelations</hi> and the firſt verſe, and ſo forward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the fifth Angell ſounded, and I ſaw a Starre fall from Heaven unto the earth, and to him was given the key of the bottomleſſe pit, and there aroſe the ſmoake of the pit, as the ſmoake of a great furnace, and the Sunne and the aire were darkened by the ſmoake of the Pit, and there came out of the ſmoake, Locuſts upon the Earth, and unto them was given power, as the Scorpions of the earth have power, and it was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44248:53"/>
them that they ſhould not hurt the graſſe of the earth, neither any greene thing, neither any tree, but onely thoſe men which have not the ſeale of God in their foreheads, and to them was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that they ſhould not kill them, but that they ſhould bee vexed five moneths, and that their paine ſhould bee as the paine that commeth of a Scorpion when hee hath ſtang a man: therefore in thoſe dayes ſhall men ſeeke death and ſhall not find it, and ſhall deſire to dye, and death ſhall flye from them: and the forme of the Locuſts was like unto horſes prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to battaile, and on their heads were as it were Crowns like unto gold, and their faces were like the faces of men, and they had haire as the haire of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of Lions, and they had Habergeons as the Habergeons of Iron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Papiſts themſelves confeſſe, that there by the Starre fallen from Heaven is meant the maſter of ſome great error and hereſie, and by the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts that ariſe out of the earth, the reachers of thoſe hereſies, that goe

about to infect the people of God. The Rhemiſts ſay, this Starre fallen from Heaven is ſuch as <hi>Arius, Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> was; The Star that ſhall lead me to the light of this Starre that is fallen from Heaven, ſhall bee that fixed Starre now in Heaven, KING <hi>Iames.</hi> Kings have a ſpeciall intereſt in the book of the <hi>Revelation;</hi> And God hath made them of great uſe there to bring downe the man of ſinne: Then it may well ſtand with the wiſdome of God to reveale the meaning to them: And of all Kings, I heare of none that hath taken that paines in the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as King <hi>Iames;</hi> This Starre (ſaith hee) is the Pope who was once in the kingdome of Heaven, as a glorious bright Starre in Heaven above, who had an eminent place in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Church of God; The Locuſts that infect the aire, are that innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable multitude and diverſe orders of Eccleſiaſticall perſons, as Fryers, Monkes, Prieſts, Cardinalls, Ieſuites, and I know not whom, who bring as much deſtruction upon all ſorts of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44248:54"/>
men, as Locuſts to the graſſe, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der herbe; As Locuſts come by ſwarmes, and overſpread the whole earth, ſo theſe fill the whole earth with their Inſinuations; The ſhape of them is like unto Horſes, prepared to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, to ſignifie that their forme of practiſe and policie ſhall be ſo world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſe, that they ſhall want nothing pertaining to the ſetting forth of their intents, no more than a horſe of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which is curiouſly barbed, fitted and prepared for the fight; They had on their heads, Crownes of Gold, they pretend great holineſſe, none more then that Eccleſiaſticall order, even as the Elders, becauſe of their true holineſſe, had Crownes of Gold, ſo they, becauſe of their pretended holineſſe, have Crownes of Gold al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. They have the faces of men, they come with the faces, and Reaſonings of men; Sophiſticall Arguments, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till Philoſophy, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> cals vaine Philoſophy; The haire of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: As the haire of women is a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all part of their bewty to deceive men,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44248:54"/>
ſo they have Arts and Crafts, to draw men to their Religion; They have habergeons of Iron: to ſhew they are backt with authority, and the like. I could goe on further, they are many and crafty, full of power, have Crownes of Gold, the heads and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of men, the haire of women, all alluring, tempting, enticing and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching: thoſe that in this place are called Locuſts, in the ſixteenth of the <hi>Revelation</hi> and the 13. are call'd frogs: Frogges indeed, like thoſe frogs that came into the houſes and bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of Egypt, and of his ſervants, and all his people, no place nor perſon free: they are the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate, and the tranſcendent Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of deceit, they come out of the mouth of the Dragon, out of the mouth of the beaſt, and out of the mouth of the falſe Prophet; The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpirit of the Devill, active, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſtrong and ſtirring, full of deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to deceive men.</p>
            <p>Brethren, you ſee what reaſon you have to <hi>ſtand fast,</hi> that you be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44248:55"/>
not by any drawne back againe to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</p>
            <p>Secondly, conſider, it's a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thing to be drawne away to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery. I ſay, conſider the danger that attends all them, that are drawn away. All Papiſts, in that ſenſe that I ſpeake of Papiſts, for I doe not ſpeake of all that may be Popiſhly affected, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to ſome Popiſh opinions, but ſuch Papiſts as derive their name from <hi>Papa,</hi> the Pope, that hold him to bee the head of the Church, that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the Counſell of Trent, all Italianated, Ieſuited Papiſts, they are Traitors to the King under whom they live, Heretickes, Infidels and Atheiſts, in continuall danger of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall deſtruction, and at laſt ſure of eternall damnation.</p>
            <p>Firſt, all ſorts of Papiſts are Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to the King under whom they live; Not to prove this by an Inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of particulars from thoſe many Treaſons that have beene committed in this Land, when was there any Treaſon, ſince the beginning of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44248:55"/>
or ſcarce before, but they were the Contrivers, Plotters, Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, at leaſt the favourers and Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of it? Was not <hi>Sumervile, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey, Babington</hi> and his complices Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts? was not <hi>Lopez</hi> and his <hi>Abettors</hi> Papiſts? was not <hi>Campion</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> Papiſts? were not the Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Traitors Papiſts; was not <hi>Cateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, Winter</hi> and <hi>Perſey,</hi> was not <hi>Digby, Rooke-wood</hi> and <hi>Treſham,</hi> was not that Incarnate Devill <hi>Guido Fawkes,</hi> were they not all Papiſts? Nor yet to prove them Traitors, becauſe the Law of the Land makes them Traitors, which hath enacted, that all thoſe Prieſts and Ieſuites that come into the Land are Traitors, all that bring <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Dei,</hi> that maintaine the Popes ſupremacy above the Kings, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to draw obedience from the King, and perſwade to <hi>Rome,</hi> are Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. But I will prove it from the principles and maximes of their owne Religion, that ſhew neceſſarily all ſuch Papiſts muſt bee Traytors in that kingdome where they live; All Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44248:56"/>
may perhaps have ſome that are Traitors in it, but no Religion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven (ſet aſide the Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) doth neceſſitate and compell men to be Traitors; They have a maxime among them, I finde it in <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that Kings have not their immediate power from God, but from the people, yet ſo that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple transferre their power into the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the King, yet keepe habitually in themſelves, which they may make a principle for Traytors: It's ſaid of all that the Pope may excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Kings, and Kings ſtanding ſo may be depoſed, and thoſe that goe about to infect the people, the people ought to riſe up againſt them, and that it is not only a lawfull, but a neceſſary and a meritorious worke; The Engliſh Papiſts (ſaith a Ieſuited Engliſh Prieſt) are well to be excuſed for not riſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their King, becauſe they want power; had they power to their will, the King ſhould either obey the Pope, or elſe they would not obey the King.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:44248:56"/>
Papiſts are Traytors.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Papiſts are Heretickes, Infidels and Atheiſts, not to ſpeake of their innumerable multitude of leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer errors, called Veniall ſinnes, yet notwithſtanding the number of them may helpe to drowne the Shippe of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor yet to ſpeake of their groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Tenents, not yet confirmed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but diſputed in their Schooles, there are ſome hereticall er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors maintained among ſome, ſo groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hereticall, that whoſoever holds them, muſt neceſſarily be an Heretick, Infidell and Atheiſt; Such is their Image worſhip, their Altar worſhip; their Croſſe worſhip, their Saint wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, their Angell worſhip, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke worſhip and the like, ſuch is Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by works, works of ſuper-arrogation, but above all, the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent hereſie, the head of hereſies, that the Pope is the head of the Church, above the Scriptures, above Synods, above Counſells, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44248:57"/>
erre, is ſo hereticall, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver holds it in <hi>Radice, in fundamento,</hi> denies all the Articles of the faith, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the booke of God, and by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary conſequence denies GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: for whoſoever they are that build any thing on a falſe foundation, if the foundation falls, all the building falls with it. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that the man of ſinne, ſits in the Temple of God as God, and exalts himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all that's called God, above all Kings and Princes, to whom God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts ſome part of his power and name, above all Synods and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, yea he ſhewes himſelfe as God, for he advances himſelfe above God, he will diſpenſe with the morall Law, bleſſe where GOD doth curſe, and curſe where <hi>God</hi> doth bleſſe, no Law, nothing ſhall binde him, this wicked one, (called ſo verſe the eight, the Greeke word ſignifies properly this lawleſſe one, for ſo indeed the Pope is a lawleſſe perſon whom no law of God nor man is able to bind,) he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſeth with ſolemne oathes, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44248:57"/>
tye betwixt man and man: that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and well compoſed oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, they make it a <hi>Sampſons</hi> Cord; To hold the Pope to bee the head of the Church, is more incongruous and improper, more blaſphemous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory againſt Chriſt, then if a man ſhould make an excellent Image of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite and exact forme, delineated in all the points to the life, with necke and ſhoulders, with armes and hands, with thighes and legges, and ſhould place thereon a Gorgons head of an hideous and monſtrous ſhape. That Image in <hi>Daniel</hi> was more uniforme that had a head of gould, breaſt and armes of ſilver, belly and thighes of braſſe legges, of Iron, and feete part of Iron, and part of Clay, then to have the legges and thighes of Gold, and the head of Clay; This is ſo hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and damnable, that whoſoever holds it muſt neceſſarily bee a Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, Infidell and Atheiſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Papiſts are in continuall danger of temporall deſtruction. The Popes Paraſites, <hi>Romes</hi> builders, give
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44248:58"/>
the ſame glorious titles, Attributes and Eulogium, to the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> that once the Prophets of God did to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> calling it the Holy City, the City of the great King, the joy of the whole earth, the Queene of Nations, the everlaſting, the eternall Citie, and yet <hi>Rome</hi> muſt downe, <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall fall, the ſpirit of God ſpeakes plaine enough, reade the whole eighteenth of the <hi>Revelations</hi> at your leiſure, hee that reades it may underſtand, for the Text you ſee is plaine enough, it muſt downe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rome</hi> muſt downe by the ſword, Popery muſt downe by the word; <hi>Rome</hi> firſt, Popery after; Thoſe ten Kings that cleave unto her ſhall at the laſt make War againſt her, <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall down, Popery ſhall looſe it's ſtrength, though not it's being, till the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt; I will not determine the ſet time when <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall downe, I have read the Conjectures of many, yet all agree, the time cannot be long, but <hi>Rome</hi> muſt downe; At the firſt comming of our Saviour Chriſt when
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44248:58"/>
there was a generall expectation of him, the <hi>Iewes</hi> did not know the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular time, the yeare, the moneth, the day, there is at this day in the Church of God a generall expectation of ſome change, though wee cannot particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly tell the time, the yeare, the month the day, it may be the time is now at hand, the Trumpet is ſounding to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile; it may bee preſent with our ſelves, of uncertaine things wee can ſpeake but uncertainly, I ſubſcribe to them rather that conceive the yeare to bee one thouſand ſixe hundred ſixtie and ſixe though upon other grounds; tis plaine, Satan ſhall bee tyed up a 1000 yeares, ſixe hundred ſixty ſixe yeares is the number of the Beaſt, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt ſhall ſo long reigne, theſe two together make the juſt number, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides looke into the Latin Alphabet, the tongue that <hi>Rome</hi> uſeth, and the numerall letters make up this number: But this wee can certainely ſay, <hi>Rome</hi> muſt downe, <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall fall, <hi>Rome</hi> in the <hi>Revelation</hi> is ſet downe by the name of <hi>Sodom, Gomorrah</hi> and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44248:59"/>
               <hi>Ieruſalem, Rome</hi> equalls their ſins, and ſhall beare their plagues, God calls his people to come out of her, that they bee not partakers of her ſinnes, and of her plagues: <hi>Rome</hi> muſt fall, and Papiſts are in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall danger of temporall deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, all Papiſts (in that ſenſe that I ſay Papiſts) are ſure of eternall damnation, I may not ſpeake peace, where God ſpeakes no Peace: When <hi>Iehoram</hi> ſaid to <hi>Iehu,</hi> what peace <hi>Iehu?</hi> he anſwered, what peace as long as the witchcrafts and whoredomes of thy mother <hi>Ieſabell</hi> remaine? What peace can I ſpeake to <hi>Rome,</hi> while the ſpirituall whoredomes and witchcrafts of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> remaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them? <hi>Saul</hi> loſt his kingdome for ſparing <hi>Agag:</hi> And God may damme me, for ought I know, if I refuſe to damne them. They are but falſe Prophets <hi>Balaam</hi>-like, that bleſſe where God doth curſe; God preaches damnation to them, I may not preach ſalvation. In the third verſe of this
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44248:59"/>
Chapter, Antichriſt the man of ſinne is called the ſonne of perdition, and he is ſo indeed, both actively and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively: he is damned himſelfe, and is the cauſe of the damnation of others. The ſpirit is plaine in the 10, 11, and 12. verſes, <hi>hee ſhall work in them that periſh, and for this cauſe God gave them up to ſtrong deluſions to believe lyes, that all that receive not the truth in the love of the truth, but had pleaſure in unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, might be damned:</hi> See in the twentieth of the <hi>Revelations</hi> and the tenth verſe, what the end of them is, where all they muſt goe, <hi>into the lake that burnes with Fire and Brimſtone:</hi> They that write profeſſedly of this queſtion, whether a Papiſt can be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or no, diſtinguiſh of times, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and perſons, firſt of times, ſince the Reformation, and before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: at thoſe times of ignorance God did connive; Then men would have ſeen and could not, the Sun did not then ſhine, our fore-fathers might bee ſaved in that Ignorance; But God commands every one to ſeeke after
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44248:60"/>
knowledge, the Sun ſhines cleere en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough, Papiſts may ſee and will not, God gives them over to affected ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance: he that will be ignorant, let him be ignorant. Againe they diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of places, where the light of the Goſpell hath ſhined, and where it hath not ſhined: in ſome places the Goſpell ſhines very bright and very cleere, as in ſome parts of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and (bleſſed be God) in <hi>England;</hi> In ſome places is darkneſſe, they have the word rarely preached to them, God will not be mercifull to thoſe Papiſts where the light of the Goſpell ſhines as cleare as may be, and yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in darkneſſe.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, they diſtinguiſh of perſons. It's confeſt of all, that a learned Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Apoſtate Papiſt, cannot be ſaved. <hi>God</hi> hath preach'd damnation to them, ſo muſt we; Now you ſee the danger of being Papiſts, they are <hi>Traitors</hi> to the King under whom they live, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Infidels, and Atheiſts, in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all danger of temporall deſtruction, and at laſt ſure of eternall damnation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:44248:60"/>And you ſee the firſt Reaſon why we ſhould <hi>ſtand fast,</hi> becauſe there wil be an Apoſtacy, a falling away to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, the ſecond followes more briefly.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Therefore ſtand faſt,</hi>

            <p>Firſt, conſider what a bleſſing God hath brought among us, this glorious Goſpell, the greateſt bleſſing that ever God brought into any nation under heaven. Were the Land as the Land of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> was before its deſtruction, were it as <hi>Eden</hi> before the curſe, as the Garden of God, as Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, were all our Marchants as No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, our Nobles as Princes, our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as Emperors, were Silver and Gold as it was in the dayes of <hi>Salomon,</hi> were

our houſes like <hi>Salomons</hi> houſe, our Churches like his Temple, were the foundations of our Cities, the Gates, the Walles, all of Pearles and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones, as wee read of the new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> yet (beloved) what were all this, if wee had no Sunne to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten us and ſhine upon us? What good would all this doe us? Light is ſweete, and it is a pleaſant thing to ſee the Sunne, that ſweetens all, the want of it embitters all, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.7, 8. <hi>For what nation is there ſo great that hath Statutes and Iudgements ſo righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as this I ſet before you this day?</hi> What Nation is ſo great as this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that hath ſuch righteous Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Marke, the righteouſneſſe of GOD to a people makes a Nation great, and God is ever neere the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple where the Goſpell is, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Iudgements and righteous Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes makes a Nation great, and we have righteous Iudgments and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Statutes, therefore a great Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>See the curſe of that people from
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44248:61"/>
whom God takes the Goſpell, and then tell mee what a bleſſing it is to have the Goſpell; It's neceſſary (ſaith the Apoſtle) that the Goſpell ſhould bee firſt preached to you: but ſince you have refuſed life and ſalvation; loe henceforth wee turne to the Gentiles; Everlaſting life and the Goſpell goe together: Salvation is of the Gentiles: Salvation and the Goſpell goe together: the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of GOD ſhall bee taken from you, and given to a Nation that will bring forth better fruits. Marke, the kingdome of GOD and the Goſpel goe together; and if that Kingdome bee once taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, then all the kingdomes of the world, Crownes and Scepters heapt together cannot comfort that people. Beloved, God hath brought the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell among you, the greateſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing:</p>
            <pb n="94" facs="tcp:44248:62"/>
            <q>Therefore Stand fast:</q>
            <p>Secondly, conſider how and when God brought the Goſpell to us, <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was a Land of darkneſſe: Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, Superſtition and Idolatry mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevailed among us, what nation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt under Heaven more Barbarous, Idolatrous, heatheniſh, ſuperſtitious, then the Engliſh Nation: Inſomuch that one calls it the Popes Aſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thoſe Antichriſtian taxations and burdens laid on us, and for thoſe many Rebellions, Treaſons and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, our King was proverbially cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the King of devils, yet in the time of the greateſt darkneſſe of Popery and Ignorance God brought this Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, though not as the Sunne at noone day, yet as the Sun in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that ſhines more and more to the perfect day.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, conſider God hath preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this Goſpell among us in great peace and in great plenty by weake meanes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:44248:62"/>I muſt begin (becauſe the time is paſt) with that bleſſed Queene of ever bleſſed memory, Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who though ſhee was of the weaker Sexe, and daughter to a great King, in the Raigne of her ſiſter Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> a poore priſoner ſhut faſt in the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, toſſed from place to place, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall danger of her life, attended with bloudy diſpoſed men, often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined to death, yet God bound up her ſoule in the bundle of life, and ſet her in the Throne, and great things God did by her: through her, Religion was reſtored to its Primitive purity; Shee refined the corrupt Coine, reſtored the Royall Navie, ſuccored the <hi>Scots</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants againſt the Papiſts, and both of them againſt <hi>Spaine;</hi> Shee defended <hi>Belgium</hi> againſt the whole Armies of <hi>Spaine,</hi> Shee commanded the whole Ocean, kept continuall warre with the Beaſt; The roaring Bulls and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Treaſons that came from <hi>Rome,</hi> were but as Arrowes of Reed thrown againſt a Brazen wall; Shee brought

            <p>Fourthly, pray mightily to GOD that God will uphold and ſtrengthen you with the right hand of his power, that you may ſtand faſt, CHRIST tells <hi>Peter</hi> hee prayed for him, that his faith might not at all faile; If CHRIST prayed for <hi>Peter,</hi> Lord what great need have we to pray for our ſelves, that our faith may not faile? you may (Beloved) bee tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed yet above your ſtrength, there may yet come a time of tryall, and an houre of temptation, you have not yet reſiſted unto bloud, yet you have lived in a land of peace and ſafety, you have not beene ſcar'd with the barking of Vncouth Wolves, Prieſts and Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites have been baniſht from among us, and long may they be baniſht, once

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44248:68"/>
ſpoke to his Chaplein, I have ſaid much, and writ much, and read much, and preacht much; Yet in all the booke of God, I doe not finde the leaſt ground for Popery. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> withſtood <hi>Peter</hi> to his face, and gave him no place, no not for an houre; O withſtand <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> who can challenge nothing of <hi>Peters,</hi> but that title which Chriſt once gave him, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and that fact, in denying his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; I ſay, withſtand him to his face and give him not place, no not for an houre. I can never ſufficiently admire and wonder at the ſpeech of bleſſed <hi>Luther,</hi> who (though he was very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to have the Communion admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in both kinds, contrary to the Doctrine and cuſtome of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>) yet he profeſſes, if the Pope (as Pope) commanded him to receive in both kindes, he would but receive in one kind: Its a generall rule among the beſt, that what the Pope com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands as Pope, though it bee good or indifferent, as to pray, to read, to lift up an eye, a hand, to weare blacke or
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44248:69"/>
white, a lace, a modell, to drop a Bead, as the Pope commanding it; It is a receiving the marke of the beaſt, a yeelding our ſelves the Vaſſalls of Sathan, and an Implicite denying the faith of Chriſt; So extremely veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous is the poyſon that lyes at the root of that fundamentall hereſie, which they have layed at the very Rocke and foundation of their faith, ſo dangerous and pernitious it is to hearken to the Pope.</p>
            <p>The renowned Martyrs in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> days, would ſhow no reverence to the commiſſioners from the Pope, and let mee tell you there are many things in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> that may be, that are decent to be uſed in the Church of God, ſome things there are at this day in practiſe in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that were in uſe in that Church when it was not Antichriſtian, in the times of the Primitive Biſhops and bleſſed Martyrs; Some things uſed, that are not yet commanded by the Pope as Pope: what ever we uſe with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we uſe it, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:44248:69"/>
by another power, not becauſe commanded by the Pope, ſo that what we doe, is to bee accounted an Act of obedience, what they doe is to bee condemned, becauſe commanded by the Pope; be wiſe as Serpents, Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent as Doves, rightly diſtinguiſh of times, places, and perſons, ſo ſhall you not endanger your own ſoules, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey them that are over you, nor ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall them that live with you.</p>

The Greeke, <hi>Beza,</hi> and many others reade it, in the plurall number, ſlew men, and digg'd downe walls, overthrew their houſe, or (as in the Margin) houghed the Oxen in pieces. This is the ſecond Aggravation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there ought to bee a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion betwixt the puniſhment and the offence: though all ſinnes are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, yet all are not equall: wee are ſo farre Catholicke, that we are not Stoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call: leſſer ſins are not to be puniſhed
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:44248:74"/>
with the great cenſures of the law, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in heart is not ſo evill as <hi>Raca</hi> in the frowne, or foole in the mouth: the perſon againſt whom, as well as the perſon that offends, aggravates the ſinne; That word which is ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a private man will but beare an action, againſt a Lord of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell is <hi>Scandalum magnatum,</hi> againſt the King, Treaſon, againſt God, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: ſinne and judgement have their <hi>Climaxes:</hi> ſimple fornication was not to bee puniſhed with death, but with maryage or a Dowry, <hi>Sechem</hi> was guilty of no more, yet they kill'd him; This was the third aggravation.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Miniſters of juſtice ought not raſhly to proceed in judgment. <hi>God</hi> hath proclaimed himſelfe; and would have the Gods of the earth to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, that he is ſlow to wrath, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to forgive; Our Law forbids all men trading in bloud to beare the ſword of Government, <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and groaned, at juſt execution: <hi>Nero</hi> wiſhed he could not write, when hee was to ſigne a condemnation,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44248:75"/>
Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (next to the holy Scriptures) prefers (as the beſt piece) <hi>Seneca</hi> his booke of Clemencie; Our Gracious King (you have often heard it,) proclaimed how backward hee is to unſheath the ſword, even as to draw bloud from his owne veines; If pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment muſt follow, revenge may not; a member may not be cut off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſighes and teares; ſoftly, deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muſt men execute judgement: the greater was the ſin of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> that in their <hi>anger ſlew a man, and in their ſelfe will digg'd downe a wall,</hi> this is the fourth aggravation.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, to do as we would be done unto is the ſtanding Law of God and Emperours, oathes and covenants are to be ſacred and inviolably kept: <hi>Shall he proſper</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>ſhall hee breake the covenant and bee delivered?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezec. 17.15</note> 
               <hi>Thou Ieſus</hi> (ſaith <hi>Amurath</hi> the great Turke) <hi>if thou be a God, as they ſay thou art, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the treachery of thy ſervants.</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants and agreements ought to be moſt ſimple and moſt naked; <hi>Hamor</hi> and <hi>Sechem</hi> were at Truce with <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:44248:75"/>
at Peace: not only in covenant with them, but in covenant with God, they were proſelytes in Religion, they dealt ſincerely and truly, the greater was the ſin of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> that dealt treacherouſly and falſly. This was the fifth Aggravation.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Religion ought to bee the ſureſt bond: men that profeſſe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that countenance their doings by Religion, ought (eſpecially to them that are without) to be moſt Religious, juſt and exact, that the name of God be not blaſphemed, that the holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion be not evill ſpoken of. <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> were viſible members of the Church militant, they themſelves profeſſed Religion, and undertooke all the Treaty in the way of Religion, the more Irreligious their treachery, and perfidious their cruelty, this is the ſixth and laſt aggravation.</p>
            <p>Collect theſe all together (my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) Their ſinne was murder, they ſhed the ſacred bloud of Kings, they murdered Innocents, they deemed
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:44248:76"/>
them above their offence, they delight in puniſhing, they breake oathes and covenants, and they did all this under a pretence of Religion; <hi>Laborat An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalium fides.</hi> After ages would never have beleeved this, if Gods ſacred Annals, the Hiſtory of this book had not recorded it: you have ſeene the ſin of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> more briefly ſee their cenſure.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</note>Curſed be their <hi>Anger:</hi> ſometimes wee ſhall have the holy man <hi>David, curſing,</hi> not onely mens paſſions, (as <hi>Iacob</hi> his ſonnes here) but alſo their perſons, but then his curſes are Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, or conditionall, or propheticall: either hee names not the man, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it if God intend it ſo; or his cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are rather predictions, than male-dictions: <hi>Non tam vota, quam vatici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi> God appointed ſixe Tribes to curſe, as well as ſixe to bleſſe, <hi>Moſes</hi> the meekeſt man in all the earth was mediator of the condemning Law, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> that was compounded of affection, yet pronounced the greateſt curſe in the Book of God; mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:44248:76"/>
ought not ſo to be had in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that their wickedneſſe paſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out condemnation: In Courts of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice mens cauſes (not their perſons) ſhould ſpeake. <hi>Iacob</hi> lookes not on his ſons cruelty with a fathers indulgent lenity, but with a frowning Auſterity: whom GOD curſes, <hi>Iacob</hi> will not bleſſe, curſed be their anger.</p>
            <p>This cenſure will aggravate their ſinne, if you conſider theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>The Parents curſe</hi> (ſaith the wiſeman) <hi>rootes out the foundation of a child:</hi> Gods curſe uſually goes along with theirs. <hi>Noah</hi> curſed <hi>Cham,</hi> and the <hi>Canaanites</hi> were curſed of God. Saint <hi>Auſten</hi> tells us of a Mother cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her tenne Children, that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from Heaven they were ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in pieces; <hi>Camerarius</hi> relates of one curſed by his father, that preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a miracle hee was faſtned to the ground, of a ſecond devoured by Serpents, of a third torne by devils; ſad and dreadfull examples, a fearefull document to Parents to take heed
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:44248:77"/>
how they raſhly curſe their children, and for children how they provoke their Parents. Parents are not eaſily moved to curſe their children, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if they be religious parents, men fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>God,</hi> and yet <hi>Iacob (Simeon</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi's</hi> father, holy <hi>Iacob</hi>) curſes, but it is their anger, not them; their paſſions, not their perſons, <hi>curſed be their anger:</hi> this is the firſt aggravation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the words of dying men, are living oracles, then men ſpeak moſt affectionately, and their words pierce moſt deepely. <hi>Iacob</hi> at this time was on his death bed, his ſons crave his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, he loves them, but hates their ſins; as his ſoule at firſt gave no conſent, ſo his tongue now ſhall give no approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it: at firſt he reproves them, but having more liberty he deteſts it; He was preſently to appeare, before <hi>Gods</hi> Tribunall, ſo he calls them to his.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, an honeſt heart doth not only not act wickednes, but abhors it: <hi>Iacob</hi> as hee was no Counſellor to the offence, ſo he would be no Patron to the offendors, <hi>O my ſoule come not into
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:44248:77"/>
their ſecret, unto their aſſembly mine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour be not thou united: Iacob</hi> as before he proteſted againſt it, ſo now he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it's the curſe that followes the <hi>Iewes</hi> to this day, to be a ſcattered people on the face of the earth: diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will follow unity in ſin: <hi>Simeon and Levi brethren in evill,</hi> therefore <hi>Iacob</hi> makes them ſtrangers in dwelling, <hi>I wil divide them in Iacob, and ſcatter them in Iſrael: Simeon</hi> had no entire inheritance, <hi>Levi</hi> no certaine. Thus you have ſeen their ſin, and their cenſure.</p>
            <p>But what's this to us, (wil you ſay) or what's this to the buſines of this day; Have patience and this ſhall give more light, and bee more welcome to you, conſidering that <hi>Iacob</hi> in thus ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king is our ſpokeſman. <hi>Brightman</hi> ſpeaking of the ſeaven Churches ſaith, they were Typicall of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to the comming of Chriſt. I ſhould be too ſingular if I did ſay, this hiſtory were Typicall, and did ſet forth the tragedy for this day. I wil not undertake to give an interpretation,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44248:78"/>
but I will promiſe, and your ſelves ſhall ſee an exact application in all the particulars, be pleaſed therefore once more to have recourſe to the words of the Text, and with a little variation of names and time, read it thus, <q>Ieſuites <hi>and Ieſuited Papiſts,</hi> are Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, Instruments of cruelty are in their habitations. O my ſoule come not thou into their ſecret, unto their aſsembly mine Honour be not thou uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for in their Anger they ſlew a man, and in their ſelfe will they digg'd downe a wall, curſed bee their Anger for it was fierce, and their wrath for it was cruell. God divide them from <hi>the ſonne of our</hi> Iacob, and ſcatter them from our Engliſh Iſrael.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I will follow the ſame method that I did before, I will ſhew you the ſinne of theſe and their cenſure, and that, aggravated with the ſame circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as that of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt then <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> in their <hi>anger</hi> they ſlew a man, a King; The
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44248:78"/>
lives of Kings are ſacred, therefore thoſe doctrines, the moſt remote con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences whereof will maintaine kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Kings are to be abhor'd among us. But as for the doctrine of Ieſuites, and Ieſuited Papiſts, their Tenets and and principles ſticke point blancke to this killing of Kings, and in this, their cruelty is farre worſe, than that of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> and <hi>Levi. Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> did once kill a King: though, <hi>de facto,</hi> they did it, yet they did it but once, and their Religion condemned it, and their father <hi>Iacob</hi> curſed it: But it is the Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the conſtant practiſe of the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites to doe it not only once, but often, yea their Religion maintaines it, and in ſome caſes makes it meritorious; yea the Pope their father allowes it, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances and bleſſes it; you were once taught to ſay on the ſervice of this day, that their Religion is Rebellion, and their faith faction, it is now alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; And I have reaſon enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve there's ſufficient Reaſon of State for it, though I ſee none; I hope I ſhall
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:44248:79"/>
make it eaſily appeare to you, that the Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> maintaines killing of Kings. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Blackwell</hi> the Arch-Prieſt of <hi>England</hi> makes this Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call flouriſh, did ever any Pope from the Infancy of the Church at any time command any King (though heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh) to be kill'd, or approve the Act, after it was done; Therefore (ſaith hee) why ſhall the King of <hi>England</hi> feare that, that never any Chriſtian King in the Chriſtian world did ever, or hath cauſe to feare? boldly ſpoken, and as a Cardinall Ieſuite: Let <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> anſwer <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and throw bluſhing in his owne face. I have the rather made choice of him, becauſe he is their <hi>Coripheus,</hi> and few of them (I beleeve) deny what he affirmes, yea I have him to ſhew, if any denies what I ſay to you, in his fifth booke <hi>De Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Pontific.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> he ſaith plainly, <hi>Non licet Chriſtianis, &amp;c.</hi> It is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for Chriſtians to tollerate a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh, Infidell, Hereticall King, yea (ſaith hee) it pertaines to the Pope
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:44248:79"/>
alone to judge if the King be ſo or no, he ſaith alſo in the ſame place, if any ſheepe become a Wolf, any Chriſtian Prince become a Heretick, and labours to withdraw his ſubjects, then the Pope ought to expell them, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them, drive them away from their kingdome, and diſcharge their ſubjects of obedience; And he gives this Reaſon (and I beſeech you marke it) why the Chriſtians in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times did not thus proceed againſt <hi>Nero, Caligula, Diocleſian, Iulian</hi> the Apoſtate, <hi>Valerian,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe monſters (Gods plagues to the Church) becauſe they wanted force, So that by the doctrine of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> if Chriſtian Kings are once Hereticks, by the Pope they may bee excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, depoſed and deprived, and experience ſhowes, it neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes they muſt be murdered. The ſame <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his fift booke ſixth chapter ſpeakes out; The Pope may change kingdomes, and take them from one, and give them to another, and gives this Reaſon, elſe (ſaith hee)
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:44248:80"/>
Kings may pervert their people, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſhewing, that as the King is, ſo is the kingdome, Inſtancing in <hi>Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, Constantine, Conſtance, Iulian,</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt, Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> Queene <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> All whoſe kingdomes changed with their Kings; He affirmes this to bee a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Doctrine, and to prove it, brings in the Verdict, of Twenty <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> foureteene <hi>French,</hi> nine <hi>Germans,</hi> ſeaven <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> nineteene <hi>Spaniards,</hi> all theſe prime Authors, yea the Prieſts and Ieſuites the great fomentors of thoſe damnable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> give up father <hi>Bellarmine</hi> for their chiefeſt authority, for their Oracle: you ſee <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpeakes plaine, he ſaith en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough, yet not all, I muſt tell you, <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> is modeſt to others that come after him, though he ſaith ſomewhat, yet they much more; He maintained indeed againſt <hi>Aquinas,</hi> that Kings are not to be murdered, though they are Hereticks, except they labour to make their people ſo too, and maintaines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44248:80"/>
others that except the Pope have excommunicated and accurſed them, ſubjects are not to riſe againſt their King. But others, <hi>Mariana,</hi> and the reſt of that blacke Guard ſpeake out, people are to riſe againſt their King, and though the Pope neglects his duty, they are not to neglect theirs, hee adviſes rather to poyſon their chaire, Incarnate devils! yea the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vow that the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> take will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily inferre this conſequence, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's not the opinion of a few a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but the whole order muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch it, I will not ſay every Ieſuite and Papiſt (<hi>de facto</hi>) is not loyall and dutifull to their Prince, I will ſay, all their Loyalty depends on the Popes pleaſure; And what a rotten thread this is to hang ſo ſharpe a pointed ſword in, over the head of Kings, what loyall heart doth not tremble to thinke of it? After a ſolemne profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that they beleeve the Popes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute authority over all, as the Vicar of Chriſt, they make this vow to doe whatſoever the Pope or the Generall
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:44248:81"/>
of the order ſhall command them, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately without any Tergiverſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, diſputation, or excuſe at all, and to goe whereſoever he ſhall command them, whether to the Turks, Infidels, and Indians, or Hereticks and Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks among the Chriſtians; yea they are bound to beleeve that no er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, impiety, injuſtice can come from the Pope, but that all is Religion, Zeale, Devotion, Equity and Truth; My Brethren, doe not theſe men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves ſoule and body to the Pope, doe not they give themſelves not to beleeve their owne ſences, their owne Reaſon, Iudgment and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; And doe they not vow to goe, to come, to doe, to ſay, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute upon all perſons, and againſt all perſons, whatſoever he ſhall command them and if this be true, what hope, what ſafety, what meanes of refuge have Chriſtian Kings and Princes but the Popes pleaſure, when theſe, the ſlaves of the Pope, (for ſo the Ieſuites call themſelves) which care not for their owne lives, bee maſters of the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:44248:81"/>
Kings; And yet (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) was it ever heard, or read, or did the Pope approve the fact after it was done, if the Pope doth not allow of the killing of Kings and Princes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (I pray you) doth he not ſet ſome ſevere Cenſure, and with a fearefull frowne cry downe thoſe Ieſuiticall bookes of <hi>Mariana</hi> and the reſt, that not only approves, but commends King-killing ſervice; Wherefore doth his holineſſe ſuffer at <hi>Rome</hi> even under his noſe, thoſe <hi>Ieſuites</hi> that had the chiefeſt hand in Treaſons, to be pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Bookes like Martyrs, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious worſhip by the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to bee done to them: And thoſe two Kings in <hi>France</hi> (both murdered by Ieſuites) why did not his holineſſe teſtifie to the Chriſtian world his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of ſo great misfortune, which all Europe had cauſe to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, why hath not his holines made a Law, and a decree againſt killing of Kings and Princes, whereby they may enjoy more ſafety; Let not words be credited when deeds ſpeake ſo lowd,

I will keep at home, and only tell you how the Pope proceeded againſt our King <hi>Iohn,</hi> Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>Iames: Innocentius</hi> the firſt, hee firſt interdicted the kingdome, excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated the King, curſed his perſon, animated his ſubjects againſt him, gave his kingdome to the King of <hi>France,</hi> at laſt when the King ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what relented and ſubmitted to him, he forced him to reſigne his Crowne and kingdome to <hi>Pandolphus</hi> his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, who kept it three dayes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gave it him, and made him tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary for his own kingdome.</p>
            <p>That Bull of Pope Clement ſent out againſt Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> is infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly and notoriouſly knowne, whereby after much railing and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming of her ſacred perſon, hee curſes all that adhere unto her; This
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:44248:82"/>
Bull he ſends into <hi>England,</hi> faſtened it on one of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Gates, <hi>Saunders</hi> in his writings maintained it. <hi>Briſtow</hi> in his Motives, approved it, ſome of the Nobility and many of the Gentry were ſaid to execute it: From this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine all thoſe bitter ſtreames of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed water flowed out, damnable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt her perſon. But to paſſe all other, the Treaſon intended this day, ſpeakes loud enough, occaſioned by Popiſh Religion, attempted by Popiſh Catholikes, encouraged by Popiſh Doctors, maintained and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Pope himſelfe; I ſay, the Pope himſelfe, for when father <hi>Garnet</hi> deſired to know the Popes Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning the bloudy Tragedy, <hi>Catesby</hi> preſently reſolved him; The Pope (ſaith hee) that commanded our endeavours to hinder his comming in, is willing enough wee ſhould throw him out.</p>
            <p>I know this Anniverſary remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of this great deliverance, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the hearts of tender Ieſuites and Papiſts, ſome in Print condemne it,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:44248:83"/>
and ſay that the treaſon of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Traitors, ought to bee buryed in the grave of the offendors, and not to be imputed to their Religion, ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently now begin to deny it, and ſome with blacke mouthes labour to faſten it on the Puritans, God rebuke them; Tis no new thing (my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) to diſavow that which took no effect: But had this damnable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon beene executed, it would not have wanted Patrons highly to have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it. When that Parricide killed <hi>Henry</hi> the third King of <hi>France,</hi> did not the Pope in full conſiſtory of his Cardinalls make a glorious relation of it, comparing the Aſacinat to <hi>Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> and <hi>Iudeth,</hi> forbidding all Maſſes and dirges to bee ſaid for the ſoule of the King? Is not his picture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleately ſet up in the Ieſuites Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: over the Altar, with Angels protecting and crowning him? I could at large relate the manner of the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites proceedings, how they raiſe the ſpirits, and ſteele the reſolutions of others, whom they ſet apart to this
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:44248:83"/>
King-killing ſervice. I am ſorry for the Chriſtian Name, that ſuch damnable poſitions ſhould bee publiſht among heathen nations, to the diſgrace of Chriſtendome; The Apocryphall booke of Iudeth the Pope receives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Canon, it may be for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe it commends this Act of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> which <hi>Iacob</hi> curſes: There wants not Ieſuites to Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gize for, and juſtifie the powder Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Pope (for on him I faſtned it this day Twelve month) the man of ſinne, that exalts himſelfe above all that is called God: ſome there are that exalt his holineſſe above God himſelfe, but hee himſelfe and all that adhere to him, exalt him above all that is called God, above Kings and Emperours. The Pope makes himſelfe good ſport with the Crownes of Kings, Kings and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours are his ſervants and Vaſſals, they hold his Stirrop, lead his horſe, goe before him in a kinde of proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; The Pope at his pleaſure tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples upon their necks, hee crownes
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:44248:84"/>
and uncrownes them with his foote, he makes them waite bare foote at his gate, he excommunicates them, Armes their ſubjects againſt them, gives their kingdomes to others, diſcharges their ſubjects of obedience to them, they poyſon them at the Sacrament, ſtabbe them in their Coaches, murder them in their Courts, they make themſelves fatte with the bloud of Kings. O might thoſe Kings, thoſe tenne Kings ſpoken of in the <hi>Revelations</hi> 17.16. (amongſt whom ſome there are that name the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the King of <hi>France</hi> to be there ſpoken of,) O may they hate the whore, make her naked and deſolate, eate her fleſh and burne her with fire! <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> kill'd a KING, that's the firſt thing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Innocents, it's a ruled caſe among the Ieſuites, where the Catholike cauſe may be advanc't, there the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of a few Innocents, though hundreds and thouſands is not to bee ſtood upon. When <hi>Garnet</hi> was que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:44248:84"/>
by <hi>Cateſby,</hi> whether with a ſafe conſcience they might proceed with the Powder project, becauſe in blowing up the Parliament houſe they ſhould kill ſome of their owne Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, he quickly replyed, ſuch as this was not to bee ſtood upon; And this <hi>Eudemon</hi> with great earneſtneſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends, and it hath beene the conſtant practiſe of the Ieſuites, to this day; I muſt now lead you into <hi>Golgotha,</hi> a field of dead mens bones, a field very ample and large, as that to which <hi>God</hi> brought <hi>Ezechiel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eze. 37.</note> I am bold to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme unto you, that the tenne perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of the Heathen Emperors of <hi>Rome,</hi> never put to death ſo many nor with that cruelty as the power of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> Inſtruments of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty indeed are in their habitations. In their anger they kill men, ruine Cities, Countries, nations full of men; The heatheniſh perſecution was long and bitter, but as for Catholike perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is more tedious, more bitter, more cruell. Pope <hi>Theodorus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> when the ſecond time he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:44248:85"/>
               <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he mixed ſome of the conſecrated Cup with Inke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hee wrote the ſentence of the curſe, a new unuſuall forme of curſing, not heard of before. Something the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites have added to former perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to make them more bitter and fierce: this man of ſinne Saint <hi>Paul</hi> cals the ſon of perdition, and ſo he is, both Active and Paſſive. Genitives, put for Adjectives, adde to their ſignification, ſon of perdition, becauſe he deſtroyes moſt, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> calls him Apollyon, a deſtroyer; He ſaith they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves druncke with the bloud of the Saints: To ſpeake of the Murders, Maſſacres, Treacheries, Cruelties of the Papiſts, it is ſo large a field, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into it, I know not where to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, nor where to end. I could (my Brethren) ſhow you a Sea of bloud, flowing from the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> like to the Sea <hi>Ezechiel</hi> ſpeakes of,<note place="margin">Eze. 47.3.</note> which was at the firſt to the Anckles, then to the knees, then to the loynes dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and deeper; If I ſhould race

I ſpure to relate their horrible cruelties and treacheries, againſt the Albigenſes, and Waldenſes, the Cities of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindoll and Cabriers; The Hiſtory is in Engliſh, and worth your read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I will not tell you what cruelty they have done in <hi>Germany,</hi> nor ſpeak of that damnable Maſſacre in <hi>France,</hi> I will not bee your Pilot to wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t you unto the Indians, where the Chriſtian Romans have kill'd more Pagans, then ever Pagans kill'd Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; Onely take notice of one ſpeech, the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> ſaid, who confeſſed in cold bloud, that in ſixe yeares government of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Lands hee had put to death of the reformed Chriſtians meerely in the cauſe of Religion, eighteene thouſand; in thirtie yeares after the Ieſuites roſe, I find nine hundred thouſand Proteſtants, murdered in Chriſtendome, in a ſhort time one hundred thouſand in <hi>France,</hi> I could deſire to enlarge my ſelfe in declaring
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:44248:86"/>
of the monſtrous cruelty of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, 'Tis a matchleſſe, Intollerable, unſufferable perſecution, an invention found in hell, and uſed ſtill by helliſh furies; Give me leave I beſeech you, to recite one example of our own fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſubjects, by that Iudge of the reſt. <hi>Lithgow</hi> a <hi>Scot</hi> having attained King <hi>Iames</hi> his Letters for his commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for his ſafe travell through the world, hee paſſes through the greateſt parts of the knowne world, amongſt Turkes, Pagans, Infidels, Iewes; He travelled through Forreſts, Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and deſerts, hee met with theeves and murderers, Lions, Beares, and Tygers, yet came off ſafe: But as he paſſed through <hi>Spaine</hi> in the Citie of <hi>Maligo,</hi> on a ſuddaine he was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed by nine Sergeants, who faſt grapled him about the throat that he could not ſpeake, violently ſnatched him away, carryed him before the Governour, who firſt offered to him (as he called it) that tyrannicall oath, to anſwer to whatſoever they ſhould aske Him, they ſtrip him naked of his
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:44248:86"/>
cloathes, Robb'd him of his money, put him into a Dungeon without any light at all, with great fetters and ſhakles on his legges, fed him many dayes with a little muſty bread and cold water, they ſtarved him, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him; In tenne houres he received ſeaventy ſeverall torments, at laſt all the Lords Inquiſitors commanded him to receave Eleaven ſtrangling tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at midnight, and to bee burnt body and bones to aſhes, though they had nothing againſt him but ſuſpition of Religion, contrary to the peace then agreed upon, that none ſhould come into the Inquiſition: And yet after this, God wonderfully delivered him, hee was brought on his bed to our King, wounded and broken, who made this relation to the face of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimor the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſador.</p>
            <p>My Brethren, if the monſter of this day, which was brought to the birth, could the Devill have forced it forth; O what maſſacring, murdering and butchering of Innocents would there have beene, beſides the Maſſacre and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:44248:87"/>
murder of the day, wherein the King, and Queene, the Prince, the ſacred houſe of Parliament, and all that dwelt thereabouts, had beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed: who can conceive the ſad and bloudy conſequences of it; The ſword would not onely have paſſed through <hi>Weſtminster, London</hi> and the Regions about, but all the Country and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſhould have felt the fury of it, yea Children unborne ſhould have beene ſmothered with the ſmoake of it; When the <hi>Sicilians</hi> Maſſacred the <hi>French,</hi> their fury was ſo great, that they did not only not leave one <hi>French</hi> man among them, but ript up all their owne women that were with child by the <hi>French,</hi> that not one droppe of <hi>French</hi> bloud might remaine among them.</p>
            <p>When that great diſſention in <hi>Italy,</hi> and thoſe factious names of Gibilines and Guelphs came up, one adhering to the Emperor, the other to the Pope; When the Gibilines called in a third to aſſiſt them, promiſſing their goods, they having obteyned the victory fell

a Rifling of both without diſtinction, being charged with breach of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, they replyed, your ſelves are Gibilines and ſhall be ſafe, but your goods are Guelphs. I make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but the Engliſh Papiſts that now complaine of <hi>Salomons</hi> yoake, if ever the <hi>French, Spaniſh</hi> or <hi>Italian</hi> ſhould come victoriouſly among us (which God forbid) they would find <hi>Rehobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams</hi> burden, all their goods ſhould be Engliſh, if not they themſelves; Arch-Biſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> was not hee burnt though hee recanted? My ſword (ſaith the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>) knowes no difference; In the troubleſome Reigne of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> when the traitorous and rebellious Nobles called in the <hi>French,</hi> and joyned with them againſt their King; You may remember what <hi>Vicount Melun</hi> (troubled in Conſcience upon his death bed) told the Lords, affirming it upon his ſalvation, that <hi>Lewes</hi> and ſixteene Lords, had taken an oath, that if ever the Crown were ſet on his head hee would condemne to perpetuall exile and utterly extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:44248:88"/>
all their kinred that adhered to him, as Traitors to their owne Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne; when the proud <hi>Spaniards</hi> exerciſed thoſe Tyrannies in the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands, they firſt pretended the maintenance of the Romiſh Religion, yet they ſpared not to deprive very many Catholikes and Eccleſiaſticall perſons of their Liberties and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and the chiefeſt that was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted of the Nobility, was that vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant <hi>Count Egmund,</hi> that moſt zealouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was effected to their Religion, yet moſt cruelly tormented: examples are infinite, but I haſten to the third ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> puniſht them above their offence, nothing is more ordinary in the writings of the Ieſuites, then this, that Hereticks can never bee enough puniſhed; One complaines of that bloudy duke of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> that hee made the Netherlands worſe by ſhewing too much mercy, from Spaniſh mercy, Lord deliver us. <hi>Ariſt.</hi> ſaith; There ought to be a Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricall proportion betwixt the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:44248:88"/>
and the offence, leſſer offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not to bee puniſhed with the great cenſures of the Law. Doctor <hi>Burges</hi> preaching before King <hi>Iames,</hi> relates a ſtory of Pollio's Wife, that commanded her Butler to be hanged for breaking of a Glaſſe; The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror paſſing by, ſtayed the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſaid the ſight of the Gallowes was enough for ſuch an offence, and to prevent the like, commanded all glaſſes to be broken; It's Tyranny, bloudy cruelty to puniſh every ſinwith death. When men exerciſe great cenſures for ſmall offences; It is (as one ſaid) to kill a fly upon a mans fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head with a great Beetle: The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts will allow veniall ſinnes againſt God, but all are mortall againſt their Pope; There's no command of the morall Law, but they can diſpenſe with it, but none of their Ceremoniall Law, diſobedience to Parents, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Treaſons, Treachery, Adultery, Inceſt, Theft, Sacriledge, Lying, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, are all pardoned, but nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Let God ſay they, looke

to the breach of his owne Law, wee will looke to ours.</p>

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:44248:89"/>
indeed that caſheered one of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, becauſe he kept not the legge of a Peacocke, blaſphemouſly ſaying, God baniſht <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe for an Apple, and may not I his Vicar for a Peacocks legge. To excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate Kings and Princes, to interdict kingdomes, to raiſe motions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, to ſend out Croſado's againſt Chriſtians as againſt Turkes, becauſe in every thing they conforme not to the Pope, what greater injuſtice, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and oppreſſion; To raiſe one kingdome againſt another, to give one to another, what greater tyranny and cruelty: What had our King and State deſerved of the Gunpowder-Traitors that they ſhould reward it with ſo great cruelty? They were not put to death, as wee were in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes: our State had not erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Inquiſition like that of <hi>Spaine.</hi> It hath beene the conſtant atteſtation of our Princes and States, that not one Papiſt hath ſuffered in the cauſe of Religion; They enjoyed their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, their liberties, their titles of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:44248:90"/>
they were admitted neare to the Kings perſon, had the protection of our Lawes, no violence was offered to them, Engliſh Papiſts (ſaith one) are more pontificiall then the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> or <hi>French:</hi> That is, more falſe, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous, traitorous, bloudy and cruell. Soe that when the Romiſh Religion was in place among us, there were more invaſions and Rebellions then ever ſince, that it became proverbiall of our King and kingdome, that our King was the King of devils; Now ſince the puritie of the Goſpell among us, all Rebellions and Commotions have been of the Popiſh faction, I am ſure the conſpirators of this day were bloudy Papiſts. One ſaid to Q. <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> commending <hi>Seneca</hi>'s booke of Clemencie, and ſaying it had done her much good, yea (ſaith hee) but it hath done your ſubjects much hurt. You know not what Powder-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, may bee hatching in <hi>Rome,</hi> nor what Invincible Armado preparing in <hi>Spaine,</hi> nor what Incarnate Devill, and deſperately reſolved Ieſuite, with
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:44248:90"/>
murder in his heart, may be lurking in ſome ſecret corner of the kingdome. I know while the Devill is in hell, and the Pope in <hi>Rome,</hi> and the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> aſpiring to bee univerſall King as the Pope univerſall Biſhop, while the Ieſuites are ſuffered in <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are reformed, there wil not want Plots to confound us all; O they are active ſpirits, firy Gunpowder Traitors: A <hi>French</hi> Papiſt made this Apoſtrophe to <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth King of <hi>France;</hi> Great Prince (ſaith hee) Your Majeſtie need not feare the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Ieſuites, for you are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by the particular care and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary favour of GOD, which over-ſhadowes you, and makes you redoubtable to all your enemies. But Sir (ſaith hee) what hopes or meanes of ſafety or refuge to poſterity, when the Rat is in the Bagge, when the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent is in the boſome, the powder in the Piſtoll, Ieſuites (ſaith he) that are ſworne ſervants to the Pope, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bee true ſubjects to their Prince, they exempt themſelves, from obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44248:91"/>
and avouch the ſame of all Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie men, to make their party the more ſtrong, yet poore Prince, after a little while had the Ieſuites knife in his heart. God preſerve our King, and hee that brought him from <hi>Spaine</hi> to the admiration of many, that he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him a bleſſing to this age, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him from the power and cruelty of <hi>Spaine:</hi> yet as a Privie Counſellor ſpake of Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> concerning the Papiſts, he never went to bed but awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with feare, leaſt he ſhould heare of her death by Treaſon, nor never Roſe in the morning but expected the ſame ere night; So wee may bee ſure of this where ever occaſion is offered, how ever for the preſent they may ſtrive to appeare good ſubjects, traitors wil be ever traitors, ready to vent their Treaſon, the leaſt occaſion ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough to kill Kings and blow up Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; This is the third Aggravation.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> in their anger they ſlew a man, in their ſelfe will they digg'd downe a wall; Their anger was fierce, their wrath was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:44248:91"/>
               <hi>Salvian</hi> asketh, What? ſo great wickedneſſe in the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? that for this cauſe Parents curſe their children, and children their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents? No anger ſo fierce, nor rage ſo cruell, as that againſt ſincere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, I cannot but admire at the diveliſh rage of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> againſt us, they eſteeme all the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches no better then Turkes, Iewes and Infidels, nay worſe, for they admit theſe to dwell in the midſt of them.</p>
            <p>Blaſphemers, murderers, witches, perjured perſons, traitors, they can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with, they account us dogs, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy nothing but rackes, torture, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, worthy cruell death, and beaſtly buriall, they will not allow us a place in their purgatory, but ſend us to Hell, yea thoſe damned Hypocrites, the Lords Inquiſitors (the very <hi>Nero's</hi> and Caligula's of the Age) ſay, they ſhow too much lenitie to ſuch dogges as we are. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> in his hot Rage cauſed 7000. of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be put to death; for which cauſe
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:44248:92"/>
               <hi>Ambroſe</hi> excommunicated him, and he relenting made this Law, that exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution ſhould not ſoone follow ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, but thirtie dayes ſhould paſſe betweene them; They have not the reaſon of men, but the rage of Lions, the Venym of Serpents and devils, that are haſty to ſhed bloud. It was a cruell wiſh of <hi>Caligula,</hi> that wiſh't all <hi>Rome</hi> had but one neck, that he might cut it off at one blow, and the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> that wiſh't all the Netherlands a Sea; My brethren, there is no rage, wrath nor malice, like to the wrath of <hi>Rome,</hi> I cannot enlarge my ſelfe in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular; No piety to God, no juſtice to Innocents, no pitty to their friends, no loyaltie to their Soveraign, nothing is able to keep them in, <hi>Romes</hi> Babylonicall furnace is ſeaven times hotter, their rage and ſuperſtition (like two impetuous torrents,) beare down all reſpects before them, but that rage is moſt helliſh, which in peace ſtorms and thunders, which brings me to the fift Aggravation.</p>
            <p>The fifth circumſtance that aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:44248:92"/>
the ſinne is that they falſified their words, they broke their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants. The Papiſts teach that no faith is to be kept with Infidels, Heretickes, Oathes and agreements, ought to bee ſacred, and kept among all nations, Heathens will not infringe their oathes, when once the name of their God is upon them, for the terror of that God; Therefore the Heathen Embaſſadors of <hi>Rome,</hi> choſe rather voluntarily to returne and be tortured to death then perjured: When one of them equivocated to ſave his life, the Senate put him to death. But the <hi>Rome</hi> Chriſtian not onely practiſe, but teach that men may, men muſt breake, and the Pope can diſpenſe with the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the oath. The Councell of Conſtance determined this in the caſe of <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> and <hi>Ierom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> whom they illegally burnt though they had promiſed ſafety, ſaying, no faith was to bee kept with Hereticks. This made the friends of <hi>Luther</hi> ſo unwilling to let him goe to Wormes, though his reſolution was unalterable,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:44248:93"/>
I go (ſaith he) in the name of God and of Ieſus Chriſt, though as many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills were in Worms as there be tyles on the houſes, I would goe. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was the ſame <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved him, for <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts there would have him put to death, and had not the plaine oppoſition of <hi>Lewes</hi> Elector Palatine prevailed with the noble diſpoſition of <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, they had burnt him alſo.</p>
            <p>Good God! that they that have the faces of men, the Intellect of Angels, the profeſſion of Chriſtians, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of learning, ſo great a name through the whole world, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding maintaine ſuch diveliſh, Atheiſticall and damnable poſitions, contrary to all humane ſociety, to the ſhame of Chriſtians, to the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minie and reproach of <hi>Christ Ieſus,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the 2 <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> 2. calls him the lawleſſe man, no law can bind him, no covenants, no agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; When the Cardinals meete to chooſe a Pope in the Conclave, they make a vow, whoſoever is choſen <hi>Pope</hi>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:44248:93"/>
he ſhal ſweare to ſuch Articles as they make, And <hi>Sleydan</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pope</hi> is no ſooner choſen, but he breaks them all, and checks their Inſolencies, as if they went about to limit his power to whom al power is given in heaven and in earth; The Chriſtian Religion ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffered ſo great a ſcandall and loſſe, as when <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Legate</hi> diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the oath w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> 
               <hi>Vladiſlaus</hi> made to <hi>Amurath</hi> the Turk. The cauſe (ſaith Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi>) of the cruell war forty yeares betwixt the Netherlands and the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> which coſt one hundred Millions of money, and the lives of foure hundred thouſand of men, is diſpenſing with the oath the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> took; Ile inſtance in one to which a ſecond cannot bee added, <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, Emperor, and <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall</hi> the Pope, made an agreement, for further teſtimony of their Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, and for more ſecurity the Pope doth adminiſter the Sacrament with theſe words; Take this pledge of my true love and our unfained recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, let him bee divided from
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:44248:94"/>
               <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and have no part in his kingdome who firſt breakes covenant, yet the very next yeare with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of his Cardinals hee broke this oath, when oathes and Covenants are like <hi>Sampſons</hi> cords, not able to binde, what ſafety can there be in the world? Some Ieſuites laugh at the Zeale of our King and State, in making the oath of Allegiance, and ſay it's to bind ſilly Foxes, and is eaſily broken, and ſay the Pope can diſpenſe with the oath, one ſaith the oath is voyd, and holds it ſinne for a Papiſt, to performe his word to a Proteſtant, I make no wonder that ſome Papiſts take the oath, I wonder that any refuſe it, when the Pope can diſpenſe with it, and deale with them as hee did with the <hi>French</hi> King, give him leave to take an oath, and then promiſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with the breaking of it; what certainty or ſecurity can Kings have, when ſuch damnable Tenents are broached in the world, that oathes are not to bee kept with Hereticks, and they are Heretickes whom the Pope

will have ſo; This is the fifth Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> coloured their revenge and crueltie, under a cloak and maske of religion: Religion ought not to bee a Bond of Iniquitie, yet under Religion in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> all iniquitie (eſpecially Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, treaſons, Perjury,) Iuſtifies it ſelfe, They make the cauſe of Religion to deſcend to the execrable Acts of the murdering of Princes, Butchering of Innocents, firing of States, no men more pretend and boaſt of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the holineſſe of their medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then the Ieſuites doe, yet this Platforme is heatheniſh, Tyrannicall, and able to ſet Aretine, Lucian, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavell and the Devill himſelfe to Schoole. I want words to expreſſe that peſtilent project of the Popes, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured under a pretence of Religion, for the recovery of the holy Land; For two hundred yeares together they made the flower and Chivalrie of Chriſtendome to fall by Millions in the fooliſh Conqueſt of <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:44248:95"/>
They ſent Chriſtian Princes far from their own kingdomes, to inveſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into them: never any Nation ſo heatheniſh, and barbarous and diveliſh, whoſe Religion maintained Murder, Treaſon, Treacheries, Perjuries. In every Religion and State have beene ſome ſuch found, but none whoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hath maintained them as the Religion of Rome doth. <hi>Fawkes</hi> had nothing to charge the State withall, but that Religion prompted him to this Treaſon; When <hi>Ravilliac</hi> murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth King of <hi>France,</hi> being tortured to know his incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to it, he ſent them to the Sermons made by the Ieſuites in Lent. They that read <hi>Bellarmine, Suarez, Eudeman, Becanus, Emanuell Say,</hi> ſhall eaſily perceive their Religion teaches Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, Treaſon; That Act of <hi>Iehu</hi> in proclaiming a ſolemne ſervice to <hi>Baal,</hi> and then murdering of them, and that of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> commanding all his chiefe officers to worſhip the Idol, and then caſheering them, wants more ſubtill Patrons to maintaine it, then
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:44248:95"/>
either my Religion, or my reaſon can reach to: Religion needs not to bee ſhrowded under the Cloak of policy. That great <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> they have lifted up to ſo high a ſtraine that they equall him to God, and ſay there is no appeale from him to God, God and he are of one and the ſame Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; He can determine againſt the Law of Nations, againſt the Law of nature, againſt the Law of God. Yea that his power and actions are no way to bee diſputed of; That is the cauſe of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and the juſt cauſe of all: O, I am weary of the Blaſphemy and cruelty of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> their Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are ſo innumerable, their tyranny ſo execrable, their cruelty ſo unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, their deluſions ſo heatheniſh, their perjuries ſo diveliſh, that the like was never in any ſtate: Murders, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries, Treaſons are there in their proper place, they are no ſinnes in <hi>Rome,</hi> or at leaſt but Veniall ſinnes, eaſily diſpenſed with by the Pope, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions and Treaſons, Maſſacring,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:44248:96"/>
and butchering of Innocents, <hi>Draco's</hi> lawes and Spaniſh inquiſitors, inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable wrath and inveterate rage, perjuries and breaking Covenants, theſe are the Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> It was once in the Engliſh Liturgy (King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth put it in, Queene <hi>Mary</hi> put it out,) That we ſhould pray that our Kingdom ſhould bee delivered from ſedition, tyranny, and conſpiracy of the Pope, wee may doe it ſtill, (at leaſt in private prayers,) from the treaſons, treachery, perjury of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from the rage, malice and cruelty, from the Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites and Ieſuited Papiſts, Good Lord deliver us.</p>
            <p>And thus I have done with the firſt Generall, the ſinne of Ieſuites and Ieſuited Papiſts; It now onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines to ſpeake of the ſecond, their cenſure.</p>
            <p>Their cenſure, ſhall I ſmite them (my Brethren?) <hi>Iacob</hi> you heare would not ſpare his own ſons though
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:44248:96"/>
in the ſame houſe with him, though they ate the ſame bread, drank of the ſame Cup, were of the ſame faith, though what they did, they did it in revenge of the wrong done to their ſiſter, ſhall we then ſpare them? No, I muſt follow <hi>Iacob</hi> ſtill, O my ſoule, come not thou into their ſecret, unto their aſſembly mine honour bee not thou united: curſed be their anger for it was cruell, and their wrath for it was fierce: God divide them from the ſon of our <hi>Iacob,</hi> and ſcatter them from our Engliſh <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O my ſoule, come not into their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret: we muſt neither with heart nor tongue, affection nor action, neither in word nor deed, no (my Brethren) not ſo much as in thought nor look, ſhow any countenance to Popiſh Cruelty, their treaſons, murders, perjuries, and the reſt of that Heatheniſh cruelty; It hath beene the deſire of many, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of ſome, to worke a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation betwixt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:44248:97"/>
and us, <hi>Franciſcus de ſancta clara,</hi> whoſe booke of reconciliation hath been 23. times printed, I have read it, and I will ſay of it, that the diſcourſe doth more confirme mee, that it's impoſſible to make a reconciliation betwixt them, indeed there may bee ſuch a forme of confeſſion drawn up in termes that both ſides may ſubſcribe to, but then the termes ſhall bee ſo Ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that at the next opening of the ſore (the skinne being but heal'd over before) the breach will be more dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; A Botch is never cured as long as the core remaines, excrements will grow on a dead body while the humor laſts: <hi>Arius</hi> preſented the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> with ſuch a forme of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that when the Orthodox read it, they conceived it for their ſide, and the <hi>Arians</hi> for theirs. The quarrell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Rome</hi> and us is not like <hi>Caeſar</hi> and Pompey, which ſhould be chiefe, but like that betwixt <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> which ſhould not be: if <hi>Rome</hi> prevaile we ſhall not ſtand; and if we prevaile,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:44248:97"/>
they ſhould not ſtay long, <hi>Bellar.</hi> ſaith plainly, the controverſie betwixt them and us is whether the Church of God conſiſt or no, or be ſhattered in peeces. A learned man of our <hi>Church,</hi> yet very moderate too, conceives it impoſſible that ever there ſhould be reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt them. Therefore (ſaith he) if theſe reconcilers were the wiſeſt men under heaven and ſhold live to the worlds end, they would be brought to their wits end, before they could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh this works end, to make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, betwixt <hi>Rome</hi> and us: you know who printed it long agoe, no peace with <hi>Rome,</hi> that King of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſo called by the King of Schollers, ſaid plainely, The <hi>Northerne</hi> and <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne</hi> Poles may ſooner meete in one, then a Reconciliation betwixt the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and us. I could bring in the teſtimony of many Reverend men of our <hi>Clergy:</hi> if nothing elſe, yet, this is enough to free them from being limbs of Antichriſt, in regard that a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation is impoſſible, and if there can be
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:44248:98"/>
no reconciliation, I truſt the reformed Churches will ever ſcorne to accept a diſpenſation, and the piety and policy of our Chriſtian ſtate to admit a tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration among us.</p>
            <p>Come out of Babylon, is the voyce from Heaven, come out in affection, come out in perſon, ſeparate farre from them, ſay with <hi>Iacob,</hi> ô my ſoule, come not into their ſecret: unto their aſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, mine honour bee thou not united; But what? is this enough to abhorre future agreement with them, to deny them approbation to their deeds? <hi>Iacob</hi> goes further, and we muſt follow him, curſed be their anger for it was fierce, and their wrath for it was cruell; One ſaith, Babylons brats, muſt not bee dandled on the lap, but daſht againſt the Stones: Another, painted <hi>Iezabel</hi> the whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> muſt be throwne out at the windowes, to be troden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot of horſes; Another, <hi>Rome</hi> is like a Nettle, ſtings them that handle it ſoftly; A fourth ſaith, they are like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bells, never well tuned, till they be

well hang'd; Only I ſay, as <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaith, <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> made themſelves ſtinke among the Nations, and one day the Nations will conſume them and their houſe. I would not (my brethren) blow the Trumpet to this Warre; Let <hi>Rome</hi> founded in bloud, propagate her Religion in bloud: I have otherwiſe learned <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> the King of peace.</p>
            <p>I hate the perſon of no Papiſt under heaven, I know God hath a great peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple among them, elſe he would never ſay, come out of Babylon, yea Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, Nations and kingdoms that now adhere to the beaſt ſhall hate the Whore; I ſee Ieſuites themſelves may be converted, I dare not hate them, nor ſo love their perſons as to ſpare their wickedneſſe: curſed be their anger for it was fierce, and their wrath for it was cruell: curſed be the Religion that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes rebellion, Treaſon, murdering of Innocents, treachery, perjury; The worſt I will doe againſt them, is to pray, <hi>God</hi> divide them from the ſon of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and ſcatter them from our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

            <p>I have now done with my Text and with the Application alſo, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines ſome little of my Sermon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind: you have heard (my Brethren) <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> fit parallells of Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites and Ieſuited Papiſts: as face an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers face in a glaſſe, ſo the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the one, anſwers the cruelty of the other; <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> in cruelty againſt <hi>Hamor</hi> and <hi>Shechem</hi> &amp; the reſt of the Citie, will be Typicall for the Tragedy of this day; I ſee little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, but now in one thing, in the laſt thing, in the concluſion of all, (with which I will conclude my Sermon) O they differ altogether; They as their
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:44248:100"/>
reſolution was fierce, ſo their execution was cruell: they did not onely meere and conſult, plot, and contrive, and combine themſelves in one, but they did accompliſh, and finiſh, and perfect their intention. The laſt Act was Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall and bloudy; But as for ours, God fruſtrated all their preparations, and that, when it was but late, there was not many ſands to runne in the glaſſe, not many ſtrokes to ſtrike at the Clocke, not one Tide to paſſe the Bridge, it was late laſt night, that God diſcovered it, and this morning it ſhould have beene executed; The knife was at the Throate, the dagger at the breaſt, the powder in the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, the Match burning in the hand, there was the villaine ready to give fire: But God delivered us, and they periſhed in their Treaſon, and let their memories periſh with them.</p>
