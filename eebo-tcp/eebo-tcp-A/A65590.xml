            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AMong other Artifices, wherewith the <hi>Romish</hi> Emissaries recommend their Religion to igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and unwary Persons, none hath been more specious and successful, than the pretence of an excellent Ecclesiastical Policy, fitted to preserve Vnion in the Church, and prevent the Illusions of a private Spirit. The badness of their Cause permits them not to descend into a scrupulous examination of the merits of it. Every single Controversie hath been so often hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and so demonstratively determined against them, that it would be rash and disadvantageous to resume the debate of those particular Questions. It was therefore found necessary to advance some general Considerations, which might amuse the Ignorant, and divert the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive from the examination of particular Controversies. Prejudices have been published against the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and pompous Arguments of external Convenience daily urged in favour of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of these is the pretended excellence of the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Church, tending to preserve an intire unity of Faith, and universal decency of Discipline in the Church, and free all private Persons from the danger of entertaining any pernicious Error, or at least infusing it into others continuing in the Communion of the Church; while every one submits his private Reason to the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, and with a blind obedience receives
<pb facs="tcp:46195:6"/>
directions from the Living Rule of Faith, whether Pope or Council.</p>
            <p>This supposed Advantage hath been often, and with great ostentation produced in behalf of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; and a natural tendency to Disorder, Heresie and Schism, with great vehemence charged upon the Church of <hi>England.</hi> It is objected that she allows to every man an unlimited power of using his own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in deciding matters of Faith; that she constitutes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Person a supreme Iudge of the most momentous Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies, from whom lyeth no Appeal to any Visible Iudge on Earth; That she subjects the Faith of all private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to infinite uncertainty and fluctuation, since the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Direction of the Holy Ghost is promised only to the Representative Church; and the Iudgments of men may be as various as are their Humours and Vnderstandings; That hereby a door is opened to infinite Heresies and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and the Christian Religion exposed to the danger of being divided into as many several Systems as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Proselytes: That by this disorder all Rules of Faith are rendred useless, since whatsoever they may propose in their genuine sense, men will adapt them to their own pre-conceived Notions<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and frame to themselves a belief from the Dictates and Inclinations of their private Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: whereby unity of Faith will be totally destroyed, and Religion will degenerate into downright Enthusiasm.</p>
            <p>Indeed the danger of Enthusiasm, when rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, is so fatal to Christianity, and destructive to the Reason of Mankind; that we cannot but conclude any Church, which is guilty of it, to be grosly corrupted and degenerate; and shall willingly put the whole Controversy upon this issue. But then Enthusiasm consists not in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing to every private Person the power of judging for himself in matters of Religion. For this the Nature as
<pb facs="tcp:46195:6"/>
well as Interest of Mankind requireth, which received the use of Reason chiefly for this end; and even our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries themselves must at last recur to this principle; but it consists in pretending to receive the Articles of Faith by extraordinary Illumination, and in irrational and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant actions of Devotion and Piety, which a fond Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination mistaketh for the Impulses and Dictates of the Divine Spirit. Such Pretences and Actions, as they are most remote from the Genius and Constitution of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; so they naturally flow from the Principles of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and are fomented and promoted by her.</p>
            <p>This appears upon many accounts, but chiefly from the consideration of her most Illustrious Saints, whom she ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired when living, and reverenceth when dead; consulted them then as Oracles, and proposeth them now to her Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers as Patterns of the most consummate Perfection, and by canonization of them, and solemnizing their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, hath set a publick stamp of authority and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation upon their Life and Conduct. The most eminent of these were extravagant Enthusiasts, who distinguished themselves from the rest of Mankind by nothing else but the continued exercise of a blind Fanaticism. The proof of this Charge is the design of this present Treatise; which hath therefore assumed for the Subject of it the Actions of <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> as the greatest and most il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious of all the latter <hi>Romish</hi> Saints.</p>
            <p>If our Arguments shall be convictive, and the most admired Saints of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> shall be found to be in the highest degree guilty of Enthusiasm; many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Conclusions may be drawn from thence in relation to other Controversies, which I shall not here insist to prove; The so much boasted Order and Discipline of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will be intirely ruined. For if the
<pb facs="tcp:46195:7"/>
pretence of a private Impulse be once publickly admitted and countenanced in any Church, all Impulses whatsoever must be allowed without distinction, whether agreeable or contrary to decency and the established Discipline of the Church, which will open a wide door to all licentious Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, since it is the nature of Enthusiasm ever to affect somewhat extravagant and irregular. The certainty of Oral Tradition will be overthrown; since if Persons of so great authority and repute, as Saints are supposed to be, received not the Catholick Faith from any precedent Tradition, but from extraordinary Inspiration, that is in truth, the whimsies of their own Brains, and so deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it to vast multitudes of credulous Hearers; Oral Tradition will be interrupted, and the grossest Heresie might be easily introduced in the Church.</p>
            <p>But to omit other Consequences prejudicial to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; the <hi>Invocation of Saints</hi> will hence receive a fatal blow. For it would be highly irrational to address our Prayers to any Saint to desire his intercession in Heaven, unless we were probably assured that the Saint hath already obtained a place in Heaven. But if the Church can so far err in the Canonization of Saints, as to bestow that sacred Character upon, publickly address Prayers to, and exhort the People in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Devotions to desire the intercession of such foolish En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasts, as are utterly unworthy the lowest seat in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and perhaps never got so far as Purgatory; then <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> altho we should grant it to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the Theory, cannot but be infinitely unsafe in the practice of it.</p>
            <p>If the imputation of Enthusiasm renders the Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these Saints unsafe and dangerous; much more will the evidence of some notorious Crime unrepented of incapacitate other <hi>Romish</hi> Saints from receiving our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses.
<pb facs="tcp:46195:7"/>
That there have been such, the Examples of St. <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> and St. <hi>Dominick</hi> put past all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; the first of which violently opposed the lawful power of his Prince over the Clergy; the last employed his whole life in inciting Armies of holy Pilgrims to the slaughter of the innocent <hi>Albigenses.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>2d part of the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Exposition of the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England.</note> But what, if after all, great numbers of Saints, placed in the <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar, and invoked in the publick Offices of the Church, had never any existence, and are the meer Inventions of Romantick Legends? A Learned Person hath lately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced in some few of them, as St. <hi>George,</hi> St. <hi>Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> St. <hi>Longinus,</hi> St. <hi>Viarius,</hi> &amp;c. to which perhaps some hundreds might be added. I will instance but in one, but him most remarkable, and not yet observed by any, as being such a Monster of a Saint, as Pagan Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition would have never thought of, and which may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps at the first sight seem incredible.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath taken the <hi>Almanack</hi> into the number of the Saints, and canonized it under the name of St. <hi>Almachius,</hi> solemnizeth its memory on the first day of <hi>January,</hi> and giveth to it an illustrious Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in the Martyrology. This probably proceeded from the mistake of some ignorant Monk about the seventh or eighth Age, who finding the word S. <hi>Almanacum, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum Almanacum</hi> written in the front of the Calendar, and not knowing what to make of that barbarous term, with which he was before unacquainted, imagined it to be some ancient obscure Saint, who took up the first place in the Calendar. Being possessed with this Error, it was no hard matter to make S. <hi>Almachius</hi> of S. <hi>Almanacum</hi> written in the old way of Abbreviation. Having thus framed the Saint, out of good manners he placed him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Circumcision of our Lord, the memory of which is celebrated upon the same day; but yet to keep the former
<pb facs="tcp:46195:8"/>
Order as much as possible, immediately after it, as it now continueth in the <hi>Roman</hi> Martyrology. This unhappy mistake was thence transcribed into many other Copies, and so encreased the Rabble of the <hi>Romish</hi> Saints with the addition of St. <hi>Almanack.</hi> Afterwards a goodly Story was framed of him; that he suffered Martyrdom at <hi>Rome</hi> under the Presecture of <hi>Alipius,</hi> where repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the Gladiators in the Amphitheater for their bloody sports, he was killed by them. That my Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is just, manifestly appears from the constant silence of all ancient Writers concerning any such Martyr. None makes mention of him before <hi>Alcuinus</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>De Divin. Offic. c. 4.</hi>
               </note>; and he doth it in such a manner as sheweth that he knew not what to make of him. For as for the Martyrologies of <hi>Beda, Usuardus</hi> and <hi>Ado,</hi> they have received so many Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polations from latter hands, that no Arguments can be drawn from them. <hi>Baronius</hi> is grievously perplexed about this S. <hi>Almachius.</hi> One while <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Not. in Martyrolog.</hi> Rom. <hi>p. 3. Edit.</hi> Paris, <hi>1645.</hi>

               </note> under <hi>Theodosius</hi>; and supposeth him to have been the same with the Martyr <hi>Telemachus,</hi> of whom <hi>Theodoret</hi> 
               <note n="(d)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Hist. Eccl. l. 6. c. 26.</hi>
               </note> makes mention. But so prodigious a change of <hi>Telema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> into <hi>Almachius</hi> is somewhat incredible; and that <hi>Telemachus</hi> was stoned, whereas <hi>Almachius</hi> is said to have been stabbed. Add to this universal silence of the Ancients, that S. <hi>Almachius</hi> is placed exactly in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Calendar, on the first of <hi>January,</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the Circumcision of Christ; and the matter will be rendred highly probable. The only Objection, which with any shew of reason can be opposed, is, that the word <hi>Almanacum</hi> seems not to have been so ancient as the time of <hi>Alcuinus,</hi> as being received from the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians.</hi> But this is no other than a vulgar Error. For <hi>Porphyry</hi> 
               <note n="(e)" place="margin">

               <hi>whose names are contained in the Almanacks:</hi> which may also give a probable reason how the letter <hi>h</hi> crept into <hi>Almachius.</hi> For as anciently in spelling words derived from the Greek, they kept much more closely to the Greek Orthography, than we now do; it is not unlikely that when this word was first adopted by the Latins, it was writ <hi>Almanachum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Arguments will at least create a probability of my Assertion, that this fictitious Saint arose from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy mistake of some ignorant Writer. If our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> shall yet persist to defend the honour and truth of their Calendar; it will concern them to produce better Arguments for the existence of St. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machius,</hi> than I have now proposed against it: But to return from St. <hi>Almanack</hi> to St. <hi>Ignatius</hi>; it cannot be pretended by our Adversaries, that the Character of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm or Falsity, which I have affixed to him, and the Miracles attributed to him, may equally be fastned on the Actions and Miracles of Christ and his Apostles; altho both <hi>Ignatius</hi> and St. <hi>Francis</hi> in acting their Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances flattered themselves with the thoughts of a perfect imitation of Christ. As for the reception of the Faith by extraordinary Illumination, and in many cases acting by Divine Impulse; that in the first propagation of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity (when it was both necessary and convenient) was no argument or character of Enthusiasm: but only in subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent times, after the Faith had been once published; and an ordinary Rule, whether Scripture or Tradition, was fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which by natural means might divulge the knowledge of it. Nothing childish or ridiculous can be discovered in the Actions of Christ and his Apostles; none of those frantick Motions, or irrational Extravagances, which are so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
<pb facs="tcp:46195:9"/>
conspicuous in the whole Conduct of <hi>Ignatius.</hi> At least none of their Miracles are subject to those Objections, which intirely ruine the credit of those ascribed to <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi> They were all well attested, performed before whole multitudes of Enemies as well as Friends, delivered to us by Eye-witnesses, and that without any fluctuation, or mutual repugnance of their Testimony, were not destructive of the Laws of Corporeal Beings, nor included any contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, contained nothing monstrous or indecent in them, and were in all respects intirely conformable to the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty of that God, who wrought them; and the gravity of that Religion, which was confirmed by them.</p>
            <p>It will perhaps be pretended with greater shew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that the actions and Histories of many famous Monks and Anchorets of the Ancient Church give no small counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to the Conduct of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and by the authority of their Examples rescue it from the force of our Objections; that consequently the Ancient Church is no less subject to the Charge of Enthusiasm than the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and both equally concerned in it. Altho the deformity of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm cannot be palliated by any Authority whatsoever; yet the regard which I have to Truth, and the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence which the Church of <hi>England</hi> not unjustly beareth to the more pure and ancient times of Christianity, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth me to remove this prejudice, and preclude the force of any such Objection, before I dismiss the Reader.</p>
            <p>First then, however it cannot be denied that many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who obtained to themselves an extraordinary repute of sanctity in the Ancient Church, committed many gross irregularities in the conduct of their Devotion, practised immoderate Austerities, and were sometimes guilty of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Actions; yet the Ancient Vniversal Church is not in the least concerned in all this, nor receiveth any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice from the indiscreet Zeal of these private Bigots.
<pb facs="tcp:46195:9"/>
She gave no countenance to their Extravagances, never recommended them to the practise or imitation of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, much less approved them by any solemn and publick Act. Whereas the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath in the highest and most solemn manner espoused the Follies and Whimsies of her Enthusiastick Saints by canonizing them, celebrating their Memories with Festivals and pompous Ceremonies, invoking them in her publick Offices, and recommending their Examples to the World as the best and greatest Patterns of Christian Perfection.</p>
            <p>This alone might suffice to overthrow all pretence of Antiquity in this case. Yet to clear the matter somewhat farther, I will observe that these indiscreet Actions and Childish Irregularities were the products of latter and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Ages in the Ancient Church, unknown to the first four Ages, when Christianity flourished in its greatest pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. In the three first Ages not the least footstep or sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of them can be found; and in the fourth Age they were very rarely practised, and wholly confined to the Desarts of <hi>Egypt</hi> or <hi>Palestine.</hi> As for the Follies rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of St. <hi>Antony</hi> in his Life, ascribed to St. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and those of other Saints in the <hi>Vitae Patrum,</hi> said to have been writ by St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> all Learned Men are now agreed that the former Work is miserably corrupted, the latter wholly spurious. After the fourth Age, many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish Impertinencies and trifling Superstitions began to be practised by the Monks and Hermits, whose Follies are celebrated and magnified by injudicious Writers of the same Order and time, such as <hi>Palladius, Heraclitus, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picius Severus, Cassian</hi> and <hi>Moschus</hi>; but augmented with a large addition of Fables and absurdity, by the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Legendary Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place it deserveth farther to be considered, that in the Ancient Church none but obscure and inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
<pb facs="tcp:46195:10"/>
Persons, confined to a Mountain or a Desart, who obtained neither authority nor reputation in the Church, were guilty of such foul mistakes and irregularities. The great and famous Doctors and Fathers of the Church, who drew the eyes of the whole World upon their Actions, and acquired to themselves an universal veneration, cannot be accused of such fatal miscarriages, which were so far unworthy of them. On the contrary, they sharply opposed the misguided Zeal of these ignorant Devotoes, censured their imprudent Actions, slighted their external shews of apparent Piety, and deplored the evil consequences of their irregular Practices. What the wisest of the Ancients dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned, deserve not to be excused and defended by us. And indeed the trifling Devotions and wild Impertinencies of the Monastick Order were the greatest blemish to those latter Ages of Antiquity; and laid the foundation of all Corruptions, whether of Faith or Manners, which infected succeeding Ages.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In vita Aedesii prope fin.</hi>
               </note> Towards the beginning of the fifth Age, <hi>Eunapius,</hi> the Heathen Historian, could find no more plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or rational objection against Christianity, than the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Actions and ridiculous Conduct of the Monks: cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly no objection was then more visible, or less capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a refutation. But then the Actors of these Follies never obtained that respect and admiration from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick suffrage of the Ancient Church, which Enthusiastick Saints have received from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer commemorated none in her publick Offices but Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, Confessors and famous Persons, who had been emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently instrumental in the service of the Church; and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not her Diptychs with Monks and Anchorets. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath scarce canonized any other than such as were chiefly eminent for Enthusiasm.</p>
            <p>Lastly, to say no more, Even the highest Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of these Ancient Bigots come far beneath the Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasm
<pb facs="tcp:46195:10"/>
of <hi>Ignatius</hi> and other admired Saints of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> They might perhaps commit many gross absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and indecent actions, and entertain Childish notions of Religion; but never proceeded so far, as to pretend to extraordinary Illuminations, reception of the Faith by su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Revelation, and continual Impulse of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit; nor took upon them to publish their own Whimsies by preaching to the People without any commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from the Governours of the Church; which are the genuine and most essential Characters of Fanaticism. If the Miracles related of them be sometimes found to lye open to the same Objections, which are opposed by me to those of <hi>Ignatius</hi>; the honour of the Ancient Church suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers no prejudice thereby; which far from building her Authority and Reputation on them, hath frequently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned and rejected them; as appears among other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, from that Passage of the Learned Author of the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Imperfectum,</hi> which I have produced in the following Discourse. None will be concerned in the truth of these ancient Monkish Miracles, but that Church only, which hath proposed them to the People in her publick Offices and Ecclesiastical Legends.</p>
            <p>In representing the Actions of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> I have chiefly made use of the Authority of <hi>F. Dominick Bouhours,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Iesuit<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> altho one of the latest Writers of his Life; because in publishing the Life of <hi>Ignatius</hi> of late among us, that Author was thought fit to be preferred before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and his Relation of him translated into our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. However, in whatsoever he proposeth, he wants not the attestation of more ancient and authentick Writers. For he seems to have taken his whole Relation from <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landinus</hi> his History of the <hi>Society of Jesus,</hi> printed at <hi>Colen</hi> in the Year <hi>1615.</hi> with the approbation of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius Aquaviva</hi> the General. I have seldom produced any
<pb facs="tcp:46195:11"/>
other Writers of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Life; but when the first is either wholly silent, or giveth a different Relation. If I have sometimes inserted Observations from the Life of <hi>Apollonius Tyaneus</hi>; that tendeth as well to illustrate the nature of Enthusiasm in general, as to do justice to the common Cause of Christianity against the pretences of an Impostor, whom the latter Heathens set up in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our Blessed Saviour.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I hope our Adversaries will not pretend that I have misrepresented or falsified the Actions of <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius:</hi> since I have all along to every particular Action so carefully annexed in the Margent the Author who relates it, and the place where it may be found. The pretence of misrepresentation is the last refuge of a baffled Cause; and therefore made use of by our Adversaries as the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining expedient upon all occasions; particularly by the Author of the <hi>Monomachia,</hi> who not being able to answer the Objections brought by a Friend of mine against the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of his <hi>Speculum Ecclesiasticum,</hi> pretended to overrule the concurrent Testimonies of <hi>Labb√©, Oudin, Du Pin,</hi> and other <hi>Romish</hi> Criticks; because the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar places of their Books, to which those Passages related, were not adjoined; and insinuated a suspicion of some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sincerity, as if that omission had proceeded from a fear, lest the truth of those Citations should be examined. What the ignorance or artifice of this Author will not permit him to do<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> at least all judicious Persons will allow, that it were both unuseful and impertinent to stuff the Margents with particular mention of the places of such Critical Writers, who in giving their Censures upon Ancient Authors, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed either Alphabetically, or in order of time, and may consequently be immediately recurred to without any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. But a lame excuse must serve the turn, when the badness of the Cause will admit no better.</p>

            <head>THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE CHURCH of <hi>ROME,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>SO great and venerable an Idea of God is by nature imprinted in the minds of men; so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and convictive are the Arguments of his Omniscience and Veracity, that all Divine Revelations are no sooner proposed, than admitted; and esteemed to command, no less than to deserve our assent. The infinite desires of our Will, and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble imperfections of our Understanding, sufficiently convinceth mankind of the necessity of such Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The desire of happiness is natural to all, and impossibility of attaining it in this life is no less evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. The nature and immateriality of our Soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates that we were created for greater and more noble ends than the mean and inconsiderable enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this life; that we cannot but exist for ever, and are capable of Eternal Happiness; and then our Will naturally prompts us to desire that this future Happiness may be commensurate to the infinite dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our existence, and not inferior to the capacity of our Nature. Yet these ardent desires, and possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of obtaining them, would but enhance our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46195:12"/>
and augment our wishes, unless the means of attaining them were assured to us. This Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation alone can do; since God alone can confer that happiness upon mankind; and that he will do it, can no otherwise appear than by some external Revelation. The sense and evidence of these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Truths have excited mankind in all Ages to enquire after such Revelation, and obliged them to found all their hopes of future Happiness upon it. Their Hopes and Desires induced them to attend to the proposal of it, and then their Reason commanded them to acquiesce in it. The assurance of the Divine Infallibility excluded all doubts and scruples; and the sense of their Interest engaged in it, banished even all desire of doubting.</p>
            <p>Thus Divine Revelations easily gained belief and obedience in the World; and if at any time they were rejected or disbelieved by men, it was because their Judgment and Assent was prepossessed with some either real, or feigned Revelation. But then it could not be avoided but this natural reverence for Divine Revelations, and proneness of believing them, would produce some ill effects prejudicial to the Reason and Interest of mankind. A fatal credulity would creep into the World, and possess the minds of more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Persons, and induce them blindly to believe every bold Pretender to Revelation. After a labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and fruitless search of future Happiness, men were apt to embrace any System of Religion presented to them, if it flattered their hopes of future felicity; they were loth to discover the error and illusion of any pleasing Revelation: they wished it might be true; and what at first they wished, they at last be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. But not only did the desires and hopes of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46195:12"/>
mankind create this credulity; the natural reverence of God and all divine Oracles, when not rationally directed, advanc'd and increas'd it. Many feared they should be injurious to the Divine Majesty, and incur the guilt of Atheism, if they should scrupulously examine what pretended to carry the stamp of his Authority, and to have been revealed by him. To entertain scruples in this case, was thought no less than Sacrilege; and every doubt was esteemed an affront to God. To which may be added, that most imagined they should contract no small merit, and even lay an obligation upon God, if they immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately resigned up their judgment to his supposed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and blindly received it without any doubt or hesitation.</p>
            <p>This in all Ages opened a wide gate, and prepared the way for Error and Superstition: while the whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of every foolish Enthusiast, and fables of every bold Impostor were proposed under the venerable name of Divine Oracles, and securely believed by the credulous multitude. Hence all the follies and absurdities of Pagan Religion found belief and entertainment in the World; and the most extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Impostors never wanted Proselytes. Hence the most pernicious Errors of Hereticks found admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion into the Church; and the pretence of new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations in every Age, seduced some part of the Christian World. All the present corruptions of the Faith are owing to it; on which side soever any Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors at this day are entertained, a scrupulous exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation would discover them to be entertained chiefly for the precedent reasons; and all modern additions to genuine Christianity will be found either to flatter the hopes, or raise the admiration of the common People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:46195:13"/>To this fatal credulity, and danger of illusion ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from it, God and Nature have assigned an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent remedy, the use of our Reason; which may exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the grounds and testimonies of all pretended Revelations, inquire into their truth, and after a scrupulous trial pass sentence on them. This the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of Truth, and the honour of our Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to perform, that we may neither prostitute the former, nor depreciate the latter by submitting our Understandings to the Pretensions of every bold Impostor. Without this precedent enquiry, our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief would be irrational, and far from being merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, would become unlawful. For to violate the rules of conduct prescribed to our understanding, were to overthrow all the Laws of Nature, to debase the dignity of mankind, and efface the Image of God imprinted in us. These Rules assure us that God cannot reveal any thing foolish or ridiculous, much less contrary to the testimony of our Senses, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the first principles of Reason. No greater injury can be offered to the Deity, than to believe him the Author of any Religion which prescribes or encourageth foolish and superstitious Practices, or opposeth Sense and Reason. All such Revelations would imply repugnant Attributes to be in God; which if it did not destroy his existence, would at least oblige us to form dishonourable Ideas of him. And therefore <hi>Seneca</hi> truly saith, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Superstitio error insanus est, quos co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit, violat.

               <hi>Superstition is a most senseless Error, which affronts that Object it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to worship. For what doth it matter, whether you deny or dishonour God?</hi> Justly also doth <hi>Plutarch</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note n="(b)" place="margin">

                  </gap>. De Superstitione.</note> why Atheism should be rather accused of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46195:13"/>
Impiety than Superstition, since few of are moved by any defect in the Order or Government of the World to call in question the Existence of God; but the Tricks and Cheats of superstitious Persons, their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiastick Motions, Ridiculous Actions, Exorcisms, Lustrations, and such like, give them occasion to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it better, and more rational, there should be no God, than such a God, as the Author of such a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious Religion must necessarily be. So that wise Heathen.</p>
            <p>If Christianity in the first and purer Ages of it, had laboured with these difficulties, or been obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to these Objections; it could never have convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the World of its Truth, or surmounted the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Heathen Philosophy. It would have been highly irrational and unworthy the learning of those Ages to have deserted one Superstition to embrace another so much more absurd, than the former, by how much the one was repugnant to Reason alone, the other both to Sense and Reason. It is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness of latter Ages, to lye open to the force of this Objection, which after so many Superstitious Practices and Opinions introduced into a great part of the Christian Church, is thereby become unanswer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. For, whosoever considers the Fictions of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, Purgatory and Infallibility, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence of Prayers in an unknown Tongue, the trifling Actions of their most illustrious Saints, and fond Superstitions practiced in their several Monastick Orders, Processions, Worship of Images, Saints and Relicks; and indeed, in every individual Office of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> cannot but conclude without descending into the merits of the Cause, That the complex Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is not of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46195:14"/>
Institution, and deserves not, either to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by God, or to be believed by Men; and if he believeth these opinions and practices to be inseparable from Christianity, he may justly reject it, and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally conclude it to be a Cheat, and the Author of it to have been an Egregious Impostor. That these Reasons have really tended to the Prejudice of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and made innumerable Apostates from it, the sad Experience of <hi>Italy,</hi> and other <hi>Romish</hi> Countries beyond the Seas demonstrates, where, if the Relations of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Travellers do not deceive us, few real Christians can be found out of the credulous Multitude, whose Ignorance disableth them from perceiving the Follies, and discovering the Falseness of their Religion.</p>
            <p>It is therefore the peculiar Glory of the Christian Religion, that it was revealed and proposed to the World in the most Learned of all the precedent Ages; That it did not take shelter in the Ignorance of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, nor confine its Mysteries to the more remote and ignorant Part of the World. The Learning and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy of the Heathens was then raised to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Perfection; and the Knowledg of all Arts and Sciences had gained equal extent with the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; so that we may truly affirm the World to have been then more universally Learned, than in any Age, either before or since. At this time especially, God chose to publish his Revelations to the World, and made the more Learned part of it the Stage of his Promulgation; that so in future Ages, Christianity might not be subjected to any just Suspicions of Fraud and Imposture, nor the precedent Reception of it be ascribed to the foolish Credulity of ignorant and illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Proselytes. The Doctrines of it were proposed, and Miracles in testimony of it, wrought in all the

more famous Cities of the Empire, in their publick Schools and Synagogues, in their Theaters and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities, in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Athens,</hi> the great Centers of Learning; and, which deserveth to be observed, more especially in <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Asia Minor,</hi> the most Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed part of that then Learned Empire. This secured the Christian Religion from all possibility of Error and Illusion; since, if either the Doctrines of it had been ridiculous and irrational, or the Miracles fictitious and pretended; the Learned Auditors and Spectators of those times, who were not in the least prepossest in favour of it, would soon have discovered the Cheat, and vehemently decried the Error. This considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion also tendeth no less to the Advantage and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Reformation, that it was advanced and undertaken in a most learned and knowing Age; That all the Authors and Promoters of it, were Persons of extraordinary Knowledg; and that purity of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and success of Learning, as they decreased pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably in all Ages; so they returned into the World at the same time. Whereas Popery oweth all its Triumphs and Success to the Ignorance of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; began with the decrease of Learning, and was well nigh ruined with the Restauration of it. All the peculiar Articles of Popery, were founded in the dark and ignorant Ages of the Church; their most illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and admired Saints, were rude and illiterate Idiots, devoid of all Learning, and oft-times of common Sense; their Miracles are ever acted either in barbarous and credulous Ages, or in remote Corners of the World; (we poor Hereticks, who have the greatest need of them (for their Arguments being so often baffled, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Miracles can now convert us) can never be blessed with the sight of them) and at this day,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46195:15"/>
it flourisheth proportionably to the Knowledg or Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of all Countries. In <hi>France,</hi> the most Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all the Popish Countries, it is forced to put on a new Masque, and by many subtil and nice Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Qualifications and Interpretations, is almost lost and refined into nothing. In <hi>Italy</hi> (if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Reports of modern Travellers) it hath few Proselytes, besides the ignorant and unlearned Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; the more intelligent sort being become either Atheists,<note place="margin">Vid. Histoire de l' Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion de Goa, chez Horte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, <hi>Paris,</hi> 1688 <hi>cum Privilegio.</hi>
               </note> Scepticks or Molinists. In <hi>Spain</hi> alone, and the <hi>Indies,</hi> doth it flourish in its full Vigour; where so gross an Ignorance hath possessed the minds of Papists, that they believe their Inquisitors no less In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible than the Apostles; and imagine that their Images can both hear and see them. So necessary and useful is Learning to Mankind, which may fix Rules to distinguish true from pretended Revelations, discern real from feigned Miracles, and discover the Illusions of Impostors, that the decay of it hath in all Ages and Countries been accompanied with a deluge of Error and Superstition.</p>
            <p>But in nothing is the use and necessity of Learning, and its subservience to the interest and purity of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, more conspicuous and apparent, than in preventing the Dangers and Follies of Enthusiasm; to which, in the present Constitution of mankind, all revealed Religions cannot but be obnoxious. I do not hereby imply the necessity of any extraordinary Learning, or accurate Knowledg of all Sciences, in all Ranks and Orders of Christians; but an ordinary Prudence, and right understanding of the nature and genius of Christianity; which if assisted by the Direction of more learned Guides and Pastors, as God in the first Institution of Christianity intended it should be; will abundantly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46195:15"/>
secure all Persons from the delusions of designing or ignorant Enthusiasts. However, a great part of Mankind will continue to want this Prudence, and neglect this Direction; especially, when the means of Knowledg are studiously kept from them, and no Instruction to be obtained, but from external Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, or the Dictates of a Confessor, as it is in all Popish Countries. Such Persons profess Christianity, not out of any Conviction of the Truth or Divinity of it, but induced by the Prejudices of Education and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Example, understand not the true Principles of their Religion, and instead of a rational Faith, possess only a blind Credulity. This affords a fair opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of success to the Frauds and Artifices of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, who will never want Proselytes in an ignorant and credulous Auditory; and if upheld, and favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the publick Applause of the Church, may draw Multitudes of Admirers after them. The great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines of these Religious Juglers, were ever Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asm, and the pretence of Miracles. The latter have long since ceased, and could never really be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Impostors: It remains therefore, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themselves to Enthusiasm; possess the People with a belief of extraordinary Revelations communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to them, of an inward Familiarity with God, of continual Divine Inspirations, of acting solely by the impulse of the Spirit, and following the infallible Dictates of an inward Light.</p>
            <p>This Opinion must be raised, and continued by bold Pretences, extatick Motions, severe Austerities, and Macerations of the Body, a mortified Look, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Acts of apparent Humility, ridiculous Actions, which may imply a contempt of the World, perpetual canting about Spiritual Matters, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46195:16"/>
them in such a manner, as may seem to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the immediate Revelation of God; and withal, in impenetrable Nonsense. Such Pretences and Actions, will excite the Admiration of foolish Persons, and by amusing their Judgment with speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Shews, create in them an extraordinary Veneration for their Enthusiastick Prophet. All the Whimsies of his disturbed Phantasy shall then pass for Oracles, and his foolish Austerities for so many certain Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a real Sanctity. When this Opinion is once entertained, then the pretence of Miracles may se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely be set on foot, and the grossest Cheat may pass undiscerned among credulous Spectators, who will be deterred by a religious Awe from examining the Truth of the Miracles of their admired Impostor, whose own Word shall without Scruple be received for Miracles pretended to be done by him in Secret; or at least, the single Testimony of one credulous Woman, or fanciful Ideot, shall be esteemed an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Certainty. Whosoever examines the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the <hi>Romish</hi> Saints, will find them all to have been at first believed upon <hi>such</hi> slender Motives, and afterwards amplified and increased by the Writers of their Lives; at least, that this was the case of the Miracles pretended to be done by <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> I doubt not to demonstrate.</p>
            <p>Thus the Folly and Credulity of Mankind, hath opened the way, and facilitated success, even to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing Impostors, who are conscious of the falsity of their own Pretences, and are disquieted with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual fear of Discovery. But, then the way is more open, and success more easy to such Enthusiasts, who imagine they really enjoy and receive from God those Illuminations and Impulses which they vent
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46195:16"/>
to their deluded Followers. Such Persons are inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a false Zeal; and in proposing the Phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of their disturbed Brains, imagine themselves to act in Obedience to Heaven, and for the benefit of Mankind; which renders all their Actions vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and themselves unwearied in the Prosecution of them. That there have been, and are still, many such Enthusiasts in the World, the History of all times, and our own Experience demonstrates beyond all doubt; and that there should be such, we shall cease to wonder if we consider the nature of things. Such Persons are commonly endued with weak Brains, and diseased Bodies; often suffer irregular motions of the Blood, which creates gross and turbulent Spirits, and fills the Brain with strong and active Vapours. These continuing a violent motion in the Brain, will reproduce so strong and lively Images of those things, which have been the most frequent Objects of their Meditations, and made deepest Impression in them, that they will really believe themselves to act those things which they only imagine; and to see, hear, and feel all those Objects, which are so lively represented to them. This is manifest even in Melancholly and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriack Persons, who are so far deluded by the Action of the undigested Vapours of their Bodies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Brain, that they frequently believe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of those things, which their disturbed Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion representeth to them. If the motion of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits be very irregular, and their action upon the Brain exceeding strong, it will produce various ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects upon the Body, according to the different Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of it, or peculiar irregularity of the motion and disorder of the Spirits. Sometimes violent and extraordinary motions of the Body shall be effected;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46195:17"/>
at other times, all the Spirits flowing to the Brain, the Nerves will be emptied, and thereby all the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Actions of Life will be suspended, and both ways an Extasy will be produced. And all this may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen involuntarily without, or even against the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Will. All these Effects will be much more sensible and apparent, when the Enthusiasm is affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and contracted by a long habit of distempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Imagination. This frequently happens in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and melancholy Persons, whose Thoughts are not serene and calm, but accompanied with vehement Passions and turbulent Motions. Such are wont to affix their whole Thoughts to certain Objects, and employ all their Spirits in continuing their Ideas of them; which being gross, and hurried with an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Motion, create a mighty Fermentation in the Blood, whence new Clouds and Vapours are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Brain, and render the Imagination more intense and strong. The Spirits being put into this irregular and rapid Motion, various Effects will follow in the Body, according to the different Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of it, or present Disposition of the Spirits. Either violent and extraordinary Motions of the whole Body will be produced, or all the sensible Actions of Life will be suspended. And all the while the Mind amuseth it self with monstrous and extravagant Ideas of things, which are often rendred pleasing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful by their infinite Variety. When once the Art is obtained, of exciting the Passions, and disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirits of the Body at the Meditation of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Objects, no sooner will the Ideas recur to the Mind, but the same Motions will return into the Body, and all the aforementioned Effects will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be produced. Thus a habit of Enthusiasm at
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46195:17"/>
last is formed; and extasies may be produced as often as the convenience or whimsies of the Enthusiast shall require it. In this state the Soul is detained with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable Notions, and monstrous Ideas of things, which enables even the most ignorant Persons to talk boldly and fluently of those things, whose imagination then disturbs the mind, which are commonly Divine Matters, but withal in an incoherent and unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible manner. However, the Enthusiast himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves all this to proceed from a Divine influence, and mistakes the phrensies of his Brain for the dictates of the Holy Ghost; and the credulous Multitude, which ever refers those things to a Divine original, whose causes it cannot comprehend, proclaimeth his Dreams to be Inspirations, ascribeth the extatick mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Body to the operation of the Spirit acting in him, and admireth his high-flown Nonsense as Divine Sublimity.</p>
            <p>These Enthusiasts, as they are commonly Persons of weak understandings, and narrow capacities, are easily led away with false appearances of Religion, and grosly mistake the nature and genius of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity. They imagine Religion to consist in a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and severe exercise of those external actions, which in the Countrey they live in, are generally esteemed the indications of Piety and Christian Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and fancy, that the farther they carry these practices, the more nearly they approach to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most degree of perfection. Thus in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the profession of Evangelical poverty, a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly habit, a severe mortification of the Body, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual telling over of Beads, going in pilgrimage, and other childish actions, are at least by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people esteemed the best characters of a refined
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46195:18"/>
and exalted Vertue. Hence Enthusiasts of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, corrupted with these prejudices, while they aim at an extraordinary perfection and purity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to themselves long pilgrimages, terrible auste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, continual prayer, and a thousand other ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous actions, which their deluded fancy suggests to be meritorious. They employ their thoughts in the perpetual meditation of these imaginary perfections; and in their extasies and raptures are amused with them, and form pleasing Ideas of them, arising from the apprehension of any exceeding merit or venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be obtained by the practice of them. In this religious phrensy they imagine to have received the Divine approbation of them, mistaking a foolish sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of a deluded judgment for the suffrage and voice of the Holy Spirit acting in them: and at last proceed so far, as to fancy the reception of a Divine Command for the commission of these extravagancies. No wonder then, if after such a false perswasion they proceed to act all the whimsies and follies which a disturbed brain and violent imagination can suggest; if they put off all sense of shame and modesty, and setting no bounds to their extravagance, deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up to the conduct and direction of an irrational fancy, which inciteth them to commit such follies and trifles, as are beneath the dignity of a rational Being, and contrary to the dictates of common sense; such ridiculous fopperies and elaborate extravagance, as may justly provoke the laughter of sober Heathens, and indignation of wiser Christians.</p>
            <p>Such ridiculous Fanaticism is the utmost degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of Christian Religion, than which nothing can be more contrary to its Genius, and destructive of its Principles. Christianity was intended to exalt and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46195:18"/>
perfect the Reason of mankind, to create true notions of the nature of all moral and religious Actions, and introduce the practice of a manly and rational Piety. Whereas this Enthusiasm debaseth the Reason and Understanding of mankind, introduceth false Ideas of Religion and Piety, and exposeth both to the scorn and derision of the more judicious and intelligent World: as if none but Fools and Ideots could be perfect Christians; and the highest degree of madness were the most certain mark of piety. Such absurd Opinions cannot but scandalize all considering Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; and cause them to conclude, that either these absurdities are gross corruptions and deviations from Christianity, or else Christianity it self is a grand Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture, unworthy the belief and veneration, or even attention of mankind. The former is not easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible by those who have no other notions of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, than what they receive from the general practice and currant opinions of their Countrey; and are from their infancy prepossest, that there is no true Christian Society besides their own; where if such Fanaticism be publickly practised or countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, it cannot but create in them a detestation of all Christianity. But as for those who are convinced of the truth of Christianity in general, and enquire after the true Doctrines of it among so many divided Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions of the Christian World, they may rationally and infallibly conclude that particular Church which favours or promotes this Superstitious Enthusiasm, to be infinitely corrupted and degenerate from the true Spirit and Principles of Christianity.</p>
            <p>If we view the several Churches and Communions of the Christian World, we shall find no Society of Christians more free from Fanaticism than the Church
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46195:19"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> or more guilty of it than the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> It hath been the peculiar happiness of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to create a right sense of Religion and Piety in all her Communicants, and secure to them the practice of a rational Devotion. She makes no pretensions to private Inspirations, and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Illuminations of the Holy Ghost; and all her Children are more apt to deride, than admire the follies and extasies of Enthusiasts. If any of her Members have at any time through ambition or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance embraced Fanaticism, they have at the same time departed from the Communion of the Church, and becoming Schismaticks, proclaimed themselves her Enemies. Yet so far hath the sober and judicious practice and example of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced even their conduct, that the most extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant among them have been less Fanatical than the most admired Saints of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and whensoever the sense of their Duty, and Providence of God shall induce them to return to the bosome of the Church, which we heartily wish, they can do it no otherwise than by deserting even all Reliques of Fanaticism. Not so the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which in all her Offices and publick Ceremonies promotes and foments it, hath on many occasions given pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick applause and approbation to it, and oweth the greatest part of her peculiar Doctrines, and present prosperity to the Enthusiasm of her Followers. If we consult the publick Offices of that Church, we shall find nothing intelligible directly proposed to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People, but the Prayers performed in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Tongue, and their Senses in the mean while amused with antick Gestures, Images, Processions, and pompous Representations. The first enforceth
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46195:19"/>
the minds of ignorant Persons to betake themselves to the entertainment of their own thoughts, and direct their Devotion according to their own crude and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digested Ideas; and then the latter inspires them with childish and absurd notions of Religion, and Divine Matters, and both together cause them to form wild and Enthusiastick Apprehensions of Religious Actions, and direct their Conduct according to those Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions. If we examine the peculiar Doctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we shall find many of them to derive their original from Enthusiastick Visions and Revelations. I will instance only in Purgatory and Transubstantiation; whereof the former, however at this day defended, was at first set a foot upon the sole Authority of these Fanatick Visions; which imaginary Visions of this kind were so frequent among the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiastick Monks of the sixth, seventh, eighth, and tenth Ages, that large Volumes might be compiled of them: as indeed I have seen several voluminous Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections of them in Manuscript, composed before the Reformation, in proof of Purgatory. As for Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, as it was first forged in the Cell of a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionary Monk; so it chiefly gained credit and belief in the World from the pretended Visions of supposed Saints; for whose sake God divested the Sacramental Elements of their usual Accidents, and offered them to their sight under the very Species of an Humane Body. Scarce a Monkish Saint of any eminence after the ninth Age can be found, in whose life such a Vision is not related. Lastly, if we view the Religious Orders of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> where Religion and Piety is supposed to flourish in its utmost perfection, and which are esteemed the grand Patterns of refined Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; we shall find them to be so many Societies of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46195:20"/>
Enthusiasts, who, if we except vicious and irreligious Persons among them, wholly busie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in wild Imaginations, and ridiculous Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. If any religious Persons among them escape this contagion, and surmount this imperfection, it is owing to the excellency of their Genius, and advantage of their Learning, not the Rules of their Order, which naturally lead them to it.</p>
            <p>But in nothing is the Enthusiasm of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> more apparent, than in her approbation and veneration of Enthusiastick Saints. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in her Calendars, Offices, Legends, and Bulls of Canonization hath placed such a rabble of Saints in Heaven, that if a <hi>Lucian</hi> or <hi>Iulian</hi> should arise anew to write Satyrs againts the Inhabitants of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and criticise upon the vulgar conceptions of them, I fear they would find greater matter of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter among the Christian Saints, than the Heathen Gods. Of these Saints no small part had never any existence; and many no such existence as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ascribed to them; I mean, acted no such things as their Legendary Lives relate. Of those which remain, many were vicious and wicked Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Traytors to their Prince and Countrey, or furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Persecutors of the supposed Hereticks of latter Ages; whom nothing but a blind zeal for the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> caused to be canonized. As for the Saints of latter Ages, who were canonized by solemn Bulls and Ceremonies (For the Ancient Saints never enjoyed that honour) they were generally cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen out of the Monastick Orders; and were either downright Enthusiasts, or chiefly admired for those Actions which included somewhat of Enthusiasm. In these Canonizations it is enquired, not whether the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46195:20"/>
Candidate of that sacred Character exercised all the offices of Piety, Temperance and Charity in the highest perfection; not whether he procured some il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious benefit to the Church, or was ever ready to suffer Martyrdom for the Profession of Christianity; but whether he ran about the World barefoot, and professing Evangelical Poverty, begged his bread from door to door; whether he wore an iron Chain, an hair Shirt, or a knotted Cord, and affected to appear ridiculous in all his Actions; whether he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated his Body with prodigious Austerities, and went in Pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Shrines; whether he enjoyed extraordinary Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminations of the Holy Ghost, acted by the sole im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse of the Spirit, and had frequent extasies and rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of mind: lastly, whether any of his credulous Followers would adventure to testify any Miracles done by him, either seen by themselves in secret, or received from others by Tradition. What a misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble corruption of Christianity must this needs be, to give such solemn and publick approbation to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagances of Fanaticks, to applaud their Follies, admire their Phrensies, and propose them as the great Objects of imitation, not to say of worship, to the People; to solemnize Festivals in their memory, and invoke them in the publick Liturgies; and give thanks to God for the great and glorious Examples of those, who were fitter for <hi>Bedlam,</hi> than the Blessed Society of Apostles, Prophets and Martyrs! Such fond Credulity and irrational Conduct might be somewhat excusable in the common People, whose ignorance and inexperience might plead their pardon. But when the representative Church of <hi>Rome</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit such Follies, and deliberately form such Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zations,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46195:21"/>
which are afterwards approved and received by the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, we cannot but conclude that Church to have grosly perverted the Design of Christianity, and widely deviated from the primitive Purity of that most Rational as well as Holy Religion.</p>
            <p>That the Charge of Enthusiasm upon the Saints of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is most just and deserved, will appear from a particular view of their Lives and Actions: and that not only of those who lived in the more barbarous and ignorant Ages of the Church, but of those who flourished in these last more learned and refined Ages, after so many Reformations of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Discipline, and so great improvements of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. For in those Countries where Popery is freely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, and without fear of Heretical Observers, Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism retains as great applause as ever; and by a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Contagion, whether of pernicious Examples, or prevailing Ignorance, the latest Saints are the greatest Enthusiasts. This might be abundantly demonstrated from the Lives and Actions of St. <hi>Philip Neri,</hi> of St. <hi>Teresa,</hi> St. <hi>Mary Magdalen Pazzi,</hi> and St. <hi>Rosa</hi>; but I chuse rather to prove it from the Conduct of St. <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> as well because he is one of the most eminent and illustrious Saints in the <hi>Roman</hi> Calendar, as because he was Founder of the most celebrated and learned Order of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> If after a strict examination he shall appear to have been a most extravagant Enthusiast, we cannot hope to discover a more rational Devotion in the obscure and more inconsiderable Saints of that Church.</p>
            <p>In forming this Enquiry, I shall begin with the Qualities necessarily required to constitute and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat an affected Enthusiast; among which an ardent
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46195:21"/>
desire of Glory, and immoderate Ambition, obtains the first place. For none would prostitute the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his Nature to the Follies and Impertinencies of Enthusiasm; deny to himself the common benefits of Life, and undergo Poverty, Nakedness, Hunger, and a thousand other Inconveniencies incident to that Profession, if he were not transported with a violent Ambition, and sustained with the pleasing hopes of obtaining thereby unusual Glory, and extraordinary Admiration. <hi>Ignatius</hi> was in a most particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner indued with this Heroick Quality, and that both natural and acquired. That he was by nature am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, all the Writers of his Life assures us. Thus <hi>Bouhours</hi> 
               <note n="‚∏´" place="margin">De la vie de St. Ignac. lib. 1. Vid. Orlandin. Hist. Soc. Jesu l. 1. num. 9. &amp;c.</note> tells us, That above all, he had an ardent Passion for Glory; that he was naturally Haughty, and his Fancy wholly filled with Gallantry and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and in all his Actions, he only followed the false Maxims of the World. This, as the same Father relates, naturally incited him to the love of Poetry, and made him keep a kind of Decency even in his Irregularities. They pretend indeed, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> was possest with this ambitious Temper, only before his Conversion, when it was abolished by a particular gift of God; but besides, that even that is sufficient for our purpose; if we may judg from his subsequent Actions, we have no great Reason to believe them, as shall be shown hereafter.</p>
            <p>This natural Ambition of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> was fomented and increased by his extraordinary Addiction to read Romances, and the Lives of Saints. The same Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> relates of him, That he was a diligent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Romances; and in particular, a great Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of <hi>Amadis de Gaul,</hi> and such Books of Knight Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, and wonderfully tickled with Adventures and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46195:22"/>
Feats of Arms related in them. This filled his Head with false Ideas of Glory, and heated his Brains with vehement desires of Imitation. Thus <hi>Don Quixot</hi> began his Knight-Errantry with the reading of such Romances, which even made him run Mad with am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and desire of Glory: And as it happens most unluckily, <hi>Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Don Quixot</hi> were both inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with reading the same Book, the Adventures of <hi>Amadis de Gaul,</hi> whom the <hi>Don</hi> always proposed to himself, as the grand Pattern of all his Exploits; and <hi>Ignatius</hi> imitated as far as the difference of Saint-Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantry would give him leave. But it was the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Legends of Saints, which finally compleated the Disease, and rendred it incurable. This excited in him a passionate desire of obtaining an equal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in the Church, and Degree in Heaven with them; and after envying their Glory, perswaded him to imitate their Follies. It was necessary, as well as natural, for such an ignorant Bigot, who designed to acquire to himself esteem, by the repute of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Sanctity, and yet understood little of the true Principles of Christianity, to take his Pattern from the Lives of Saints, and direct his conduct by the Imitation of their most celebrated Actions, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ordinary Legends of the Church; which affixing most ridiculous Follies to the venerable Names of Apostles, Martyrs and Confessors, and not undeservedly relating them of the latter Saints, who are commonly held in the greatest Esteem, betrayed his weak Judgment to the Imitation and Practice of the same Extravagances. All the Writers of his Life, ascribe his Conversion to his accidental reading of the Lives of Saints; and <hi>Maffeius</hi> 
               <note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">De vita Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. l. 1. c. 2.</note> particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of him, That in reading these Legends, he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46195:22"/>
would often stop, and in a transport, whether of Zeal or Ambition, cry out, <hi>What if I should imitate this Illustrious Exploit of St.</hi> Dominick? <hi>What if I should undertake this celebrated Action of St.</hi> Francis? This procured to them little less than Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and may make me be accounted somewhat more than Human.</p>
            <p>Somewhat extraordinary, therefore, he was resolved to do, which might immortalise his Name, and give occasion for new Legends; but how to direct his Ambition, he was yet uncertain; being desirous of the Honour of a Saint, yet loth to forfeit the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of a Knight-Errant. He was ravished indeed with the reading the Life of Christ, and Legends of the Saints; <note n="*" place="margin">Bouhours, l. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Was set on fire with the wonderful things he read; and being astonished at the Austerities of the Anchorets, resolved to imitate them, to visit the Holy Sepulchre, and shut up himself in an Hermitage. But these good Motions lasted but for a while, and he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relapsed into his former Weakness.</hi> He wisely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, That the Imitation of these <hi>Anchorets</hi> might procure him the Admiration of ignorant <hi>Devoto</hi>'s; but Feats of Arms alone, could secure to him the Favour and Applause of more Polite Ladies. For it must not be dissembled, That our Saint <note n="‚Äñ" place="margin">Id. ibid.</note>, <hi>besides his innate Passion for Glory, had a secret Inclination for a Lady of Quality; and now his Head was full of Military Exploits, to make himself worthy of that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies favour. Then he fell again to read, and anew to imagine somewhat more wonderful in the Actions of Saints, than in all the Exploits of those Romantick He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes, which had formerly filled his Imagination. This rekindled in him a desire of Solitude; but still, when he was upon the point of taking a good Resolution, the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46195:23"/>
World with all its Charms so powerfully assaulted him, that he fell back, and lingred after Military Honour.</hi> Many days were spent in this Fluctuation of Mind, till at last he resolved to become Saint-Errant. And not imprudently. For as <hi>Sancha Pancha</hi> unanswera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly disputed to his Master <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> since the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of Glory was his only aim, Saint-Erranty was a much easier, and more certain way than Knight-Errantry. For from the first, nothing but Blows and Wounds were to be expected, and perhaps a sudden Death in the first Encounter, which might blast all the hopes of Honour; whereas a Saint-Errant might sleep securely, unless disturbed with the Phrensies of his own Brain; be lodged in Palaces, and attended with crouds of admiring Followers; might survive the Fruits of his Labour, and after his Death be inrolled among the Favourites of Heaven; might be honoured with an Anniversary Solemnity, have his Bones en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased in Gold, and his Tomb frequented with crouds of devout Clients; might have Churches and Images erected to his Memory and Worship; and if the Writers of his Life be endued with fruitful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, have innumerable Miracles ascribed to him. Besides, <hi>Ignatius</hi> wisely remembred that his Lameness, and the visible deformity of his Leg, remaining after his Wound received in the Siege of <hi>Pompelona,</hi> would eternally hinder him from appearing a compleat Courtier, or attracting the Favour and Affections of Ladies, without which a Knight-Errant cannot sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist. He had used indeed all imaginary Remedies to cure this Deformity,<note place="margin">Bouhours l. 1.</note> as <hi>passionately affecting to appear every way compleat, without the least Blemish.</hi> But Heaven had designed him for a more noble Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:46195:23"/>The Order of Knighthood being thus resolved on, it remained to chuse some illustrious Saint, whose Actions he might imitate, and propose as a Rule to his Conduct. <hi>Don Quixot</hi> sat not longer in Councel to chuse a Pattern for his Military Atchievements, than <hi>Ignatius</hi> did to find out a fit Exemplar for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Bigottry.<note place="margin">Maffeius, l. 1. c. 2.</note> At last, most luckily he pitcht upon St. <hi>Francis,</hi> than whom latter Ages have not produced a greater, or more extravagant Enthusiast, if we except his Ape <hi>Ignatius.</hi> How well he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his undertaking, and how nearly followed the footsteps of this great Master, we shall often by comparing their Actions, have occasion to shew. However <hi>Ignatius,</hi> to manifest that he was no Dastard, sometimes ventured a little higher, and had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable flights in imitation of Christ himself, <hi>having a very ardent desire to be as much as possible, the lively Image of Iesus Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vie de St. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace. l. 2. c. 5.</note> as <hi>Bussieres</hi> expresseth it. Thus after he had perswaded his first six Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to submit themselves to his Direction; he calls them together, and opens to them his design of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating Christ in the most perfect manner;<note place="margin">Bouhours, l. 2.</note> tells them, that Christ went about saving Souls, and thence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded them to go into <hi>Palestine</hi> upon the same em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. St. <hi>Francis</hi> was not altogether so hasty;<note place="margin">Bonaventura de vita. Fran. cap. 3.</note> he staid till he got twelve Disciples about him, that so himself might resemble Christ, and they the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; altho none can easily discover any resemblance between them, save only in this, that they were illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Ignatius</hi> was not so wholly taken up in the Imitation of Saints, but that he still kept an eye to the Laws of Chivalry, and as much as possible, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected his Actions by those Ideas which the reading
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46195:24"/>
of Romances had created in him. And in this he degenerated not from the Example of his Master St. <hi>Francis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Id. cap. 1.</note> who in the beginning of his Conversion, was inclined to exert his vigorous Ambition in Feats of Arms. These Military Ideas so far possessed <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>'s Imagination, that he could not forget them, in forming the draught of his Order, and writing his Book of Exercises. The first design of his Order, was revealed to him by God in his Meditation of the two Standards,<note place="margin">Bouhours, l. 3.</note> in which were shewed to him the first Lineaments, and general Scheme of his Order, by Military Representations. Afterwards intreating the Pope that no Preferments might be conferred on any of his Order, he represented to him, that the other Orders were like so many Squadrons of Cuirassiers to stand fast in their Post;<note place="margin">Id. l. 4.</note> but his Order like Light-Horsemen, to be always in a moving Condition. In like manner, his Book of Meditations is formed in a Military way, where he represents to us, our Saviour as a King, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting his Subjects to accompany him in a Military Expedition, for the Conquest of the whole Earth, and assures them of their share in the Booty and Glory of the Conquest in Proportion to their Fatigues in War. He describes Christ coming to Preach his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to the World, with the Devil standing in the Front before him, and both under the resemblance of Generals, who raise Troops, spread their Ensigns, take the Field, and exhort their Men to follow them. It seems, the Propagation of the Gospel by force of Arms, is connatural to the Order of Jesuits; only the Wisdom of latter Years hath changed these Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, into carnal Weapons. But to come a litle nearer; one of the most necessary Ingredients of Knight-Errantry, is a Lady, who by the auspicious Charms
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46195:24"/>
of her Beauty may protect the Knight, and receive the Trophies of all his Victories. The choice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso,</hi> cost <hi>Don Quixot</hi> no less than the serious Consultation of eight Days; and the choice of the Blessed Virgin cost <hi>Ignatius</hi> a tedious Preparation at his first setting out; when at last, he prostrated himself one night before her Image,<note place="margin">Bouhours, l. 1.</note> and consecrated himself to the Service of the Son and the Mother; vowed inviolable Fidelity to her; made her his Protectress, and ever after esteemed himself to be obliged to her by the Laws of Knighthood. Another necessary Qualification of Knight-Errantry, is to be solemnly dubbed Knight, and watch a whole Night in Armour, before the undertaking of that Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therefore <hi>Don Quixot</hi> at his first setting out, had a terrible scruple of Conscience, because he was not yet dubbed Knight; whereupon he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caused himself to be dubbed by the Inn-keeper, and kept his Vigils in his imaginary Chappel. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> was not forgetful of this Ceremony, and therefore in Imitation of it, he watched a whole Night in his Pilgrims Weeds, the Armour of Saints, before the Altar of our Lady at <hi>Montferrat,</hi> praying and devoting himself to Jesus and <hi>Mary,</hi> according to those warlike Ideas, which were still in him, as <hi>Bouhours</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> expresseth it. Departing, he hung up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Altar his Sword and Poniard. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a Knight-Errant performs his Vigils, his Arms are forfeited to the use of the Chappel, and must be redeemed if he will have them. But to proceed, <hi>Don Quixot</hi> carried no Money about him, because no Knight-Errant ever did; ordered <hi>Sancha Pancha</hi> to provide no Necessaries aforehand, saying Knights-Errant ought to rely on Gods Providence; and ever
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46195:25"/>
pleaded that by the Priviledg of his Order, he was exempted from paying any Reckonings, or any other Debt whatsoever. So <hi>Ignatius</hi> thought it a Crime to carry Money with him; relied so far upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, that he would accept of no Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions for a Journey, altho offered to him; and in his Journey to the Holy Land by Sea, pleaded al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, that as a Saint he ought to be excused from paying any Fraight, and would never pay it, tho Money were given to him for that purpose. <hi>Don Quixot</hi> believed every one bound to confess, believe, and maintain whatsoever he avouched, whether they had seen it or no. So <hi>Ignatius</hi> established it for the primary Rule of his Order, that every one should obey the General, that is, himself while alive, with the same implicite Faith as they would God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Lastly, to omit many other Instances of this nature, As the Inn-keeper excused <hi>Don Quixot</hi> when he had done many outragious Injuries, as a Fool and distracted Coxcomb; so the <hi>Spanish</hi> Captain excus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the same account the Extravagant Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> when he was brought before him.</p>
            <p>But the most remarkable Instance remains behind. <hi>Don Quixot</hi> in Obedience to the Laws of Knight-Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantry, in all his Exploits left it to the Discretion of his Horse whether he would go, believing the essence and being of all his Adventures to consist in that. In like manner, <hi>Ignatius</hi> ever submitted himself blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Dictates of his Confessor; and when he was wanting, to the Direction of his Horse; as may appear from this Story.<note place="margin">Maffeius, l. 1. c. 3. Bouhours l. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Ignatius</hi> presently after his Conversion, made a Pilgrimage to <hi>Montser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</hi> By the way, he fell in Company with a <hi>Moor,</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:46195:25"/>
and disputed with him about the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin. The <hi>Moor</hi> stifly opposed it, and as it should seem, was too hard for <hi>Ignatius</hi> upon the point, as well he might, arguing against an ignorant Disputant, and being on the righter Side. At this <hi>Ignatius,</hi> transported with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and zeal, was in doubt with himself, whether his Faith and Allegiance due to the Blessed Virgin ever since his solemn dedication of himself to her, did not oblige him to revenge her honour by the death of the <hi>Mahometan.</hi> Not being able to resolve the Doubt, and fearing to be wanting in his Duty, he resolved to follow the <hi>Moor,</hi> and do what God should inspire him. Thus riding on, he came where the Road parted. One way led to <hi>Montserrat,</hi> the other the <hi>Moor</hi> took. No Divine Inspiration yet appearing, and the Case admitting no longer delay, he abandoned all farther expectation of Divine Impulse, and committed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the direction of his Horse, although all will not allow him to have rid upon so learned a Beast; <hi>Maffeius</hi> saith,<note place="margin">L. 1. c. 3.</note> It was a plain Ass, or at least a Mule. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> therefore, coming to the Division of the Road, stopt his Horse, and loosned the Reins, resolving if the Beast took the same way which the <hi>Moor</hi> had done, to set upon him, and kill him; if the other, to let him pass unrevenged. The Beast by good luck took the way leading to <hi>Montserrat</hi>; whereupon <hi>Ignatius</hi> most rationally concluded, that God did not require at his hands that he should revenge the Blasphemies of the <hi>Moor.</hi> This the Writers of his Life call a Miracle, tho an honest Heretick would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther call it Chance. Now the <hi>Romish</hi> Saints may well be impeccable, if God must work Miracles to perserve them from sin; tho a sober Casuist would not
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46195:26"/>
fear to conclude, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> by making such an irrational Resolution, was really guilty of Murther. It is well his Countryman St. <hi>Dominick</hi> did not live in his time. For he denying the Immaculate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Blessed Virgn, if <hi>Ignatius</hi> had met him in this mood, and his Ass had not been wiser than himself, the two Saints must have fought a Duel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Immaculate Conception; and then surely by the common Privilege of Saints each would have fought for Truth.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his Conversion was acted with these ambitious Principles, and reformed his Life not out of any sense of Piety, but meerly through an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate desire of Vain-glory, is so undeniable, that even the Writers of his Life cannot dissemble it. This appears from the account given by them of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions excited in his Imagination by reading Romances and the Lives of Saints at his first Conversion, which was before mentioned; and may be farther demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated from what <hi>Bouhours</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">L. 1.</note> adds, that in exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing all his Religious Austerities, he had at first no other aim than to imitate those holy Penitents, whose Lives he had read, and to expiate his Sins. This last clause was annexed only to save the Credit of the Saint. For in his Life, <note n="(b)" place="margin">Cap. 2. <hi>Rome,</hi> 1629. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </note> published by order of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Vitelleschi,</hi> General of the Jesuits, it is freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> his <hi>first Resolutions were to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise great Austerities, and perform extraordinary Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, not so much to expiate his Sins, which then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented themselves to his view, as because he imagined that in these rigours the utmost perfection of Christianity consisted, having no higher Idea of it, and desiring with passion to acquire that perfection,</hi> as the only means of obtaining the repute of Sanctity. And indeed if we
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46195:26"/>
examine his first Adventure after his Conversion, we hear of no extraordinary acts of real Piety and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but only Pilgrimages, Sackcloth, Fasting, Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and Begging, the effects of an Ambitious Desire to imitate the Actions of the most Renowned Saints, which then wholly possest his Imagination;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Maffeius,</hi> l. 1. c. 3.</note> and with the thoughts of which he continually amused himself, so far as to employ his whole time in painting the famous Actions of Christ and his Saints upon a Book, and then admiring the glory of them. However, this was somewhat better employment, than that wherewith St. <hi>Francis</hi> at first busied himself, to make Crucifixes in Mortar with his own hands; although both equally proceeded from Childish Notions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Devotion.</p>
            <p>If then Ambition had so great a part in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of <hi>Ignatius:</hi> if an excessive desire of Glory, and foolish emulation of the Honour of other Saints, chiefly induced <hi>Ignatius</hi> to embrace a Religious Life: with what pretence or shew of truth can the Writers of his Life ascribe his Conversion to the Providence of God, and operation of the Holy Ghost? A Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion which themselves cannot deny to have been the effect of Ambition, and other unruly Passions; and in which, without any breach of Charity, the Devil had far more influence than God. Divine Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions never proceed from such unlawful Principles; and correct the Errors of the Judgment, as well as purge the Corruptions of the Will; whereas <hi>Ignatius,</hi> after his Conversion, continued in the same Ignorance of all Divine Matters and true Piety, and retained his former Ambitious Inclination, which alone may create a reasonable suspicion of insincerity in the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:46195:27"/>It cannot be pretended that <hi>Ignatius</hi> was at first induced by motives of Ambition and Vain-glory to undertake the Severities of a Religious Life, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards proceeded wholly upon Principles of disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed Piety. The Writers indeed of his Life assure us, that immediately after his Conversion, all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of Ambition were by an immediate operation of the Holy Ghost extinguished in him; but the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent conduct of his Life demonstrate the contrary. The ambition of founding a new Order in the Church, had strongly possest his Imagination, and was the grand motive of all his Austerities. To this all his Actions were directed; and by this he was encouraged to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take and conquer the greatest Difficulties. <hi>Orlandinus</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">Hist. Soc. Jesu, l. 1.</note> plainly confesseth, no man would have taken so much pains as he did, unless he had carried such a Design in his head; and <hi>Bouhours,</hi>

The Ambition of instituting a peculiar Sect was ever the chief Motive of all Heresiarchs and Impostors; who thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more glorious than to acquire an arbitrary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over the Understandings of their deluded Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. This incited <hi>Apollonius Tyaneus,</hi> St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and <hi>Ignatius</hi> to gather to themselves Disciples as soon as they had obtained a popular repute of sanctity; and that the World might take notice of their great suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, they all agreed to lead their Disciples as it were in triumph into the Capital City of the World:<note place="margin">Philostratus de vit.

his Threats. No wonder the supposed Merits of the Design, and sanctity of the Profession which <hi>Ignatius</hi> had undertaken, should raise his Pretensions; since he might rationally promise to himself an extraordinary veneration on Earth, and a more exalted Throne in Heaven. <hi>Don Quixot</hi> fancied that all Knight-Errants went to Heaven, or at least to Purgatory; and surely Saint-Errants deserved to be placed in an higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree than they.<note place="margin">Id. l. 3. c. 15.</note> The <hi>Indian</hi> Philosophers had assured <hi>Apollonius,</hi> that both dead and living he should be esteemed a God.<note place="margin">

            <p>I might instance in several other Actions and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, which clearly manifest an immoderate desire of Vain glory.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46195:28"/>
Sacred Matters is to envy to all others the acquisition of Reputation by the same method.

                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 2.</note> In like manner, <hi>Ignatius</hi> represented to two Ladies of <hi>Alcala</hi> his Disciples, who had resolved to go in pilgrimage to our Lady of <hi>Gvadalupe,</hi> profess Evangelical Poverty, and serve the Sick in Hospitals, the folly of their Design; and asserted, that without an evident Inspiration of the Holy Ghost, they must not take such extraordinary courses to advance in Perfection; that Sanctity did not consist in Pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or Evangelical Poverty; and earnestly dissuaded them from their Intentions. Now if <hi>Ignatius</hi> did truly practice and pursue Evangelical Perfection, he ought not to have diverted these Ladies from their Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who had proposed to themselves the practice of those very Actions which they had before admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in <hi>Ignatius.</hi> He might perhaps plead for himself Inspiration of the Holy Ghost: but besides that such a Plea is downright Enthusiasm, it might have been with equal reason pretended by the Ladies;<note place="margin">Id. l. 6.</note> since all such Inspirations are purely interrnal, and known only to the Person who receives them. Thus also he expressed great dislike of long Prayers in others, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho himself frequently bestowed whole days in Prayer; and at his first conversion did nothing else but pray. The affectation of the name of Saint is a no less evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent mark of a violent Ambition; and therefore we
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46195:29"/>
may reasonably conclude <hi>Apollonius</hi> to have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely guilty of this Vice,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Philostr.</hi> l. 8. c. 2.</note> in that while alive he not unwillingly received the title of God from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People. The Notions which the Heathens had of their Inferior Deities was the same which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists usually entertain of their Saints. This Title <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> upon all occasions ambitiously courted; and by cunning Artifices endeavoured to procure.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 1.</note> Thus at <hi>Manreze</hi> having with many incredible Austerities and severe Mortifications once acquired among the credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Multitude the Title of a Saint, as if he had got his Aim, he immediately gives over all solitude, changed his deformed Penitential Dress into a more decent Habit, and moderates his Austerities. At <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celona</hi> meeting a company of Beggars,<note place="margin">Id. l. 2.</note> he distributed all his Money to them, and then immediately in their sight began himself to beg: whereupon they cryed out,<note place="margin">Gloria S. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natii, Rotho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magi,</hi> 1630. cap. 8.</note> A Saint, a Saint. His Confessor <hi>Eguia</hi> was wont to give it out, that he was more than a Saint; and he to return the Complement, and secure the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of it, gave <hi>Eguia</hi> a great character of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Piety.<note place="margin">Id. c. 14. <hi>Ribadeneira</hi> in vit. ejus.</note> He betrayed no less Vain glory, when in an affected extravagance of humility he prayed to God, and wished publickly on all occasions, that his Body, when dead, might be exposed in the open Fields to be devoured by Beasts and Fowls, or at least might be buried in a Dunghill. Such Wishes were frequent in the Mouths of <hi>Cynicks,</hi> who were ever esteemed the most ambitious of all Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.</p>
            <p>If any thing be still wanting in <hi>Ignatius</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the Character of Ambitious, it must be arrogant Boasts, and high Pretences of his his own Sanctity; which indeed is the utmost degree of Vain-glory, than
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:46195:29"/>
which nothing is more intolerable or inexcusable. <hi>Ignatius</hi> was never wanting to his own praise, always endeavouring to excite and continue great Ideas of his own Merits in the minds of men: following herein the common Artifice of all Impostors, who supply their own want of merit by an arrogant ostentation of it.<note place="margin">

Saint <hi>Francis</hi> boasted that he was daily fed with the Bread of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; and published every-where, that after his death he should be worshipped as a Saint through all the World. As for <hi>Ignatius,</hi> he conceived so great an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his own merit, that presently after his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, before he had performed yet any thing extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, being seized with a violent Fever, and lying in a desperate condition, he fancied to hear an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Voice repeating to him, that he need not be troubled to die,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 1.</note> because he died a Saint; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arrived at so great a degree of Perfection, he needed not fear either the Temptation of the Devil, or the Judgment of God. On the one side he saw repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to him his Meritorious Austerities; on the other side Heaven open, where the Angels, with Palms and Crowns in their hands, invited him to enter in. That he might create in others the same apprehension which he had formed to himself, he sometimes talked publickly of his Raptures and Extasies,<note place="margin">Id. l. 6.</note> and spread abroad a Report that he had an Archangel for his Angel Guardian. This perhaps might be somewhat pardonable in a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but what follows is intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. <hi>Polancus</hi> asked him one day, as he was boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:46195:30"/>
of his wonderful Gifts,<note place="margin">Gloria S. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natii,</hi> cap. 7.</note> Whether he did not fear to be guilty of Vain-glory? <hi>Ignatius</hi> answered in these words: <hi>Polancus,</hi> I do assure you that I do not relate the thousandth part of the Divine Gifts conferred on me, by reason of the incapacity of those who hear me, to conceive them: and added, that he would not change Merits or Divine Gifts with any one of all the Saints, if they had not greater than what are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly related of them in their Lives. It might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be imagined that a more exquisite Flattery could not be invented; yet thanks to a Politick Brain, the Reputation of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Merits must be rais'd yet higher. <hi>Eguia,</hi> his Confessor, often wished that he might outlive the Saint,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 6.</note> at least, some few hours, that he might reveal without Scruple, what he knew of the Sanctity of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and he pretended that he had things to tell, which could not be heard without astonishment. The cunning Saint fearing that if the Matter came to a Trial, it might end in Smoke, or at least, not answer Expectation, prayed earnestly against his Wish; and by good fortune the Confessor died before him. Alas, What a loss did the imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Death of <hi>Eguia</hi> bring to <hi>Christendom?</hi> Such a loss no doubt the World had before suffered in the case of <hi>Don Quixot</hi>; a great part of whose most noble Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures were not mentioned in the Records of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ambition is the chief and fundamental Quality of an affected Enthusiast; that <hi>Ignatius</hi> was eminently endued with it, we have now proved. Other acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daneous Qualities are required to constitute a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Fanatick, which were not wanting in our Saint; I shall instance only in two, weakness of Body, and want of Judgment. The first is commonly antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:46195:30"/>
to, and in some measure the cause of Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asm, but must necessarily be contracted by those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Fermentations and Commotions of the Blood, which attend the Extasies of Enthusiasts; which may for a time confer an unusual Vigour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Body; but when the Heat is expired, and the Tempest calmed, leave it languid and dejected. The Production and Conservation of a strong and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Imagination, by gross and impure Spirits, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth a vehement Indisposition of the Body, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Corruption of Blood, which also that very Imagination promotes and augments. And this alone might unanswerably detect all the Illusions and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures of Enthusiasts, who pretend to intellectual Visions and divine Raptures. For if those Visions were indeed purely intellectual, no extraordinary motion of the Body would attend them; whereas the violent Ebullition of the Spirits, which accompany these pretended Visions of Enthusiasts, demonstrate them to be wholly owing to their Imaginations and disturbed Brains. Thus <note n="*" place="margin">Vite ejus per Jac. Baccium Romae 1645.</note> St. <hi>Phillip Neri being often overflowed with celestial Pleasures,</hi> was forced to fall flat upon the Ground, and rowl himself to and fro: And in praying, his whole Body was wont so much to Quake and Tremble, as would cause the Chamber to shake, and the Stools in it to dance about. Nay, once this shaking proceeded so far, that the poor Saint broke two of his Ribs by it. <hi>Ignatius</hi> began his fits of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion in a violent Fever, and ever after maintained them in a weak and crazy Body. In his Retirement into the Vale of Paradice,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 1.</note> where he enjoyed such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Raptures, he impaired his Health so far in a few days, that his Friends searching for him, found him in a Swound, which wmmediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:46195:31"/>
by a desperate Fever. <hi>In his Meditations and Raptures, he poured forth so great an abundance of Tears, that he was often very near blinded by it. In all his Extasies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gloria S. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natii,</hi> cap. 8.</note> 
               <hi>his Body was wonderfully weakned. By reciting Mass,</hi> (wherin he always pretended to receive a flood of Consolations) <hi>he often became so languid, that he was forced to be carried to his Chamber upon the Shoulders of other Men, not being able to stand upon his own Legs for weakness. Sometimes in praying or celebrating Mass, he burned with such vehement Heat, that all the Parts of his Body seemed to be on Fire, his Face grew red as Scarlet, his Pulse beat violently, and all his Veins swelled through the extraordinary Fermentation of his Blood, and the hair of his Head stood upright.</hi> Or as another Author expresseth it, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 6.</note> 
               <hi>His Countenance was inflamed in praying; and commonly in the heat of his Devotion, he had very violent Palpitations of Heart, and frequent Raptures; withal, he poured out a Torrent of Tears, till he obtained of God by Prayer, that he might be able to restrain his Tears; but when they were kept in, he felt in his Soul an Inundation of spiritual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</hi> From which last words, it is manifest, That he mistook the extraordinary motion of his Blood (which commonly produceth a grateful sentiment of Pleasure) for spiritual Delights; since, from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strainment of his Tears, no other effect could fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, than that the motion not being allayed by an Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of Tears, should continue longer in its first Vigour. To mention no more, our Saint, <hi>Whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he thought of Death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vitelleschi,</hi> c. 20.</note> 
               <hi>and the Love of God, had such furious motions in his Heart, that his Health was exceedingly injured for a long while after.</hi> After so many manifest Indications of a violent and disturbed Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, we cannot with any shew of reason ascribe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:46195:31"/>
his spiritual Delights and Visions, to the serene and calm Operation of the Holy Ghost, but must impute them to the Phantomes of his Brain; an effect which naturally followed his method of Devotion and Meditation; insomuch, as <hi>Peter Faber</hi> having wholly resigned up himself to his Conduct, and to the Rules prescribed in his Book of <hi>Spiritual Exercises,</hi> felt such fervour in his Meditations, that he was forced often to go down from his Chamber into a little Court, to take fresh Air, and cool his Brains.</p>
            <p>Ignorance and Weakness of Understanding, is so necessary a quality to those Enthusiasts, who are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of the truth and reality of their Dreams and Visions, such as <hi>Ignatius</hi> seems to have been, at least, in the former part of his Life; that without it, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm could gain neither Admission nor Belief, even in their own Breasts. For this reason St. <hi>Philip Neri, Above</hi> 
               <note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">Jac. Baccius in Vit. ejus, l. 2. c. 19.</note> 
               <hi>all things endeavoured that his Disciples should suppress in themselves the too nice Inquisitions of the rational Intellect, and often said it was the Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Spiritual Life, to lay aside Reason and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> This affected Ignorance not only disposeth them to submit their Judgment to the Direction of an irrational Imagination, and resign up their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to the fortuitous Impulse of irregular Motions in the Body; but also disables them from discovering the Folly and false Ideas of Enthusiasm, from percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that nothing can be more contrary to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of Christianity, than Fanaticism; that right Reason is the greatest Ornament, as well as Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mankind; that whatsoever violates the Laws of Decency and Sobriety, cannot be Divine; and instead of merit, that God is dishonoured by ridiculous Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and irrational Austerities.

He was so far indeed conscious of his own Ignorance, that he put himself to School, and bestowed many years in learning Philosophy and the Latin Tongue; but all his Labour met with small success; his natural Stupidity was too prevalent for the greatest Industry. In the Grammar-School at <hi>Barcelona,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 2.</note> he made so small Proficience, that in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Months he could not learn to Conjugate the Verb <hi>Amo</hi>; and was forced to beg of his Master to whip him severely, and treat him equally with the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Boy. After two years Study at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> he goes to <hi>Alcala,</hi> where he learneth Logick, Physick and Divinity,<note place="margin">Id. ibid.</note> 
               <hi>And studieth Night and Day without Intermission; but so many different Notions so confounded his Vnderstanding, that all his Labour ended in learning nothing.</hi> Next he removes to <hi>Salamanca,</hi> leaves off begging, and mitigates his Austerities, that he might imploy his whole time in Learning. Yet finding but small Progress, he quits <hi>Spain</hi> for shame, and betakes himself to the University of <hi>Paris,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Maffeius,</hi> l. 1. c. 18.</note> wisely driving an Ass laden with Books before him. For himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he got to <hi>Paris,</hi> had lost all his Learning, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:46195:32"/>
as coming thither, he was forced to begin all a new, and return even to the first Elements of Grammar. After he had studied there several years, by the help of Friends, and many Petitions, he gets a Degree; but still continues so Ignorant, that after he had enticed <hi>Faber</hi> into his Society, he was forced to desire him privately to explain <hi>Aristotle</hi> to him;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bussieres</hi> l. 2. c. 1.</note> to whom he in requital explained the Secrets of a Spiritual Life, and Mystical Divinity. But perhaps all this is to be ascribed to a singular Providence, which hindred his Progress in Learning, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be destructive to the very being of a <hi>Romish</hi> Saint. That little smattering which he had of Learning, did no small Prejudice to his Sanctity; for after that, his Visions, Extasies and Illuminations, became infinitely less frequent. The very reading of a learned and rational Book, lessened his Devotion, and quenched his Spiritual Consolations. For being advised once by some learned Men, to read the Books of <hi>Erasmus,</hi> he perceived that the reading of him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished his Devotion; and the more he read, the less fervour he had in Prayer: He thereupon threw them away;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 2.</note> and when General of his Order, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that none of his Followers should read <hi>Erasmus</hi>'s Writings, or at least, not without great Precaution. Nothing but the reading of <hi>Thomas a Kempis,</hi> or other unintelligible Enthusiasts could keep alive his first fervour, which grew faint and expired at the least appearance of solid Learning. If the Jesuits have since conceived a greater esteem for Learning, and not unsuccessfully employed their Labour in the attainment of it, they have perhaps deservedly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Reputation to themselves; but, as I fear, have thereby forfeited the Protection and Intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Founder <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who continues even
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:46195:33"/>
after his Death, to be the professed Enemy of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For ten years after his Death, appearing to <hi>Iames Terry,</hi> a young <hi>Scotchman</hi> of his Society, who with diligence and fervour had applied himself to the Study of true Learning, he sharply reprehended him, recommending to him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bussieres,</hi> l. 3. c. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Less Knowledg, and more Virtue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus manifested, That <hi>Ignatius</hi> wanted no Qualities necessary to an Enthusiast; I shall next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether he were really guilty of Enthusiasm. This consisteth in pretending to divine Visions and extraordinary Illuminations, after Christianity is once fully setled, and all Christians left to learn their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by natural and ordinary means from the Rule of Faith, whether Scripture or Tradition; in boasting of infused Knowledg and inward Lights, in pretending to have received all the Articles of Faith by particular Inspiration, to do all things by the private Impulse of the Spirit, and act solely by the Inspiration of the Holy Ghost; in venting these pretended Revelations, without any respect to the Rules of Ecclesiastical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline fixed by Christ, much less of Decency; in perpetual talking of Divine Matters in an unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Jargon, and impertinent Canting, and boasting of a mighty Familiarity with God and Christ. To which, if frequent Extasies and Raptures of mind be added, the Enthusiast is become compleat, and his Disease little less than Madness. These Pretences are not only apt to raise the Admiration, and excite the Veneration of the Vulgar, who ever admire what they cannot Penetrate; and having crude Notions of Religion and Piety, are easily led away with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of it; but raise the Ambition, and augment the Folly of the Enthusiast himself, who thence form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vast Ideas of his own Merits and Perfection; is delighted with his own Illusion, hates to be convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:46195:33"/>
and flatters himself with the thoughts of being the familiar Friend of God, and Favourite of Heaven. That <hi>Ignatius</hi> was guilty of all these Extravagances and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in the highest degree, a particular Examination of his Actions, will abundantly demonstrate.</p>
            <p>First, Therefore, as to the pretence of Divine Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and Illuminations, his whole Life after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, if we may believe the Writers of his Life, was a continued Series of them. His Conversion was at first produced by such imaginary Visions. The Holy Virgin descended from Heaven, and brought down with her the Child Jesus in her Arms (one would wonder how our Saviour since his Ascension,<note place="margin">Gloria St. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natii,</hi> c. 4. l. 1.</note> should dwindle into a Child) to convert this maimed Soldier. She appeared to him all invironed with Light, while he was awake, (tho <hi>Bouhours</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">L. 1.</note> implieth the contrary) and continued with him some while. <hi>At this Vision,</hi> Ignatius <hi>felt his Soul replenished with such a spiritual Vnction, as ever after rendred all Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the Senses insipid to him. During this Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition, it seemed to him that his heart was purified with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, and that all Images of sensual Delights were quite razed out of his mind.</hi> Soon after he imagineth St. <hi>Peter</hi> to appear to him, to touch him, and cure his Wounds. Being recovered, he goeth to <hi>Manreze,</hi> where he receiveth innumerable Visions and Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; but the most remarkable, was an Extasy, which lasted eight Days;<note place="margin">Id. ibid,</note> during all which time he had no use of his Senses. Some thought him Dead, and would have buried him. But some motion of his Heart being at last perceived, diverted that Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. No Body ever knew the Secrets which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to him in that long Rapture; and all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which he would give, was, that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:46195:34"/>
Travelling thence through <hi>Italy,</hi> in his way to the Holy Land, and praying in the open Plain before the Gates of <hi>Venice,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Id. l. 2.</note> Jesus Christ appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, gave him inward strength, and promised him Protection in all his Journey. Coming to <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> he was seized with a religious horror, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that he saw Jesus Christ in every place, born in the Manger at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> teaching in the Temple, crucified in Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> and triumphing on Mount <hi>Olivet:</hi>
               <note place="margin">

Afterwards at <hi>Paris</hi> he saw clearly in a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that God had appointed to establish a Company of Apostolick men, and found a new Order in the Church. A year after journeying from <hi>Spain</hi> through <hi>Valentia</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 3.</note> he happened on <hi>Iohn de Castro,</hi> a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hermit, to whom he made known his Intention of going into the Holy Land. <hi>Castro</hi> spends all the Night following in Prayer, comes out of his Cell next Morning in a transport of joy, and tells <hi>Ignatius</hi> that he was commissioned by Heaven to let him know, that his Design should succeed, and turn to the good of all Christendom; and for a sign that he did not speak at random, offered himself to be his Companion and Disciple. <hi>Ignatius</hi> received this Testimony of <hi>Castro</hi> as an Oracle of the Holy Ghost, but would not suffer him to accompany him. Whence <hi>Bouhours</hi> concludeth, that Persons inspired from Heaven in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of others, are not always so for themselves. He might more reasonably have concluded that the whole Inspiration was fictitious, and a meer whimsie of the

               <hi>Ignatius</hi> travelling from <hi>Venice</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> he stept alone into a little ruinous Chappel upon the Road, <hi>following the motion of the Spirit which possest him,</hi> to recommend his Company to God. Scarce had he begun his Prayer, but he was wrapt in spirit, environed with a great brightness, and saw the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Father, who presenting him to the Son, who stood before him laden with an heavy Cross, recommended him to his protection; who receiving him graciously, said, <hi>I will be propitious to you at</hi> Rome. Removing soon after to <hi>Monte Cassino,</hi> he saw the Soul of <hi>Hozez,</hi> one of his Companions,<note place="margin">Id. ibid.</note> who at that time died at <hi>Padua,</hi> at the very moment of his expiring, in a glorious and shining Habit, enter into Heaven: and thereby had the good fortune to equal St. <hi>Benedict,</hi>

But now for the Honour of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> whereas St. <hi>Benedict</hi> had but a transient view of the ascending Souls, our Saint had the same Vision more than once. For presently after hearing Mass, he saw Heaven open, and his Companion in the middle of the Saints (See the Merits of the Society) more resplendent than the rest.<note place="margin">

of St. <hi>Benedict,</hi> that in his time Enthusiasm was but in its infancy, which in latter Ages was advanced to greater perfection. St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> scorned to draw his model from an imperfect Copy; but chose rather to imitate St. <hi>Francis</hi> a more Illustrious Visionary. He assured his Companions,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bonaventura,</hi> cap. 8.13.</note> that he often enjoyed the Corporeal Presence of Jesus Christ; who appeared to him in his private Prayers nailed to the Cross, and at other times under the form of a Cherub having six wings, bearing a Crucifix in his Breast, and fluttering before him for a long while in the Air. Not only were Divine Visions of this nature frequently by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven granted to them, but also liberally communicated to others, whensoever their Interest or Advantage required it.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 2. <hi>Vitelleschi,</hi> cap. 4.</note> Thus <hi>Ignatius</hi> coming to <hi>Barcelona</hi> to take Ship for the Holy Land, a certain Lady, called <hi>Isabella Rosella,</hi> saw him at Church, and heard a Voice within her, crying, <hi>Call him, Call him.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon she invites him to her House, and desires him to lodge there. But he declared that he was called by Heaven to another place, and so denied her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest. Certainly one of these Calls must have been an Illusion. For if the Lady was indeed commanded by God to invite him, he ought to have accepted the Invitation; if he was sent by God to another Place, she ought not to have diverted him. But not to be too critical upon the Actions of the Saints, since it is the peculiar privilege of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that no Contradictions can prejudice the truth of its Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. From <hi>Barcelona Ignatius</hi> travelled to <hi>Venice,</hi> where entring late, he takes up his Lodging upon the stones in the Piazza.

               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:46195:37"/>These Visions and Apparitions are so plainly owing to the whimsies of a disturbed Imagination, that no art can palliate the Delusion. The Ideas which these Enthusiasts conceived of God, Christ, and Angels, were so gross and corporeal, and by long habit atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with such violent motions of the Spirit, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cloud in their Brain was mistaken for that Object, whose Idea did then accompany it. This is evident in the case of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who in Mount <hi>Cassino</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the famous Vision of St. <hi>Benedict</hi> in that place, and then hearing the death of <hi>Hozez,</hi> imagined he saw a Vision of the like nature; and in visiting the holy Places in <hi>Palestine</hi> always fancied to see Christ before his eyes in that habit, which the remembrance of the Place suggested to his Imagination, born in the Grotto at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> crucified in Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> and ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in Mount <hi>Olivet.</hi> This was solely to be ascribed to the delusion of a violent and strong Imagination, wherewith all the precedent Actions and Arguments demonstrate <hi>Ignatius</hi> to have been endued. To which may be added this following Circumstance. When <hi>Ignatius</hi> first set himself to learn Grammar at <hi>Barce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona,</hi> he found his Spirits by long habit so stongly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to these Enthusiastick Imaginations, that he could not divert them any other way.

However, if this Illusion had stopt in his own Breast, it had been no great loss; but when it imposeth upon multitudes of credulous Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and draws them into pernicious mistakes; when after a juridical Inquiry the reality of such Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions is allowed and attested by the publick suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:46195:37"/>
of a large Christian Church in the Canonization of the Visionary, we cannot but deplore the Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Mankind, and Corruption of that Church. If the truth of all Christian Religion depended upon the attestation of such a Church, as is pretended, well might all sober Heathens suspect the Miracles of Jesus Christ, or even deny the existence of such a God, who chooseth the greatest Fools for his highest Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, and obsequiously attendeth the Motions of every petty Visionary. More rationally did <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratus</hi> proceed in writing the Legend of <hi>Apollonius Tyaneus</hi>;<note place="margin">De vita <hi>Apoll.</hi> l. 4. c. 5. l. 8. c. 13.</note> to whom he ascribes no more than two Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and both of them undertaken for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Knowledge; the first an Apparition of <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>'s Ghost to him for the resolution of divers Critical Questions; the other of himself after death to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Friends, to assure them of the Immortality of the Soul.</p>
            <p>If the external Visions of <hi>Ignatius</hi> were rare and wonderful, the internal Illuminations of his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing were more extraordinary. From these he pretended to have received a more perfect knowledge of the Mysteries of the Christian Religion, than could have been drawn from the ordinary Rule of Faith; to have learned all the Secrets of the Trinity, and seen the very Essence of God. The pretence of this Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Knowledge is the chief and most essential Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Enthusiasm; others may be properties or effects of it,<note place="margin">

               <hi>that being but an Idiot, he was enabled to write a Book concerning the Trinity in the beginning of his Conversion. His mind was frequently illuminated with Visions of Divine Persons, sometimes altogether, sometimes every one separately, and of the Divine Essence it self.</hi>

               <hi>The whole design of his Order was by him ascribed to this divine and admirable illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind. Wherefore he might justly assume those words of St.</hi> Paul, <hi>For I neither received it of man, nor was I taught it but by the revelation of Iesus Christ. For in the very first year of his Conversion, when he thought least of it, a Divine Light arose in his mind, so great, and so wonderful, that he clearly perceived many things without any Master in a moment of time, not only concerning matters of Faith, but also other things, even the most subtil Questions and Determinations of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers; and manifestly perceived, as in a most bright Glass, those things which men are scarce able ordinarily to understand after long and accurate reading, many la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and great study.</hi> This is even a degree above the Infallibility of Pope or Councils; for they never pretended to be infallible, or to receive Divine Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the determination of Philosophical Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions.

            <p>But to represent more evidently the Enthusiastick Spirit of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> his pretence of Infused Knowledge, and perpetual enjoyment of Divine Illuminations; I will present the Reader with an account of his Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions for some few days only, written by his own hand; which the Writers of his Life pretend to have been preserved by a particular Miracle and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Providence, when all his other Papers, relating to the same Subject, were by him committed to the Flames. If the whole Journal of his Life had been preserved, it had mightily conduced to the glory of <hi>Ignatius</hi>; since none could then have denied him to have surpassed infinitely all the Enthusiastick Follies of the other <hi>Romish</hi> Saints, or <hi>English</hi> Visionaries. However, it appears from this Fragment, that he was no puny in this Art; but only was either more cunning, or less charitable than the rest, in not bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the World with the publication of his Revelations. Let us hear him then speaking in his own words.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The tears of this day seemed to me very different from those of other days;<note place="margin">

I heard Speeches within and without me, which all excited me to the love of God by an internal sound, with a concert and harmony so touching, wherewith God spoke to me, that I want words to express it. The next day I was overwhelmed with my tears, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Mass, as on other days, and even after Mass; and all the while I heard with great joy this internal
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46195:40"/>
Discourse. It seemed to me, as it was pronounced, that it was the Musick of Heaven, which I then heard. With these tears I perceived my devotion and love towards God to increase; as knowing that I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood what was revealed to me by an extraordinary and divine manner. The day after I had yet a great abundance of tears, as also of internal Discourses ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and wonderful. Praying to the Holy Virgin, and desiring her to intercede for me to the Son, and to the Eternal Father; and addressing my self to the Son, I implored the intercession of himself, and his Mother, to obtain for me the assistance of his Divine Father. In doing this, I perceived that my hairs stood aright, that I was elevated before the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that an extraordinary heat was dispersed through my whole Body: after which my tears be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan anew, together with a very ardent devotion. I began my Prayer with great abundance of tears, with a very sensible devotion, and among lofty perceptions of the Holy Trinity. Amidst these so sublime Ideas, so often reiterated, so sweet and so touching, I saw very well, that I had no memory which could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present them to me, nor understanding which might furnish to me words wherewith to express them. I had so great an abundance of perceptions, illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and spiritual sentiments, with so many tears, that I could not speak, could do nothing else but name God and my Saviour: and it seemed to me, that as often as I named them, I found my self pierced to the very bottom of my Soul with a plenary sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and a profound respect, and a desire of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is impossible to be expressed. After prayer I felt yet extraordinary motions, tears and palpitations, burning all over with the love of God, and saying to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:46195:40"/>
him, that I desired rather to die with him, than live with any other. While I prepared my self for the Altar, meditating on Jesus Christ, I found my self moved by impulse to follow him. It seemed to me internally, that to accept an extreme poverty, the greatest motive which I could have, was to consider my Saviour as the Chief of the Society. Remembring then that the Father had formerly remitted me, and as it were, delivered me to the Son, I renewed my Design to imprint more than ever in my heart the Name of Jesus. After I had well fixed my Resolution, tears and palpitations returned as before. Speaking to the Divine Majesty, I was surprised with a torrent of tears; and was elevated to so flaming a love of God, that it seemed to me I was extraordinarily uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his love. I do not remember ever to have received any Illumination so excellent, so luminous, so sweet, and in so admirable a manner. Being afterwards in the Chappel, my tears began anew, and my Devotion renewed, being wholly terminated upon the most Holy Trinity. Being at the Altar, and habited to say Mass, my tears, palpitations and most ardent love were redoubled, thinking of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but the adorable Trinity. Afterwards I said Mass with so tender a sentiment of devotion, and among such abundant tears, that the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, together with a great pain, which they caused in one of my eyes, made me fear the loss of it, if they ceased not. At those words, <hi>Placeat tibi Sancta Trinitas,</hi> I was surprized with an emotion of excessive love, and a great inundation of tears. This Illumination and all others were terminated in the most Holy Trinity, which led me to it self, and drew me to its love. After Mass, having put off
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:46195:41"/>
my Habits, and praying near the Altar, I began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new to sob and renew my weeping, all inflamed with the love of the Trinity; and the sweetness of this love was so great, that I could neither divert my self from it, nor rise from that place. The rest of the day, either in the House, or in the Streets, at the remembrance of the Adorable Trinity, these vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent emotions of love were renewed, with a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of melting into tears. Disposing my self to say Mass, and speaking to the Holy Ghost with the same tears, and in the same devotion, it seemed to me that I saw him in a singular brightness, in the colour of a flame of Fire, in an extraordinary manner, and that he spoke to me. While the Altar was prepared, and while I put on the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and while I celebrated Mass; I had great interior Commotions, strong Tears, and vehement Palpitations, which often hindred my Speech. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards I had a powerful Commotion, and I saw the Holy Virgin near the Eternal Father, who seemed to me mightily disposed to assist me. Insomuch, as in the Prayers addressed to the Father, and at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration, it seemed to me that I comprehended, and saw evidently, that the Mother of God hath a very great share in the distribution of Grace; and that she is the gate whereby to arrive at Glory. I saw more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over at the Consecration, that her Flesh was contained in the Flesh of her Son, which I saw with so clear a perception, and so tender a sentiment, that it is not possible to express it. In the ordinary Prayer, from the beginning to the end, I had a very great devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all full of light. Without doors, in the Church, and in saying Mass, I saw the Heavenly Countrey in its Sovereign Monarch, as it were by

knowledge of the three Divine Persons, seeing the Second and Third Persons in the Father. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the Chappel to pray, I received an illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and supernatural assistance; by the help of which I knew, or to speak more properly, I saw the most Holy Trinity, and Jesus Christ, who served me in quality of a Mediator, and disposed me to this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Vision. In this Sentiment, and in this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion I was overwhelmed with a torrent of tears, and filled with an extraordinary love. Saying Mass with the same tears, and in the same devotion, I had on the sudden the same Vision of the Holy Trinity, my love for the Divine Majesty continually increasing. In beginning the <hi>Te igitur,</hi> I knew and saw, not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely, but with a vey clear light, the Divine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence or Essence, as the Sun, but much more lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous than that Sun which we see; and it seemed to me that the Father proceeded from this Divine Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, yet so, that the Essence appeared to me with the Father. And in this representation of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Existence, without any distinction of Persons, I felt a very ardent devotion for the thing represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with great emotions, great effusion of tears, and a great love towards the Holy Trinity. After which having finished Mass, and praying before the Altar, I saw a-new the same Essence in the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a Globe; and I saw in some manner the three Persons, to wit, the Father on one side, on the other the Son, and on the third side the Holy Ghost, which took their original from the Essence, without being yet divided from the Globe which I saw. And in this Vision I had new emotions, and new tears.</q>

               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:46195:42"/>He proceeds to relate other Visions and Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Trinity, his clear perception of its Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; and being swallowed up in the love of it, his union with the Divine Majesty, and fresh Visions of the Trinity, sometimes with, and sometimes without any distinction of Persons; his wonderful Illuminations which gave him in a moment greater knowledge of Divine Matters than could have been obtained by the study of many years; his elevated and innumerable perceptions in Spirit, and those so clear, that there remained nothing further to be comprehended in the Holy Trinity: his flaming love towards the Person of the Father, because in him the other Persons were es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially contained: his frequent sight of Jesus, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersoever he turned himself, accompanied with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant tears, inexpressible sweetness, and strong inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal motions. In short, it appears from this extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Account of his Visions and Illuminations, that no Enthusiast in any Age hath exceeded him either in the number or extravagancy of his Imaginary Visions. That they were indeed imaginary, and no other than the effects of a disturbed Brain, I need not insist to prove, since the very nature and constitution of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity requires it; which would be dissolved, if after a determinate Rule of Faith were setled, extraordinary Revelations in matters of Faith should be admitted, or Religion were to be learned not from that Rule, but from private Inspiration. Besides the absurdity and impertinence of these Pretended Revelations of <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> the crude and indigested Notions contained in them, demonstrate them to have proceeded from a Principle of Disorder, not the Divine Omniscience. But since the Writers of his Life contend these Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to have been real and Divine, and the Church
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:46195:42"/>
of <hi>Rome</hi> in the process of his Canonization alledgeth them as the grand argument of his Sanctity: I will op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose one reason to the truth of them. If indeed <hi>Ignatius</hi> received a perfect knowledge of the Christian Religon by extraordinary Illumination; if in these inward Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations he obtained distinct Notions of all Matters of Faith,<note place="margin">Vid. supra.</note> and was enabled to publish his Inspirations in such proper and sublime Expressions, that the most Learned admired him, and the most Ignorant were instructed by him, as is pretended; how came it to pass that for many years after, he was still esteemed a Fool and an Ideot? that in learning of any Science whatsoever, he was so insuperably dull and stupid, that after some years study,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 2.</note> upon a particular exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by the Inquisitors of <hi>Alcala,</hi> and Archbishop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> he was adjudged not to have been sufficiently instructed in Matters of Religion, and therefore orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by them to continue his studies of Divinity some years longer; but above all, how can it be imagined that after so many, and so clear Illuminations, any Learning should be necessary to him? yet after all <hi>Bouhours</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> tells us, that being conscious to himself of his Ignorance, and convinced that Learning was necessary to his intended purpose of Conversion, he applied himself to study.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, when once the belief of Divine Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminations is received by the deluded Enthusiast, and he imagines himself to be frequently inspired by God, it is natural for him to resign himself wholly to the supposed conduct of that inward Light, and act solely in obedience to it. Thus he mistaketh every whimsie of his Fancy for the Dictate of the Holy Ghost, and every motion of his Brain for the Impulse of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Then he believeth himself infallible, and pretends
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:46195:43"/>
to act always by Divine Inspiration. This indeed is an high degree of Fanaticism, but which above all is apt to draw the admiration, and delude the Judgment of the common People, who being not willing to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the labour necessary for discovery of truth, greedily embrace every pretence of infallibility, which may ease them of a laborious search, and in appearance secure them from all error. <hi>Philostratus</hi>

                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 6.</note> Lastly, to advance the Merits of <hi>Ignatius</hi> beyond all possibility of comparison, or even comprehension, contrary Impulses of the Holy Ghost acted in him and his Disciples at the same time.

               <note place="margin">Id. l. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Ignatius</hi> earnestly dissuaded it, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arguments from Truths divinely revealed to him, laid before them the folly of their Undertaking; yet the Ladies pursued their Design; and no wonder, for <note n="(e)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Maffeius,</hi> l. 1. c. 17.</note> 
               <hi>they were moved to it by the impulse of the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Enthusiastick Pretence of Divine Impulse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded so far in the College of Jesuits at <hi>Conimbria,</hi> while <hi>Ignatius</hi> was yet alive,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 5.</note> that <hi>every one took upon himself to be his own Director in matters of Piety and Mortification, only consulting his own Spirit, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heat of his Devotion. Ignatius,</hi> who never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in others the same methods of Perfection which he embraced himself, and could endure no Competitors of Divine Inspiration, writ an Epistle of Obedience to them, wherein he layeth down three Rules of Perfection. The first and lowest consists in doing what we are commanded. The second in not only executing the Orders of our Superior, but also conforming our Will to his. The third, to believe that what he orders us is best, and most reasonable, and upon this ground alone, because the Superior doth judge it so to be. However, this Advice of <hi>Ignatius</hi> may seem to check the Fanaticism of his Followers, yet it infinitely tendeth to promote his own. For if the Commands of the Superior must be judged best
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:46195:44"/>
and most reasonable for this Reason alone, because the Superior judgeth them so to be; it must necessarily be supposed that the Superior in giving all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, is acted by a Divine Inspiration, which renders him infallible. This not only created in others the belief of a Divine Impulse perpetually acting in him, but conduced to feed his Ambition, and augment his Glory. And indeed the whole design of his Order, and practice of his Life, tended to produce in others a belief of his own Infallibility, and thereby create to himself a little less than Divine Authority.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 3.</note> Summon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his Companions to <hi>Rome</hi> in the Year 1538. to treat with them about the constitution of his intended Order, he perswaded them besides their Vow of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and Chastity, which they had before made at <hi>Paris,</hi> to add a third of Obedience; and <hi>resolve to this end to elect a superior General, whom they must all obey as God himself.</hi> He knew very well, that the Election would most certainly fall upon him; and accordingly after he was chosen, his Companions made their vows of Poverty, Chastity, and Obedience; to which they added a fourth Vow of a Blind-obedience to the Pope,<note place="margin">Id. ibid.</note> with this difference, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> the General made his promise immediately to the Vicar of Jesus Christ, and the rest made theirs to him as to their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and Chief. Afterwards sending twelve Disciples into <hi>Sicily,</hi> he required them to subscribe to this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle among others,<note place="margin">Id. l. 4.</note> That they did believe whatever their Superior should prescribe to them was most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for them, and most conducible to their eternal good. Lying upon his Death-bed, among other Rules left as a Legacy to his Order, he requireth them to believe all things which the Superior enjoyns,<note place="margin">Id. l. 5.</note> to be good for them, even altho their own judgment should
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:46195:45"/>
suggest the contrary. This is a degree of Infallibility beyond whatever the Pope claimed. For however many have asserted him to be infallible in defining Matters of Faith; none ever yet denied that he might publish Constitutions prejudicial to the real Interest of the Church. But <hi>Ignatius</hi> ever affected somewhat extraordinary;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Maffeius,</hi> l. 3. c. 8.</note> and therefore taught that none did perfectly perform his Vow of Obedience, who were not like a Statue, which doth not in the least resist any motion: a Position which he had learned from his Master St. <hi>Francis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bonavent.</hi> cap. 6.</note> who affirmed none to be truly obedient, who were not like a dead Body, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in whatsoever situation it is placed. An Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which indeed deserveth to be chiefly urged and recommended by designing Impostors; who, when they have once possest their Credulous Disciples with the belief of it, have obtained their Design, and may securely propose their Erroneous Doctrines. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Apollonius</hi> above all things took care to teach his Disciples,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Philostrat.</hi> l. 5. c. 7.</note> that they ought in all things to pay a blind obedience to his Commands:<note place="margin">Id. l. 1. c. 13.</note> told them that he had received Inspirations from God, and was taught by him whatsoever he revealed to them; that he acted by Divine Impulse, and expected that they should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Directions, as he followed God's.</p>
            <p>This pretence and belief of Divine Inspiration and Impulse in Enthusiasts, is usually accompanied with so great a diffidence of their own Reason and Judgment, that no matters of moment must be left to their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; Heaven must be importuned, and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Revelations demanded to satisfy the meanest Scruples, and regulate their Actions; as if no Reason had been given to Mankind to guide their Conduct, and determine their Resolutions. St. <hi>Francis</hi> upon
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:46195:45"/>
any undertaking was wont to retire into solitary Places,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bonavent.</hi> c. 2.</note> and there <hi>incessantly beg of God with inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible groans,</hi> and importune him with continual prayer to reveal to him what he should do.<note place="margin">Id. cap. 4.</note> 
               <hi>In all emergent Difficulties he neither trusted himself, nor his Friends; but by instant prayer searched out the good pleasure of the Divine Will, till he were illustrated by the Oracle of supernatural Revelation.</hi> Being tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a great Scruple, whether he should employ his whole time in Prayer, or betake himself to preach the Gospel, he could not resolve the question by his own Reason, but resolved to expect the Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. He commands St. <hi>Clara</hi> to inquire the Will of God by Prayer.<note place="margin">Id. cap. 12.</note> It is revealed to her that he should undertake the Office of Preaching. It is impossible to imagine any thing more irrational or Enthusiastical than this Conduct; but what follows is an unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Superstition, which in the Ancient Church would have been punished with Excommunication. Whensoever he undertook any thing of moment,<note place="margin">Id. cap. 3.</note> he was wont to consult the Bible, and take his Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from that place, which upon a sudden opening of the Book first presented it self to his view. <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> having got together six Companions at <hi>Paris,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 2.</note> calls them together, causeth each in particular to pray, and fast, and beg of God his light to direct them; and then opens to them his Design. He prescribed to them the same method in forming the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Order, and choosing a General. When <hi>Borgia,</hi> one of his Disciples, was chosen Cardinal, to find out the Will of Heaven in that matter, he <hi>shut up himself for three days, and communicated only with God in prayer.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Id. lib. 4.</note> 
               <hi>The first day he found himself wholly indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, inclining to neither side. The second day he found
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:46195:46"/>
in himself an inclination rather of breaking the Design, than permitting it to go on. But the third day he was convinced that it was not the Will of God, that</hi> Borgia <hi>should be made Cardinal</hi>; and therefore opposed the Election. I will produce but one Passage more, which demonstrates both the Enthusiastick Diffidence of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi> and the intolerable Flattery of his Disciples. Upon occasion of his seeking God by Prayer so much, when he was to write the Constitutions of his Order, <hi>Vitelleschi</hi> hath these words. <note n="(a)" place="margin">Cap. 16.</note> 
               <hi>It seems there was upon this Subject an agreeable debate between the Master and the Servant; the latter judging himself incapable of making any Constitution, and resolving not to make any, without consulting the Oracle of the Eternal Wisdom; and the former taking pleasure in communicating to the other the sublime and resplendent Lights of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, which he had reserved from before the beginning of time for the conduct and regulation of this Society, which he conceived, and gave to his Church.</hi> What pity is it, <hi>Ignatius</hi> should be unhappily reserved to such a learned ungrateful Age? Otherwise his Disciples might have offered somewhat to his memory, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable, and in nothing inferior to <hi>the Eternal Gospel of St.</hi> Francis.</p>
            <p>When the Enthusiast is advanc'd so far as to believe the Phrenzies of his Brain to be Divine Illuminations, and himself on all occasions to be divinely inspired, he will not fail to pretend a mighty familiarity with God; and from the sentiment of any grateful motion in the Blood or Spirits, imagine together with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Lights to have received great abundance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Consolations. He will fancy himself to be the familiar Acquaintance of God, and Favourite of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and thence conceive a spiritual Pride greater and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:46195:46"/>
more intolerable than any which ariseth from the pomp or grandeur of the World.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 1.</note> That sometimes such a flood of Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would suddenly come upon him, that he was even overwhelmed, and transported out of himself; that by reason of these overflowing Consolations,<note place="margin">Id. l. 3.</note> such abundance of tears would follow, that his sight was endangered by it: that by the great affluence of these Consolations, and tears ensuing from them, in reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Divine Office,<note place="margin">Gloria S. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natii,</hi> cap. 9.</note> he was forced to stop and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt his Prayers at almost every word, and employ a great part of the day in reading the Psalms only.

For when the turbulent motions of the Brain are mistaken for Divine Inspirations, and the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment willingly acquiesceth in that delusion, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward expressions, which are ever conformable to the Ideas of the Mind, cannot but be involved in the same obscurity. And this, however it deserves the scorn and contempt of judicious Persons, tendeth not a little to raise the Reputation of the Enthusiast among igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant men, who ever admire what they cannot pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, and suppose the obscurity of his Discourse to proceed from the Divine Mysteriousness of it. If we consult the Writings of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> we shall find them full of this foolish Canting.

This is indeed the last and highest degree of Fanaticism, not to contain the whimsies of their disturbed Fancy within their own Breasts, but imagining them to be necessary Truths for all Christians, to propagate them with a blind and unwearied zeal; to believe that Christ hath not openly and plainly delivered to the Church in the rule of Faith all necessary Articles of Religion, or that suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient means were not provided for the propagation of them, unless they intruded themselves into the Holy Office against all the Rules of Decency and Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Policy. The Author of the <hi>Lawful Prejudices against the</hi> Calvinists, affirms the guilt of this disorder alone to be a sufficient argument why all their Pleas should be rejected without any farther consideration. Whether, and how far the <hi>Calvinists</hi> are guilty of this
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46195:48"/>
irregularity, I will not enquire; but affirm that the most Illustrious Saints of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have been inexcusably guilty of it. Particularly the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Merits of St. <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Ignatius</hi> are chiefly founded upon this apparent zeal for Souls, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their wild notions to the People without any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary mission from Christ, or delegation from the Church.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bonavent.</hi> cap. 3.</note> St. <hi>Francis</hi> immediately after his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, while he was yet an ignorant Layman, fell to preach repentance to the People in the Streets and Markets: and being asked by some Robbers, setting upon him in the Road, who he was, as if he were ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 2.</note> he answered, <hi>I am the Preacher and Messenger of the Great King.</hi> As soon as he had got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether seven Disciples, he sends them forth to preach the Gospel in these words,<note place="margin">Cap. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Go ye, and declare peace unto men, preaching repentance for the remission of sins.</hi> Then taking one Companion to himself, he proceeds to one part of the World, sending the other six by couples into the other three parts of the World. This was a phrenzy beyond the power of <hi>Hellebore,</hi> and which exceeds even the Follies of our <hi>English</hi> Fifth-Monarchists. Surely, whatsoever <hi>Bonaventure</hi> may pretend, the Holy Ghost had no share in this Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking: and therefore no wonder it met with no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter success. St. <hi>Francis</hi> himself prepares to preach the Gospel to the <hi>Sarazens</hi> in <hi>Syria</hi>; but by contrary Winds is driven upon the Coast of <hi>Sclavonia,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to return back.<note place="margin">Id. cap. 8.</note> The Spirit still moving him, he disposeth himself to convert the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Miramolins</hi> of <hi>Africk</hi>; but detained in his Journey by sickness, loseth his Courage, and quits the Design.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:46195:48"/>
yielding himself Prisoner to the <hi>Soldan</hi>'s Guards, boldly demands to be brought to his presence. The Soldiers, after they had soundly beaten him, bring him to their Emperor. He asketh him who he is. <hi>Francis</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, That he is sent by God to preach Salvation to him and his People; and for proof of the Christian Faith, undertakes to enter into the fire. The <hi>Soldan</hi> laughs at him; and having made sufficient sport with him, dismisseth him for a Fool. <hi>Ignatius</hi> at his very first conversion proposed to himself to preach the Gospel in the Holy Land. Accordingly, in the Year 1523. he enters upon the Journey,<note place="margin">

The poor Saint is forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn without success: however, he quits not his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign. Studying at <hi>Barcelona,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Id. ibid.</note> 
               <hi>he began to preach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version to his Neighbours.</hi> Removing to <hi>Alcala,</hi> he falls to reform the dissolute Manners of Scholars, Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and others, and to Catechize Youth. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing suspected of Sorcery, he is clapt into the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To free himself from Prison, he professeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self willing blindly to obey his Ecclesiastical Judge. At last the Inquisitors dismiss him, but withall forbid him to explain to the People the Mysteries of Religion upon pain of Excommunication and Banishment. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi> notwithstanding his promise of blind obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, would not readily submit to this Command, doubting whether it were a lawful Command, and fearing that in not preaching, he should be wanting to his Call and Vocation. To get rid of this difficulty,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:46195:49"/>
he removes to <hi>Salamanca,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Id. ibid.</note> and there preacheth openly to the People in the Streets and Fields; altho many good men were scandalized at it, saying, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard that a simple Layman should instruct the People, and perform the whole Office of a Pastor in directing their Consciences. Upon this he and his Companions are thrown into Prison by the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; where they do nothing but sing Psalms,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ribadeneira,</hi> cap. 6.</note> and preach to the People flocking to them, through the windows and chinks of the doors. Being examined by the Inquisitors, he pretends that he did not preach, but only hold forth to the People,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 2.</note> Being confuted in that, he refuseth to give any farther account of his Authority to preach, till his Ecclesiastical Superiors should command him. At last he is absolved upon condition to preach no more.

Upon this he is accused to the Inquisitor, but upon intercession of Friends dismissed. Now he falls hard to study, and wholly omits preaching: but soon after begins to talk of Heaven and Hell so vehemently to the Scholars, that he forced them to intermit their studies; and was thereupon condemned to be publickly whipt in the Hall by all the Regents, as a Disturber of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. However, soon after his zeal for conversion of Souls mightily increased upon him; and he clearly saw that God had appointed him to establish a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Apostolick Men to that end.<note place="margin">Id. ibid.</note> Hereupon he begins to gather Disciples, and first sets upon <hi>Peter
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:46195:49"/>
Faber,</hi> a poor <hi>Spanish</hi> Youth, <hi>acted with sentiments of Vain-glory,</hi> and after a deal of Cant, acquaints him with his Resolutions to go into the <hi>East,</hi> and employ himself wholly in the conversion of Infidels. <hi>Faber</hi> takes fire at this, and resolves to follow him through all dangers. After he had gained five other Disciples by the like Artifices, he calls them together, opens his Design, and perswades them to vow a Journey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Holy Land to preach the Gospel there, altho none of them were yet ordained, except <hi>Faber.</hi> The Design being resolved on, <hi>Ignatius</hi> takes a progress into <hi>Spain</hi>; and there preacheth every Sunday, and two or three days in the Week, with great concourse of People. The Church not being able to contain the multitude of his Auditors,<note place="margin">Id. l. 3.</note> he holds Field-Conventicles; and there inveighs powerfully against Cards and Dice (I suppose Mince-pies were not yet in fashion) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading the People to throw them all into the River. Coming to <hi>Venice,</hi> he waits for his Companions, and in the mean while employs himself in preaching. When his Companions were all met, they most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily could get no passage to the Holy Land; and therefore go to <hi>Rome</hi> to receive the Directions of the Pope. Here they obtain to be ordained Priests; yet that they may as much as was possible continue their Enthusiasm, refuse to preach in a regular way; but dispersing themselves through the great Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> commonly get upon some Stone in the middle of the Market-place,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Maffeius,</hi> l. 2. c. 4.</note> and whirling their Caps over their heads, invite the People to hear them with a loud voice; when having got a confluence of People about them, they vented their undigested Notions of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in a canting and mysterious stile; altho for the most part with such ill success,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 3.</note> that many of them
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:46195:50"/>
were clapt into Prison by the Inquisitors. We have long since deplored, and our Adversaries of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have upbraided to us, the Divisions of our Church arising from the unlawful usurpation of the Pulpit by Enthusiastick Preachers. Yet could we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver charge them with such gross follies and irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities as those now mentioned; nor can the Papists justly accuse them of any; since in acting this Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Enthusiasm, they imitated the Great <hi>Ignatius</hi> and his Disciples, and perhaps learnt it from them. At least our Adversaries cannot now deny, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits have sometimes preach'd in Conventicles.</p>
            <p>Thus we have past through all the chief and most es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Properties of Enthusiasm, and demonstrated <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> to have possest them all in an high degree. I will next consider some of the more ordinary effects and consequences of it, and compare them with the Actions of our Saint. For these essential Errors of Enthusiasm, in mistaking the turbulent Motions of the Spirits for the Dictates of the Holy Ghost, and the Tempests of the Brain for Divine Inspirations, cannot but betray the Judgment of the Enthusiast to a thousand other Errors and Absurdities; inspire him with false notions of Religion, misguide his Zeal, and corrupt his Devotion: Every immoderate excess of Vertue will then appear an extraordinary Perfection; and the foulest Superstition shall be accounted meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious. Hence, among other follies, the Enthusiast will imagine it no small Perfection to pray continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, suppose it to be a sign of a nearer familiarity with God; thence flatter himself with the belief of his own extraordinary Merit, and by gratifying his mistaken Ambition, create to himself even a sensual pleasure in the performance of it. Thus St. <hi>Francis</hi> was wont to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:46195:50"/>
pray incessantly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bonavent.</hi> cap. 4.</note> if not vocally, at least mentally; and in praying, used to receive great caresses from the Holy Ghost, to be ravished in his mind, and wholly swallowed up in a certain wonderful light;<note place="margin">Cap. 3.</note> and ofttimes in an excess of contemplation to be put beside himself;<note place="margin">Cap. 8.</note> insomuch, as being wrapt in Spirit, and perceiving somewhat beyond humane sense, he was ignorant of what was done before his Eyes. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi> after his conversion, spent seven hours every day in the Church in prayer upon his knees; and was immediately so recollected,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 1.</note> that he often conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued many hours together without any motion. In his long retirement at <hi>Manreze,</hi> not satisfied with his seven hours of prayer, he did nothing but pray. When he was ordained Priest, he retired to a poor solitary Cottage; and living like an ancient Hermit, fasted daily, prayed incessantly, and there received such overflowing Consolations,<note place="margin">Id. l. 3.</note> that through, the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of tears his sight was endangered. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce no more Instances, all the Actions of his Life were directed by the Illuminations of the Spirit, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be received in prayer, as we before shewed. Yet himself, when the Reputation of any other devout Enthusiast was to be diminished, could alledge against it,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hours,</hi> l. 6.</note> that such as made long Prayers, ought to take great care not to abuse that commerce which they have with God. That there are a sort of People, of a wilful nature, who by much praying, without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the rules of discretion and found judgment, dry up their Brains, and are so possest with their own Imaginations, that there is no getting them out of their head. That others there are, who perswaded that all comes from God which enters into their thoughts in time of prayer, take their own Fancies
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:46195:51"/>
for their conduct; and so by following only the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse of Nature, which they mistake for that of Grace, fall into most gross Errors.</p>
            <p>Another ordinary effect of Enthusiasm is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of extraordinary assistance from God in all emergent Difficulties. The supposed experience of frequent Supernatural Illuminations makes the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiast believe that God is ever ready to engage in his quarrel, and for his sake to violate the Laws of Nature no less than the established Rules of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: that as he informs his Soul with Supernatural Inspirations, so he will protect his Body, and provide it necessaries by continual Miracles.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bonavent.</hi> cap. 8.</note> Thus St. <hi>Francis</hi> offered to the <hi>Soldan</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> to throw his Body into the fire in proof of Christianity, and decide the Controversy by the operation of the flames upon it. St. <hi>Dominick</hi> was more cunning, when preaching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Albigenses</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> he would not trust his Body to the fire, but drawing up his Faith and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in a Schedule,<note place="margin">Golden Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend. <hi>London,</hi> 1527. fol. 190.</note> used to cast it into the fire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the like Schedule of the <hi>Albigenses.</hi> The Legend tells you, that the first was always untoucht, the latter always burnt.<note place="margin">

Undertaking his Pilgrimage into the Holy Land, <hi>he would take no Companion along with him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 1.</note> 
               <hi>no Money, nor provision of necessaries for the Iourney; that he might have no comfort but from God, and no dependance but on

                  <hi>Maffeius,</hi> l. 1. c. 5. <hi>Bussieres,</hi> l. 1. c. 3.</note> Yet with all this Self-resignation, the cunning Saint dared not to come near <hi>Barcelona,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was infected with the Plague. Being accused of Sorcery, Sedition and Heresy to the Inquisition of <hi>Alcala,</hi> and some Ladies offering to him an Advocate to plead for him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 2.</note> he refused their kindness, <hi>thinking that he ought to leave himself to Providence,</hi> and not distrust God so far as to make use of any Humane means for his preservation. In his Voyage to <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> he would give no Money for his Passage, for that he thought utterly unlawful. Free Passage he could obtain no otherwise than upon condition of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding necessaries for himself.<note place="margin">Id. ibid.</note> This he scrupled at, and esteemed it a kind of diffidence of Providence, and deviation from Evangelical Poverty, to carry any thing along with him in the Ship. Touching in the way at <hi>Venice,</hi> some endeavoured to discourage him from the Journey, by representing to him the dangers of it, and impossibility of getting any farther passage at that season of the Year; he told them, that if he could not get a Ship, he would pass the Sea upon a Plank with the succour of Heaven.<note place="margin">Cap. grave Legend. <hi>Nov. London,</hi> 1516. fol. 197.</note> I suppose he had read how <hi>Iosefes,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> sailed from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Britain,</hi> with 150 Companions, upon his Shirt.</p>
            <p>Not in these respects only doth Enthusiasm betray the Judgment to false notions of Piety and Perfection; but in all other Christian Vertues infuseth the same Error, especially if it may tend to ostentation, and procure to the Enthusiast the admiration and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the deluded Vulgar. In that case it will be accounted an improvement of Vertue to run into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes; and the most extravagant Superstition shall be esteemed an exalted degree of Piety. Thus if Christ
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:46195:52"/>
hath commanded us not to set our heart upon Riches, but to be ready to forsake all Worldly Possessions, when they stand in competition with the profession of true Religion; the Enthusiast will believe all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of Goods to be unlawful, and account Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Poverty a Christian Perfection. If a temperate diet, and sometimes fasting, be recommended to us, the Enthusiast will fall in love with immoderate Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterities and Mortifications; and imagine the Merits of his Abstinence to be then infinite, when the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it exceeds all bounds. If we be admonished not to be deterred from our Duty by the contempt of the World, or scoffs of men, the Enthusiast will by all means court this contempt, and perform a thousand ridiculous actions to obtain the laughter of Mankind; and then applieth to himself all the Beatitudes of the Gospel as rewards of his Folly. Evangelical Poverty is one of the most specious pretences, that can be made use of by Fanatick Visionaries, to raise an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of extraordinary merit either in themselves or others. This was ever the grand Engine of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastick Orders of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; altho the World knows what vast Treasures and Possessions they have appropriated to their Monasteries and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. Certainly Reason doth not teach us that it is any great perfection to put on rags, and beg from door to door; and if Christ had taught so, Mankind would have had sufficient reason to reject his Religion as irrational and absurd. But he proposeth no such thing. These are only the Whimsies of Brainsick En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasts, who have abandoned themselves to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a depraved Imagination. When <hi>Apollonius</hi> boasted to <hi>Phraates,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Philostratus,</hi> l. 1. c. 10.</note> King of <hi>Media,</hi> of his own vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Poverty (for he had distributed all his Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:46195:52"/>
and Possessions to his Kindred and the Poor) and that of other Greek Philosophers; <hi>Phraates</hi> truly answered him,<note place="margin">Id. l. 3. c. 9.</note> that <hi>they were bigotted Enthusiasts, contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melious and seditious, unfaithful and rebellious, asserters of Fables and monstrous Stories; who made an ostentation of Poverty, not out of any sense of modesty or frugality, but that they might have the better pretence to steal and cheat.</hi> How far this Character may agree to St. <hi>Francis, Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> or their Followers, I will not now determine. I will only shew that they far exceeded these Greek Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers in the pretence and extravagant practice of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Poverty. St. <hi>Francis</hi> immediately after his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, changed his fine Cloaths with the Rags of a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, whom he met; and soon after hearing that Gospel read,<note place="margin">

But being at the point of departure, a fit of Conscience returns: he dares not make use of the Money, nor carry it along with him; and yet would not give it to the Seamen, lest they should use him the better for it in his Voyage, for to permit that, would be a distrust of Providence. At last he very learnedly decides the case, He layeth down his Money upon the shore for the next Comer to take, and so enters into the Ship. The same scruples urge him at his return; he begs free passage in the notion of a Saint, and upon no other condition will enter the Ship. The same scruple had possest St. <hi>Francis</hi>

How well the Jesuits have observed this Constitution, concerns not me to enquire. I fear most believe them to have broken their Founder's Will. I am sure they have palpably violated it in intruding themselves into the Courts of Princes, courting their Favour, seeking the acquaintance of Great Men,<note place="margin">Id. ibid.</note> and intermedling in Secular Matters; Practises which <hi>Ignatius</hi> esteemed the greatest Plagues which could befall his Society, and therefore earnestly begged of God for ever to avert them.</p>

In imitation of this Heroick Penance, <hi>Ignatius</hi> resolves upon a retreat; and having found out a dark and deep Cave in the hollow of a Rock (opening into a solitary Valley,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Ignatius</hi> will not renounce his Austerities, but continueth all his life to sprinkle his Meat with Ashes.

If to be bedawbed with Coaldust be so great a Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; when the granting of Indulgences comes next in fashion, we may hope to see erected an holy Confrater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Catholick Chimney-sweepers.</p>
            <p>If it be irrational to mortify the Body with excessive Austerities, and deny to it the common benefits of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it is no less folly to court the laughter, and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striously procure the contempt of Mankind; much more to be ambitious of Afflictions and Sufferings, or refuse to be delivered from them. This is the utmost degeneracy of Humane Reason, to imagine that our Nature receiveth any perfection from contempt or misery; an Opinion which overthroweth the very Laws of Creation, and is highly injurious to the Honour of God; as if God in creating us had not intended some benefit and happiness to Mankind even in this World; or afterwards, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing Christianity, had resolved to render us miserable and ridiculous. Such fatal Mistakes doth Enthusiasm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce, while it affecteth excesses in all Actions, and disliketh all sober Vertue. Yet no wonder even these gross Mistakes should be admitted, which so naturally tend to inflame the Pride, and foment the Ambition of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiast; who hence imagins himself dear to Heaven, assumes the title of Martyr, conceives a vast opinion of his own Merits, and misapplies to his Follies all the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings and Rewards promised to those who suffer for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness sake.<note place="margin">

blessing himself that he was thought worthy to suffer for the name of Christ.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 1.</note> Thus <hi>Ignatius</hi> also thought it highly meritorious to be on any account derided; and if by chance any insolent Person threw stones at him, while he preached,<note place="margin">

               <hi>that so he might not lose, through his own fault, so fair an occasion of partaking in the Ignominies of the Cross.</hi> Upon his refusal to plead, the Inquisitors clapt both him and his Companions into Prison, and load them with Chains, as Hereticks and seditious Persons. Hereupon they sing Psalms, and give thanks to Heaven all night long, for being thought worthy to suffer for Righteousness sake. The other Prisoners brake Prison; and binding the Guards, make their escape. <hi>Ignatius</hi> and his Disciples will not make use of this opportunity, but stay in the Prison. This is exaggerated by the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his Life as an extraordinary mark of Christian gallantry; altho we shall have no great reason to admire it, if we remember that their Legs were chained. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it cannot be denied, to the honor of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that he never blushed at any Reproach, nor was ashamed of the most ridiculous Action.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bussieres,</hi> l. 2. c. 15.</note> When he preached at <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Italian,</hi> that he might obtain the laughter and scorn of his Auditors, he would often intermix Spanish words, talk Gibberish, use Solecisms, and break the Rules of Grammar. But of all his Actions of Humility, the most illustrious was his Adventure at <hi>Bologna.</hi> Going over the Draw-bridge there, he fell into the Ditch, and crept out soundly drencht and bedaubed with dung.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:46195:56"/>
through all the larger and more frequented Streets of the City, begging of Alms, all covered with dung, as he was. This no doubt procured the desired effect, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the Rabble, pleased <hi>Ignatius,</hi> loaded him with merit, and made him proof against all shame.</p>
            <p>These effects of Enthusiasm, which I have already mentioned, however they be highly irrational, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the simplicity of the Christian Religion, yet at least they carry some shew of Piety, Abstinence, Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Mortification along with them, which may da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle the eyes of unwary People, and in an Ignorant Age pass for real Sanctity. But there are other Actions of Enthusiasts so extravagantly absurd and ridiculous, that they can be ascribed to no other cause than the unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Phrensies of a disturbed Brain; to whose irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Motions the Enthusiast yielding a blind obedience, is betrayed to the commission of all those Follies and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities which an heated Imagination can invent or sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest. These above all other Actions give the greatest scandal to the unthinking part of Mankind, as not to be palliated with any pretence of Piety; and do infinite prejudice to the common Cause of Christianity, while unlearned Persons taking their measures of it from the Actions of reputed Saints, accuse it of Folly and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, and believe it rather to have been designed for the Sport, than the Salvation of Mankind.

He gives the title of Brother or Sister to the meanest Beasts, even Worms and Flies; and thinks it meritorious to redeem Lambs from slaughter.

Among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Errors, into which he was carried headlong by a violent, and as himself thought, infallible Imagination, none of the least was his false notion of a Christian Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity; which he imagined to consist not in a sober de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, and unaffected gravity, but in acting pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly all the Follies of an unthinking Ideot,<note place="margin">

He doth so, plays the Fool before the General, denieth to him the civility of his Hat, and the common terms of respect due to a Person of his Quality, and dreaming out his words, denies himself to be a Spy. The General takes him for a Fool, and is angry with the Soldiers for bringing such an Ideot to him. The Soldiers revenge themselves upon him by beating him unmercifully. Next he passeth through the <hi>French</hi> Guards; but is there trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted somewhat better. I suppose the <hi>Spanish</hi> Discipline had by that time perswaded him to pull off his Hat. In the midst of all these Sufferings he was taken up with a profound meditation of the Contumelies which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour suffered, when he was carried from <hi>Annas</hi> to <hi>Caia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> from <hi>Caiaphas</hi> to <hi>Pilate,</hi> and from <hi>Pilate</hi> to <hi>Herod</hi>; and congratulated to himself the similitude of his Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.

            <p>I might produce many other properties and effects of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:46195:59"/>
Enthusiasm; and among these the perpetual inconstancy which attends their Actions and Resolutions. For since the Enthusiast wholly resigns up himself to the directions of an irregular Imagination, which is often disturbed with various, and sometimes contrary motions of the spirits, it cannot be avoided that his Thoughts and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions should be no less fortuitous than are their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; that while the motion continueth violent and rapid, he should feel a sensible pleasure, and imagine himself overflowed with Divine Consolations; when it grows languid and ceaseth, he should be reduced to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme despair, and exchange his sublime Raptures with melancholly Ideas of his own Condition: that what at one time is accounted a vertue, and no small perfection, shall at other times be contemned, and perhaps esteemed unlawful; and that the motions of his Will should be no less variable than the conceptions of his Understanding. This alone might abundantly refute all pretences of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Impulse; since the Dictates of the Holy Ghost are constant and invariable, and can no more be altered, than can the reason and nature of things. <hi>Ignatius</hi> soon after his conversion <hi>began to be afflicted with Scruples,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 1.</note> 
               <hi>and wants his former interior Consolations. Sometimes in his Prayer he found nothing but driness and anxiety. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times such a flood of Consolations would suddenly return, that he was even overwhelmed and transported out of himself. But these had no continuance. He found himself often preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated from an illuminated state into desolation and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> At his first conversion, being led, as he imagined, by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, he resolved to clothe himself in rags, to beg his Bread, to go barefoot, preach the Gospel in the Holy Land, and continue these Auste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities and Employments all his life. Many months had not passed before he changed his austere penitential Dress into a more decent Habit, put on Shooes, and suffered
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:46195:60"/>
his Resolutions of preaching in <hi>Palestine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Id. l. 2.</note> at first to cool, and at last to vanish. The itch of begging continued longer. In his Voyage to <hi>Palestine</hi> he dared not so much as to carry Provisions with him, laid down his Money at the Sea-shore; and touching at <hi>Cajeta,</hi> when some <hi>Spaniards</hi> bestowed some Money on him, he presently was troubled in Conscience for having taken it, and accused himself of it to God in his Prayer, and gave it all away to the next Poor he met. Finding his Studies to go on slowly at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> he diminisheth his Auste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities yet farther, leaves of his fantastick Habit, and Iron Chain, and retrencheth his seven hours of Prayer, <hi>Following the Light which he then had, that we may and ought on some occasions leave God for God.</hi> Retiring to <hi>Paris,</hi> he is satisfied in Conscience, that he may quit his Evangelical Poverty, and lawfully raise a fund of Money. Soon after he grows perfectly weary of his beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Life, doubts whether it is lawful; and proposed this question to the <hi>Sorbon, Whether a Gentleman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the World to follow Iesus Christ, and wandring through several Countries to beg Alms, doth any thing against Conscience.</hi> He acquiesced indeed in the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Determination of the <hi>Sorbon</hi>; yet remitted his first ardor so far, that he, who had thought it a diffidence of Divine Providence, to make any Provisions for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in a long Voyage, was content to take a Journey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Spain,</hi> to settle his own, and his Companions Affairs. For many years after his Conversion, he had ambitious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly courted the Contempt of the World, and esteemed Disgrace his greatest happiness; yet when he came to <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Id. l. 3.</note> he renounced this Self-resignation, and thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth stood upon his Punctilios of Honour; insomuch, as being accused by a <hi>Piemontese</hi> Priest, of Heresy and Sorcery, and at last beyond hope acquitted, he sollicited earnestly, to have a sentence juridically passed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:46195:60"/>
upon Record, and after long Sollicitation obtained it. Lastly, however he placed his supreme happiness in those imaginary Consolations, which he believed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to receive from God in Prayer, and was wont to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair when he found himself to want them;<note place="margin">Id. l. 6.</note> he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prayed to our Lord, not to give him any inward Consolations, that so his Love might be more pure and disinteressed. Such frequent changes of Resolution, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue that the Principle of his Actions was no other than a volatile and disturbed Imagination, no fixed and stable Judgment founded on true Notions of the Nature of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and religious Actions; much less the impulse of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Spirit.</p>
            <p>There remains one Phrenzy peculiar to the Enthusiasts of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which deserveth some Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before we close this Argument; I mean their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary fighting with Devils, whom these visionaries Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to appear frequently before their Eyes, to put on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Shapes, and play a thousand antick Tricks. This indeed is natural to those Enthusiasts, who propose to themselves the imitation of Legendary Saints, who in their Lives are represented to fight with Devils, no less continually than Knights Errant are in Romances to fight with Giants. <hi>Ignatius</hi> raised the whole Model of his imaginary Perfection from reading the lives of Saints; and therefore may be pardoned if he were transported with a furious Ambition of fighting Devils, or rather the Phantasms of his own disturbed Brain. The Devil it seems used to persecute both him and St. <hi>Francis</hi> most terribly; yet to spare the infirmity of these puny Saints, he never appeared to them under those monstrous shapes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was wont to terrify the ancient Saints. To them he presented himself under the shape of a Lyon, a Dragon, a Bear,<note place="margin">Golden Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend, f. 70.</note> or a Crocodile; and to St. <hi>Macarius,</hi> under the shape of so tall a Giant, that he reached Heaven; but
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:46195:61"/>
to our latter Saints he presents himself under a more amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble shape (as knowing their weak side) either of a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som Woman, or a purse of Money. Thus the Devil peeping one evening into St. <hi>Francis</hi> Cell,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bonavent.</hi> cap. 5.</note> with a pretty Face and glancing Eye, excited in the poor Saint an horrible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of the Flesh. Another time casting himself in his way, in the shape of a large purse of Money, he would have tempted him to the Violation of his Evangelical Poverty,<note place="margin">Cap. 7.</note> by taking up the Purse; but here the Saint was too cunning for the Devil. He is aware of the Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, forbids his Companions to take up the Purse, unless with Intention of abusing the Devil in it. The Devil smells out their design, turns into a Serpent, and runs away. Upon which St. <hi>Francis</hi> made this worthy remark; <hi>Beloved, Money is nothing else but the Devil.</hi> One Night the Devil got into his Pillow, and disturbed the good mans sleep;<note place="margin">Cap. 5.</note> but St. <hi>Francis</hi> soon made him weary of that, for he ordered the Pillow to be taken away, and the Devil to be shaken out into no very wholesom place. Nothing without doubt can be more edifying, than to read the stratagems and counterstratagems of the Devil, and the Saints. But above all, recommend me to our Countryman St. <hi>Guthlac,</hi> who when the Devils disturbed the Workmen in building the Monastery of <hi>Croyland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Capgrave Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend. Nov. <hi>London,</hi> 1516. fol. 172. <hi>Bussieres,</hi> l. 1. c. 2.</note> forced them in part of Penance to build the whole Abby Church with their own hands. As soon as <hi>Ignatius</hi> was converted, the Devils endeavoured to bury him in the ruins of an Earthquake; and when that would not suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, deluded him in appearing often in the Air before his Eyes, in a sensible Image, under the shape of a Body composed of many Stars. <hi>Ignatius</hi> for a long while knew not what this Apparition meant.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vitelleschi,</hi> c. 16.</note> But one day knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling before the Cross, he received an internal Light, which assured him that it was no other than an Illusion of the wicked Spirit. Afterwards, whensoever <hi>Ignatius</hi>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:46195:61"/>
saw it, he took his staff and brandishing it in the Air, beat the Apparition, which thereupon disappeared. For you must know,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ribadeneira,</hi> cap. 18.</note> 
               <hi>The Devil feared no Mortal like</hi> Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius; he trembled at the very sight of his staff, with which <hi>Ignatius</hi> was wont to drive him away,<note place="margin">Gloria S. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natii,</hi> cap. 7.</note> when he appeared to him, as he often did, under monstrous shapes. Lodging in an haunted Chamber at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> his Presence so terrified the Spirits which appeared to him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 2.</note> that they never after dared to approach that Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. In <hi>Demoniacks,</hi> his very Name would scare the Devils,<note place="margin">Id. l. 6.</note> and make them fly before him. Nay, <hi>his very Picture at last grew terrible to the Powers of Hell, and made them fly without resistance.</hi> Even his Letters drave away evil Spirits from a Colledg, which was haunted by them, when the ordinary Exorcisms of the Church could not. As soon as the Letter was publickly read in the House, the Noise ceased, and the Spectres disappeared. St. <hi>Francis</hi> enjoyed so unlimited a Power over Devils,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bonavent.</hi> cap. 12.</note> that if he commanded them in Virtue of their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to go out of possest Persons, they dared not to disobey. Particularly coming to <hi>Arezzo,</hi> which was greviously disturbed with intestine Seditions; he saw a company of Devils leaping and sporting in the Air over the City, and inciting the Citizens to mutual Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He commands Brother <hi>Sylvester,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 6.</note> to command the Devils in Virtue of their Obedience to be gone quickly. <hi>Sylvester</hi> goes to the Gate, and makes Proclamation with a loud Voice. The Devils without expecting a second Summons, run away; whereupon the Citizens are presently reconciled. Poor <hi>Apollonius</hi> was forced to go farther about, when he had to do with the Devil, whom he could dislodg no otherwise than by opprobrious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelies and Railings; or at least, by making him soundly Drunk.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Philostratus,</hi> l. 2. c. 2. l. 4. c. 6. l. 6. c. 13.</note> Yet this may be alledged to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Heathen Philosopher, that he once killed
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:46195:62"/>
the Devil, which is more than ever our Christian Saints could perform. For aspying a little sorry Fellow to walk in the Market of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> he assured the People it was the Devil,<note place="margin">Id. l. 4. c. 5.</note> and perswaded them to stone him. They do so, and then removing the Stones, instead of a Man, find only a great black Dog lying dead. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if all which our Historians relate of <hi>Ignatius</hi> and St. <hi>Francis,</hi> be true, they exercised an arbitrary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Power over the Devils, save only in the case of Life and Death. But see how a goodly Story is like to be marred by the Imprudence of the Relators. The Devil it seems, owed them a turn, and revenged himself upon their Memory. For the same Historians relate, that the Devil, far from being afraid at their Names, their Pictures, or their Letters, sometimes seized upon their very Bodies, and handled them very roughly. Thus St. <hi>Francis</hi> being once perswaded to betray his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility so far,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bonavent.</hi> cap. 6.</note> as to accept a Lodging in a Cardinals Palace, was at night most unmercifully beaten by the Devils, and left for dead. <hi>Ignatius</hi> was often most cruelly scourged by the Devil; more especially, one Night at <hi>Rome,</hi>

However these Bastinadoes might for a while mortify the Saints, and intirely blast the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of their arbitrary command over the Devils; yet at least they conferred this benefit upon them, that hereby they more nearly resembled the ancient Heroes of the Legend; among whom the Great St. <hi>Antony</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent the same fate. For unadvisedly peeping into the hole of a Rock,<note place="margin">Golden Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend in vita S. <hi>Antonii.</hi>

               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:46195:62"/>Not only in this respect were the Writers of his Life injurious to the Memory of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> in not telling their Story plausibly, and without any repugnance between the several parts of it; but also by their improvident zeal to raise the Honour and Grandeur of their Saint, have so imprudently represented many of his most illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious and wonderful Actions, that we might justly su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the concurrence of evil Spirits in the performance of them, if we either believed the truth of those Actions, or were ready to admit any such suspicions.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:46195:63"/>
as well as at other times diverted him from them; Lastly, if it be uncertain which miraculous Actions of <hi>Ignatius</hi> are to be ascribed to God, and which to the Devil: it cannot but remain infinitely doubtful, whether God or the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil had the greater share in the Actions of <hi>Ignatius</hi>; whether he acted by the power and impulse of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or by the assistance and suggestion of the latter.</p>
            <p>It cannot be pretended that the Church, by giving attestation to the sanctity of his Life, and the truth of his Miracles in his Canonization, hath removed all sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions of this nature, and vindicated the Memory of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> from all possibility of disadvantageous Scruples. For till the late Jesuits of <hi>Clermont</hi> proposed their The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, it never was pretended that the Church, much less the Pope, is infallible in determining matters of fact; and that the Pope in attesting the sanctity of <hi>Ignatius</hi> was actually deceived, and imposed upon the credulous World,<note place="margin">A sua conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sione nullum in eo depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensum est dictum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctumve, quod censeri posset esse peccatum mortale.

In the Bull of his Canonization the Pope affirmeth, that from the time of his Conversion no word or action proceeded from him, which can be accounted a mortal Sin. Despair of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mercy is by Divines commonly accounted the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test of all Sins; and even this may receive greater or less aggravations as it is more or less unreasonable. <hi>Ignatius</hi> committed this sin in the most aggravating circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, some while after his Conversion, when he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved frequent Illuminations from Heaven, had enjoyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Raptures and Extasies, performed stupendious acts of apparent Charity, and undergone the most severe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises of external Mortification; which if they be indeed acceptable to God, as the Admirers of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> imagine, might reasonably recommend him not only to the Mercy, but even the Favour of God.

Soon after his penitential Austerities performed at <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reze,</hi> he began to be afflicted with Scruples, and want his former interior Consolations; and he finds himself precipitated into a state of desolation and darkness.

To dissipate these Doubts, he hath recourse to Prayer; but the more he prays, the more his Doubts and Fears increase upon him. Every step he made, he thought he stumbled and offended God, imagining there to be sin, where there was not the least shadow of it; and always disputing with himself about the state of his Conscience, not being able to decide what is sin, and what not. In these conflicts of mind he groans, he sighs, he crieth out, he throws himself upon the ground like a man tormented with pain, but for the most part keeps a mournful silence. Being wont to communicate every Sunday, it now happened to him more than once, that being ready to communicate, his troubles of mind so redoubled upon him, that he retired from the Holy Table full of confusion and desolation. After many unprofitable debates, wherein his Understanding was lost, it entred into his thoughts, That obedience only could cure him; and that his pains would cease, if his Confessor should command him entirely to forget all things past. He doth so; but his Scruples continue. He redoubleth his Exercises of Piety; but finding no relief either from Earth or Heaven, he believeth that God had forsaken him, and that his Damnation was most certain. The Dominicans out of pity take him into their House, but can give him no comfort. He falls into a dark melancholly, and being one day in his Cell, he had the thought of throwing himself out of the Window to end his misery. But Heaven by force re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:46195:64"/>
him against his will. Then remembring the precedent of an old Hermit, he set himself to fasting; and resolved to eat nothing till God should hear him. Accordingly he fasted seven whole days without eating or drinking, but without success. His Confessor at last commanded him to break his fast. He doth so; and is on the sudden for ever freed from all his Scruples. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if all irregular conducts of the Will, be Sins, and an irrational Despair the greatest of all Sins; this of <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> was such a complicated Sin, as few examples can equal. But, it seems, Heresie alters the nature of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Vice. Such a Despair in a <hi>Protestant</hi> would have deserved damnation; whereas in a <hi>Romish</hi> Saint it was so far meritorious,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that if we may believe <hi>Bouhours,</hi> God in reward of it bestowed upon him the gift of curing Scrupulous Consciences.</p>
            <p>Upon occasion of this ready obedience paid by <hi>Ignatius</hi> to the Commands of his Confessor, I will take farther notice of the same blind submission observed by him through the whole course of his Life. Whether the Principles of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do not naturally lead to such a blind obedience to the dictates of every private Confessor, and thereby resolve the Faith of all particular Christians into the private opinion of an ignorant, and perhaps Heretical Priest, I will not now enquire: but certainly <hi>Ignatius</hi> practised this blind submission in the utmost extravagance; insomuch, as if he had adhered to his own Principles, or we may judge from his other Actions, he must have renounced Christianity, and even natural Religion, if his Confessor had so commanded him. His notion of a perfect obedience, which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, sheweth this; and his Actions put it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all doubt.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 2, 3.</note> He declared upon all occasions his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution blindly to obey his Ecclesiastical Judge; and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:46195:65"/>
when he preached at <hi>Venice,</hi> he proposed this as a first principle to all,<note place="margin">Id. l. 2.</note> That true Christians ought to submit themselves to the decision of the Church, with the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of an Infant. Being tried before the Inquisitors for no less than a capital Crime, he refused to answer till his Ecclesiastical Superiors should command him. <hi>Apollonius</hi> in a like case had refused to move his Tongue after a Vow of five years silence,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Philostrat.</hi> l. 1. c. 11.</note> when he was falsly accused of an horrid Crime, and in great danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing executed. However, if it be a venial Sin for a Man to sacrifice his Life to his Folly; it is no less than a mortal one deliberately to commit an action, which he is perswaded in his own Conscience to be unlawful. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> in his Voyage to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> thought it utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, and contrary to Evangelical Poverty, to carry any Provisions along with him. Yet being resolved by his Confessor to the contrary,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 2.</note> 
               <hi>he boldly did that out of obedience, which he durst not do of himself,</hi> and made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for his Voyage. This Folly at last proceeded so far, that renouncing the liberty of his Will, and use of his Reason, he would not venture upon any indifferent Action without consulting his Confessor: as if with St. <hi>Francis</hi> he wanted a Guardian,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bonavent.</hi> cap. 6.</note> who might in all things direct his Actions, and command his Will. When an unskilful Physician in his sickness administred to him hurtful remedies, and proceeded contrary to the nature of his Distemper,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Maffeius,</hi> l. 3. c. 7. <hi>Bussieres,</hi> l. 2. c. 15. <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 3.</note> and <hi>Ignatius</hi> fully knew all this; he would not once open his mouth against it, <hi>because he esteemed it meritorious, and a point of Religion, to obey in all things.</hi> When he was unanimously elected General of his Order by a method of Election which himself prescribed; he refused to accept the Office, unless he should be commanded by his Confessor. So the <hi>Iew</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to go on Shipboard on the Sabbath-day, till he was
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:46195:65"/>
beaten thither by the Janizary whom he had hired to do it.</p>
            <p>If then an irrational despair of the Mercy of God, and an intire Renunciation of the use of Reason, may be accounted Sins; we have abundantly demonstrated the Pope to have been widely mistaken in celebrating the Sanctity of <hi>Ignatius.</hi> If we should carry our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries yet farther; we might perhaps discover other no less Infirmities, which would ruin the supposed Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and the Truth of the Papal Assertion of it, at the same time. We might suspect him to have been guilty of many other Vices after his Conversion: For before it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 1. <hi>Maffeius,</hi> l. 1. c. 1.</note> all Writers allowed him to have been abandoned to the utmost degree of Debauchery and Immorality. His mean and unworthy thoughts of the Nature and Excellency of God, appear from many Actions before related, and may be farther manifested from his frequent imagining to see God and the Holy Trinity, before his Eyes, in a corporeal Representation; from his endeavouring to bribe him in favour of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by offering up to him three thousand Masses,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Maffeius,</hi> l. 2. c. 12.</note> and from his seeking to acquire the favour of God, by the practice of foolish Superstitions. We cannot but su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect him to have been inclined to Revenge and Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if we remember that all the Ships,<note place="margin">

That <hi>Ignatius</hi> was addicted to Lying and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, may be suspected from his behaviour to his own Brother, who perceiving him fallen into a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Phrenzy at his first Conversion, was resolved by all means to divert it. <hi>Ignatius</hi> not knowing how to leave his Brothers Castle of <hi>Loyola</hi> handsomely,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bussieres,</hi> l. 1. c. 3.</note> without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering his Intentions, borrows a Horse, and a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of him, assuring him that he went only to visit the Duke of <hi>Naiara,</hi> their Neighbour. Being at some distance from the Castle, he sends back the Servant, and rides away to <hi>Montserrat,</hi> where he enters upon a religious Life. After many years, returning in triumph to <hi>Loyola,</hi> he takes up his Lodging in an Hospital; but at last being overcome by the earnest Importunities of his Brother, promiseth to him faithfully to lodg with him in the Castle.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vitelleschi,</hi> cap. 12.</note> He goeth thither, lodgeth there one Night, and next Morning betimes steals back to the Hospital, thinking he had now fully satisfied his Promise; and refuseth ever after to return. Lastly, however the Writers of his Life pretend him to have been by a special priviledg freed from all carnal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 1. c. 10.</note> (which <hi>Philostratus</hi>

we have no small reason to suspect the contrary; For from his Conversion to his Death,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Bonavent.</hi> cap. 5.</note> St. <hi>Francis</hi> had the same bashfulness. He never durst look upon a Woman; and no wonder; for the very thoughts of them so terribly tormented him, as created to him no small perplexity: in proof of which I will crave leave to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the Reader with this following Story.<note place="margin">Id. Ibid.</note> The Devil one night putting on a handsom Face, peeps into Saint <hi>Francis</hi>'s Cell, and calls him out. <hi>The Man of God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently knew by revelation, that it was a trick of the Devil, who by that Artifice tempted him to lust:</hi> yet he could not hinder the effect of it. For immediately a grievous temptation of the flesh seizeth on him. To shake off this, he strips himself naked, and begins to whip himself fiercely with his Rope. <hi>Ha, brother Ass,</hi> saith he, <hi>I will make you smart for your rebellious lust: I have taken from you my Frock, because that is sacred, and must not be usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by a lustful Body. If you have a mind to go your ways in this naked condition, pray go.</hi> Then <hi>being animated with a wonderful fervour of spirit,</hi> he opens the door, runs out, and rowls his naked Body in a great heap of Snow. Next, he makes seven Snowballs, and laying them before him, he <hi>thus bespeaks his outward man. Look you, this great Snowball is your Wife, those four are two Sons and two Daughters; the other two are a Man and a Maid, which you must keep to wait on them. Make hast and clothe them all, for they dye with cold: But if you
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:46195:67"/>
cannot provide for them all, then lay aside all thoughts of marriage, and serve God alone.</hi> This was honestly said: no expedient of Fornication thought on, when Marriage was rejected. Now see the merits of rowling naked in the Snow. <hi>The Tempter being conquered, departs, and the Saint returns into his Cell with triumph</hi>; that is in plain English, his Courage was cooled; and Brother Ass benummed with cold.</p>
            <p>Not only may the Immunity of <hi>Ignatius</hi> from all mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal sin after his Conversion be denied; but even his Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity through the whole conduct of his Life may be called in question. We before observed him to have been acted with an ambitious Spirit, which might prompt him to undertake any Artifices tending to increase his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and if any thing was wanting to render him a compleat Impostor, it was only defect of Wit. Yet in many of his Actions we may plainly discover the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of an Impostor, who designed to raise his Honour upon the credulity of Mankind: Thus it may be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that for many years after his Conversion he applied himself to infuse his Notions into Women and Young men, taking advantage from the weakness of Sex, or inexperience of immature Judgment. <hi>Agnes Pascall, Isabella Rosella,</hi> and some Ladies of <hi>Alcala,</hi> were in a manner his only Disciples before his remove to <hi>Paris.</hi> These were the only Witnesses of his Miracles, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers of his Sanctity. At <hi>Paris</hi> he sets upon, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long canting and earnest sollicitations gains, to him <hi>Peter Faber,</hi>

These were the only Disciples he gained at <hi>Paris,</hi> and the first six Companions of his Order. To this we may add his resuming his discalceate Habit after a long intermission at his return into <hi>Spain</hi>; which ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only to raise to himself an opinion of extraordinary sanctity among his credulous Countreymen; his artifice of framing his Countenance, as himself pleased, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion required:<note place="margin">

               </note> his canting upon <hi>the greater glory of God,</hi> which served as a preface to all his Words and Actions: his pretended desire of resigning the Generalty of his Order, when he knew that it would not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; his flattery of Great Men, whom he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally praised, but winked at their faults, and never bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them, altho their Actions and Behaviour were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and decried by the unanimous consent of all men. Lastly, to produce one Instance of a just sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of Imposture in performing Miracles, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present it in the words of <hi>Vitelleschi.</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">Cap. 12.</note> At his last Voyage into <hi>Spain, one night the Saint did a great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. The People flocking to his Chamber, and staying with him late, he desired them to withdraw, and carry away the Candle with them, saying, God can enlighten the darkness of the night. When they were gone,</hi> Ignatius <hi>fell to praying loud. The People after some while return; and peeping through the Keyhole, see a light in his Chamber.</hi> He that will not suspect some artifice in this matter, may safely believe all the Fables of the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> If <hi>Ignatius</hi> wanted a light in his Chamber, why did he order the People to carry away the Candle with
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:46195:68"/>
them? If he intended to perform a Miracle, why did he not suffer the People to stay, and be spectators of it?</p>
            <p>But, what if after all, <hi>Ignatius</hi> should be found an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick? He would ill deserve the dignity of a Saint; and at the next reformation of the Calendar, might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps expunged out of it It seems St. <hi>Francis</hi> was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what inclined to Heresie, and no thorough Catholick. For his Epistle to the Priests of his Order is prohibited in the <hi>Index Romanus:</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">Ind. Rom. libr. prohibit. <hi>Romae</hi> 1607. p. 211.</note> and he is known to have laid those Principles of Evangelical Poverty, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards founded the Heresies of the <hi>Fratricelli</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guini,</hi> or <hi>Beguardi.</hi> This Opinion of the perfection and excellence of Evangelical Poverty, was common both to <hi>Ignatius</hi> and St. <hi>Francis</hi>; and was condemned as erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and heretical by Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> XXII. But the charge of Heresie falls much more heavy upon <hi>Ignatius.</hi> For he believed Scripture to be the only Rule of Faith: a Doctrine which passeth among our Adversaries for a rank Heresie. For magnifying the greatness and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity of the Divine Illuminations and Revelations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vitelleschi,</hi> c. 3.</note> and boasting that he received the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christianity not from the ordinary Rule of Faith, but by extraordinary Illumination, he was wont to use these words:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 1.</note> That if the Articles of Faith had never been recorded in the Scriptures (or as another Author <note n="(c)" place="margin">Gloria S. <hi>Ignatii,</hi> c. 3.</note> expresseth it) altho no Monuments or Testimonies of the Christian Religion had remained, he should still have believed them; and that even had the Scriptures been lost, no part of his Faith had been diminished. Which manifestly supposeth him to have believed that the knowledge of the Christian Religion must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be received either from the Scripture, or from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Illumination, and that there was no medium,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:46195:68"/>
which might serve the ends of a Rule of Faith. Besides all this,<note place="margin">Vid. supra.</note> 
               <hi>Ignatius</hi> pretended that in Prayer his Soul acted passively, not actively, and did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but receive the influences of the Spirit; and upon the authority of a personal Apparition,<note place="margin">Gloria <hi>S.

               </note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that the Flesh of the Blessed Virgin was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Eucharist in the Flesh of her Son there substantially present. Now among the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of <hi>Molinos,</hi> condemned last year in the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>Rome,</hi> one is, that in contemplation the Mind acts purely passively, not actively: and one of the pretended Opinions of Signior <hi>Burrhi,</hi>

If <hi>Ignatius</hi> had lived at this time, I do not see how he could have escaped being condemned for an Heretick by the Inquisition.</p>
            <p>It will be no small confirmation of the truth of whatsoever I have hitherto observed or advanced concerning <hi>Ignatius,</hi> if it be proved, that in his life-time he was esteemed an Enthusiast, an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, and a Heretick, by many sober, indifferent, and learned Men of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; if he was censured as such by the publick Tribunals of the Church; and suspicions of this nature often entertained of him by whole multitudes of his Hearers. Saint <hi>Francis</hi> at his first conversion was esteemed to be a Mad-man by his Father, who therefore put him in Chains, and shut him up in a dark Room, to cure his Distemper. His Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Assisium</hi> entertained the same opinion of him, where the Rabble commonly persecuted him
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:46195:69"/>
whensoever he appeared in publick, with stones and dirt,<note place="margin">

His own Brother, far from esteeming his Conversion a work of Heaven, told him it was only the effect of a <hi>melancholy distemper,</hi>

Soon after, he is clapt into the Inquisition a second time, for instilling foolish Principles into his Hearers; and when he removed to <hi>Salamanca,</hi> both he and his Disciples were put in Chains by the Inquisition there, as Hereticks and Seditious Persons; and not absolved, but upon condition of preaching no more.

               <note place="margin">Id. l. 4.</note> 
               <hi>and said, that he who had set it on foot, was a little Spanish Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionary.</hi> Lastly,<note place="margin">Id. l. 5.</note> his Book <hi>of Exercises</hi> was accused of Heresie in <hi>Spain</hi> by the Learned <hi>Melchior Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>; who asserted it to be the work of a Brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick Enthusiast. From this universal contempt of <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his life-time, and frequent suspicions of Heresie, Enthusiasm and Sedition, entertained of him by the Governours of the Church, it may be farther evinced that all the Reports of his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are absolutely false, and either not yet inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or generally disbelieved at that time. For it is not credible that such contempt should attend him, or such suspicions be entertained of him, if he had indeed performed so many and so great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>
            <p>It remains that we examine the truth of these Miracles more particularly by some general Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, which may be framed of them. It might
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:46195:70"/>
indeed be sufficient to oppose to them, what <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>

                  </gap>. Adv. <hi>Hierocl.</hi> prope fin.</note> doth to the Miracles of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> that we are not inclined to believe them: but because our Adversaries are not ashamed to produce them as undoubted arguments of the truth of their Cause, I will oppose some few Considerations to them. And first, it may be enquired, To what purpose should God work so many Miracles in the midst of Christian Countries, many Ages after the Faith had been fully setled in them? Were those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries devoid of true Religion? This is not preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Was the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at that time grievi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously corrupted with Errors and Superstition? This our Adversaries will by no means allow. Or lastly, Did the Evangelical Counsels of Poverty, Absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, Humility and renunciation of the World, which were the grand Topicks of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> want the recommendation of Divine Miracles?<note place="margin">Gloria S. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natii,</hi> cap. 22.</note> This <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> himself would not approve: For he was wont to say, that if Miracles were to be desired of God, they were much rather to be desired in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Precepts, than of the Counsels of the Gospel. It remains therefore that God should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all these Miracles meerly in testimony of the extraordinary Sanctity of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> to manifest his favour to him, and procure to him honour and esteem among all Christians; a Design so unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of God, and contrary to the excellence of his, and imperfection of our Nature, that the very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of it is an unpardonable boldness, and a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest argument of Imposture and immoderate Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; and that even altho we should allow <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> to have been indeed as great a Saint, as the Writers of his Life do represent him. And
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:46195:70"/>
therefore the Author of the <hi>Opus Imperfectum</hi> upon St. <hi>Matthew,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Homil. 49.</note> argueth excellently, that there is no way now left to find out the true Church, or the true Faith, but only the Scripture; that at the first Institution of the Gospel, it was known indeed by Miracles, who were true, and who false Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; since the latter could either perform no Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, or none such as the former did: For the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of true Christians were perfect, and tended ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the use and Interest of the Church, than to procure the admiration of the World; whereas the Miracles of false Christians were imperfect, and of no use, and tended wholly to raise admiration. <hi>By this means true Christians might formerly be discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from false: But now all working of Miracles is cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and is found only among false Christians, among whom Miracles are yet feigned to be wrought; as St.</hi> Peter (<hi>cited by</hi> St. Clement) <hi>assureth us, even the Power of working true Miracles shall be given to Antichrist.</hi> This Passage is so offensive to our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, that it is ordered to be expunged in the <hi>Indices Expurgatorii,</hi> and was accordingly left out in all subsequent Editions, till it was restored by <hi>Fronto Ducoeus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If yet the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will pretend her Miracles to be true and real; we are content, provided she assumeth the title affixed by St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and this Author, to the Workers of true Miracles in latter Ages. If She refuseth the Title, She renounceth her claim to Miracles. But the Temptation of lying and feigning Miracles for the Reputation of an Order, is in that Church far more perswasive than the evidence of Reason. A Catalogue of Miracles is as necessary to a <hi>Romish</hi>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:46195:71"/>
Saint, as a list of wonderful Cures is to a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebank; no Canonization can be obtained without them. When <hi>Ignatius</hi> therefore was to be promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the dignity of a Saint, his Disciples set their Inventions on the rack, to raise a Fund of Miracles; every flying Report was taken up, and every Old womans Tale advanced into a Miracle: and the most Illustrious wonders of his Life then first feigned without any ground. This the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Order required, to which all conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Truth and Honesty were betrayed, that so the Founders of it might be rendred no less Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious, than those of other more Ancient Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by an equal number of Miracles and Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies.<note place="margin">Cap. 23.</note>

               <hi>One of the Plurisie,</hi> &amp;c. That the far greatest part of these Miracles were feigned many years after his Death, we have just reason to suspect; for when <hi>Ribadeneira,</hi> who was his familiar Companion, first published his Life, in the Year 1572. he made a long Apology in it, in defence of <hi>Ignatius</hi>; maintaining that it was no way derogatory to his Sanctity, that he had performed no Miracles: Afterwards in the Year 1610, publishing a second Edition of his Life, he was so far enlightned in this matter, that he giveth to us a long Catalogue of the Miracles of <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> but withal confesseth, That the Reason why
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:46195:71"/>
he had not inserted them in the first Edition,<note place="margin">Utpote haud satis certa &amp; explorata.</note> was because they were not then sufficiently certain and uncontested. Now it cannot be imagined, how the Miracles of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who died in the Year 1556, should be unknown, or at least uncertain, Sixteen years after, when the Memory of them was yet fresh, if any such indeed there were; and after Fifty four Years, when the greatest part of the Witnesses must be supposed to have been dead, should be advanced to undoubted Certainty? In like manner, <hi>Maffeius</hi> writing the Life of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> in the Year 1605, when his Canonization was not yet thought on, relates very few Miracles per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by him;<note place="margin">Haud satis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorata sunt. L. 3. c. 14. in fine.</note> and concludes in these words, <hi>Beside these, many other wonderful actions are related of</hi> Ignatius, <hi>which because they are not sufficiently certain, I thought not fit to insert; especially, since the holiness of famous men consists not so much in Signs and Miracles, as in the Love of God, and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of Life.</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Prefat.</note> And after all, <hi>Bussieres</hi> confesseth, That many wonderful things related of <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his Life, written by <hi>Nierembergius,</hi> are by no means testified with incontestable Proofs; and that we may justly doubt of the Truth of them: But however <hi>Ribadeneira</hi> and <hi>Maffeius</hi> knew very few Miracles of <hi>Ignatius</hi>; later Writers had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Information of them. At the Examination preceding his Canonization, in the Year 1609, <hi>Bouhours</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">Lib. 6.</note> tells us, That 660 (<hi>Bussieres</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 5.</note> 665) Witnesses, juridically interrogated, deposed concerning the Holiness of his Life; and that 200 Miracles well attested, were produced at the same time; altho <hi>Vitelleschi</hi> 
               <note n="(c)" place="margin">Cap. 23, 24.</note> assures us, That 13 Years after, at his Canonization, no more than
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:46195:72"/>
140 Miracles could be heard of, when he saith that 175 Witnesses were examined by order of <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> XV. Two or three years after <hi>Vitelleschi,</hi> comes out the <hi>Glory of Ignatius</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 16, 17, 7.</note>, which enlargeth the number of the Miracles to above 200. and the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses to 675. Now even altho we should take the lesser Account, it is utterly incredible, that so many Witnesses of the Miracles and Holiness of <hi>Ignatius</hi> should be alive in the year 1622. 66 years after his Death. If it be a merit to believe Contradictions in Faith, it is none to believe lies in History. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of St. <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Apollonius,</hi> labour with the same difficulties; for to mention no more of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> than the Miracle of the Five Wounds of Christ imprinted in his Body, which however <hi>Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,</hi> proposeth it as a thing past all dispute, and attested by Infinite Multitudes of Spectators; it is certain, that presently after his Death, Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> IX. would not believe one word of it;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bonavent.</hi> c. 15.</note> inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as the poor Saint was forced to appear to him in the Night, and draw a whole Porringer of Blood out of the Wound in his side, to convince him of the Truth of it.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Philostrat.</hi> l. 1. c. 3.</note> As for <hi>Apollonius, Moeragenes,</hi> who was Contemporary to him, and writ his Life immediately after his Decease, knew little of his Miracles; <hi>Philostratus</hi> comes a hundred years after, and giveth a large Legend of them; altho at last, he confesseth himself to be so far ignorant of his Actions, that he knows not whether he died Eighty, Ninety,<note place="margin">Id. l. 8. c. 12.</note> or an hundred years old, and by what kind of Death. <hi>Philostratus</hi> himself pretends no more than one Person to have been raised from the Dead by <hi>Apollonius</hi>;<note place="margin">L. 4. c. 16.</note> and even relates that so doubtfully, that he delivers it as his own Opinion, that the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:46195:72"/>
Person was not really dead. An hundred years after him,<note place="margin">In Aureliano Caes.</note> 
               <hi>Vopiscus</hi> doubted not confidently to assert, that <hi>Apollonius</hi> raised to life many dead Persons. But Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles may so easily be obtruded upon the World, after a long distance of time, and are so securely received by the credulous Multitude, that nothing less than a strict Examination can defeat the hopes of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, and confute the Lies of their devoted Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</p>
            <p>If all the Miracles of <hi>Ignatius</hi> in general, want a sufficient Attestation, much less will those deserve our Belief, the Truth of which was never attested by any Spectators, but depends upon his own sole Credit and Authority; and that, not only because it is unreasonable to believe a Person witnessing in his own Cause; but chiefly, because it is foolish to imagine that God should concur with <hi>Ignatius,</hi> to work Miracles in secret, which could tend to no other end, than to foment his vain glory by increasing in him an Opinion of his own Merits. Yet if we examine his Miracles, we shall find ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them attested by his own sole Authority. All his Illuminations and Visions were of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; of which none could be conscious besides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. When in his Journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> he stept alone into a little ruinous Chappel, and there enjoyed that wonderful Vision of the two first Persons of the Trinity,<note place="margin">Cap. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Vitelleschi</hi> tells us, that he was envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with a great brightness. This could depend only upon his own Testimony; as also the hover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a flame of Fire over his Head, like the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven fiery Tongues of the Apostles, while he writ the Constitutions of his Order in his private Chamber; and indeed,<note place="margin">Lib. 3.</note>

of this Miracle, but only saith it appears from a Paper-Book, writ with his own Hand. His driving away Devils from an haunted Chamber, and producing a light in his Chamber, when he had commanded the Candle to be carried away, which we before mentioned, are of the same nature. Thus St. <hi>Francis,</hi> while he prayed alone in Woods, or solitary Places, was wont to be raised from the Ground, and continue in that pendulous Posture, environed with a bright Cloud.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bonavent.</hi> c. 10.</note> His five Wounds in the likeness of Christ's, he received in secret, and would never shew them to any but his own Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. St. <hi>Mary Magdalen Pazzi,</hi> was yet more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to prevent any discovery of her Imposture.<note place="margin">Id. cap. 14.</note> She pretended to have the five Wounds of Christ engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in her Heart. It is more than probable, that if her Heart had been opened, they would have disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and must have been searched for in her disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Brain.</p>
            <p>It would be no less irrational blindly to believe those Miracles of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> which are delivered to us upon the Testimony of one single Witness; who possessed perhaps with a vast Opinion of his San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, fancied somewhat extraordinary to be in all his Actions, and mistook every Motion for a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, to which himself could not assign a Cause. Not to say, That in some Persons the Vanity of lying and spreading wonderful Reports, surmounts all considerations of Shame and moral Honesty. That he was often raised from the Ground in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and continued in that pendulous Posture in the Air, is delivered to us upon the sole Authority of <hi>Iohn Pascal,</hi> a poor ignorant Youth, his Chamber-fellow at <hi>Barcelona</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 2.</note> who thought sometimes, that
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:46195:74"/>
he saw him elevated from the Ground, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Light, when he arose in the Night to pray. The Widow and Children of this <hi>Pascall</hi> deposed upon Oath,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vitelleschi,</hi> cap. 7.</note> that they had heard their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Father say, that he had often seen <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> in an Extasy, environed with Light, raised from the Ground five or six Yards high. This was admitted as an undoubted Testimony, and most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain proof of a prodigious Miracle;<note place="margin">Cubiculo sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per usus est perangusto humili, longo 29. lato 14. alto 10. Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis. Gloria S. <hi>Ignatii,</hi> c. 10.</note> altho, if we remember that <hi>Pascall's</hi> house was a poor Cottage, and that another Author assures us, that he always lodged in a low Chamber, which could not admit any such Elevation of his Body; we shall have great reason to suspect the Miracle. However it is irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to imagine God the Author of so unuseful a Miracle, which could tend only to make the foolish Saint believe that God heard him better hanging in the Air, than kneeling on the Ground. That Miracle was more notorious, which <hi>Lucian</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">De Dea Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</note> assures us, he saw publickly performed in the Temple of <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> of the Image of <hi>Apollo,</hi> hanging for some while, and caried about in the Air; yet must we ascribe it to any thing else, rather than the Divine Omnipotence. The same <hi>Pascall</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to great Necessity after the Death of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and imploring his Assistance one morning in a Church,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 6.</note> heard a melodious sound, and saw <hi>Ignatius</hi> appearing attended with a beautiful train of young Clergymen. After a while, the Canons enter to sing <hi>Mattins,</hi> see no Apparition, but find <hi>Pascall</hi> transported into an Extasy with the Imagination of it. The frequent Splendor and supernatural Brightness of his Face is no better attested.<note place="margin">Gloria S. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natii,</hi> c. 6.</note>

while standing amidst a croud of People, he heard Sermons in the Church; altho no other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son present could perceive any such thing. In <hi>Spain,</hi> two Women of his Kindred peeping through the Keyhole, while he prayed, <hi>saw his Countenance enflamed, as with a Fever; for it shined with such a Light, that it dazled their Eyes.</hi>

                  <hi>Bouhours,</hi> l. 3.</note> Being once at the point of Death, as he expected Extreme Unction, his Health was miraculously restored to him. <hi>Vitelleschi</hi>

This consideration also defeats the credit of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of <hi>Apollonius</hi> his Miracles, being known only to his confident <hi>Damis</hi>; with whom being chained in Prison, he drew his Leg out of the Chain, and shewing it unchained to <hi>Damis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Philostratus,</hi> l. 7. c. 16.</note> immediately put it in again; by which Miracle he was first convinced, that somewhat Divine, and more than Human, was in <hi>Apollonius.</hi> The Miraculous Splendor of his Face, was better attested, if we may believe <hi>Philostratus</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">L. 7. c. 13.</note>, for while he was led to the Tribunal of <hi>Domitian,</hi> the whole People of <hi>Rome</hi> saw and admired it. This also ruins the Authority of St. <hi>Francis</hi>'s Miracles, the far greater part of which were performed by him after his Death, in Apparitions to sick Persons; Apparitions which are owing only to the disturbed Imagination of the foolish Votaries,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid. Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</hi>
               </note> first desiring his assistance, and then fancying him to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
            <p>Such Miracles as these have nothing extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in them, and are fitted only to amuse the ignorant part of Mankind, who not knowing their natural cause, recur to the Divine Power. Many
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:46195:75"/>
Miracles of <hi>Ignatius</hi> lay open to the same Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and may be rationally solved without any deep Philosophy. All his Apparitions after death, and Cures of sick Persons making their applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him, and other like Miracles, which fill up the far greater part of his Legend, are of this nature. The former may be ascribed to the whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies and vapours of a disturbed Brain; the latter to the effect of Chance, altho even the strength of imagination may not a little concur to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the effect. If among a thousand Persons, which implore the assistance of <hi>Ignatius</hi> in any sickness, danger, or undertaking, one hundred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, escape, or obtain their desire; a blind Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity shall ascribe the whole event to the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Power, and wonderful Benignity of the Saint; altho in all appearance the Invocation of <hi>Aesculapius, Mahomet,</hi> or <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> had produced the same effect. As for the remaining nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred which obtain not the grant of their Petitions; their unhappiness shall be ascribed to their want of Faith, to the coldness of their Devotion, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to the multiplicity of business wherein the Saint was then engaged. Thus Miracles can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be wanting to a <hi>Romish</hi> Saint, when once the People are perswaded to offer up their Petitions to him Many even of the most illustrious Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles performed by <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his life-time, may be resolved into the same cause; and when examined, will be found to have nothing worthy admiration in them. I will instance but in one, the raising of a man from the dead at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> which all the Writers of his Life magnify as a great Miracle. The case was this. A Man had hung himself in
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:46195:76"/>
the House where <hi>Ignatius</hi> lodged. <hi>Ignatius</hi> comes hastily into the Chamber, and cuts the Rope. The Man revives, but had already so far weakned the union of Soul and Body, that his life could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued no longer, than while he confessed, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his Soul to God. Here is nothing extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary in all this; but only an impertinent Story magnified and exalted into a Miracle in imitation of those frequent Fables of Legends, which to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandize the Power of Priests, represent them saving the Souls of Men by some pretty Artifice perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in a minute, without any concurrence of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and sometimes even against their wills. Thus Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> by one short Prayer translated the Soul of <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperor from Hell to Heaven; and St. <hi>Dunstan</hi> did the same kindness to King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> when they least thought of it.<note place="margin">

            <p>There are other Miracles ascribed to <hi>Ignatius,</hi> which may be evidently convinced of falsehood and forgery; and if this Charge be once proved, the credit and authority of all his other Miracles is intirely overthrown.

            <p>Miracles including such contradictions, as that one individual Body can exist in two distant places at the same time, ought in no case to be believed; but there are others, which however implying no contradiction, include somewhat monstrous in them, and carry such an air of incredibility, that nothing less than the utmost evidence of sense can induce the mind to assent to them. The Miracles of Christ and the Apostles were indeed beyond the ordinary power of Nature; but yet were not so extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly stupendious, as might affright no less than perswade Mankind. But the Legendary Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> while they calculated their

Miracles, not for the benefit of the Church, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the World, but the honour and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their Saint, scorned to stoop at ordinary Prodigies, or take measures from the more sober Miracles of the first Founders of Christianity.

It were too tedious to reckon up all the fabulous Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies ascribed to <hi>Ignatius</hi>; how many Miracles were performed by his Name written in a piece of Paper; How many Legions of Devils were driven away by his Staff, and Cures performed by the parings of his Nails. But that Miracle is more especially observable, which he acted at his last return into his own Country.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vitelleschi,</hi> c. 12.</note> Preaching there in Field-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles, surrounded with a great Auditory, his Voice, tho naturally very low, and weakned with many Diseases and Infirmities, was heard distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly above a Quarter of a Mile round. In framing of Miracles for the Reputation of an Order, it seems dishonourable to Copy out from one another. No greater Curse can befal an Order, than not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent some Miracles more Stupendious, than any pretended to by other Orders. Yet in this case of Preaching, the <hi>Dominicans</hi> have been so success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in their Miracles, that they have left no room for future Invention. They tell us, that <hi>Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Ferrerius</hi> of their Order, preaching to People of many Nations, and different Languages at once,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:46195:80"/>
was understood by all at the same time, as well as if every one had heard him Preaching in their own Language. This was so high a flight, that it must be a very fruitful Invention which can exceed it. The Jesuits therefore at least, to offer somewhat in Comparison to it, have represented <hi>Ignatius</hi> dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Voice in Preaching beyond the ordinary Power of Nature; and when they were conscious that this was too mean a flight, have ascribed to <hi>Xaverius</hi> the gift of Tongues; a Miracle in their esteem so great and unexceptionable, that of late it hath been thought worthy to be produced and employed in the Conversion of <hi>English</hi> Hereticks.<note place="margin">Epist. ad so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales. inter Epist ex India select. l. 1.

               </note> But see the unhappiness of the Project.

            <p>Lastly, There are some Miracles so foolish and unuseful, and performed upon such frivolous occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, that the proposal of them would deserve our Indignation, rather than belief; such as are injurious to the Honour of God, and repugnant to his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and look rather like the effects of Vanity, or a trifling petulant Humor, than the Works of Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscience; as if God would condescend to exert his

Omnipotence in Trifles, and give sport to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. It would be unworthy his infinite Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to violate the ordinary course of Nature, for any other than great and noble Ends, or to prostitute his Power of working Miracles to the Whimsies an Capricio's of every petty Devoto.

When St. <hi>Francis</hi> one Night earnestly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to hear some Musick,<note place="margin">

               <hi>not only in his Imagination, but with his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ears, most sweet Lessons of the heavenly Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick.</hi> And when his Body was exposed after Death,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vitelleschi,</hi> c. 19. <hi>Ribad.</hi> c. 21.</note> divers Stars were seen upon his Sepulchre, and a very harmonious Concert of Musick was heard about it, for two whole days together. But St.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:46195:81"/>
               <hi>Dunstan</hi> was more modest in procuring to himself this miraculous Musick.<note place="margin">Capgrave Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genda Nova, <hi>London,</hi> 1516. fol. 89.</note> He scorned to put the Angels to any trouble; and therefore his Harp usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally played of its own accord, as it hung upon the Wall.</p>
            <p>Such are the Miracles, which in former Ages advanced the Doctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and at this day continue to be none of the least Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of their truth to credulous and injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Persons. Upon these is founded the honour of their Saints; and upon their truth depends one of the most glorious Notes of their Church. From the Miracles of Saint <hi>Francis</hi> alone, <hi>Surius</hi> pretends,<note place="margin">Not. ad <hi>Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</hi> Vit. S. <hi>Francisci</hi> ad IV. Octob.</note> that, <hi>whatsoever Hereticks may prate, it is abundantly proved, that the departed Saints know our Concerns on Earth, and hear our Petitions.</hi> Thus the Controversie of the <hi>Invocation of Saints</hi> is decided. Add to this the Visions of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and devotion of Saint <hi>Francis</hi>'s Lamb, and <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation</hi> will be irrefragably demonstrated: and so in all other Articles peculiar to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> Miracles will not be wanting to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate their truth. And indeed Miracles are now become the only refuge to which our Adversaries can recur, when Reason and Learning runs so low among them, and their Arguments have been so often baffled. But by an unhappy incredulity we are no more inclined to believe their Miracles, than Doctrines; the latter we imagine to be false, but the former both false and foolish. It remains therefore that we receive a conviction of the truth of the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, as <hi>Ignatius</hi> did, by super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Illumination, and extraordinary Impulse,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:46195:82"/>
which may be hoped for, when God shall lose his Attribute of Immutability, and Christianity cease to be Rational. But to pass by that; From what hath been hitherto said, it appears that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is in the highest degree guilty of Enthusiasm; and that <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and (whom he imitated) Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> were the greatest and most foolish Enthusiasts of any Age; Persons so far un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the Glories of Heaven, and Society of Angels, that they deserved rather to be excluded from the number of rational Beings, and upon that account be placed one degree beneath Fools and Madmen. Yet to these are publick Prayers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> Festivals celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Churches dedicated, and Vows directed; and as if all this were not sufficient, God must be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to save us through their Merits. Thus <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naventure</hi> concludes the Life of Saint <hi>Francis</hi> in these words.<note place="margin">Fol. 266.</note> 
               <hi>May Iesus Christ bring us unto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Merits of his Servant</hi> Francis: and the Golden Legend thus. <hi>Let us pray to Saint</hi> Francis <hi>that he would aid and assist us, that by his Merits we may come to everlasting life.</hi>

Attribute, By whom also he made the World.</hi> This was spoken of <hi>Ignatius</hi> before he was yet Canonized. I know not whether his Canonization qualified him to receive that Attribute; but I am sure it excused not his Memory from the just imputation of Folly and Enthusiasm, nor the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from the Charge of a most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable Fanaticism in celebrating his Memory, and applauding his Folly.</p>
