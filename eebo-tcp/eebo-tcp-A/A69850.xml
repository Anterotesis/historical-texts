         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In the Commons House of

               <salute>Mr. Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Esterday the affaires of this House
did borrow all the time allotted
to the great Committee of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
I am sorry, that having
but halfe a day in a whole weeke,
we have lost that.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> The sufferances that we have
undergone, are reduceable to two heads: the
First concernes the Church. The second be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the Common-wealth. The first of
these must have the first fruits of this <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,</hi>
as being the first in weight and worth,
and more immediate to the honour of <hi>God,</hi>
and his glory, every dram whereof is worth
the whole weight of a Kingdome.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:44116:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The Common-wealth ('tis true) is full of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
dangers; the Sword is come home unto
us, and the two twind Nations united to each
other under one Royall head, breathing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the bowells and bosome of the same
Island; &amp; which is above all, imbounded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the same Religion (I say the same
Religion) by a devilish Machination, like to
be fatally imbrued in each others blood; ready
to digge each others grave, <hi>Quantillum abfuit!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For other grievances also, the poore dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned
Subject sadly groanes, not able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
between Power and Law, and with a
weeping heart (no question) hath prayed for
this houre, in hope to be Relieved, and to
know herafter whether any thing he hath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
his poor part and portion of the common
ayre he breathes in, may be truly cal'd his own.</p>
            <p>This (Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi>) and many other, do deserve,
and must shortly have our deep regard, but <hi>suo
gradu,</hi> not in the first place. There is a <hi>unum
necessarium,</hi> above all our worldly sufferings
and dangers; <hi>Religion,</hi> the most immediate
service due unto the honour of Almighty
<hi>God:</hi> and herein let us all be confident, that
all our Consultations will prove unprosper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
if we put any determination before that
of Religion. For my part, let the Sword reach
from the North to the South, and a generall
perdition of all our remaining Rights and
safety threatning us in open view, it shall be so
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44116:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
farre from making me to decline the first set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling
of Religion, that I shall ever argue, and
rather conclude it thus, That the more great,
the more eminent our perills of this world
are, the stronger, the quicker ought our care to
be for the glory of <hi>God,</hi> and the pure Law of
our soules.</p>
            <p>If then Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> it may passe with full
allowance, that all our cares may give way to
the Treaty of Religion, I will reduce that
also to be considered under two heads:</p>
            <p>First of Ecclesiasticall Persons.</p>
            <p>Secondly, of Ecclesiasticall Causes.</p>
            <p>Let no man start, or be affrighted at the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
length of this Consultation: it will not,
it cannot take up so much time as it is worth.</p>
            <p>This is <hi>God</hi> and the King; this is <hi>God</hi> and
the Kingdomes; nay, this is <hi>God</hi> and the two
Kingdomes Cause: And therfore Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi>
my humble Motion is, that we may all of us
seriously, speedily, and heartily enter upon
this the best, the greatest, the most important
Cause we can treat of. Now Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> in
pursuit of my own Motion, and to make a little
entrance into this great affayre, I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to you the Petition of a poore opressed
Minister, in the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
in his practise, Orthodoxe in his
Doctrine, laborious in the Ministry, as any we
have, or I do know. He is now a sufferer (as all
good men are) under the generall obloquie of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44116:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a Puritan, as with other things, was admirably
delivered by that silver Trumpet<note n="*" place="margin">Sir Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yerd.</note> neare the
Barre. The Pursevant watcheth his door, and
divides him and his Cure asunder, to both their
griefs: For it is not with him, as perhaps with
some that set the Pursevant at worke, glad of
an excuse to be out of the Pulpit: it is his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to preach. About a week since I went o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to <hi>Lambeth</hi> to move that great Bishop (too
great indeed) to take this danger off this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
and to recall the Pursevant; and withall
I did undertake for Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> (so your Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner
is called) that he should answer his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers
in any of the Kings Courts at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi>
The Bishop gave me this Answere (as
neere as I can remember) <hi>in haec verba,</hi> I am
sure that he will not be absent himselfe from
his Cure a twelvemoneth together, and then
I doubt not but once in a yeare we shall have
him. This was all I could obtaine: but I hope
by the help of this House, before the yeare of
threats be run out, his Grace will either have
more grace, or no grace at all.</p>
            <p>For our manifold griefs doth fill a mighty,
a vast circumference, yet so that from every
part, our lynes of sorrow doe leade to him, and
poynt at him, the Centre from whence our
Miseries grow.</p>
            <p>Let the Petition be read, and let us enter
upon the worke.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Mr. Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU have many private particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Petitions, give me leave by
word of mouth to interpose one
more generall, which thus you
may record: <hi>Gods</hi> true Religion
is violently invaded by two seeming Enemies,
but indeed they are like <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> fast
Friends, for the destruction of Truth, I mean
the Papists for one part, and our Prelaticall
Faction on the other: between those two in
their severall progresse, I observe the occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of some few parallells, fit as I conceive
to be presented to this Honourable House.</p>
            <p>First with the Papists, here is a severe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition,
and with us (as it is used) there is a
bitter high Commission, both these (<hi>contra
fas &amp; jus</hi>) are Judges in their owne Cause:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44116:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yet herein their Inquisitors are better then
our High Commissioners. They for ought I
ever heard, do not <hi>saevire in suos,</hi> punish for
delinquents and offenders, such as professe and
practise Religion, according as it is establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
by the Laws of the Land, where they
live: but with us how many poore distressed
Ministers we have; how many scores of them
in a few yeares past have been suspended, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived,
degraded, excommunicated, not guilty
of the breach of any of our established Laws.
The Petitions of many are here with us, more
are coming; all their prayers are in Heaven
for redresse. Down with the Tables of these
Money-Changers: they doe professe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation
of pennance, and I may therfore
justly call them so.</p>
            <p>Secondly, with the Papists there is a myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Artifice, I meane their <hi>Index expurgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
whereby they clip the tongues of such
Witnesses, whose evidence they doe not like:
To this I parallell our late Imprimators Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences
for the Presse, so handled, that Truth
is supprest, and Popish Pamphlets fly abroad
<hi>Cum Privilegio,</hi> witnesse the andacious Libells.
against true Religion, written by <hi>Cosi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, Daw,
Heylin, Pecklington, Mede, Shelford, Swan, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts,</hi>
and many others; I name no Bishops:
but I adde, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay they are already grown
so bold in this new trade, that the most learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
labours of our ancient and best Divines,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44116:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
must he new corrected and defaced with a
Deleatur, by the supercillious pen of my
Lords young Chaplein (fit perhaps) for the
technicall art, but unfit to hold the Chaire
for Divinity. But herein the Roman Index is
better then our English Licences; they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
doe preserve the current of their owne
established doctrines, a point of Wisdome.
But with us, our Innovators by this Artifice
doe alter our settled Doctrines: nay, they do
introduce points repugnant, and contrariant;
and this I dare assume upon my selfe to prove.</p>
            <p>3. One parallell more I have, and that is
thus, amongst the Papists there is one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
Supreme in Honour, in Order,
and in Power, from whose judgement there is
no appeale.</p>
            <p>I confesse Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I cannot altogether
match a Pope with a Pope; yet one of the
ancient titles of our English Primate was <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terius
orbis Papa:</hi> But thus farre I can goe <hi>ex
ore suo,</hi> it is in Print. He pleads faire for a
Patriarch, and for such an one whose judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he beforehand professeth ought to be
finall; and then I am sure it ought to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring;
put thefe two together, and ye shall
find that the finall determination of a Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch,
will want very little of a Pope, and then
we may say <hi>mutato nominede te fabula narratur:</hi>
he pleaded Pope ship under the name of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch,
and I much feare least the end and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44116:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
top of his Patriarchall plea may be as that of
Cardinall <hi>Poole</hi> (his Predecessors) who would
have two heads, one <hi>caput regale,</hi> another <hi>caput
Sacerdotale,</hi> a proud parallell, to set up the
Mitre as high as the Crown. But herein I
shall be free and cleere, if one there must be;
be it a Pope, be it a Patriarchall, this I resolve
upon for mine own choyce, <hi>procul à Iove,
procul à fulmine,</hi> I had rather serve one as farre
off as <hi>Tiben,</hi> then to have one come so near me
as the Thames. A Pope at <hi>Rome</hi> will doe lesse
hurt then a <hi>Patriarch</hi> at <hi>Lambeth:</hi> I have
done. And for this third parallell, I submit it
to the wisdome and consideration of this
grave Committee for Religion: In the mean
time I doe ground my motion on the former
two; and it is this in briefe, that you will
please to select a Subcommittee of 4, 6, 8, or
10. at the most, and to impower them for the
discovery of the great number of oppressed
Ministers, under the Bishops tyranny: For
these 10. yeares last past, We have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of some, but more are silent, some are
patient and will not complaine; others are
fearefull and dare not; many are dead; many
are beyond Seas, and cannot complain.</p>
            <p>And in the second place that the Subcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
may examine the Printers, what Books
by bad Licences have bin corruptly issued
forth: the worke I conceive will not be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
but will quickly return into your hands
full of weight; and this is my motion.</p>

Cannons, and the former; and
of that which the Clergy have
miscalled a benevolence, I shall
for the present, onely touch the
first of them, and that is the Roman Velites,
who did use to begin the Battayle: so shall I
but <hi>velita<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>de,</hi> and skirmish, whilst the mayne
Battayle is setting forwards.</p>
            <p>The POPE, as they say, hath a triple
Crowne, answerable thereunto; and to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it, he pretendeth to have a threefold
Law.</p>
            <p>1. The first that is <hi>Ius divinum,</hi> Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44116:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by Divine Right: and this he would have
you thinke to be the Crowne next his head,
which doth circle and secure his power, our
Bishops have in an unlucky time entred their
Plea, and presented their title to this Crown,
Episcopacy, by <hi>Divine Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The second is <hi>Ius humanum Constantij
donativum,</hi> the guift of Indulgent Princes tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
power; this Law belongs to his mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
or second Crowne, this is already plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for, by our Prelates in Print.</p>
            <p>These two Crownes being already obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
(He the POPE) Creates and makes the
third himselfe, and sets it highest upon the
top: This Crowne also hath its Law, and
that is <hi>Ius canonicum,</hi> the Canon Law of
more use un to his Popeship, if once admitted
then both the other. Just so our Prelates
from the pretended Divinity of their Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy,
and from the temporall power, gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by our Princes, would now oberude a
new Common Law upon us: They have char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the <hi>Commons</hi> to the full, and never feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they would requoyle into a <hi>Parliament,</hi>
they have rammed a prodigious ungodly
Oath into them. The Illegality, and Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
of these Cannons, is manifested by one
short question, (<hi>vizt.</hi>) what do you call the
meeting wherein they were made?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Speaker,</hi> who can frame an Argument
aright, unlesse he can tell against what he is
to argue?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:44116:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Will you confute the Convocation-house?
they were a holy Synod: will you argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their Synod? they were Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
will you dispute their Commission? they
will mingle all power together, and perhaps
answer, they were something else that we
neither knew, nor imagined, unlesse they
would unriddle themselves, and owne what
they were, we may prosecute non conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Arguments.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I have conferred with some
of the founders of those Cannons, but I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
here, that I could never yet meet with
any one of that Assembly, who could well
answere to that first question of the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme,
<hi>What is your name?</hi> Alas, they were
parted before they knew what they were,
when they were together.</p>
            <p>The summe of all the severall answers that
I have received, do altogether amount unto
this: They were a Convocationall, Synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Assembly of Commissioners: Indeed
a threefold Chaemera, a Monster to our Laws,
a Cerberus to our Religion. A strange Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
where no Commissioners name is to
be found! A strange Convocation, that lived
when the <hi>Parliament</hi> was dead. A strange
holy Synod, when the one part never saw nor
conferred with the other.</p>
            <p>But indeed, there needed no conference,
if it be true of these Cannons which I read of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44116:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the former, <hi>quis nescit, Canones Lambe thae for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mari
priusquam in Synodo ventilentur?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> they have Innovated
upon us; we may say, It is <hi>Lextalionis</hi> to inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
upon them, and so I hope we shortly
shall doe.</p>
            <p>In the meane time my humble motion is,
that every member of that Assembly, who
voted their Canons, may come severally to
the Barre of this House, with a Booke of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
in his hand, and there unlesse he can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
that Catechisme question, as I called
it, better then I expect he can, <hi>concept is verbis,</hi>
in such expresse termes as this Honourable
House shall then think fit, he shall abjure his
owne Issue, and be commanded to give fire to
his owne Cannons.</p>
            <p>And this motion I take to be Just.</p>
