            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But 'tis unjuſt to debar Readers of that tickling delight they take in finding faults, it being often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times all the conſideration they have for laying out their Money. The <hi>Statio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> humour and mine agree, Let them but <hi>buy</hi> the Book, and then (being their own) uſe it as they pleaſe. I ſhall not therefore waſte time, either in <hi>Courting</hi> or <hi>Huffing</hi> the Reader, (for
<pb facs="tcp:99114:5"/>
both wayes are now commonly uſed to ſurprize his good opinion,) but only endeavour to give an Impartial Account of the <hi>Author,</hi> and <hi>Deſign</hi> of the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>To ſay much of the <hi>noble Agrippa,</hi> were to put an Affront on the Reader, (if he pretend at all to traffick in the Commonwealth of Learning) by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing him a <hi>ſtranger</hi> to that Man, who was juſtly admir'd as the <hi>Prodigy</hi> of his Age, for all kind of Science. That vaſt <hi>progreſs</hi> he made, <hi>Tam Marte quam Mercurio,</hi> in <hi>Arms</hi> no leſs than <hi>Arts</hi>; the Titles and Honours he acquir'd; the reſpect paid him by moſt of the Grandees, and famous Men, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries; and thoſe <hi>Monuments of Learning,</hi> wherewith he hath oblig'd Poſterity; all ſpeak him a Perſon above the ordinary <hi>level</hi> of Mankind; to be rankt only amongſt thoſe few noble <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes</hi>;</p>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99114:5"/>'Tis true, (like all great Wits) he took no little pleaſure in <hi>ſtemming</hi> the impetuous Tide of popular opinion, as if nothing had been impregnable againſt the puiſſance of his parts.

               <hi>Onſet,</hi> to prove in particular, what <hi>Solomon</hi> was content to affirm in the lump, <hi>That all things are Vanity</hi>; and with an exceſs of <hi>Gallantry</hi> undertook ſingly to <hi>duel</hi> all Arts and Sciences.</p>
            <p>Nor was this preſent <hi>Eſſay</hi> any other than a <hi>ſally</hi> of the ſame <hi>Generoſity,</hi> that delights to engage on diſadvantages, and bravely to aſſiſt the weaker party. After ſo many ſlanderers (like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull Mules, turning their brutiſh heels to kick thoſe Paps whence they receiv'd their firſt Nutriment) had dipt their keen Pens in Gall, and fill'd their black Mouthes with Calumnies, to ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Repute of this <hi>fair Sex,</hi> our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was <hi>too noble,</hi> not to think himſelf concern'd in its <hi>Vindication</hi>; Common Juſtice, no leſs than point of <hi>Honour,</hi> obliging all to ſuccour oppreſſed Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.

enters the Liſts, to aſſert the <hi>Honour</hi> of the Female Party, againſt the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited obloquies of the Male, which he chooſes to attempt, not after the low, timerous method of an Apology, the ſhallow Invectives of the Adverſaries being unworthy the refute of his Pen; but like a <hi>politick General,</hi> carrying the War into the enemies Countrey, <hi>ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles</hi> them with an expected Invaſion, and lets them know this noble Sex ought to be the object of their <hi>venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> not <hi>contempt,</hi> being in all reſpects their ſuperiour.</p>
            <p>How prudently this Deſign was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, or how well perform'd, I ſhall not fore-ſtall the Readers opinion, ſo far as to determine; but muſt confeſs my ſelf pleaſ'd with that Diverſion I met with in reading the <hi>Original</hi>; and thereupon to have attempted the <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation,</hi> not without ſome Additions, and variation, to render it more ſmooth and gratefull to the preſent Age, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I could ſcarce better <hi>devote</hi> my va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant hours, than to the ſervice of that <hi>ſweet Sex,</hi> which every one deſerving

            <p>Thus were Women, by thoſe anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Princes of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and the valiant <hi>Romans,</hi> from the very infancy of their Empire, treated with all kind of reſpect and honour; and to this day, by how much each Nation is more <hi>civiliz'd,</hi> and refin'd from Barbariſm, ſo much greater liberty and honour do Women there enjoy.

All things that are <hi>neceſſary</hi> for Man, are <hi>good; food</hi> is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> it is <hi>good</hi>; Apparel <hi>neceſſary,</hi> it is <hi>good</hi>; the Fire, the Air, the Earth, the Water <hi>neceſſary,</hi> they are <hi>good</hi>; Women <hi>neceſſary,</hi> therefore <hi>good.</hi> For elſe if we ſuppoſe God hath bound Man in ſo <hi>hard</hi> a Condition, that ſome things are <hi>neceſſary</hi> for him, yet <hi>evil,</hi> we both <hi>impair</hi> the wiſdome of God, and <hi>detract</hi> from his goodneſs.</p>
            <p>To conclude: If Woman be ſo <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> for Man, and he of himſelf ſo <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>impotent,</hi> that he could not even in <hi>Paradiſe</hi> live without her; If <hi>Abraham</hi> the <hi>friend</hi> of God be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, by no leſs Authority than the voice of Heaven, to <hi>hear</hi> his Wife <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah whatſoever</hi> ſhe ſhould ſay to him; If <hi>Nature</hi> have ſo illuſtriouſly markt out Women for the moſt <hi>excellent</hi> of all Creatures, and crown'd them moſt prodigally with the choiceſt of her or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments; Since they in no reſpect come ſhort of the moſt celebrated <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes,</hi> and that their Names and gallant Actions have <hi>ſwell'd</hi> the Records of Fame, and ſtand <hi>Regiſtred</hi> there with

            </p>
            <p>Thus have we <hi>endeavoured</hi> to ſhew the <hi>Pre-eminence</hi> of the Female Sex, from the <hi>name, order, place,</hi> and <hi>matter</hi> of Creation; and what <hi>Dignity</hi> bounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Heaven hath vouchſaft thereto above the Male.
