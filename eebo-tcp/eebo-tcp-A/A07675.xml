            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For he vvas most constantly affected alvvayes to the French Nation and crovvne, next after the duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obedience vvhich he ought to his ovvne natural Lord and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne. And this his affection did he manifest in all occasions, but especiallie in the treatie of the happie mariage of your highnes, vvith the King our soueraigne Lord and maister; Assembling

            <p>This being the affection of the author of this treatise I should much vvronge his memorie, if these labours of his should be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred to the patronage of anie other then of your roiall Maiestie.

that it is now very hardly to be found; though some haue seene it of late.

of life, a singular lay-man <hi>Iohn Picus</hi> Earle of <hi>Mimndula,</hi> who was a man famous for vertue, and most eminent for learning; his life he translated, and sett out, as also manie of his most worthie letters, and his twelue precepts of good life; which are extant in the beginning of his English Workes. For this ende he also wro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te a treatise both learned, spirituall and deuout, of the Foure last things of man, though he left it vnperfect, being called by his father to other studies.</p>

perfected the whole, that thereby euerie one might learne, what they should belieue, what to followe, and what to shunne, and shewed the meanes how euerie Christian might come to perfection in their sundrie states of life; and his life did not disagree from his doctrine; for he exercised himself much in all workes of Charitie and mortification of his flesh. This was he that founded the goodlie Free-schoole of Paules, dedicating it to the little boy IESVS, as he was found disputing with the Doctours at twelue yeares olde, of which famous acte Sir THOMAS MORE writing vnto him, compareth it by a fitt Antithesis to the Horse of <hi>Troy,</hi> out of which the <hi>Grecians</hi> issued to surprise that Cittie; in like manner, saith he, out of this your schoole, manie haue come that haue subuerted and ouerthrowen all ignorance and rudenesse.</p>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:13162:22"/>
for his ghostlie Father; for he was accounted one of the skillfullest phisitians for the soule, that could be found amongst ten thousand; him he committed himself vnto, as to a safe guide of perfection in the dangerous passages of youth; that by his experience he might the more easily ouercome the deuill, the world, and his owne flesh, by following his whole so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me lessons, to worke the saluation of his soule, without anie preiudice of his bodie; to him he was as obedient in all spirituall affaires, as he was to his father in all dutiefull obligation; whereby he arriued to perfect obedience, one of the chiefest helpes that a spirituall man can haue to gett heauen.

And his example may moue all his to follow therein his footestepps, that their chiefe and principall endeauour in their youth be to seeke out a skillfull phisitian of the soule, who both can and will guide vs in the path of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike doctrine and dutie, and when we haue found such a one, to follow his counsell preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sely, and make the secretts of our harts knowen to him. This dutiefulnesse of the ghostlie childe to so rare a father, made <hi>Colett</hi> also admire this yong man's towardlienesse, so that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour would professe to manie, and at sundrie times say, that there was but one witt in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, and that was yong THOMAS MORE; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoug manie flourishing youthes at that time liued in England, which were of hopefull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.

him; vvhose bountiefull entertainement at his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I esteeme not so much as his learning, his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, and his liberalitie.

agree so well vvith your opinion, that I thinke one cannot liue vvithout inconueniencies vvith the verie best vvoman.

            <p>Doe not thinke, saith Sir THOMAS MORE, that, to be alwaies pleasant, which madde men doe laughing. For one may often see a man in
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:13162:71"/>
Bedlem laugh, when he knockes his head <note place="margin">The vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar no true jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of things.</note> against the wall; vttering this to condemne them that esteeme all things good or badde, which the common people iudge to be.</p>
            <p>Againe: A sinner, saith he, cannot taste spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall <note place="margin">Sinners distasted.</note> delights; because all carnall are first to be abandoned.</p>
            <p>By an excellent similitude he teacheth vs, <note place="margin">Why fevv do feare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ath.</note> why few doe feare death thus: Euen as they which looke vpon things afarre of, see them confusedly, not knowing whether they be men or trees; euen so he that promiseth vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe long life, looketh vpon death as a thing farre of, not iudging what it is, how terrible, what griefes and dangers it bringeth with it. And that none ought to promise himselfe long life, he proueth thus: Euen as two men that are <note place="margin">No man sure of long life.</note> brought out of prison to the gallowes, one by a long way about, the other by a direct short path, yet neither knowing, which is which, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they come to the gallowes, neither of these two can promise himself longer life, the one then the other, by reason of the vncertaintie of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:13162:71"/>
the way; euen so a yong man cannot promise himself longer life, then an olde man.</p>
            <p>Against the vanitie of worldlie honour he <note place="margin">VVorlds vanity.</note> speaketh thus: Euen as that criminall person, who is to be lead to execution shortly should be accounted vayne, if he should engraue his Coate of Armes vpon the prison gate; euen so are they vaine, who endeauour to leaue, with great industrie, monuments of their dignitie in the prison of this world.</p>
            <p>By a subtile <hi>dilemma,</hi> he teacheth vs, why <note place="margin">VVorld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lesses hurt not.</note> we are not to thinke that we can behurt, by the losse of our superfluous goods, in this manner: he that suffereth anie losse of his goods, he would either haue bestowed them with praise and liberalitie, and so God will accept his will in steede of the deede itselfe, or else he would haue waisted them wickedly, and then he hath cause to reioyce, that the matter of sinning is taken away.</p>
            <p>To expresse liuely the follie of an olde co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous <note place="margin">The fally of old misers.</note> man he writeth thus: a thiefe that is to dye to morrow, stealeth to day; and being
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:13162:72"/>
asked, why he did so, he answered, that it was a great pleasure vnto him to be maister of that money but one night; so an olde miser neuer ceaseth to encrease his heape of coyne, though he be neuer so aged.</p>
            <p>To expresse the follie and madnesse of them that delight wholy in hording vp wealth, he writeth in the person of the soules in purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thus; in his booke of the Supplication of the <note place="margin">Madnes of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> Soules: We that are here in purgatorie when we thinke of our bags of golde, which we hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vp in our life time, we condemne &amp; laugh at our owne follie no otherwise, then if a man of good yeares should sinde by chance the bagg of Cherrie stones, which he had carefully hidde, when he was a childe.</p>
            <p>In his booke of Comfort in tribulation, that <note place="margin">Fruicts of tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</note> men should not be troubled in aduersitie, he writeth thus: The mindes of mortall men are so blinde and vncertaine, so mutable and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant in their desires, that God could not punish men worse, then if he should suffer eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thing to happen that euerie man doth wish
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:13162:72"/>
for. The fruit of tribulation he describeth thus all punishment inflicted in hell, is only as aiust reuenge because it is no place of purging: In purgatorie all punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts purge only, because it is no place of meritt; but in this life, euerie punishment can both purge sinne and procure meritt for a iust man, because in this life there is place for both.</p>
            <p>He sayth also that they which giue themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues <note place="margin">Hovv fonde it is to loue this vvorld.</note> to pleasure and idlenesse in this time of pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, are like to him, who trauelling to his owne house, where there is abundance of all things, would yet be an hosteler in an Inne by the way, for to gett an Innekeepers fauour, and so ende his life there in a stable.</p>
            <p>Speaking of ghostlie Fathers, that seeke to <note place="margin">Against Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours that ffat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their ghostly Childre.</note> please their penitents, he sayth: Euen as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sendeth forth her childe to schoole with sayre words and promises, that hath slept too long in the morning, and therefore feareth the rodde, when he weepeth and blubbereth she promiseth him, all will be well, because it is not so late as he imagineth, or that his maister will
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:13162:73"/>
pardon him for that faulte this time, not caring what he endureth when he cometh thither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, so she send him merrie from home with his bread &amp; butter in his hand; euen so, manie Pastours of soules speake pleasing things to their sheepe that are riche and delicate, they promise them, when they are dying, and feare hell, that all things shall be well with them, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, that either they haue not offended God so grieuously as they feare, or that God being mercieful will easily forgiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; nothing carefull whether after this life they feele hell or no, so that they make them not sadde in this world, &amp; shew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues gratefull vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here.</p>
            <p>Pleasure, sayth he, doth not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe <note place="margin">Afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then pleasure.</note> wicked men from prayer, but also affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction sometimes; yet this is the difference; that affliction doth sometimes wrest some short praier from the wickedest man aliue; but pleasure calleth away euen one that is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent good from all prayer.</p>

            <p>The prosperitie of this world is like the shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test <note place="margin">Danger of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity.</note> winter's day; and we are lifted vp in it as an arrowe shott vp on high, where a hote breath doth delight vs, but from thence we fall sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to the earth, and there we sticke fast, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bemired with the durt of infamie, or star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing with colde, being pluckt out of our fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>

Applying this to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie mans case, who cometh naked into this world, and is to returne naked againe.</p>

            <p>To ease his thoughts when he was in prison, <note place="margin">An the vvorld a prison.</note> he imagined that all the world was but a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, out of which euerie day some one or other was called to execution, that is to death.</p>

            <p>Speaking of heretikes he would say; they haue <note place="margin">Heresy impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> taken away hipocrisie, but they haue placed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie in the roome thereof; so that they which before fayned themselues to be reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, now doe boaste of their wickednesse.</p>
            <p>He prayed thus: O Lord God, grant, that I <note place="margin">Prayer.</note> endeauour to gett those things, for which I am to pray vnto thee.</p>
            <p>When he had anie at his table speaking de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, <note place="margin">Detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> he would interrupt them thus; Lett anie man thinke as he pleaseth, I like this roome very well; for it is well contriued and fayrely built.</p>

            <p>He compareth reason to a handmayde, <note place="margin">Faith the mistresse of reason</note>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:13162:76"/>
which if she be well taught, will obey; and Faith to the mistrisse, which is to keepe her in awe: <hi>captiuans intellectum in obsequium fidei.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To seeke for the truth amongst heretikes, is <note place="margin">No truth among heretikes</note> like to a man wandring in a desert, &amp; meeting with a companie of lewde fellowes, of whome he asketh his way they all turning back to bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, each poynteth right before him, &amp; assureth him that that is his true way; though neuer so contrarie one to the other.</p>
            <p>He sayth that he were a madde man, that <note place="margin">Better preuent, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse.</note> would drinke poyson to take a preseruatiue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that; but he is a wise man, that spilling the poison, leaueth the antidote for him, that hath need thereof.</p>

            <p>He is not wise that eateth the bread, which is <note place="margin">Auoid heresy.</note> poysoned by his enemies, although he should see a friend of his scrape it away neuer so much, especially hauing other bread to eate not poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned.</p>

The heretikes saying that none ought to fast, <note place="margin">Fasting.</note> but when they are troubled with the motions of the flesh, he answereth; if it be so, no married man needes to fast; for they haue another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie athand; and virgins durst not fast, least wanton fellowes should marke them, when carnall temptations most assayle them, and this were for one to shew to others their fleshlie fraylties.</p>
            <p>He was wont to say that he may well be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admitted <note place="margin">Desire of heauen.</note> admitted to heauen, who was verie desirous to see God; but on the contrarie side, he that doth not desire earnestly shall neuer be admitted thither.</p>

            <p>That people should fall into bad life and <note place="margin">Bad life no mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</note> lust, is as great a miracle, he saith, as stones to fall downe wards.</p>
            <p>Whereas (he sayth) you inueighe against <note place="margin">School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuinity.</note> Schoole Diuinitie, because truth is there called in doubt, not without danger; weinueighe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you, because false matters are held by you vndoubtedly for truth it selfe.</p>

            <p>Heretikes writings, seing they conclude no good thing, are altogeather tedious, be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so short.</p>
            <p>And againe: As none can runne a shorter race, then he that wantes both his feete; so none can write shorter then he that hath not anie good matter, nor fitt wordes to expresse it.</p>
            <p>When an heretike tolde him, that he should <note place="margin">Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gning of heresie.</note> not write against heretikes, vnlesse he could conuerte them; he sayd, that it was like, as if one should not sinde faulte with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

VVhich when Sir THOMAS had seriously perused, and had excused himself saying, he was vnfitt to meddle with such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, being one that neuer had professed the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Diuinitie: The king not satisfyed with this answer, knowing well his iudgement to be sound in whatsoeuer he would apply himselfe vnto; pressed him so sore, that in conclusion he condescended to his Maiesties request being as it were a commaunde; and for that the cause was of such weight and importance, hauing neede of greate deliberation, he besought his Maiestie to giue him sufficient respite aduisedly to consider of it; with which the king very well satisfyed, sayd that <hi>Tunstall</hi> and <hi>Clarke,</hi> two

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:13162:84"/>
you say, and going through all estates with his comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dations of them, he went farre beyond my vncle; and yet sonne, quoth he, I pray God, that some of vs, as high as wee seeme to sitt now vpon the mountaines, treading heretikes vnder our feete like auntes, doe not liue the day that we gladly would wish to be in league with them, to suffer them to haue their chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches quietly to themselues, so that they would he content to lett vs haue ours peaceably to our selues. VVhen mine vncle <hi>Rooper</hi> had tolde him manie reasons, why he had no cause to say so; well, sayd he, I pray God some of vs liue not till that day; and yet shewed he noe reason for all these his speaches. whereat my vncle sayd in a choller: By my troath Sir it is very despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely spoken; I cry God mercie (saith my vncle) I vsed vnto him that very word. By which speach Sir THOMAS perceauing him to be some what angrie, sayd merrily: well sonne <hi>Rooper,</hi> it shall not be so, it shall not be so. But yet himself founde the predictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> too true: for he liued vntil the fiueteenth yeare of Q. <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> raigne,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:13162:84"/>
when he saw religion turned topsie turuie, and no hope of anie amendement.</p>
            <p>This spiritt of prophecie no doubt was a <note place="margin">4. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous reductio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his senno Roper from he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy, by his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> signe of Gods loue vnto Sir THOMAS, being so deare in his sight, that he would make him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of some parte of his secretts: but that which he wrought in the conuersion of this his sonne in lawe, was not a signe only, but an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent demonstratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God's great fauour vnto him. For when <hi>M.<hi rend="sup">r</hi> VVilliam Rooper</hi> was a yong man, he vsed austeritie to himselfe more then discretion afforded; and by this meanes he grew wearie of the Catholike fasts and religious discipline; and hearing of a new and easie way to heauen, which the preachers of nouelties did promise to their followers, he beganne to reade diligently the bookes of heresies, which came ouer, and were spread in euerie place of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland; in so much that being wearie of Auricular Confession, fasting the lent, and vigiles, he grew vehement in his new opinions, and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in breaking of them to others; so as that he would be alwaies talking, what a readie way to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:13162:85"/>
heauen was now found out, no bodie needing to sue to Saints or mens prayers; but Gods eare was open still to heare, and his mercie readie to forgiue anie sinner whatsoeuer, when he shall call to him by fayth, which was only necessarie to saluation; and hauing that only, which he assured himself of, he needed not doubt, but that he was an elect and saued soule, so that it was impossible for him to sinne or fall out of God's fauour. Of this dangerous poison of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie <note place="margin">The hot spirit of heresy.</note> he hauing druncke a full draught, he came on a time to Sir THOMAS to request him, because he was highly in the king's fauour, that he would gett him a licence to pieache, what the spiritt had taught him; for he was assured that God had sent him to instruct the world; not knowing (god wote) anie reason of this his mission, but only his priuate spirit; to whome Sir THOMAS in a smiling manner replyed; Is it not sufficient, sonne <hi>Rooper,</hi> that we that are your frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds should knowe that you are a foole, but that you would haue your follie proclamed to the world? After this he often disputed with
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:13162:85"/>
him about matters of religion, yet neuer could he bring him to hearken to anie reason, euerie day seeming more obstinate then other, vntill at length he sayd: in sober sadnesse: I see, sonne, noe disputation will doe thee good; henceforth therefore I will dispute with thee no more; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will I pray for thee, that God will be so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable as to touch thy hart; and so commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to God, they parted. And he earnestly powred out his deuotions before the Diuine mercie for that intent. And beholde my vncle not long after being inspired with the light of grace, beganne to detest his heresies; and, as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>S.

for both of them beare name of a reasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture equally, vvhose nature reason only doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish from bruite beastes, and therefore I do not see vvhy learning in like manner may not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually agree vvith both sexes; for by it, reason is cultiuated, and (as a fielde) sovved vvith vvhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some precepts, it bringeth forth excellent fruit. But if the soyle of vvomans braine be of its ovvne nature bad, and apter to beare fearne then corne (by vvhich saying manie doe terrifye vvomen from learning) I am of opinion therefore that a vvoman's vvitt is the more diligently by good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions and learning to be manured, to the ende, the defect of nature may be redressed by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie.

And for my parte, I esteeme that the harder it is to shake from vs this plague of pride, so much the more ought euerie one to endeauour to do it from his verie infancie.

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:13162:93"/>
their ovvne vvorth, being full of fine vvitt, and of a pure Latine phrase. therefore none of them all, but ioyed me exceedingly, yet to tell you inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously vvhat I thinke, my sonne <hi>Iohn's</hi> letter pleased me best, both because it vvas longer then the other, as also for that he seemeth to haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more paynes then the rest. For he not only paynteth out the matter decently, and speaketh elegantly, but he playeth also pleasantly vvith me, and returneth my ieastes vpon me againe very vvittily; and this he doth not only pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but temperately vvithall, shevving that he is mindefull vvith vvhome he ieasteth, to vvitt, his father, vvhome he endeauoureth so to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, that he is also afeared to offende. Hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I expect euerie day letters from euerie one of you; neither vvill I accept of such excuses, as you complaine of, that you had no leasure, or that the Carrier vvent avvay suddenly, or that you haue no matter to vvrite; <hi>Iohn</hi> is not vvont to alleage anie such things; nothing can hinder you; from vvriting, but manie things may exhort you thereto. vvhy should you lay anie faulte vpon the

And hovv can you vvant matter of vvriting vnto me, vvho am delighted to heare eyther of your studies, or of your play: vvhome you may euen then please exceedingly, vvhen hauing nothing to vvrite of, you vvrite as largely as you can of that nothing, then vvhich nothing is more easie for you to doe, especially being vvomen, and therefore pratlers by nature, and amongst vvhome daily agreat storie riseth of nothing. But this I admonish you to doe, <note place="margin">He wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to write with care and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that vvhether you vvrite of serious matters, or of trifles, you vvrite vvith diligence and considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, premeditating of it before; neither vvill it be amisse, if you firstindite it in English, for then it may more easily be translated into Latine, vvhilst the minde free from inuenting is atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiue to finde apt and eloquent vvordes.

held themselues bound to consider him for his paynes taken and bestowed to discharge them in Gods quarrell; and albeit they could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his deserts requite him so worthily as they willingly would, but must referre that only to the goodnesse of God: yet for a small parte of recompence, in respect of his estate so vnequall to his worth they presented vnto him that summe in the name of the whole Conuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, desiring him to take it in good parte.

And when they
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:13162:119"/>
with great importunitie pressed still vpon him, that few would haue supposed he could haue refused it, they could not for all that fasten anie whitt vpon him. Then they besought him that he would be content they might bestowe it vpon his wife and children. Not so my Lords, quoth he; I had rather see it cast all into the Thames then I or anie of mine should haue there of one pennie. For though your offer, my Lords, be indeede very honourable, yet sett I so much by my pleasure and so little by my profitt, that I would not in good faith for much more monie haue lost the rest of so manie nights sleepe as was spent vpon the same: and yet for all this I could wish that vpon conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all heresies were suppressed, all my workes were burnt, and my labour vtterly lost. Thus they were fayne to departe, and restore to euerie one his owne againe. By which wise and vertuous answer, euerie one may see that all his paines that he tooke, were only in respect of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and not for either vaine glorie or any earthlie commoditie;</p>

For the heretikes hauing gotten it by the ende, that the Clergie had offered him a great summe of monie, and measuring other men by their owne couetous humours, reported and wrote in pamphletts that he was bribed by the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie to write, whome he answered mildely by a flatt deniall, that he was not made richer by one pennie from the Clergie. Yet some of those he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes had spent him somewhat; and besides he being <hi>Bigamus,</hi> twice married, could neuer hope for anie spirituall promotion</p>
            <p>The water baylife of <hi>London,</hi> who had bene sometime his seruant, hearing (where he had bene at dinner) certaine marchants somewhat drunke with this new poison, liberally to rayle against Sir THOMAS, in that he was so bitter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <note place="margin">True glorie to be hated by here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes.</note> 
               <hi>Luthemns,</hi> waxed sore discontented therewith, knowing wel, that he little deserued anie euill reporte; wherefore he hastily came to Sir THOMAS and tolde him what he had heard: and were I, Sir, sayd he, in such fauour and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie

Wherefore you may doe well, <hi>Sir,</hi> to call them before you, and to their shame to punish them for their vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued malice.

could mende his doings, so vprightly that none could take exception against him or his iust proceedings, and so dexterously that neuer anie man did before or since that which he did.

            <p>When (as I say) Sir THOMAS had deserued high commendations of euerie one, and now perceaued that the king was fully determined to proceede to the vnfortunate marriage of <hi>Anne Bullen,</hi> and for that cause a Parlement <note place="margin">A parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for Q Annes marriage</note> was called, wherein Sir THOMAS being the chiefe Officer of the higher house, was with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse Bishops and Noble men commaunded by the king, to goe downe to the lower house

More sues to depose his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.</note> least further attemps should after follow, which contrarie to his conscience by reason of his office, he was likelie to be putt vnto; he made great suite to the Duke of Norfolke his singular good frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that he would be a meanes to the king that he might be discharged, with his Maiesties fauour of the Chancellourshipp; wherein for certaine infirmities of his bodie he pretended himself vnable anie longer to serue.

in that office, at which time it pleased his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to say thus vnto him: That for the seruice he had hitherto done vnto him, in anie suite that he should hereafter haue vnto him that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should concerne Sir THOMAS his honour (that very word it liked his Highnesse to vse vnto him) or that should appertaine to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitt, he should not fayle to finde him a good &amp; gracious Lord.

But to requite her braue minde, he beganne to finde fault with her dressing, for he saw a greate fault about her; for which she chiding her daughters that none of them could espye it, they still saying they could finde none; Sir THOMAS merrily sayd: Doe you not perceaue that your mothers nose standeth somewhat awry? at which wordes she stept away from him in a rage.

declared vnto them, that albeit at her vrging he had indeede receaued the Cuppe, yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately therevpon he caused his buttler to fill it vp with wine, and therein drunke to her; which when he had donne, and she pledged him, then he as frecly as her husband bestowed it vpon him, did euen as willingly bestowe the same vpon her againe for her newyeares-guift; &amp; so forced her to receaue it, though much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her will; all which herselfe and manie others there then present deposed before that honourable assemblie.

But to this, as appeareth by the examinations sett out at the ende of his English Workes, they could neuer bring him, because he was loath to aggrauate the king's displeasure against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, saying only, that the Statute was like a two-edged sworde; if he should speake against it, he should procure the death of his bodie; and if he should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent vnto it, he should purchase the death of his soule.</p>

he declared amongst manie reasons &amp; sound authorities, that</hi> like as this realme alone being but one member and a small parte of the Church, might not make a particular lavv disagreing with the generall lavv of Christ's vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall Catholike Church, no more then the Cittie of <hi>London</hi> being but one member in respect of the vvhole realme may enact a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>AMong his Latine Workes <note place="margin">Epigrammes.</note> are his Epigrammes, partly translated out of Greeke, and partely of his owne making, so wittily deuised and penned, as they may seeme nothing inferiour, or to yeelde to anie of the like kinde written in our daies, and perchance not vnworthie to be compared with those of like writers of olde.

And this sayd iollie inuention of Sir THOMAS MORE'S seemed to beare a good countenance of truth, not only for the creditt Sir THOMAS was of in the world, but also for that about the same time manie strange and vnknowne nations and
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:13162:203"/>
Countries were discouered, such as our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers neuer knew. especially by the wonderfull nauigation of the shippe called <hi>Victoria,</hi> that sayled the world round about, whereby it was fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that shipps sayle bottome to bottome, &amp; that there be Antipodes, which thing <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> and others doe flattely denye, laughing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to scorne that so did write. Againe it is found, that vnder the Zodiake, where <hi>Aristotle</hi> and others say that for the immoderate &amp; excessiue heate there is no habitation, is the most tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and pleasant dwelling, and the most fruitfull countrie in the world. These and other considerations caused manie wise and learned men nothing lesse to mistrust, then that this had bene nothing but an Inuentiue drift of Sir THOMAS MORE'S owne imagination; for they tooke it for a verie sure true storie, wherein they were deceaued by Sir THOMAS as too wittie, and as well learned as they were. In this booke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other things he hath a very goodlie processe, how there might be fewer theeues in England, and a maruelous opinable probleme
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:13162:203"/>
of sheepe, that whereas men were wont to eate <note place="margin">Sheep deuour men in England.</note> the sheepe, as they doe in other countries, now contrariewise sheepe in England pittiefully doe deuowre men, women and children, houses yea &amp; townes withall. Like a most thankefull man he maketh honourable mention of Cardinall <hi>Morton</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> and Lo: Chancellour of England, in whose house, as we haue sayd, himselfe was in his tender youth brought vpp, albeit it be by the dissembled name of the sayd <hi>Hythlodius,</hi> whome he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth to haue bene in <hi>England,</hi> and to haue bene acquainted with the sayd Cardinall.</p>
            <p>And as this booke in his kinde is singular and <note place="margin">Sir Tho.

King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight had written a notable and learned booke against <hi>Luther's</hi> booke <hi>De Captiuitate Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica,</hi> most euidently and mightily refuting
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:13162:204"/>
his vile and shamefull heresies against the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Fayth and Christ's holie Sacraments, which did so grieue <hi>Luther</hi> to the hart, that hauing no good substantiall matter to helpe himselfe withall, he fell to scoffing and sawcie ieasting at the king's booke in his answer for the same, vsing nothing throughout the sayd Answer but the figure of Rhetorike called <hi>savvce-malepert,</hi> and played the very varlett with the king. To whome Sir THOMAS MORE made reply, and doth so discipher and lay open his wily wrested handling of the Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his monstrous opinions and maniefolde contradictions, that neither he nor anie of his generation durst euer after putt penne to paper to encounter and reioyne to his reply: in which besides the deepe and profound debating of the matter itselfe he so dresseth <hi>Luther</hi> with his owne scoffing and ieasting rhetoricke, as he worthily deserued. But because this kinde of writing (albeit a meete Couer for such a Cuppe, and verie necessarie to represse &amp; beate him with his owne follie, according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:13162:204"/>
               <hi>Responde stulto secundùm slutitiam eius</hi>) seemed not agreable and correspondent to his grauitie and dignitie, the booke was sett forth vnder the name of one <hi>Gulielmus Rosseus,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, suppressing his owne name.</p>
            <p>He wrote also and printed another proper and wittie treatise against a certaine Epistle of <note place="margin">His epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Pomera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> 
               <hi>Iohn Pomeran</hi> one of <hi>Luther's</hi> sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dard-bearers in <hi>Germanie;</hi> And after he was shutt vp in the Tower he wrote a certaine expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Latine vpon the Passion of Christ, not yet printed, which was not perfited, and is so plainely and exquisitely tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slated into English, by his neece M.<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> 
               <hi>Bassett,</hi> that it may seeme originally to haue bene penned in English by Sir THOMAS MORE himselfe. Some other things he wrote also in Latine which we pretermitt; and now we will somewhat talke of his English Workes, which all (besides the life of <hi>Iohn Picus</hi> Earle of <hi>Mirandula,</hi> &amp; the foresayd life of king <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, and some other prophane things) concerne matters of religion for the most parte.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="400" facs="tcp:13162:205"/>
The first booke of this sorte, was his Dialo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, <note place="margin">His English writings. The dialog with the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singer.</note> made by him, when he was Chancellour of the Dutchie of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> which bookes occasioned him afterwards (as according to the olde prouerbe, One businesse begetteth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other) to write diuerse other things For whereas he had amongst manie other matters touched and reproued <hi>William Tindall's</hi> adulterate and vitious translation of the New Testament, <hi>Tindall</hi> being not able to beare to see his new religion, and his owne doings withall to haue so fowle an ouerthrowe, as Sir THOMAS MORE gaue him, after great deliberation with his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelicall bretheren, tooke in hand to answer some parte of his dialogues, especially touching his aforesayd corrupt Translation; but what small glorie he wanne thereby, is easie to be seene of euerie man, that with indifferent affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction will vouchsafe to reade Sir THOMAS MORE'S reply, whereof we shall giue you a smal taste; but first we will note vnto you the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie, sinceritie and vprightnesse of the good and gracious nature and disposition of the
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:13162:205"/>
sayd Sir THOMAS MORE in his writing, not only <note place="margin">Great sincerity in his writing: and loue of the truth.</note> against <hi>Tindall,</hi> but generally against all other Protestants. First then it is to be considered in him, that he doth not, (as manie other writers doe against their aduersaries, &amp; all Protestants doe against him &amp; other Catholikes,) wreathe and wreste their wordes to the worst, and make their reasons more feeble and weake, then they are; but rather enforceth them to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, and oftentimes further then the partie himself doth or perhaps could doe. And he was of this minde, that he sayde, he would not lett, while he liued, wheresoeuer he perceaued his aduersarie to say well, or himselfe to haue sayd otherwise, indifferently for both to say and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the truth. And therefore himselfe after the printing, finding the bookes diuulged and commonly read of the Debellation of <hi>Salem</hi> and <hi>Bizanze,</hi> albeit manie had read the place and found no faulte therein; yet he finding af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards that he mistooke certaine wordes of the Pacifyer, without anie man's controule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, meerely of himselfe reformed them;
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:13162:206"/>
The like he counselled his learned friends, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially <hi>Erasmus</hi> to doe, and to retract manie things that he had written; whose counsell (wherein he had a notable president in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Doctour <hi>S. Augustine</hi>) yf <hi>Erasmus</hi> had followed, I trowe his bookes would haue bene better liked of, by posteritie, which perchance shall be fayne either vtterly to abolish some of his workes, or at least to redresse and reforme them. Here is now further to be considered in his writings, that he neuer hunted after praise <note place="margin">He writt neither for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Yet did the Euangelicall bretheren, after he had abandoned the office of Lo: Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, as they otherwise spread and writt manie vaine and false rumours to the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cement of their new Gospel, and oppressing of the Catholike, lay to his charge in their boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, that he was partiall to the Clergie, and for his bookes receaued a great masse of monie of
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:13162:206"/>
the sayd Clergie. And <hi>Tindall</hi> and diuerse others of the good bretheren affirmed, that they wist well that Sir THOMAS MORE was not lesse <note place="margin">His <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The like pouertie of anie man, that had continued so long a Chancellour with the king, and had borne so manie great offices, hath, I trowe, seldome bene founde in anie lay man before, and much lesse since his time. As for his partialitie to the Clergie, sauing the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

First, touching anie fees he had to his liuing, after that he had left the Chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellourship, he had not one groate gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted him since he first wrote, or bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne to write the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues, &amp; that was the first booke, that euer he wrote in matters of religion. And as for all the lands and fees he had besides those of the king's guift, was not, nor should be, during his mother in lawe's life, (who liued after he relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished the office of Chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cellourship) worth yearely the su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of 100. pound &amp; thereof had he some by his wife, some left by his father,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:13162:207"/>
some he purchased, and some fees had he of Temporall men; &amp; so may euerie man soundly guesse, that he had no greate parte of his liuing of the Clergie to make him partiall to them. Now touching rewardes or lucre, which rose to him by his writing, (for which good Father <hi>Tindall</hi> sayd he wrote his bookes, and not for anie affection he bare to the Clergie, no more then <hi>Iudas</hi> betrayed Christ for anie fauour he bare to the Bishopps, Scribes and Pharisies) it is a most shamefull lye and slaunder; as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by his refusall of the 4. or 5. thousand pound offered him by the Clergie.</p>
            <p>Concerning <hi>Tindall's</hi> false translation of <note place="margin">Tindals false tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> the New Testament; first it is to be considered, as these good bretheren partely denye the very Text it selfe, and whole bookes of the sacred Scripture, as the booke of the <hi>Machabies,</hi> and certaine others; and <hi>Luther S.

After this Sir THOMAS MORE wrote a letter <note place="margin">Against Iohn Frith.</note> impugning the erroneous writing of <hi>Iohn Frith,</hi> and whereas, after he had giuen ouer the office of Lo: Chancellour, the heretikes full fast did write against him, and found manie faultes with him and his writings, he made a goodlie and learned Apologie of some of his answers; <note place="margin">Sir Tho.

            <p>Whereas now they found farther faulte <note place="margin">Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the length of Sir Tho.

and some that make tables thereof for their owne remembrance, and are men that haue as much witt and learning both, as the best of all this blessed Bretherhood, that euer I heard of.

            <p>We haue now one booke more written in <note place="margin">Sir T. M. his book of the blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> matter of religion, and that is of the B.

We tolde you before of a letter of his, wherein he impugneth the heresie of <hi>Iohn Frith;</hi> albeit he was prisonner in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> he found the meanes to make answer to that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to conuey it beyond the seas, where it was printed, and it was afterwards brought into this realme, as Sir THOMAS MORE, did certainely vnderstande, who minded, when the booke came to his hands, to answer it; but now in the meane season came there from beyond the seas, an Answere made to the same letter by another, and printed without the Authour's name entituled: The Supper of the Lord. But I beshrewe, quoth Sir THOMAS MORE, such a <note place="margin">The heretiks supper of the Lord, wants the best dishe.</note> Sewer, that serueth in such a supper, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyeth away the best dish, and bringeth it not to the borde, as this man would, if he could co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueye from the B. Sacrament Christ's owne flesh and bloud, and leaue vs nothing there in but for a memoriall only bare bread and wine. But his handes are too lumpish, and this messe too great for him, especially to conuey cleane, sith the man hath his hart bent thereto, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

his eye sett thereon, to see where it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh.

And yet is there one thing, that in the valuing and praysing of these bookes, he is
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:13162:220"/>
not, as manie great Clerkes are like, to a whett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, that being blunt and dull itselfe, whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <note place="margin">Like Esaias his cole, that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified his lippes.</note> other things and sharpeth them; it was not so with this man; for though he wrote these bookes with a dead blacke coale, yet was there a most hote burning coale, such an one, as puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed the lippes of the holie prophett Esaias, that directed his hand with the black coale, and so enflamed &amp; incensed his hart withall to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that the good and holesome instructions and counsell that he gaue to other men in his bookes, he himselfe afterward in most patient suffering the losse of his goods and landes, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment &amp; death for the defence of iustice and of the Catholike Fayth experimented &amp; worthily practised in himselfe.</p>
            <p>And these be in effect the bookes he made either in Latine or English; which his English bookes yf they had bene written by him in the Latine toung also, or might be with the like grace, that they now haue, be translated into the Latine speach, they would surely much
