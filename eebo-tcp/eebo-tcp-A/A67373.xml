            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

LETTER
From a Young
OXONIAN, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SInce my last Opportunity of Discoursing with you,
(which is now some Months past) my Thoughts have
run continually upon the Subject we were then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
in, which was the Nature of <hi>Magnetism;</hi> and
what with the dignity of the Matter and the Indearments of
the Party who argu'd so Rationally upon it, whereof the
one facilitated the remembrance of the other; I have hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
talk'd of any thing else waking, nay, (as I am told) sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too, and all this at last without the success that might
justly have been presum'd of such frank endeavours; but
that you may know how much I am the wiser, and be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
by my Example from lavishing too great a Portion of
time upon such <hi>Gordian-knots,</hi> I have ventur'd to send you
the summ of my Acquisitions. It is a Question which we
know has employ'd and prov'd too hard for the Pens of the
most eminent <hi>Philosophers,</hi> and is to be rank'd among those
Misteries of <hi>Nature,</hi> which neither the thoughtful Ancients,
the laborious School-Men, nor our acute Virtuosi, could ever
make a compleat Discovery of: Not but that the <hi>Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>
is verily persuaded he has seen farther into it than other
People, as long as he can answer your demands with Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
quality or its elder Sister Substantial form; and if this
does not lay it all bare, what does? there is says he, very
gravely, something whereof we cannot with confidence
affirm any thing, which either within the <hi>Magnet</hi> or from
without, disposes it in such and such a manner; and then
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29908:3"/>
there is another <hi>what do you call it,</hi> with which according to
the Determination of its <hi>Poles,</hi> it attracts or repels a Body
Congenial; and think you Sir, this answer is not very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of a <hi>Philosopher?</hi> Others have entertain'd an Opinion,
that the <hi>Magnet</hi> accomplishes its Operations by the Emission
of Effluviums out of its own Continuum; and this the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
have so Rationally disprov'd already, that I shall think it
sufficient, if not superfluous, to offer but one Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, which shall be grounded upon the Nature and
Structure of the <hi>Load-stone.</hi> It is to be remembred that as
that Stone is for the most part fetch'd out of <hi>Iron-mines</hi> and
foster'd in Beds of <hi>Iron Ore;</hi> so in its Nature it scarce varies
from that Metal, save in the eminence of one Quality which
is Compactedness; for altho' in other Qualities it dissents
from <hi>Iron,</hi> as in its Gravity, Inductility, and Microporosity or
littleness of <hi>Pores,</hi> yet in these it rather differs from the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
consequentially than essentially, since the Original and
Fountain of them seems to be the Quality of Compactedness,
for the comprehension of more univocal matter in less Space,
which is but a Periphrasis of Compactedness unecesarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
to gravity; and then as for its Inductility, 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
that the most compact and heavy of all known Bodies
which is <hi>Gold,</hi> is the most Ductile and Malleable, but it is not
reasonable to conclude from thence, That the most Ductile
and Malleable Bodies are always the most compact and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous;
Ductility or Malleableness as I conceive, requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no more than that the Parts should be of such a Figure
as would be least impatient of those Impressions, suppose of
an <hi>Aequilateral Quadrangular Superficies,</hi> whereas such a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
and correspondency of Parts seems not to be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary to a Bodies becoming heavy and compact,
so their Connexion and Union be but such as admits of the
smallest <hi>Interstices</hi> and <hi>Pores;</hi> not but a coincident Figure of
Parts, such as that I just mentioned an <hi>Aequilateral Quad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangular,</hi>
contributes much to Compactedness, for which
reason all <hi>Architects</hi> take care their Materials be of such a
form. But the parts of the <hi>Load-stone</hi> are in all probability
so far from <hi>Aequilateral-Quadrangulars,</hi> that they are rather
to be supposed of a Branchy stragling Figure as the Parts of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29908:3"/>
               <hi>Iron,</hi> yet because those Branches are better and closer Plait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Connected one with the other than those of <hi>Iron,</hi>
which are so loosly dispos'd as to be even thorough fares
for Heterogeneous Matter, they become more Inviolable
and Inflexible than those of the latter; nor is there any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
occasion to prove as much of the Tenuity of its <hi>Pores.</hi>
seeing therefore the <hi>Magnet</hi> and <hi>Iron</hi> have so near an Affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as to be in respect of <hi>Magnetism,</hi> two Species of the same
Genus, and their difference chiefly to consist in the Dignity
and Degrees of some Accidents, on account of which <hi>Iron</hi>
may be reputed an imperfect and Bastard <hi>Load stone,</hi> and
the <hi>Load-stone</hi> the most pure and noble <hi>Iron;</hi> there will be
found but few <hi>Phaenomena</hi> which may not be attributed to
both indifferently, wherefore it ought to be a general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legomenon
in disputes upon this Subject, That <hi>Magnetism,</hi>
not of the <hi>Magnet</hi> only properly so called, but of all <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical</hi>
Bodies is the Theme. <hi>Magnetical</hi> Bodies being
therefore naturaly unapt for Malleableness and Ductility,
though one Species less so than another; it will follow that
notwithstanding they are tight and compact, yet that the
Parts of them are of no <hi>Quadrangular</hi> regular shape, but on
the contrary of a stragling Branchy one, though strongly
Interwoven and Connected; whence it is Demonstrative
that the Effluviums of <hi>Magnetical</hi> Bodies flow not from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
themselves, for by such a Procession and Expiration, it
is certain there must be a very considerable and visible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of the Parts: for though slightly considering the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it may be answered that the Evaporating Particles are
few and slender, yet when their mutual Dependence and
Concatenation is weigh'd, it will appear that one single Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
cannot escape without the attendance of its whole
Chain, so that in a short time there would necessarily suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
a very sensible and obvious decay of Parts; and this
may suffice you for the Confutation of the Opinion of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>spiration.</hi> I shall not worry you with the rest of those Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theses
and Notions which some Mens Brains have teem'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with;
such as the Influence of the <hi>Stars,</hi> or the entire <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netism</hi>
of the <hi>Earth</hi> and the like, which instead of giving
a light into the Question, is but meer building new Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29908:4"/>
and Errors upon our Antecedent Ignorance. I
have therefore only a Word to say to <hi>Des Cartes</hi> and the
<hi>Materia Pennata</hi> Men, and so shall go on to perform my
promise. The latter of them seem to be offenders against
all Reason and Rule too; it is a receiv'd Maxim or Postula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
among <hi>Philosophers,</hi> That Entities without a necessity
are not to be Multiply'd, and if so, then certainly are those
<hi>Philosohers</hi> to blame, who have invented a new Species of
Matter, of an unaccountable extract and production to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
those Operations which another Species of Matter, the
existence whereof is evidently known has Power to effect.
But as for the Ingenious <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> it were an unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
peice of Ignorance and Envy, not to acknowledg his
<hi>Hypothesis</hi> to be the most satisfactory and adequate Account
hitherto Published; but yet as a Man's having good Eyes
when he walks in the Dark, will not save him from stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
some times, so neither could the Perspicacity of this
great Man, ensure him from many mistakes in the trace of
so profound a Secret. For not to mention to one who
knows them so well, the many perplexities which the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
have discover'd in his <hi>Philosophical</hi> Principles, altho' the
reality of his <hi>Magnetical System</hi> must unavoidably stand or
fall with those Principles: I say not to mention any thing
of this; there are yet some difficulties observable in the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem</hi>
it self; take one for all, for his Instruments, he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
a sort of fine Matter to issue out of both <hi>Poles</hi> of the
<hi>Earth</hi> after such a manner, that those that come from one
<hi>Pole</hi> take a compass round the Superficies of the <hi>Earth</hi> and
enter in again at t' other, which matter he has Denominat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Corpuscula Striata,</hi> because of the <hi>Strias</hi> impressed upon it
by being drain'd thro' the <hi>Apertures</hi> or <hi>Interstices</hi> necessarily
left-between the contacts of the <hi>Globuli</hi> of his second <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
This matter he supposes to be a Species of his first
<hi>Element,</hi> which he defines thus, <hi>Quoe tantam vim habet agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis,
ut aliis Corporibus occurrendo in minutias indefinitae parvita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
dividatur, &amp; figur as suas ad omnes Angulorum, abijs relictorum
angustias implendas, accommodet;</hi> It is, says he, so agil a kind
of Matter as upon encountring other Bodies, to dash into
innumerable Particles, and conforms it self to the Spaces
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29908:4"/>
which are left between those Bodies. but how is it possible
to conceive, That Matter of so easy and yeilding a Nature
should not be as Susceptive of an Impression from, and as
conformable to the <hi>Pores</hi> of Bodies compounded of third
Elementary Matter, in the number of which are <hi>Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
Bodies, as it is to the Interstices of the <hi>Globuli</hi> of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Element,</hi> which if it be, then cannot it act with any
force or impulse, but must glide ineffectualy thro' the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
of the <hi>Magnet,</hi> and like a winding Stream comply
with the Luxuriancy of its Channel; nor will it avail to say
that this Matter upon approaching the <hi>Poles</hi> of the <hi>Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi>
Body is Congregated, and Acts with an united force,
since we cannot see why it should more readily congregate
and confederate upon such an accession than before or after
it, unless, which this Learned <hi>Philosopher</hi> I am sure will not
admit, it is Collected by some Sympathetical Attraction of
the <hi>Magnetical</hi> Body. thus Sir, you see one Difficulty, and
were it needful perhaps I could make you sensible of many
more; but I am unwilling to attempt a Dispute, which would
be as endless as the Ropings of the <hi>Welchman</hi>'s Toasted
Cheese. Now be pleased to hear what I can say for my
self.</p>
            <p>It is apparent that there can be no such thing as Motion
without an Impulse, and that upon such an impulse a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
greater or less must ensue; from whence we gather
that all <hi>Magnetical</hi> Bodies require some Impellent to enable
them to perform those various Feats and Operations obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
in them; and here an Inquiry will arise, were we shall
meet with an Agent confessedly existent in Nature, neither
too gross not too feeble, but in all respects qualify'd for such
undertakings, <hi>Corpuscula Striata</hi> or <hi>Pennata,</hi> as has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
shewn, are Fabulous or Impotent if not both, and the
daily Testimonies of Mens Eyes assure them that no visible
Conspicuous Agent is in the Cause; of necessity therefore
it must be something of a midling kind between these two,
which cannot be any other than the Aethereal or Subtile
Matter incorporated in the <hi>Atmosphere</hi> of our <hi>Terraqueous
Globe,</hi> which Matter by the diurnal Motion of the <hi>Earth</hi> is
rapidly devolv'd from <hi>West</hi> to <hi>East</hi> perpetualy: Now you
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29908:5"/>
will presently wonder, I do not doubt, how that which
moves from <hi>West</hi> to <hi>East</hi> should direct any <hi>Magnetical</hi> Body
so as that its <hi>Poles</hi> should point directly <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> but
have a little Patience. The existence of such Aethereal
Matter I am confident you will not call in Question, and
that it is endu'd with a Scrutinous penetrating Nature may,
were it not trivial, be Demonstrated from the very end and
essence of it; but still this Agent suffers under the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Insufficiency and Variability equally with that of
<hi>Des Cartes,</hi> and considered by it self undoubtedly it does so,
but considered with Circumstances as the Precipitance of
its Motion, the Disposition of the Parts of its Patient and
the like, it will answer your Expectation and Demands.
Thus the Wind can manage the Sails of a Windmil, and
turn them round with ease, but has no Power upon a Rock
or a Mountain; from hence it is evident therefore that this
Agent must be driven with a due force of Motion, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
that the Patient must have some of its Parts adapted for
receiving and suffering the Impulse. Whoever takes a just
estimate of the <hi>Earths</hi> Celerity in her diurnal Motion, must
be convinced that the Violence of such a Motion is able to
effect great things, and whoever remembers that the Motion
of the Aethereal Matter about the <hi>Earths Superficies</hi> must be
proportionably quicker as that is Degrees fluider, must also
be satisfy'd of the abilities of such Matter to penetrate all the
accessible passages of those Bodies, which occur in its course
and to rage and aestuate in them, if they be not very regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and open.</p>
            <p>Having thus obtain'd an Agent; there are two things next
to be examin'd, the one is whether this Agent when it is
free and uninterrupted is capable of such an Administration;
The second is, Whether though it be so of its self, yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Diversions and Disturbances may not frustrate and
evacuate its Influence, which Queries being both Answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I hope no further difficulties will remain. In order to
clear the first, I must give you to understand that many of
the Particles of <hi>Magnetical</hi> Bodies are like so many Tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils
or little Springs, Taper and Tortuous, which in regard
of the Internal Disposition and Posture of <hi>Magnetical</hi> Bodies,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29908:5"/>
and the many anomalous Ramosities into which the Parts
of them spread themselves, I may expect to be easily grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The Body of the Aethereal Matter therefore rushing
into the <hi>Pores</hi> of the <hi>Magnetical</hi> Bodies, and there labouring
to exert its self on all sides, and obtain a free Passage or a
convenient Receptacle, distends and explicates these little
Springs which lie ranged in one and the same order, from
this <hi>Pole</hi> to that <hi>Pole</hi> of the <hi>Magnetical</hi> Body, the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of which distention can not be a direct Progressive
Motion of the Body, because then all parts of these Springs
must equally resist the Impulses of the Aethereal Matter,
but being of a Taper form, larger and stronger toward the
Radix of them than toward their Summity or Cuspis, (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
my Pedantry where I cannot help it,) the finer and
weaker parts of them suffer a readier or more forcible Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pansion
or Diastole than the larger and radical, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ensues insted of a Progressive Motion a Deflexion or
Distortion of the Springs themselves, and of the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
to which they adhere. For instance, If the Radix of
the Spring of a Watch were fastened to a peice of <hi>Wood</hi> or
<hi>Iron,</hi> when the Summity or lesser Parts of that Spring were
distended and display'd, it would not carry the <hi>Wood</hi> or <hi>Iron</hi>
at the end of it in a direct Motion to any Point just before
it, but it would turn and move it round within the Limits
of the same Area, on which it lay before the Terminating
weaker Parts were expanded; and this Distention may
very easily be effected by the Vehemency and Agitation of
the Aethereal Matter, which (to make a gross Comparison)
Acts as vigorously upon them as the Wind in a crop of Corn,
or among the sprigs of Trees. When therefore the <hi>Poles</hi> of
<hi>Magnetical</hi> Bodies are thus deflected to the Points of <hi>North</hi>
and <hi>South,</hi> the equal urgency of the Influx of the accessory
Aethereal Matter upon all Parts of the <hi>Magnetical</hi> Body, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys
the Strength of the Impression, and stays its Motion
at just that Instant; for it must be remembred that the sides
of the <hi>Magnet</hi> have not <hi>Pores</hi> fit to receive the Aethereal
Matter, which therefore upon impaction flows round it in
a Vortical manner, as shall be better explain'd hereafter.
So the first dificulty disappears, the second follows, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29908:6"/>
though our Agent be capacitated, yet external Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and Disturbances may not frustrate its Influence.
The <hi>Cartesians</hi> I hope will not be the Men that start this
Quere, their Doctrine of the <hi>Loadstone</hi> labouring under the
same or a worse disadvantage; for if external Commotions
as of the Wind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> can confound the order and irritate
the Operation of our Aethereal Matter, whose Motion is so
certain, regular, strong and unintermitted; what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of their <hi>Corpuscula Striata</hi> or <hi>Pennata,</hi> they being not
only obnoxious to accidental Ruffles and Perturbations, but
continually thwarted and Transverst by this flux of our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Matter? But I am persuaded we are both out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
from Storms of every kind, and need not shrink at the
rage of Whirlwinds and Hurricans, for such is the minute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and velocity of our Agents that they make their way
thro' all Opposition: like an Arrow in the <hi>Aire,</hi> or a good
Keel through the Waves, or as the Sunbeams directly dart
thro' the <hi>Atmosphere</hi> many times when 'tis vext and tost with
the Winds; which last Similitude carries the most in it, on
account of the vicinity between the matter of the Sunbeams
and our Subtile or Aethereal Matter; And thus we are past
the two Impregnable Wards of this Inchanted <hi>Labyrinth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You will look perhaps that I should examine all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
and Energies of <hi>Magnetical</hi> Bodies, and should solve
every particular <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> by this <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> but if you
do you will be deceived, for I am not yet so prodigal of
my Time or of my Paper, which of late is very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
risen, as I suppose you have e're this experienced, and
therefore am of Opinion that the explication of these Five
Properties following may suffice.</p>
            <p>First, the <hi>Magnet</hi> (for now we come to particular cases)
if it be unrestrain'd and have its just Liberty, will turn about
till its <hi>North</hi> Pole directly answers the <hi>South</hi> Pole of the
<hi>Earth,</hi> and its <hi>South</hi> Pole the <hi>North</hi> Pole of the <hi>Earth:</hi> Of
which conversion I need not repeat to you the cause, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
already so lately and largely spoke of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If two <hi>Magnets</hi> lye at a convenient distance
one from the other, and their <hi>Poles</hi> be disposed for their
Accession, as when the <hi>North</hi> Pole of the one faces the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29908:6"/>
               <hi>South</hi> Pole of the other, or the <hi>South</hi> Pole of the one faces
the <hi>North</hi> Pole of the other, they will close, and if their
<hi>Poles</hi> are laid just contrary wise they mutually retreat, for
you must know the Aethereal Matter which effects to move
in a <hi>Mathematicaly</hi> Circular Line, upon invading the sides of
the <hi>Magnet,</hi> finding few or no <hi>Pores</hi> to receive it, the main
course or grain of the <hi>Pores</hi> lying extended from <hi>Pole</hi> to
<hi>Pole,</hi> deviates from its regular Line of Motion and flowing
round all parts of the <hi>Magnets</hi> Superficies, falls into a kind
of Vortex on all sides of the inclosed Body; when therefore
two <hi>Magnets</hi> are situate at such a distance off each other that
the intermediate Space is too close and narrow to Transmit
the influxes of so much of the Aethereal Matter as is carried
round the approximated <hi>Poles</hi> of both <hi>Magnet</hi>'s, the Influxes
unite and generate one Vortex common to them both,
which cannot come to pass but at the same time the devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Aethereal Matter from its regulare line of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will encrease, and consequently with it its Propensity
to recover it again, whereupon must ensue a stronger Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
and Protrusion than ever upon the exteriour <hi>Poles</hi>
of both <hi>Magnets,</hi> they being the Points of its widest devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to their Impression the <hi>Magnets</hi> giving way imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
close, so that the nearer they lie to one another, the
stronger is the Impression upon their exteriour <hi>Poles,</hi> the
weaker the resistance of the Interposing Matter, the fud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainer
their Concourse, and the firmer their Unition, <hi>&amp;



vice versâ.</hi> The requisiteness of their Dinominal <hi>Poles</hi> facing
one another is plain, because that Position which is natural
to them, separately consider'd, cannot but be the most
suitable for their Unition; and the reason of their flying
one another when their Cognomininal <hi>Poles</hi> are Approxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
is this. The Central Parts of the Vorticle wherein
both <hi>Magnets</hi> are immers'd, conform as in all Vortexes
whatsoever to the Motion of the exteriour Parts, and that
is as we have just observ'd, a Deviation or Distraction or
equal Division of the Vortex it self toward either Point
<hi>North</hi> or <hi>South,</hi> and such by consequence must the distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
be of the Central Parts of the Vortex, and therefore
acting with equal strength on both sides, if those of one
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29908:7"/>
side, that is toward the Polar parts of the <hi>Magnet,</hi> on one
side meet with so disagreable a Texture of Parts, as obliges
them to retire unsuccesful, and those which act on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side or toward the Polar parts of the opposite <hi>Magnet</hi>
are more mildly received, as it will be when their Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Poles</hi> are placed over against one another, this would be
apt to drive away one of the <hi>Magnets</hi> from the other, were
not the Impression of the external Parts of the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Vorticle more powerful than that of such Central Parts;
but when the Cognominal <hi>Poles</hi> of both <hi>Magnets</hi> face each
other, the Impression of the Central Parts of the Vortex on
both sides will be equal, and their mutual renitency will as
easily overpower the Impression of the external Parts of
the Vortex, as a Man that should be to bend the Body of
a young Tree, though with one Hand singly he were not
able to move it, yet when he set his other Hand against the
Body of another Tree of equal growth, would find it in his
power to bend them both. The following Draught will
Illustrate this.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>Thirdly, If two <hi>Magnets</hi> be duly dispos'd, one will support
and sustain the other in the <hi>Air,</hi> as also a <hi>Magnet</hi> will in like
manner sustain a peice of <hi>Iron,</hi> which is very easily accounted
for, the second <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> being well understood, for being
first united in the manner there describ'd, their Cohaesion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:29908:7"/>
must be as valid and tenacious by reason of the pressure of
the Aethereal Matter upon their Superficies, as is the Cohae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of two Polished Marbles thro' the compression of the
External <hi>Air;</hi> and the same is to be said of <hi>Iron,</hi> which as
was hinted before to you, seems to be but a Bastard <hi>Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, A <hi>Loadstone</hi> will Communicate its Faculties
and Affections to <hi>Iron:</hi> for you are to remember that <hi>Iron</hi>
is of a Congenial Nature with the <hi>Magnet</hi> it self, and that
therefore it requires but a little Modification to render it
compleatly <hi>Magnetical,</hi> which Modification it under goes
from the <hi>Loadstone</hi> as it lies in its proper posture, for altho'
the <hi>Loadstone</hi> does not then abound with or discharge the
Aethereal Matter in such Plenty as when it is laid with it
<hi>Poles East,</hi> and <hi>West,</hi> yet a more moderate Concoction and
Ebullition of the same kind of Matter continues, which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
being effected among the Springs of the <hi>Magnet,</hi>
the Aethereal Matter which is agitated and Concocted must
of necessity receive such a peculiarity of Motion as the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
lying among and between those Springs will Model it
into, and issuing out of the <hi>Magnets Poles</hi> in such a Motion
it enters the <hi>Pores</hi> of the Applicated <hi>Iron,</hi> where finding at
once a larger Liberty (the <hi>Pores</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi> being more lax than
those of the <hi>Magnet</hi>) and also new Recruits of other Aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
Matter, which enters the large <hi>Pores</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi> at all parts
of it alike till such <hi>Iron</hi> is <hi>Magneticis'd,</hi> it aestuates with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
vigour, joins forces with the Aethereal Matter that it finds
in the <hi>Iron,</hi> Communicates to it the same Species of Motion,
and both in Conjunction, Purge, Polish, Frame, and in all
respects prepare those Particles of the <hi>Iron</hi> which are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of being wrought into <hi>Magnetical</hi> Springs, and when
by such a course they are wrought into those Springs, the
<hi>Iron</hi> becomes compleatly <hi>Magnetical;</hi> for as the Coadjution
of the Cock is required toward the Perfectionating those Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
Principles the matter whereof rests in the Ovary of the
Hen, and without such Coadjution would prove at best A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bortive:
so there appears a necessity of the <hi>Irons</hi> receiving the
influx of the Aethereal Matter, which was Model'd in the
<hi>Magnet,</hi> to beget such a Motion of its own Aethereal Matter
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29908:8"/>
as might compleat its <hi>Magnetism,</hi> which Analogy I think
fairly explains the whole Supposition.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Magnetical</hi> Bodies are divested of their Qualities
either by Rust or Excandefaction, or if they are confin'd
any length of time to a forc'd and violent Position: The
first partly Corroding, partly Distempering, and partly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbering
the little Springs; the second utterly destroying
them, and the third suffering Malignant and Heterogeneous
Matter to disturb and Choak them.</p>
            <p>So much good Friend, for our Physical consideration
of <hi>Magnetical</hi> Bodies, for I am very loath to examine
all those other Phaenomena, which patienter Naturalists
in better times have enumerated, especially since those
already discussed are the most difficultly solv'd of any of
them. If you are angry to see coarse Fare garnished with
such variety of hard Words, which I must confess is a
fault much in vogue among our <hi>Philosophers,</hi> and after all
is no more than a <hi>Vacuum Disseminatum</hi> in their Books, I
must e'n tell you I could not help it; Delicacy of Subject
and Newness of Notion (such as it is) would have it so;
nor can I take offence if my Opinion in a Matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
many have wrote much to little purpose, merit not
your Approbation. To feed my imagination with hopes
of success after the disappointments of such Heroes of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,</hi>
were as Sawcy and Presumptious, as it would have
been in one of <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Wives to pretend to beat her
Husband after he had Conquered his twelve Labours;
nay, so little do I promise my self of any thing like it,
that I am very apt to believe all our Inquiries into the
Causes of <hi>Magnetical</hi> Operations are next to desperate,
and will ever be so. Indeed the All-wise Authour of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
seems to have design'd them not so much Objects of
our Curiosity, as matter of our Admiration, and I might
add of our Imitation; for where is there that Emblem or
<hi>Hieroglyphick</hi> which in so lively Colours represents the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and Morals of Mankind? The Malicious and Quarel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
World see themselves Mock'd while they behold two
Stones fly on another for no other Reason than an innate
Natural Aversation. again the Covetous may blush to see
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:29908:8"/>
in the manner of the <hi>Magnet</hi>'s Communication the Picture
of one at Home, who instead of spending any part of his
Treasure upon himself, spends himself wholly upon that.
again it's perpetual Affection of the same Points of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphere,</hi>
exposes the Ambitious and Voluptuous, whose
Souls are so link'd to Greatness and Pleasure, that they
seem to have forfeited the Priviledge of a free Will. On
the other Hand it tacitly teaches Rational and Sober Men
the necessity of directing their Designs and Actions all to
one end, and in Order thereto of preserving a mutual Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animity
amongst themselves. As therefore the <hi>Magnet</hi>
seems primarily, and especially to be deputed to this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
use, for in the whole Republick of Nature, there is not
an inanimate Body more edifying, nor certainly an animate
more inscrutable, so does it discharge this function in a
manner most punctual and at the same time most unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible.
and in this Instance as in many others, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiousness
and Utility of the Phaenomena compensate for
their Latency and Obscurity; for as for those artificial Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
we have taught it to serve, particularly in Navigation,
they do not appear to have been the Genuin and Natural
ends of it they being altogether Precarious and Contingent;
so that the study of its Instructions is much more safe and
benificial than the study of its Construction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and did <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi>
observe this Rule in all their <hi>Philosophical</hi> enquiries, it
would make much more for the credit of their Profession,
and be of greater advantage to Mankind in general; we
should have less of their Errors and more of their Reason;
and that Science which has lost its Reputation by its Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and Presumptions, would by these means more than
recover it; nay, doubtless a clear Knowledg of the true
uses of things, would give us a better Light into the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of them, then their Nature gives us into the uses of
them. But I decline the Prosecution of this Argument as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
been so Particularly and Elegantly manag'd in the Case
before you, by a learned Gentleman of the last Age;
this only I will add, That whether any or all our Disquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of this kind succeed or fail, we shall have still new
Motives of expressing our Praise and Veneration to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29908:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Lord of all things; our Praise when they succed for
his having permitted the Children of Men to know so much
of the Methods of his Providence, and our Veneration
where they fail. For who can do other than adore and
revere the infinite Power and Wisdom of the Creator,
When the noblest of humane Faculties are not able with the
nicest Inspection to make any satisfactory discovery of the
Frame and Constitution of the Creature. Let therefore that
<hi>Orizon</hi> with which we lately terminated our Discourse, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this Letter. That the Omnipotent Authour of all
things would bestow on his Rational Creatures with their
Knowledg a proportionable largess of Grace to use it to
his Honour and Glory, and our own Spiritual Improvement.
I hope all our Friends in the Country thrive.</p>
