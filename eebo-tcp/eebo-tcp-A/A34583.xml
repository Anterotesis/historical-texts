            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> from none but You, will hear his Doom,</l>
            <l>He hates th' obsequious Flatteries of <hi>Rome</hi>:</l>
            <l>He scorns, where once he rul'd, now to be try'd,</l>
            <l>And he hath rul'd in all the World beside.</l>
            <l>When he the <hi>Thames,</hi> the <hi>Danube,</hi> and the <hi>Nile</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Had stain'd with Blood, Peace flourished in this Isle;</l>

            <l>Great <hi>Pompey</hi> too, comes as a suppliant here,</l>

               <pb facs="tcp:54519:4"/>He knows your equal Iustice, and (to tell</l>

                  <l>Fortune as well as justice on their side:</l>
                  <l>And thou shalt see there, with new fury hurl'd,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Pharsalia</hi>'s Ruines arm another World.</l>
                  <l>From Rank to Rank these Ashes I'll expose</l>
                  <l>Mixt with my Tears, t' exasperate thy Foes.</l>
                  <l>My Hate shall guide them too, and they shall fight</l>
                  <l>With Urns, instead of Eagles in their sight;</l>
                  <l>That such sad Objects may make them intent</l>
                  <l>On his Revenge, and on thy Punishment.</l>
                  <l>Thou to this <hi>Hero</hi> now devout art grown,</l>
                  <l>But, raising his Name, do'st exalt thy own.</l>
                  <l>I must be Witness too! and I submit;</l>
                  <l>But thou canst never move my Heart with it.</l>
                  <l>My Loss can never be repair'd by Fate,</l>
                  <l>Nor is it possible t'exhaust my Hate.</l>
                  <l>This Hate shall be my <hi>Pompey</hi> now, and I</l>
                  <l>In his Revenge will live, and with it die.</l>
                  <l>But as a Roman, though my Hate be such,</l>
                  <l>I must confess, I thee esteem as much.</l>
                  <l>Both these extreams justice can well allow:</l>
                  <l>This does my Virtue, that my Duty show.</l>
                  <l>My sense of Honour does the first command,</l>

                  <l>And as thy Virtue, whom none can betray,</l>
                  <l>Where I should hate, makes me such value pay:</l>
                  <l>My Duty so my Anger does create,</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Widow makes <hi>Cornelia</hi> hate.</l>
                  <l>And I from hence shall hasten, and know then,</l>
                  <l>I'll raise against thee Gods, as well as Men.</l>
                  <l>Those Gods that flatter'd thee and me abus'd,</l>
                  <l>And in <hi>Pharsalia Pompey</hi>'s Cause refus'd;</l>
