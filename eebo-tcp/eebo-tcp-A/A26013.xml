         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Prowels and Valour, in ſuch a nature, that the Count de <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zun,</hi> General of the <hi>French</hi> Forces, not being willing to give the <hi>Engliſh</hi> the opportunity of Signalizing their Courage a ſecond time, having already ſufficiently experimented the Effects thereof, on the River <hi>Boyne</hi>; and thereupon, gave Orders for all the <hi>French</hi> to draw thereout, with what Baggage they could poſſibly convey, and take their March towards <hi>Galloway,</hi> carrying with him Eight Pieces of Cannon, ſome Arms and Ammunition, giving out, to delude the ſimple <hi>Iriſh,</hi> That he had Expreſs Orders from his Maſter, to take Shipping, to aſſiſt the reſt of the <hi>French</hi> King's Forces, that were making a deſcent in the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts of <hi>England,</hi> which by Five <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Walloon</hi> Deſerters was brought to the King, having the day before arrived at his Camp, within 8 or 10 Miles of the place: And alſo confirmed by many others, with the addition, That Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Lutterell,</hi> with three Companies of <hi>Iriſh,</hi> had taken poſſeſſion thereof; and 'tis not to be doubted, but they will gladly accept of His Majeſties Mercy, and Surrender the ſame. To which end, the King has Expedited a conſiderable Detachment, with a peremptory Summons to the Governour, to deliver it up; which, by our next, we ſhall be able to give a more ample Account of that proceeding, there being above 60 heavy Cannon for Battery, and 20 Mortars, drawing before it.

            <p>By Letters from <hi>Paris</hi> we have Received certain Information, That the <hi>French</hi> King has Ordered 12 or 14 Ships for <hi>Galloway</hi> to fetch off the Remains of his Troops, which are Reduced to near 5000. That the Lord <hi>Tyrconnell</hi> intended for <hi>France</hi> with Monſieur <hi>de Lauſun,</hi> and they were ſending away their Baggage. That many of the Iriſh had followed the <hi>French</hi> to <hi>Galloway</hi>; and that a good number of others, who were diſcontented at the Lord <hi>Tyrconnell</hi>'s Proceedings, were retired to the Mountains of <hi>Kerry.</hi>
