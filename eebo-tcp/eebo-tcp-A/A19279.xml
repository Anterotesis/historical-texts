            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:11548:3"/>
make our fraile bodyes, as it were, the Temple of the bleſſed Trynitie, And not only that he would make his dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place in vs, but alſo abyde with vs for euer, that we might by him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioye eternal life. Theſe ſwéete allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhould not onely moue the hart of Chriſtians to pietie and godlineſſe, but alſo cauſe vs to haue an earneſt &amp; carefull conſideration of our ſoules health and not to neglect this time of grace whereinthe long ſuffring of God doth mercifully call vs to repentance. But lamentable it is, and it woulde make any true Chriſtian heart bléede to conſider, that the moſt part of vs are not onely ſo careleſſe and negligent, but ſo dul of hearing, and ſo heard har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as we take no héed of gentle ſpeche, we be not mooued with ſwéete allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yea, we be ſo a ſlepe in ſecuritie as no ſounde or noyſe of Gods mercie will wake vs out of our deadly flom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>Wherefore ſéeing mercie and milde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe will not preuaile with our care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb facs="tcp:11548:3"/>
mindes, ſéeing ſwéete and gentle ſpeeche wil not waken our ſléepie and ſluggiſh hearts, we muſt be contented this daye to heare him make terrible proclamation of his iuſtice, and to put vs in minde of that dreadfull danger, that we ſhal fal into, vnleſſe we ſpéede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue regard vnto our ſouls. <hi>VVhat doth it auaile a man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if he win the vvhole vvorlde and looſe his owne ſoule, for it shal come to paſſe that the ſonne of man &amp;c.</hi> The ſomme of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes ſpéeche is this. <hi>The ſonne of man aſſuredlie shall come vvith mightye povver to iudge the vvorlde, and giue to euerie man according to his deſerts: therfore it behoueth you to haue care of your ſoules.</hi> This ſhort argument comprehendeth great and ample mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of ſome part whereof I meane at this time by Gods ſufferance to ſpeak, and firſt of the Antecedent, and then of the concluſion. Firſt therefore I will let you vnderſtande that the daye of iudgement ſhall be, and that ſpéedely. Secondly how and after what ſort it
<pb facs="tcp:11548:4"/>
ſhalbe. And then wil I adde the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, how we ſhoulde haue care of our ſoules and prepare our ſelues for the comming of that day.</p>
            <p>That there ſhalbe a iudgement, If there were no more places in the whole ſcripture, this one might be ſufficient, eſpecially if we conſider who it is that ſpeaketh it, that is, Chriſt our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,<note place="margin">Matt. 16.</note> the Sonne of God and trueth it ſelfe. <hi>It shal come to paſſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the ſonne of man shal come in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Father with his Angels, and then shal he giue to euerie man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his doings.</hi> But beſide this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie the holy Ghoſt in ſundry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Scripture beareth witneſſe to the ſame. <hi>Novv</hi> (ſaith S. Paul) <hi>God denounceth to al men in al places that<note place="margin">Act. 17.</note> they should repent, becauſe he hath ſet a day vvherein he vvil by that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vvhome he hath appointed, iudge the vvorlde in righteouſneſſe.</hi> And againe: <hi>vve al shall appeare before the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeate of Chriſt that euerie man<note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> may yelde to God an accompt for him
<pb facs="tcp:11548:4"/>
ſelfe.</hi> And to the Corinthians: <hi>vve muſt<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.</note> al appeare before the iudgement ſeate of Chriſt, that euerie man maye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the vvorkes of his bodie accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that he hath done, be it good<note place="margin">Dan. 7. Zach. 14 Mat. 25. 26. Iohn. 5. Apoc. 1. 2. Pet. 3. 1. Cor. 15.</note> or badde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what ſhould I ſtand in reko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vp of manie teſtimonies ſeing the holy Scriptures are ful of them? And therefore the Apoſtles of Chriſt, &amp; after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the holy Fathers of the firſt Church haue layd it downe as a neceſſarie ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Chriſtian faith, the denying or doubting wherof muſt nedes ſubuert al Chriſtian religion, and make vs the moſt miſerable of al men.</p>
            <p>Wherefore Chriſtians that haue féeble and wauering faith, in theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and daungerous dayes, muſt ſéeke by all godly meanes to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then their conſciences herein, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto this reaſon following muſt be of great waight and importance with al them that haue any ſenſe of God.</p>
            <p>The Prophetes of God many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeres before Chriſt came in fleſh,
<pb facs="tcp:11548:5"/>
denounced vnto the worlde, that the true Sauiour Chriſte Jeſus ſhould be ſent to worke the redemption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynde, and deſcriueth his Conception, his Natiuitie, the place and maner of his birth, his ſtate and condition in the world, finally his death, his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and aſcention. All which things we ſée haue vnfallibly come to paſſe many yeres ſince. Therefore thoſe things, that they haue propheſied of the laſt day, and of his comming to iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, muſt alſo proue as true, and as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinly in due time come to paſſe. But happily many be ſo farre gon in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſhe infidelitie, that they beléeue not the Scriptures, yea they will ſcoffe and ſcorne at this talke, and thinke it is no better tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a bug to feare babes withall. Yea and theſe happyly ſhall be in no ſmall place and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in the world. For the world is ſo great with them, that they forget God altogether. Of theſe ſpeaketh S. Peter. <hi>There shall come</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>in<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.</note> the latter dayes ſcorners, vvalking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:11548:5"/>
their ovvn luſt, and ſaying, vvhere is the promiſe of his comming? For ſince the fathers ſlept, all things conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue a like from the beginning of the creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Who heareth not ſuch voyces ſpread co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly among the iolieſt ſort of men in this worlde, or if many doe not heare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who is it, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> by the obſtinate contempt of Gods holy worde, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain of his meſſengers, and by the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brideled looſeneſſe of mens liues, may not iuſtly gather, that this opinion is in the hearts of very many? But I wil anſwere them as S. Peter in effect doth immediately folowing, that is, that heauen and earth doth ſo long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, becauſe they are preſerued by the worde of their almightie Creator and maker, who as by his worde he made it of nothing, ſo, when he ſhall appoint the time, it ſhall ende and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe, for the ſame worde, that had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to make the worlde of nothing: hath alſo like power, when it ſhall ſeeme good, to diſſolue it. For pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e here of: the world continued from the firſt
<pb facs="tcp:11548:6"/>
creation, vntill the generall deluge of <hi>Noah,</hi> being appointed by the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned decree of Gods holy prouidence that it ſhould ſo do, and when the ſame almightie worde of God had ſayd, that for ſinne he would deſtroy the whole worlde with water, it was without ſtay perfourmed. Therefore ſéeing the ſame prouidence by his holy ſpirit hath ſayde alſo that in the ende it ſhall be conſumed with fire, the ſame worde ſhall as aſſuredly be veryfied. For<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> heauen and earth ſhall periſhe and paſſe away in vanitie, but the worde of God ſhall not periſh, but that euery iote thereof ſhal be perfourmed. But, as I haue ſayd, theſe men make ſmall account of Gods worde, I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leaue Chriſtians, and turne my ſelfe to Heathens and Paganes, for ſuche are theſe ſcorning and looſe Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures of whome S. Peter ſpeaketh, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they hide themſelues vnder the cloakes of Chriſtians. I aſke them therefore, whether they beléeue there is a God or no? If they will ſay no:
<pb facs="tcp:11548:6"/>
               <hi>For the foolish hath ſaide in his heart, there is no God:</hi> Then will I, will them to beholde the whole world, and the maruellous workemanſhip there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The Sunne, the Moone, the ſtarres and planets, with the wonderfull mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and courſe of the ſame, the earth, the water, the ayre, and all the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full furniture thereof, beaſtes, trées, plantes, foules, fyſhes, rayne, haile, thunder, lightning, with the reſidue of Gods maruellous workes in his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the maner of growing, brée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and encreaſing of the ſame, and vndoubtedly the almightie power, the excéeding wiſedome and vneſtimable goodneſſe that ſhall appeare in theſe things, muſt néedes conuince them in their owne conſciences that there is a God, which in ſo excéeding and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maner hath framed them. Yea, if he be worthy the name of a man, let himſelfe conſider but the framing of a litle babe in his mothers wombe, from ſéed to ſkynne, ſinews, veynes, arteries, bones, fleſh, lyfe and reaſonable ſoule,
<pb facs="tcp:11548:7"/>
and verie reaſon it ſelfe will tell him, that it is an euerlaſting power that doeth it. For the weighing thereof hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uinced the conſciences of great learned Philoſophers, that haue ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to perſuade them ſelues the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Oh wil they ſay, theſe are done by courſe of nature.</p>
            <p>Why, and what is that they call Nature? or what is it, that doeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recte that courſe? is it any thing elſe then the finger of God working in his creatures? <hi>Seneca</hi> an heathen Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher can witneſſe ſo much. Séeing then there muſt néedes be a God, let them reaſon thus with themſelues. If there be a God, he muſt néedes be a iuſt God, and the office of iuſtice is to rewarde them that be good, and to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them that be euill. For this direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the ſame God by nature hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in vs. But in this lyfe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God oftentimes ſhewe ſome notable examples of his iuſtice, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding the good, and puniſhing the euill, yet moſt commonly the wicked doe proſper and flouriſhe, as Dauid

delight that they had in theſe pleaſures &amp; ornamentes of the world, repoſing ſuche confidence in them, as though the world ſhould for euer haue continued, and as if there had béene none other heauen to haue reſted in but this. And in the truſt hereof dyd they neglect the preaching, warning &amp; calling to repentance vſed by Noe and Loth, euen vntill Gods wrath came vpon them: and euen in like maner doth Chriſt ſignifie that it ſhould be in the ende of the worlde. And when I praye you was there, ſince the worlde was firſt made, ſo great ſecuritie in ſinne, ſuch contempt of godlineſſe, ſuch confidence in worldlye proſperite, ſuche feaſting, banquetting, and daintie feeding, ſuch gorgeouſneſſe in apparell, ſuch ſumptuouſneſſe in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſuche vnſeaſonable marrying, ſuch planting, ſuch building, ſuch buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and purchaſing, ſuche raking and ſcraping together of worldly pelfe, as if men did determine to abyde ſtill vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of the earth, or as if euerie
<pb facs="tcp:11548:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
man did ſtriue to paſſe other in riot &amp; ſenſualitie, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue conſumed them ſelues with monſtrous exceſſe in all pleaſure, then not contented with that they haue, by hooke or by crooke they pull from other, euen from the miniſters of Chriſte, euen from the church of God, euen from the prechers of the Goſpell, and poore ſeruantes of God, which euen among the heathens haue alwayes had their honourable portion left vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherfore howe they doe eſtéeme the true worſhip of God in theſe days, men do ſhew, when they declare ſuche impietie towardes his miniſters. And when they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued for theſe enormyties, it is ſo farre off that they doe repent and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende, that they ſcoffe and ieſte, they rayle and ſlander, they taunte and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue, as if they were at defiance with God and his meſſangers, or as if they had made a couenant with death and with hell, to be out of their danger. But when they ſay peace, peace, all is ſure, then ſodainly, as Paule ſayth, ſhall deſtruction come vpon them, as
<pb facs="tcp:11548:18"/>
the Deluge did vpon the ſonnes of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the dayes of Noe, and fire from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vpon Sodom, in the time of Loth. For euer before the horrible plagues of God, obſtinate ſecuritie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Gods calling, hath gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a meſſanger, and ſhewed it ſelf in the lyfe of men.</p>
            <p>The fourth teſtimonie of the ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy comming of the laſt daye, is the wordes of Sainte Paule. <hi>2. Tim. 3. Knovve you this</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>that in the latter dayes shall be perillous times, for men shall be louers of them ſelues, couetous, boaſters, proude, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, diſobedient to parents, vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, vngodly vvithout naturall affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, truce breakers, falſe accuſers, ryo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, fierce, deſpiſers of them that are good, traitors, headie, high minded, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of pleaſures, more then louers of God, hauing a fourme of godlines, but denying the povver thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who would not thinke that Saint Paule did in ſpirite, foreſée the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of this time, and theſe dayes
<pb facs="tcp:11548:19"/>
into which we are falne, and thoſe wic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked vices, wherwith the world is now ouerwhelmed. What ſtate of men is there in which moſt of theſe vices doe not ſhew them ſelues, and that in ſuch maner, as neuer in any age the like? what ſlacke and corrupt gouernment in Magiſtrates? what ſtubbourneſſe and diſobedience in ſubiectes? what pryde and ſelfe liking in the riche and wealthy? what ſpite and enuie in the poore and beggerly? what looſeneſſe and wantonneſſe in youth, what couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and waywardneſſe in age? what cockering and euill enſample of life in parentes? what dnnaturalneſſe and vnkyndneſſe in children? what heady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and fierceneſſe in maiſters? what negligence and vntruth in ſeruantes? what craft, ſubtiltie, and deceyte, what counterfayting and diſſymuling, what falſe and vniuſt dealing, almoſt in all men? Trueth and ſinceritie is bany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, couſoning and falſhoode is eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med wiſedome, and chriſtian ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is counted péeuiſhe follie. A man
<pb facs="tcp:11548:19"/>
would in theſe dayes maruell to heare of that playne dealing that in old time hath bene. I haue hearde that the gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of a mans hande, ſhould haue aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured his heart, and tyed his fayth and trothe, but nowe all the bondes that mans wit can deuiſe, will ſcantly hold that whiche one couenanteth with an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>other. If there were no other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the ripeneſſe that ſinne and wickedneſſe is nowe growen vnto, it ſhould ſufficiently proue that the glory of this world muſt ſhortly fall &amp; decay.</p>
            <p>There is an olde ſaying of much cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite among the ewes, and is called <hi>dictum domus Eliae,</hi> the ſaying of the ſchole of Elias, and is attributed to the ſonne of the widowe, which Elias ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from death to lyfe. The ſumme of it is, that the worlde ſhould remayne ſixe thouſande yeres, that is, two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand before the law, two thouſand vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the lawe, and two thouſand vnder Meſſiah. The firſt foure thouſande we ſée by iuſt computation fulfilled before Chriſte, of the laſt two, one and more
<pb facs="tcp:11548:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
then an halfe is paſſed, nowe if we call to our remembrance, that Chriſte him ſelfe hath promiſed that for his electe ſake, becauſe of the excéeding trouble, miſerie, and wickedneſſe, the latter dayes ſhould be ſhortned, we ſhall eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gather, that the world hath not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeres to continue, and howe fewe we knowe not, for howe much or how litle he will abridge them, we are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certeine.</p>
            <p>Nowe ſéeing the proofes be ſo eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the laſt day can not be farre of (for ſéeing the figge trée leaues be ſpreade, Sommer muſt néedes be at hande) the nexte is (the more to moue our dull hearts) diligently to conſider, howe and in what maner it ſhall be. The ſtory thereof Chriſt briefly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth, <hi>Mat. 25. VVhen the ſonne of man</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>shall come in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and all the holy Angels vvith him, then shall he ſitte on the throne of his glory, and before him shall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered al nations, and he shal ſeparate them one from another, as the shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:11548:20"/>
               <hi>deuideth his sheepe from the goates, and he shall ſet the sheepe on the right hande, but the goates on the left,</hi> &amp; ſo forth as there foloweth. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes firſt comming was with al méeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, lowlines &amp; ſimplicitie, according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaying of the Prophet, <hi>Behold thy king commeth to thee meeke, and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth<note place="margin">Zach. 9.</note> vpon an Aſſe.</hi> He came then to ſaue ſinners, and therefore he ſhewed him ſelfe altogether in mercy and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſſe, but his latter comming ſhall be with great power, maieſtie and glory, for then he commeth as a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Judge, to reward in iuſtice the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repentant ſinners, that contemned his great mercies offered at his firſte comming. But let vs examine the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his comming ſomewhat more particularly. After thoſe ſignes and tokens, that goe before his comming (whereof I haue already ſpoken) there be other alſo ioyned with the verie time of his latter appearing. <hi>The ſun shall be darkened, the moone shall loſe her light, the ſtarres shall fall from</hi>

               <hi>heauen, and the povvers of heauen shall be moued,</hi> the earth ſhall burne, the firmament ſhall melt away, and the laſt trumpe ſhall blowe, and the voyce of the Archangell ſhal be heard, ſummoning as it were all people, aud ſounding in their eares, <hi>Surgite mortui &amp; venite ad iudicium,</hi> ariſe you dead and come to iudgement, whiche<note place="margin">Matt. 24. 25 26.

            <p>This maner of Chriſt his comming beſide his owne wordes in ſundrie places of the Euangeliſtes, is witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 1.</note> by S.

For where were the Prophetes ſtaine? where was Chriſte put to death? where were the Apoſtles perſecuted and kylled? was it not in Jeruſalem the citie of God? was it not among the Jewes the choſen people, and in déede, the churche of God? had not they among them the lawe of God and his ordinances? did not they crye againſt Jeremie, <hi>the Temple of God, the Temple of God</hi> is with vs, we haue the couenant that God made to our forefathers, euen as nowe the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes doe alledge that <hi>the Church of God, the Church of God</hi> is with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they can not erre, they haue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Chriſt, that his Spirit ſhould neuer fayle them. The falſe Prophets

<pb facs="tcp:11548:29"/>
the doctrine of deuils, hauinge their conſciences marked with an hot iron, forbidding to marrie and to eate ſuch meats as God hath prepared to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued vvith thankeſgiuing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider whether the Pope hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Prieſts to marrie, and denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it a grieuous ſinne if men doe eate fleſh vpon certeine dayes, and then ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whether they be the Churche of Chriſt, or vnder that colour in déed the Synagogue of Antichriſt. Oh ſay they the doctrine of the Goſpel now taught is a new doctrine neuer heard of in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Church before theſe late yeres. This is not a ſheepe ſkinne (good people) but it is a venimous tuſke of a poyſonous Bore with blaſphemous lying, ſtriken into the Goſpell of Chriſte thereby to wounde it, and make it hatefull. But the Goſpel that we teache is the ſame Goſpel that was firſt from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by the Spirit of God reueiled to the Patriarkes, and Prophets, and after ſpred into the worlde by Chriſt himſelfe and his Apoſtles. So that our
<pb facs="tcp:11548:30"/>
doctrine is as auncient as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as Chriſt himſelfe, as his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, yea, as the worlde is auncient.</p>
            <p>For it procéeded from God himſelfe at the beginning, when he ſpake to the Serpent and ſayd, <hi>That the ſeed of the vvoman should breake the head of the Serpent,</hi> That is, that the true <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> ſhould come of the ſéede of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and deſtroy the kingdome of ſiune and Satan. This Goſpell was renued vnto Abraham, and confirmed with the ſeale of circumciſion. When he ſaid, <hi>In thy ſeede all the nations of the earth shalbe bleſſed, &amp;c.</hi> This Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell was preached by Father Jacob, in his death bedde ſaying, <hi>This ſcepter<note place="margin">Gen. 49.</note> shal not depart from Iuda, &amp;c. Vntill Silo come &amp; he shal be the expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Gentiles.</hi> This Goſpel preached Moſes alſo, <hi>The Lord thy God</hi> (ſaith he) to the children of Iſrael, <hi>shall rayſe vp to thee a Prophet out of thine own<note place="margin">Deut. 18.</note> people, and from among thy brethren and him shalt thou heare.</hi> This Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel was renued by God himſelfe vnto
<pb facs="tcp:11548:30"/>
Dauid moſt euidently, and afterward by al the Prophets, <hi>Eſaie, Ieremie, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiel, Daniel,</hi> and al the reſidue. So that our doctrine and the Goſpel that we preache (as I haue ſaid) is as aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as the Apoſtles, as the Prophets and Patriarkes, as the worlde it ſelfe is auncient.</p>
            <p>For our Goſpell is none other but this, that we haue remiſſion of ſinnes, and are reconcyled to the fauoure of God onely by Chriſt and by his death, that he onely is the mediatour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſour betwene God and vs. That he onely is propitiation and full ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for our ſinnes, that by him onely we be made the children of God, and heires of eternal lyfe. All doctrines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeing with this we receiue, all doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines repugnant to this we reiecte &amp; ſay with S. Ambroſe, <hi>Quaecunque Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus non docuit iure damnamus:</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. Chriſt hath not taught we iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and worthily condemne. Therefore doe we iuſtly condemne the moſt part of the papiſtical doctrine as newe and
<pb facs="tcp:11548:31"/>
phantaſtical, becauſe it doth not agrée with this auncient Goſpell of Chriſt vttered from the beginning by God himſelfe, but reſteth vpon the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of mens traditions, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writen verities, deuiſed within the ſpace of a fewe hundred yeres vtterly againſt and beſide the worde of God.</p>
            <p>Satan in theſe latter dayes to worke ſuſpition to the doctrine of the Goſpel at this time by Gods great goodneſſe renewed, hath raiſed alſo manie other peruerſe and wicked teachers, as the Arrians denying the deitie of Chriſt. The Anabaptiſtes, beſide manie other errours improouinge the grace and ſtrength of baptiſme in infants. The Libert ines diſſoluing all true confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of faith and practiſe of godly life. The familiars of loue in whome Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan turneth himſelfe into an Angel of light, and vnder pretence of holy life bringeth in moſt pernitious errours and hereſies. Therefore, I ſaye vnto you of al theſe, beware, and take héede that you be not ſeduced, and ſettle

For therin we ſhal both acknowledge the trueth of his worde, who long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath tolde vs it ſhoulde be ſo, and alſo we ſhall euidently ſée, that he is that mightie Lorde and God, that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promiſe, is able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all that he hath ſayde, and vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to vanquiſh, ſubdue, and treade vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foote, all theſe powers, whatſoeuer y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are enemies to his electe and choſen flocke. The worlde they ſée deſtroyed before them: death ended and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſinne confounded, Satan and all his powers euen at the laſt caſt, and looking preſently to be throwen into that lake of fire, that is prepared for him and for his angels. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue then nothing to feare, howe ſhould we

not be in moſte perfite ioy. All thoſe things bréed comfort to the godly, that cauſe terrour to other. Though the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination &amp; account be verie ſtreight, though Satan ſhall lay before vs the booke of our own conſciences to accuſe vs, we ſhal eaſily diſburde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our ſelues, by acknowledging the things, and by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſing that there is in our ſelues no iuſtice in confidence, when we dare that day ſtand in iudgement, and that oure whole truſt and confidence, is in the innocent death of that immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Lambe, that dyed to take away the ſinnes of the whole worlde: and for aſſurance thereof, we ſhall ſhewe acquittances of his moſt bleſſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and vpon them with the hande of our fayth, lay ſure hold. For he hath ſayde, <hi>God ſent not his ſonne into the vvorlde to iudge the vvorld, but that the vvorlde shoulde be ſaued by him. He that beleeueth in him is not iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</hi> And agayne. <hi>So God loued the vvorld, that he gaue his only begotten ſonne, that vvho ſo euer doth beleeue</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:11548:37"/>
               <hi>on him, should not perishe, but haue lyfe euerlaſting.</hi> And agayne, <hi>He that heareth my vvorde, and beleeueth in him that ſent me, hath life euerlaſting, and commeth not into iudgement. but paſſeth from death to life.</hi> And if Satan ſhall lay any falſe thing vnto vs, or charge vs with the weakneſſe of our fayth: to oure vneſtimable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, we ſhall ſée on our right hande as it were the fruites of our faith, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed in chriſtian charitie, which the iudge him ſelfe ſhall not onely teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to be done, but acknowledge them to be done vnto him ſelfe, by ſaying, <hi>I vvas hungry, and ye gaue me to eate, I vvas thirſtie, and ye gaue me to drinke, I vvas a ſtranger, and you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terteyned me, &amp;c. So often as you did one of theſe things to the ſmalleſt of your brethren, I acknovvledge it to be done vnto my ſelfe.</hi> And therefore we ſhall ioyfully looke for that bleſſed and comfortable ſentence: <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my father, and enter into the kingdom that is prepared for you,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:11548:38"/>
               <hi>before the beginning of the vvorlde,</hi> there ſhall we ſtill beholde, as Baſile ſayth, the numbers of Angels, the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of our firſt Fathers, the ſeates of the Apoſtles, the thrones of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phetes, the ſcepters of the Patriarkes, the crownes of the Martyrs, the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the iuſt. Yea, there ſhall we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe ſuche ioyes, as neyther eye hath ſéene, nor eare hath hearde, nor tongue can tell, nor penne is able to expreſſe, vnto which endleſſe ioyes, our Lord and Sauiour Chriſte bring vs, to whome with God the Father and the holie Ghoſt be al ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. &amp;c.</p>
