            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Brethren (for so did they now stile themselues) in their Churches and charges would neither pray, nor say seruice, nor Baptise, nor celebrate the L.

And abroad (as if they had bin ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Iesuiticall proceedings; or the Iesuits with their practises) they had their meetings both classicall, and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodicall; they set downe decrees, reuersed orders, elected mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, exacted Subscriptions, and executed the censures of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spension, and excommunication where they thought good.</p>
            <p>The Iesuits had for their prouinciall first Roberr Parsons, <hi>alias</hi> Cowbuck, then Weston, and lastly Garnet (which Garnet continued in that office till the yeare 1605. when he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and for most horrible and hellish treasons, as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Traitor put to death in Pauls Churchyard the same yeare.

And had they heere stayed, there words had bin able (without the more grace of God) to haue mooued the Parliament, &amp; all the people of this land (as they haue preuailed but too much alreadie with their too credulous fauorites) to thinke our Church, for all the reformation wrought, and Vniformitie in doctrine established, to be much awrie, and farre from the truth it should professe.

that is a true ministery they shall neuer haue, till Archbishops, and Bishops be put downe, and all Ministers made equall: the other also will neuer be brought to passe, till Kings &amp; Queenes doe subiect themselues vnto the Church, and submit their scepters, and throwe downe their Crowes before the Church, and lick vp the dust of the feete of the Church; and willingly abide the censures of the Church, that is, of the Presbyterie.

            </p>
            <p>Among the things for which the yeare 88. is famous, one, and not of least regard, is, that afore it expired, these bookes of the brethren, by a Proclamation from Q. Elizabeth, were denounced Schismaticall, and seditious; and the doctrine in them contained, erroneous, tending to perswade, and bring in a monstrous, and apparent dangerous Innouation within her dominions, and countries; and to make a change, euen a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous change of the forme of doctrine then in vse. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the said bookes were commanded to be brought in, and deliuered into the hands of authoritie; and speciall charge gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen that no moe of that nature should come abroad, or be printed.</p>
            <p>Wherby (so much as in that blessed Queene, whose name with eternall honour shallbe recorded) these newe fancies of the brethren were hissed, and exploded out of this Christian kingdome; and the articles, or publike doctrine of our Church, confirmed, countenanced, and by the royall prerogatiue of that peerelesse Prince, more strongly ratified, and commended to her awefull and good subiects then afore.</p>
            <p n="19">19 The zeale of learned, and godly men herevpon was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, and their courage so encreased, as whereas afore this time but one or two, or a very few (the first whereof was your L. imediate Predecessor, whose memorie be alwaies honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

            <p n="20">20.

            <p>For while these Worthies of our Church were employing their engins, &amp; forces partly in defending the present gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Ecclesiasticall, partly in assaulting the Presbytery and newe Discipline, euen at that verie instant the Brethren (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselues too weake either to ouerthrowe our holds, and that which we hold; or to maintaine their owne) they aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned quite the Bulwarkes which they had raised,<note place="margin">

            <p>This Stratageme of theirs was not obserued then, neither I feare me is regarded as it should be yet: and yet did, &amp; since hath, and doubtlesse in time to come, if it be not timely seene

In this their fallie (as I said before) they set not vpon the Bishops and their calling, their Chancelars &amp;c. (as Popish, and Antichristian) they let them alone, seeing and knowing they are too well backt for them to subuert: but (which are of great, all; and almost of the same antiquitie with Bishops di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; and I had almost said as necessarie) they ruinate, and at one blowe beate downe all Times, and daies by iust autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie destined to religious, and holy vses, besides the Lords day, saying plainely, and in peremptorie words that the Church hath none authoritie, ordinarily, or from yeare to yeare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually to sanctifie any other day to those vses but only the Lordes daie.</p>
            <p>They builde not Presbyteries expressedly (though vnder hand, if it be well marked, they doe erect them in their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of the Sabbath: but they set vp a newe Idoll, their Saint Sabbath (earst in the daies of Popish blindnes <hi>S.</hi> Sunday) in the middes, and mindes of Gods people.</p>
            <p>By the former they haue opened not a gap, but a wide gate vnto all licentiousnes, libertie, and prophanes on the Holie daies (which is readily, and greedily apprehended of all sorts of people euerie where, especially of their fauorites) to the hie dishonor of God; decay of deuotion; hinderance of Christian knowledge and wisedome in all sorts, especially in the vulgar multitude, and poore seruants; aduantage of the common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies; and grosse contempt of the necessarie, and laudable orders of our Church.

            <p n="22">22. Their doctrine summarilie may be reduced vnto these two heads, whereof the one is, that the Lords day (euen as the
<pb facs="tcp:16528:10"/>
old Sabbath was of the Iewes) must necessarily be kept, and solemnized of all, and euerie Christian, vnder the paine of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall condemnation both of bodie, and soule.</p>
            <p>The other, that vnder the same penaltie it must bee kept from the highest to the lowest, both of King, and people, in sort, and manner as these Brethren among themselues, haue deuised, decreed, and prescribed.</p>
            <p>The former of these is like that of the false Apostles, which came from Iudea vnto Antioch, and taught the Brethren, that vnlesse they were Circumcised after the manner of Moses, they could not be saued. Whome the Apostles, Paul and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas first; and afterwards Peter, Iames, and the rest at Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem both zealously did resist, and in their first Synod, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation powerfully suppresse.</p>
            <p>The latter, as bad as that, hath bin the mother of many he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall assertions, and horrible conclusions.</p>
            <p>I haue read (and many there be aliue which will iustifie it), how it was preached in a Mercate towne in Oxfordshire, that to doe any seruile worke, or businesse on the Lords day, is as great a sinne, as to kill a man, or to committe adultery. It was preached in Sommersetshire, that to throw a bowle on the Sabboth day, is as great a sinne, as to kill a man. It was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Norfolke, that to make a Feast, or wedding dinner on the Lords day, is as great a sinne, as for a Father to take a knife and cutte his childes throate. It was preached in Suffolke (I can name the man, and I was present when hee was conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before his ordinary for preaching the same) that to ring moe Bels then one vpon the Lords day to call the people vnto Church, is as great a sinne as to commit murder.</p>
            <p>When these things I read, and heard, mine heart was struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with an horror, and so is it still, when I doe but thinke of them, and calling into minde the Sabboth doctrine (at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don printed for I.

And in this Confession I pray God they may constantly perseuere.</p>
            <p>Howebeit euen these men (which in a generalitie doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the doctrine of our Church) being called by authoritie to acknowledge their assent vnto euerie Article thereof in particular, they doe not a little debase the estimation of this
<pb facs="tcp:16528:14"/>
doctrine of our<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and shewe themselues but too apparent, and professed disseruors from the same. And though all of them doe, and will approoue some: yet not one of them will sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe vnto all, and euery of the Articles.</p>
            <p>For vnto the Articles of religion, and the Kings Supremacie they are willing to subscribe. And they may subscribe (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath beene noted) vnto such of them, as containe the summe of Christian Faith, and the doctrine of the Sacraments. But vnto the same Articles, for number 39. agreed vppon in this Conuocation at London an. 62. they neither will, nor dare, nor may subscribe. For neither the rest of the Articles in that booke, nor the Booke of common prayer, may bee allowed, no though a man should be depriued from his ministerie for it (say the sayd Brethren in a certaine Classical decree of theirs). The late Politician is not affraide to mooue the high, and most honorable Court of Parliament, that Impropriations may bee let to Ferme vnto Incumbent ministers, viz. which faithfullie preach in the Churches the true doctrine of the Gospell, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Articles of religion, concerning Faith and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: meaning that such Ministers as preach the same doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, if they proceed to the rest of the Articles, Concerning either Conformitie in externall, and ceremoniall matters; or Vniformitie in other points of doctrine contained in that booke, should not be partakers of that benefit, or of Benefices Impropriat.</p>
            <p n="31">31. If it be demaunded, what the causes may be, why they will vnto some,<note place="margin">VVhy the Br. will subscribe vnto some, but not vnto all the Articles.</note> but will not vnto all; or why they will vnto those Articles which concerne Faith, and the Sacraments, but will not vnto the rest, subscribe? The reasons hereof be two, whereof.</p>
            <p>The one is, for that in their opinion, there is no Law, to compell them to subscribe vnto all, For (say the brethren re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siant I know not where), Wee haue alwaies beene readie to subscribe to the Articles of religion concerning the doctrine of Faith, and of the Sacraments, which is all that is required by Lawe. Also the Brethren in Deuonshire, and Cornewale: Wee are readie (say they) to subscribe to the third (which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb facs="tcp:16528:14"/>
the booke of Articles of religion) so farre as wee are bound by Statute, concerning the same, <hi>viz.</hi> as they concerne the doctrine of the Sacraments, and the confession of the true faith. And the 22, London Brethren tell K. Iames to his head, how the Subscription which he calleth for, is more then the Lawe requireth.</p>
            <p>Their other reason is, because (as the Lincolnshire doe say) sundry, (as the London Brethren affirme) many things in that booke be not agreable, but contrary to Gods word.</p>
            <p n="32">32. If these things be true which they doe alleadge, surely then are those men to be chronicled for the Faithfull, the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and innocent Brethren indeede, whome neither present Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices can allure; nor the angry countenance, and displeasure of a king, euen of the puissant, and powerfull king of great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, can force to doe any thing at his beck, and pleasure, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against Lawe, or for which there is no law; and who had rather to forgoe all their earthly commodities, &amp; liuings, yea &amp; to goe from their charges, and ministery, and to expose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, their wiues, and children to the myseries of this world (grieuous for flesh and blood to endure), then to approoue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing for true, and sound by their hands, which is opposite, or not agreeable to the reuealed will, and Scriptures of God.</p>
            <p>But if these allegations of theirs be but weake, and sinfull sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, or rather apparently most false, scandalous, and slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous imputations to their Prince, their mother Church, and this State, then doubtlesse, as they euen Christians now liuing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but take them: so the ages to come will euerlastingly note, and censure them both for disloyall Subiects that so traduce a truly, and most christianly religious King; il deseruing children, that so abuse their honourable, and reuerend Fathers, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors of State, and authority: turbulent spirits, not peaceable men, which raise such broiles, troubles, and diuisions in the Church and kingdome (the issues whereof no tongue can fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and are fearefull being thought of) without cause; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally neither faithfull, nor godly Preachers, but vngodly broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of vntruthes, and slaunders, and the very authors, and
<pb facs="tcp:16528:15"/>
fautors of horrible co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fusion, &amp; faction in Gods Church, whose peace they shold seek, &amp; promote eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with their deerest blood.</p>
            <p n="33">33. Since the Statute for Vniformitie in rites and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine was first enacted, moe then 35. yeeres haue passed, in all which space, neither the Brethren nowe being, nor the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren afore them liuing, haue hetherto shewen, of the 39. Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, for names and titles, Which; for number, Howe manie the Articles be which ecclesiastical Ministers necessarily must; howe many which they may not, or neede not, vnlesse they list, subscribe vnto (which I am sure they, or some of them, at one time, or other would haue expressed, had the Lawe fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their recusancie, and they beene able to haue iustified their Maxime, which is, That they are not compellable by subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to approoue them all. Againe, since the first establishment of that Statute Lawe, the most reuerend Fathers, and truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Ministers of this Church (sound, for iudgement; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, for learning; zealous, for affection; sincere, for religion; faithfull, in their Churches; painefull, in their charges; more profitable many waies; of as tender consciences euery way, as any of these Brethren combined), according both to their bounden duties, and (as they are perswaded) to the very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and true intent of the said Statute, haue alwaies both with their mouthes acknowledged, and with their pennes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued the 39. Articles of our religion for truthes not to bee doubted of, and godly.</p>
            <p>Yea, and the Brethren too themselues (which nowe so scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouslie, when they are orderly called thereunto, doe holde backe their hands, and will subscribe but choisely vnto some of them) euen they with their mouthes (which is equiualent, and all one) haue, &amp; that according to the Statute (or else their liuings be void) vpon their first entrance into all, and singular their ecclesiasticall benefices, openly both read, and testified their consent vnto the said Articles, for number euen nine and thirty, acknowledging them, I say all of them to be agreeable to Gods word: whereof the people in there seuerall charges be ready witnesses to testifie so much before God, &amp; the world.</p>
            <p n="34">34. Againe, of these Brethren (that will subscribe but vnto which they please of these Articles) there be some who faine would beate into mens heads, if they could tell howe to make
<pb facs="tcp:16528:15"/>
it credible),<note place="margin">A late deuise of the Br. to shunne sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribtion.</note> that the Doctrine of our Church is altered from that it was in the raigne of Queene Elizabeth.</p>
            <p>But this assertion being too grosse, egregiouslie vntrue, and no way iustifiable, they secondly giue out, and report (so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious be they to inuent newe shifts to cloake their inuete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and rooted pertinacie) howe the purpose, if not doctrine of our Church is of late altered from that it was. And therefore though they can be wel content to allowe of the old doctrine, and auncient intention: yet vnto the old doctrine, and newe Intention of our Church, they cannot subscribe, might they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gaine much, or loose whatsoeuer they haue thereby.</p>
            <p>Besides, this newe Intendement, contrarie to the old pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, if not doctrine of our Church, is become nowe the maine, &amp; principall obstacle, why they cannot subscribe vnto the booke of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prayer, &amp; booke of Ordination, as earst they (some of them) foure times haue done, when aswell the Intention, as Doctrine of our Church, was pure, and holy.</p>
            <p>Lastly, they seeme not obscurely to intimate vnto the State, that were they sure, or might bee assured, that the purpose of our Church were the same which it was, neither varied from the doctrine; they would be prest, and as readie euen foure, if not fortie times moe, to subscribe vnto the fore mentioned bookes of Common prayer, and of Ordination, as afore times they did, when they were out of doubt the Intention of our Church was correspondent to her Doctrine, that it was sound, &amp; good. I haue foure times subscribed (saith a Brother) to the booke of Common prayer with limitation, &amp; reference of all things therein contained (not vnto the purpose only, or doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine only, but) vnto the purpose, &amp; doctrine of the church of England. Yet cannot the same man with a good conscience so much as once more subscribe (which formerly, and that with a good conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce had subscribed foure times). His reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the purpose, if not doctrine of our Church, (to which hee referred his subscriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) appeareth to him, by the late Canons, booke of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference, &amp; some speeches of men in great place, &amp; others, to be varied somewhat from that which he before (not without reason) tooke it to be.</p>
            <p n="35">35. The purpose of our Church is best knowne by the Doctrine which shee doth professe; the Doctrine by the 39. Articles, established by Act of Parliament;
<pb facs="tcp:16528:16"/>
the Articles by the words,<note place="margin">The purpose, and doctrine of our Church continue the same.</note> whereby they are expressed: and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpose then the publique Doctrine doth minister; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Doctrine then in the sayd Articles is contained, our Church neither hath, nor holdeth; and other sense they cannot yeeld, then their words doe impart. The words be the same, and none other, then earst, and first they were. And therefore the sense the same; the Articles the same; the Doctrine the same; and the purpose, &amp; Intention of our Church still one, &amp; the same.</p>
            <p>If then her purpose be knowne by her Doctrine, and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; and their true sense by their very words: needes must the purpose of our Church be the same, because her Doctrine, and Articles for number, words, sillables, and letters, &amp; euery way be the very same.</p>
            <p>And so our Churches intention in her publique Doctrine, and Articles reuealed, being good at the first, it is to still. For her purpose (continuing one, &amp; the same) cannot be ill at the last, which was good (and so beleeued, and acknowledged, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the Brothers subscription) at the first; or good, in good Queene Elizabeths, and ill, in illustrious King Iames his daies.</p>
            <p n="36">36. If the premisses sufficiently explane not the constancy of our Churches purpose in professing religion sincerely, then cast we our eies vpon the Propositions,<note place="margin">Neither the Doctrine, nor purpose of our Church alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> which she publiquely maintaineth; and if wee find them the same which euer they haue beene, then neede wee not doubt (the Brethren them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues being Iudges) but the Articles againe, their sense, the Doctrine, purpose, and Intention of the Church of England (the Propositions interpreting, as it were, the said Articles) is the very same it euer was.</p>
            <p>Now that the Propositions (pregnantly, and rightly gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and arising from the articles) be the same, &amp; for substance vnaltered (though vpon good considerations, some fewe be added to the former); and all of them approoued for true, and Christian, by the lawfull, and publike allowance of our Church, the booke here ensuing plainly wil declare, and so demonstrate withall not the Doctrine onely, but intention also of our
<pb facs="tcp:16528:16"/>
Church, to be the same, and not changed: and being vnchanged the bookes then of common prayer, and of ordination too, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in the purpose and intention of the Church of England and reduced to the Propositions (as the Brethren would haue them), be well allowed, and authentically approoued; and the said brethren with as good conscience nowe againe, and afresh may subscribe vnto all the Articles, euen concerning the Booke of common praier, and of ordination, aswell as of the Kings supremacie, and of Religion, as afore, often, and alwaies they did.</p>
            <p n="37">37. Fot my selfe (most reuerend Father in God) what my thoughts be of the religion in this realme at this instant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, and of all these Articles, if the premisses doe not, that which here followeth will sufficiently demonstrate, Twentie, yea 22, yeares agoe, voluntarily, of mine owne accord, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnconstrained, I published my subscription vnto them; my Faith is not either shaken, or altered, but what it then was, it still is: yeares haue made those haires of mine gray, which weare not; and time, much reading, and experience in theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call conflicts, and combates, haue bettered a great deale, but not altered one whit my iudgement, I thanke God.</p>
            <p>Nothing haue I denied, nothing gainesaid, which afore I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered.</p>
            <p>The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are (and yet not many) moe; the method, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered quotations, added, both for the satisfaction of some lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and iudicious freinds of mine, requesting it at mine hands, and for the benefit both of the common, and vnlearned, &amp; of the studious, and learned Reader.</p>
            <p>The whole worke expresseth aswell my detestation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of all adversaries and errors, opposite, crossing, or contradicting the doctrine professed by vs, and protected by our King, or any article, or particle of truth of our religion; as my approbation of that truth which in our Church by whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Statutes, and ordinances, is confirmed.</p>
            <p>There is not an heretike or Schismatike (to speake of) of any speciall marke, that from the Apostles time hitherto, hath discouered himselfe, and his opinions vulgarly in writing, or in
<pb facs="tcp:16528:17"/>
print against our doctrine, but his heresie, fancie, or phrensie may here be seene against one propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or other. The Sects, and Sect masters adversaries vnto vs either in the matter, or maine points of our doctrine, or Discipline; to one of our Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, or other; wholly, or in part, which here be discouered to be taken heed of, and auoided, are many hundres.</p>
            <p n="38">38. This, and whatsoeuer els here done, either to the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the truth, or detestation of heresies, and errors I doe very meekely present vnto your Grace, as after God, and our King best meriting the patronage thereof.</p>
            <p>My selfe am much, the whole Church of England much more bound vnto your Lordship; yea not wee onely nowe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, but our successors also, and posteritie shall haue cause in all ages, while the world shall continue, to magnifie almightie God, for the inestimable benefits, which wee haue and shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue from your selfe, and your late Predecessors (D.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16528:22"/>
This did say, how the same God was called by diuers names in the holy Scripture: and therefore that the Father became flesh, and suffered, because one and the same God is called the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost.

                        <p>Againe, some doe grant the names, and persons of three, and yet depriue not onely the Sonne, and holy Ghost of their diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, but the whole Trinitie also of their properties. For they say, there be three in heauen, <hi>viz.</hi> the Father, the Word, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, howbeit (say they) the Father onely is very God; the word is the breath of the Father; and the holy Ghost is the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit created by God of nothing, through the word: spoiling so both the Sonne, and holy Ghost of their deitie, and the whole Trinitie of their properties. Such were the Arrian, and Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian heretikes, hence by-named Pneumatomachons, because they waged battel with the holy Ghost.</p>

                        <p>A true saying is it, the Lord, and he onely knoweth who are his. For to man the Church of Christ is partly inuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and visible partly.

These as members of the Church are said to be inuisible, not because the men be not seene, but for that their faith, and conscience to Godward is not perfectly, knowne vnto vs.</p>
                        <p>The members of the visible Church are some of them for God, and some against God: all of them notwithstanding dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med parts of the Church, and acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nted faithfull, so long as they make no manifest, and open rebellion against the Gospell of Christ.</p>
                        <p>And all this wee gather from the holy Scripture, where mention is made of the Church inuisible, and triumphing, Rev. 2.26.28. &amp; 3.5.12. &amp; 7, 14.55. inuisible, and militant, in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles of S.

For the visible Church is not many congregations, but one companie of the faithfull.</p>
                        <p>Wee being many are one Body in Christ, and euery one, one anothers members <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 12.5.</note>.</p>
                        <p>Wee that are many, are one Bread, and one Body <note n="b" place="margin">1. Cor. 10.17.</note>.</p>

                        <p>For as wee haue many members in one body, and all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers haue not the same office: so wee beeing many, are one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in Christ, and euery one, one anothers members <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 12.4, 5.</note>.</p>

                        <p>IT is granted as well by the Romish, or false, as by the true Church, that none vncleane thing can enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. And because all men either haue bin, or be still vncleane, therefore they must be purged from sinne.</p>
                        <p>But in the manner of purging them who are vnpure, they doe greatly differ. For the true church, looking into the word of God, doth finde that wee are sanctified, or made cleane in diuers respects, diuersly, as by Baptisme <note n="a" place="margin">Christ loued the Church, and gaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for it, that he might sanctifie it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>For in the sacred scripture there is mention but onely of two waies, one leading vnto destruction, the other bringing vnto life <note n="e" place="margin">Matt. 7.13, 14.</note>, of two sorts of men, whereof some beleeue, and they

                        <p>Our English Papists at Rhemes doe thinke the soules in purgatorie to be in a more happie, and blessed condition then any men that liue in this world <note n="t" place="margin">

that purgatorie fire passeth all the paines of this life <note n="u" place="margin">

                        <p>Thomas Aquinas holdeth how the paines of hel fire, and of purgatorie are all one, and in nothing differ, but that the one is but temporall, and the other not so. And others, put in choise either to tarrie in Purgatorie one day, or to endure the miseries of this world an 100. yeares, haue chosen to suffer the troubles of this life an hundred yeares together, rather then to abide the paines of purgatorie but on short winters day <note n="x" place="margin">

                        <p>Therefore in this contrarietie of opinions some of them, the Papists themselues cannot denie, must be; wee say all of them are fond, and contrary to the word of God.</p>
                        <p>Besides they nourish most cursed, and damnable errors, as</p>
                        <p>That all the soules of the faithfull, separated from their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, are not at rest.</p>
                        <p>That all sinnes in their owne nature, be not mortall, or dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that some deserue not euerlasting torments. They are purged in purgatory.</p>
                        <p>That one sinful man may saue, and satisfie the wrath of God for another, and that easily by praying, saying, or doing some thing for them.</p>
                        <p>That, if friends in this word will doe nothing for the poore soule in purgatorie paines: yet may the said soules come at length vnto happines, by abyding their deserued torments vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the last howre, or day of iudgement, in Purgatorie.</p>
                        <p>Finally, that the Pope is God, in that he can at his pleasure, discharge guiltie soules both from the guilt of sinne; and from the punishments due for the same.</p>

                        <p>S. Paul in the beginning of his epistle vnto the Galathians, giueth vs to obserue the diuers sendeth-forth of men into the holy ministery: whereof</p>
                        <p>Some are sent immediately fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God himselfe. So sent, was by God the Father, both Iesus Christ <note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 20.21.</note>, and Iohn Baptist <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 1.6.</note>, by God the Sonne, in his state mortall the twelue Apostles <note n="c" place="margin">Matth. 10.5.</note>, in his state immortall, and glorious, <hi>S.</hi> Paul <note n="d" place="margin">Acts 9.15.</note>.</p>
                        <p>This calling is speciall, and extraordinarie: and the men so called were adorned with the gift of miracles co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly, as were Iesus Christ, and his Apostles; but not alwaies, for Iohn Baptist wrought none.</p>
                        <p>And they were also enioyned, for the most part, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, to preach throughout the world <note n="e" place="margin">Matth. 28.20.</note>, howbeit our Sauiour was limited <note n="f" place="margin">Matth. 15.24.</note>.</p>
                        <p>Some againe were sent of men: as they be, who are sent of men not authorized thereunto by the word of God, and that to the disturbance of the peace of the Church: such in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles time, were the false Apostles; in our daies be the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists, Familie Elders, and law despising Brownists.</p>
                        <p>And some lastly are by men sent: so in the primitiue Church by the Apostles, were Pastors, and Elders ordained <note n="g" place="margin">Act. 14.23. 1. Tim. 4.14.</note>, who by the same authoritie ordained other Pastors, and teachers <note n="h" place="margin">1. Tim. 22.5.</note>. Whence it is that the Church, as it hath bin: so it shall till the end of the world be prouided for. They who are thus called haue power neither to worke miracles, as the Apostles had; nor to preach, and minister the Sacraments where they will, as the Apostles might, but they are tied euery man to his charge, which they must faithfully attend vpon; except vrgent

                        <p>THe Sacraments are badges or tokens both of Christians, and of Christianitie.</p>
                        <p>Of Christians. For by them are visibly discerned, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, from Pagans: and Christians, Iewes, Turkes, and all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Atheists.</p>
                        <p>Of Christianitie. For, as Circumcision in the old Lawe, was a token how the corrupt, and carnall affections of the minde should be subdued; and that the Lord required not so much an outward of the Body, as an inward circumcision of the heart <note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 10.16.30.6. Ier. 4.4. Act. 7.51. Rom. 12.28. Phil. 3.3. Coloss. 2.11.</note>, so Baptisme telleth vs, that being once dead vnto sinne, wee are to liue vnto righteousnes; that all wee which haue bin bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized vnto Iesus Christ, haue bin baptized into his death, &amp;c. and must walke in newnesse of life, &amp;c. <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 6.3. &amp;c.</note>, for wee haue put on Christ <note n="c" place="margin">Gal. 3.26.</note>, by Baptisme.</p>
                        <p>And as the Paschall Lambe was to the Iewes a token that the flight of sinne should alwaies be fresh in memorie; and that it should be celebrated, not with old Leauen, neither in the Leauen of maliciousnes, but with the vnleauened bread of synceritie and truth <note n="d" place="margin">1. Cor. 5.8.</note>: so the participation of one Loafe, and of one Cuppe in the Lord his Supper, doth commend vnto our consideration a sweete concord; a brotherly vnanimitie; and a constant continuance in the true worship of God, without fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring of Idolatrie in ay respect <note n="e" place="margin">1.

                        <p>This doe the godly in al their Churches, and throughout the word both teach, and testifie <note n="f" place="margin">

                        <p>A Sacrament, according to the etymologie of the word (as the Schoolemen doe write) is a signe of an holy thing, which beeing true, then haue their bin, and still are, by so many aboue either two, or seuen Sacraments, as there be, &amp; haue bin, aboue two or seuen things, which are signes of sacred and holy things.</p>
                        <p>But according to the nature thereof, a Sacrament is a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God his fauour to man-ward, confirmed by some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward signe, or seale instituted by himselfe: which also hath bin sometimes speciall either to some men, &amp; that extraordinarily by things naturall sometimes, as the tree of life was to Adam <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 3.3.</note>, and the Rainebowe to Noah <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 9.9.13.</note>, and sometimes by things super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, as the smoaking furnace was to Abraham <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 15.17, 18.</note>, the Fleece of wooll, to Gedeon <note n="d" place="margin">Iudg. 6.37.</note>, and the Diall, to Ezekiah <note n="e" place="margin">2. king. 20.8.11.

                        <p>And sometimes generall to the whole Church militant, and ordinarie, as in the time of the Gospell.

                        <p>To say that popish Confirmation is grounded vpon Gods word, is to speake foule vntruthes.

                     <p>First the matter, which they doe say is partly the actions of the person penitent, which are sufficient contrition of his heart: perfect Confession of all his sinnes, and that in particular, with all the circumstances, as of time, place, &amp;c. and satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by deedes, which maketh an amends for all his offenses: &amp; partly the absolution of the Preist.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Forme, which in the Preist is the words of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, which he vttereth ouer the sinner: in the person peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, it is his kneeling downe at the Preists feete; his making the signe of the Crosse vpon hts breast; and his saying, Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, to his ghostly Father. The Preist (say they) beareth the person of God, and is the lawfull Iudge ouer the penitent; and may both absolue from the guilt of sinne, and inflict a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to the offense.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the minister, who ordinarily is the curate of euery parish; but extraordinarily, and in the time of extreame necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or by licence, is any Preist. And yet some sinnes are so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, as none may absolue but either the Bishop, or his Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiarie, as the crime of Incest, breaking of vowes, Church robbing, Heresie, adulterie: and some againe none remit, or pardon but the Pope onely, or his Legate, as Burning of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: violent striking a Preist; counterfaiting of the Popes Bulles, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, and last of all, the effect. Hereby they say the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent sinner is purged, absolued, and made as cleane from all sinne, as when he was newly baptized, and besides enriched
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:16528:98"/>
with spirituall gifts, and graces.</p>
                     <p>The consideration hereof hath mooued besides the Church of England all other Churches reformed to shewe their dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station of this newe Sacrament, as hauing no warrant from Gods word <note n="a" place="margin">

                     <p>The blasphemies are outragious, and the errors many, and monstrous comprised in this doctrine of Popish Penance. For neither can the matter of this their Sacrament, nor the forme, nor the minister, nor the effect be drawne from the word of God.</p>
                     <p>They say Penance is a Sacrament, and yet can they shew no element it hath to make it a Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>Their Contrition is against the truth: For no man is, or can be sufficiently contrite for his sinnes.</p>
                     <p>To confesse all sinnes, and that one after another with all circumstances vnto a Priest, as it is vnpossible: so is it neuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned by God, nor hath euer bin practised by any of God his Saints.</p>
                     <p>That any man in any measure can satisfie for his sinnes, it is blasphemie to say, and against the merits of Christ.<note place="margin">

                     <p>An vntruth is it, that any preist, Bishop or Pope hath power at his will to forgiue sinnes; or can enioyne any punishment that can make an amends vnto God for the least offense.</p>

                  <p>Touching this Article the greatest matter is, not whether these Homilies meant, and mentioned doe containe doctrine both godly, wholesome, and necessarie, but whether Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, or any Apocrypha wrightings at all may be read in the open Church, and before the congregation, which I thinke they may, and prooue thus.</p>
                  <p>Great is the excellencie, great also the vtility of Gods word preached.
