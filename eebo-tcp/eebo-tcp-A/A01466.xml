            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>This auctor denieth euil men to eat &amp; drinke the bodie and bloud of Chriſt in the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Theſe thre denials only impugne &amp; tende to diſtroy that faith / whiche this auctor ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the popiſhe to erre in / callyng nowe all popiſhe that beleue either of theſe thre arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles by him denied / the truth whereof ſhall hereafter be opened.</p>
               <p>Nowe becauſe fayth affirmeth ſome certaintee: if we aſke this auctor / what is his fayth / which he calleth true and catholique / it is only this / as we may lerne by his boke / that in our Lordes ſupper be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrate bread and wyne / and deliuered as tokens onely to ſignify Chriſtes bodie and bloud / he calleth them holye tokens, but yet noteth that the bread and wyne be neuer the holyer / he ſaith neuertheleſſe they be not bare toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s / and yet concludeth, Chriſt not to be ſpiritually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in them / but onely as a thing is preſent
<pb facs="tcp:2975:4"/>
in that / which ſignifieth it (whiche is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a bare token) ſaiyng in another place, ther is nothyng to be worſhipped, for ther is nothing preſent / but in figure and in a ſigne: whiche who ſo euer ſayth / calleth the thyng in dede abſente. And yet the auctor ſayth, Chriſte is in the man that worthely recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, ſpiritually preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, who eateth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes fleſhe and his bloud reignyng in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether the good beleuyng man aſcendeth by his faith. And as oure bodie is noriſhed with the bread &amp; wyne receiued in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: ſo the true beleuyng man is fedde with the bodie &amp; bloud of Chriſt. And this is the ſumme of the doctrine of that faith whiche this auctor calleth the true catholique faith.</p>
               <p>Nowe a catholique faith, is an vniuerſall faith taught and preached through all, and ſo receaued and beleued agreablie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the ſcriptures, teſtified by ſuch as by all ages, haue in their writynges geuen knowlege therof, which be the tokens and markes of a true Catholique faith, wherof no one can be founde in the faith this auctor calleth catholique.</p>
               <p>Firſte there is no ſcripture that in lettre mainteineth the doctrin of this auctorsboke. For Chriſt ſaith not that the bread doth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignify his bodie abſent, nor ſainct Paul ſayth not ſo in any place, ne any other cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical ſcripture declareth Chriſtes wordes ſo. As for the ſence &amp; vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng of Chriſtes
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2975:4"/>
wordes, there hath not been in any age any one approued and knowen learned ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that hath ſo declared &amp; expounded Chriſtes wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des in his ſupper, that the bread did onely ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnify Chriſtes bodie, &amp; the wyne his bloud, as thynges abſent. And to the intent euery notable diſagrement from the truth may the more euidently appeare, I will here in this place (as I will hereafter likewiſe when the caſe occurreth) ioyne as it were an iſſue with <note place="margin">An iſſue.</note> this auctor, that is to ſaye, to make a ſtaye with him in this poynte triable (as they ſay) by euidence &amp; ſone tried. For in this point the ſcriptures be alreadie by thauctor brought forth, the leterwherof proueth not his faith. And albeit he traueyleth and bryngeth forth the ſaiyng of many approued writers, yet is there no one of them that writeth in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe woordes the doctrine of that fayth, which this auctor calleth the faith catholike And to make the iſſue plaine and to ioyne it directly, thus I ſay.</p>
               <p>No auctor knowen and approued, that is to ſay, Ignatius, Policarpe, Iuſtine, Irene, Tertullian, Cyprian, Chriſoſtome, Hilarie, Gregorie, Nazianzen, Baſill, Emiſſen, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, Cyril, Hierome, Auguſtine, Damaſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Theophilacte, none of theſe hath this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in plaine termes, that the bread onely ſignifieth Chriſtes bodie abſent, nor this ſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tence, that the bread and wyne be neuer the holier after conſecration, nor that Chriſtes
<pb facs="tcp:2975:5"/>
bodie is none otherwiſe preſent in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but in a ſignification: nor this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that the Sacrament is not to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, becauſe there is nothing preſent but in a ſigne. And herein what the truth is, may ſoone appeare, as it ſhal by their workes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer appeare to haue been taught, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, receaued, and beleued vniuerſally, and therfore can be called no Catholique fayth (that is to ſay) allowed in the whol, through and in outwarde teaching, preached and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued. If this auctor ſettyng apart the word (Catholique) would of his owne wytte go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute to proue, howſoeuer ſcripture hath been vnderſtanded hitherto, yet it ſhould be vnderſtanded in dede as he nowe teacheth, he hath herein diuers diſaua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tages and hyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraunces worthy conſideracions, whiche I will particularly note.</p>

               <p>Thirdely Berengarius beyng in dede but an Archedeacon about .v. C. yeres paſt, after he had openly attempted to ſet forth ſuche like doctrine, recanted and ſo fayled in his purpoſe.</p>

Fourthely Wykclif not muche aboue an hundreth yeres paſt enterpriſed the ſame, whoſe teachyng God proſpered not.</p>
               <p>Fyftely how Luther, in his workes, han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that would haue in our tyme ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp the ſame doctrine in Germany, it is manifeſt by his and their writynges wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by appeareth the enterpriſe that hath had ſo many ouerthrowes, ſo many rebukes, ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reprofes, to be deſperate, and ſuche as God hath not proſpered and fauored, to be receiued at any tyme openly as his true tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng.</p>
               <p>Herein whether I ſay true or no, let the ſtories trye me, and it is matter worthy to be noted, becauſe Gamaliels obſeruacion wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Actes of the Apoſtels is allowed <note place="margin">Actes. 5.</note> to marke, howe they proſpere &amp; go forward in their doctrine that be auctors of any new teachyng.

What other text is therin ſcripture that encountreth with theſe wordes of ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture (This is my body) Wherby to altre the ſignification of them?

bodie in his ſupper, verely and really ſo vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, doth not neceſſaritly impugne and contrarie any other ſpeache or doyng of Chriſt, expreſſed in ſcripture. For the great power and omnipotencie of God, excludeth that repugnaunce, whiche mannes reaſon would deame of Chriſtes departyng from this worlde, and placyng his humanitie in the glorie of his father.</p>

What other poynte of fayth is there then in the matter, but to beleue the ſtorie, that Chriſt did inſtitute ſuche a ſupper, wherin he gaue bread and wyne for a token of his bodie and bloud, whiche is nowe after this vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng no ſecrete myſterie at all, or any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce aboue reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For commenly men vſe to ordaine in ſenſible thinges remembraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of them ſelfe whan they dye or departe the countrie. So as in thordinaunce of this ſupper, after this vnderſtandyng Chriſt ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed not his omnipotencie, but onely bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolence, that he loued vs, and would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred of vs. For Chriſt did not ſay who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2975:6"/>
eateth this token / eateth my bodie / or eateth my fleſhe / or ſhal haue any profite of it in ſpeciall / but doo this in remembraunce of me. And albeit this auctor would not haue them bare tokens / yet, and they be onely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens / they haue no warrant ſigned by ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, for any apparell at all. For the ſixt of John, ſpeaketh not of any promiſe made, to the eatyng of a token of Chriſtes fleſhe / but to the eatyng of Chriſtes verie fleſhe / wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the bread (as this auctor would haue it) is but a figure in Chriſtes wordes / when he ſayd, (This is my body). And if it be but a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in Chriſtes wordes / it is but a figure in ſainct Paules wordes / when he ſayd: The bread whiche wee breake / is it not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municacion of Chriſtes bodie, that is to ſay, a figure of the communicacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſtes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die (if this auctors doctrine be true) and not the communicacion in dede. Wherfore if the verie bodie of Chriſt be not in the ſupper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered in dede, the eatyng there hath no ſpe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciall promiſe, but onely commaundement to do it in remembraunce. After whiche doctrine why ſhould it be noted abſolutely for a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament and ſpeciall myſterie, that hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng hidden in it, but a plaine o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>en ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unce of a token, for a remembraunce: to the catyng of whiche token, is annexed no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſe expreſſely, ne any holynes to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to be in the bread or wyne (as this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor teacheth) but to be called holie, becauſe

they be deputed to an holy vſe. If I aſke the vſe, he declareth, to ſignify. If I ſhould aſke what to ſignifye? There muſte be a ſorte of good wordes framed without ſcripture. For ſcripture / expreſſeth no matter of ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of ſpeciall effecte. And therfore like as the teachyng is new / to ſay it is an onely fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, or onely ſignifieth: ſo the matter of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnification muſt be newly diuiſed / and new wyne haue new bottelles, and be throughly new, after .xv. C. l. yeres in the verie yere of Iubile (as they were wount to call it) to be newly erected and builded in Engliſhe mens heartes. Whiche new teachyng, whether it procedeth from the ſpirite of truth, or no, ſhall more plainely appeare by ſuche matter as this auctor vttereth wherewith to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the true faith taught hitherto. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many other profes, whereby trueth after much trauaile in contencion / at the laſt preuayleth, and hath victorie, there is none more notable, then when the verie aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of truth (who pretend neuertheles to be truthes frendes) do by ſome euident vntruth bewray themſelf. According wherunto, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the two women contended before kyng Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon for the childe yet aliue. Salomon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned <note place="margin">3. Reg. 3.</note> the true naturall mother from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by their ſpeaches and ſaiynges. Which in the verie true mother, were euer confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to nature, and in the other, at the laſt euidently againſt nature. The verie true mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

ſpeake alwaies like her ſelfe, and neuer diſagreed from the truth of nature, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the childe ſhould be killed, as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon threatened, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he called for aſword, required rather it to be geuen whole aliue to the other woman. The other woman, that was not the true mother cared more for vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, then for the childe, and therfore ſpake that was in nature an euidence, that ſhe lied callyng her ſelfe mother, and ſaiyng (let it be deuided) whiche no true naturall mother could ſay of her owne childe, wherupon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded Salomons moſt wiſe iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which hath this leſſon in it, euer where contention is, on that parte to be the truth, where all ſaiynges and doynges appeare vniformely conſonante to the truth pretended, and on what ſide a notable lye appeareth, the reſt may be iudged to be after the ſame ſorte, for truth nedeth no ayde of lyes, craft or ſlayte, wherwith to be ſupported and maynteined. So as in the intreatyng of the truth, of this high and ineffable myſterie of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on what parte thou reader ſeeſt traft, ſlayte, ſhift, obliquitie, or in any one pointe, an open manifeſt lye, there thou maiſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whatſoeuer pretence be made of truth, yet the victorie of truth not to be there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, whiche loueth ſimplicitie, plainenes, directe ſpeache, without admixcion of ſhift or coloure.

Uerely verely I ſay vnto you / except ye eate the fleſhe of the ſonne of man and drinke his bloud ye haue no life in you. Who ſo eateth my fleſhe and drinketh my bloud hath eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life &amp; I wyl rayſe him vp at the laſt day. For my fleſhe is verie meat / and my bloud ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie drinke. He that eateth my fleſh &amp; drinketh my bloud dwelleth in me &amp; I in him. As the liuyng father hath ſent me / and I liue by the father: Euen ſo he that eateth me ſhal liue by me. This is the bread which came doune fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen. Not as your fathers did eat Manna and are dead: He that eateth this bread ſhall lyue for euer.</p>
               <p>Here is alſo a faulte in the tranſlacion of the texte / whiche ſhould be thus in one place. For my fleſhe is verely meat and my bloud is verely drinke. In whiche ſpeache / the verbe that cuppleth the wordes (fleſhe) and (meat)
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2975:10"/>
together: knitteth them together in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre ſignificacion / ſo as the fleſhe of Chriſt is verelymeat as thauctor would perſuade. And in theſe words of Chriſt may appere plainly how Chriſt taught the myſterie of the fode of his humanitie / whiche he promiſed to geue for foode / euen the ſame fleſhe / that he ſaid he would geue for the life of the worlde and ſo expreſſeth the firſt ſentence of this ſcripture here by me holly brought forth, that is to ſay. And the bread whiche I ſhall geue you is my fleſhe whiche I ſhall geue for the life of the worlde. And ſo it is plaine that Chriſt ſpake of fleſhe in the ſame ſence that Sainct Ihon ſpeaketh in, ſaiyng: The worde was made fleſhe, ſignifiyng by fleſhe the hole humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And ſo did Cyrill agre to Neſtorius, when he vpon theſe textes, reaſoned howe this eatyng is to be vnderſtanded of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes humanitie, to whiche nature in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes perſon is properly attribute, to be eaten as meate ſpiritually to noriſhe man, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed and geuen in the Sacrament. And betwene Neſtorius and Cyrill, was this diuerſitie in vnderſtandyng the myſterie, that Neſtorius eſtemyng of eche nature in Chriſte a ſeuerall perſonne (as it was obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to him) and ſo diſſoluyng the inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable vnitie, did ſo repute the bodie of Chriſte to be eaten as the bodie of a man
<pb facs="tcp:2975:11"/>
ſeperate. Cyrill maynteyned the bodie of Chriſt to be eaten as a bodie inſeperable vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the godhed, and for the ineffable my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of that vnion, the ſame to be a fleſhe that geueth life. And then as Chriſt ſayth, if wee eate not the fleſhe of the ſonne of man, we haue not life in vs, becauſe Chriſt hath ordered the Sacrament of his moſt precious bodie and bloud to noriſhe ſuche as be by his holy ſpirite regenerate. And as in Baptiſme we receaue the ſpirite of Chriſt, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newyng of our life, ſo do we in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſtes mooſt precious bodie and bloud receaue Chriſtes verie fleſhe &amp; drynke his verie bloud, to continus and preſerue, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe / and augment the life receaued, And therfore in the ſame forme of wordes Chriſt ſpake to Nycodemus of Baptiſme: that he ſpeaketh here, of the eatyng of his bodie and drinkyng of his bloud, and in both the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes geueth / diſpenſeth and exhibiteth in dede thoſe celeſtial gyftes, in ſenſible ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes as Chriſoſtome ſayth. And becauſe the true faithfull beleuyng men do onely by fayth know the ſonne of man to be in vnitie of perſon the ſonne of God, ſo as for the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the two natures in Chriſt in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the fleſhe of the ſonne of man is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre fleſhe of the ſoone of God. Saincte Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine ſayd well when he noted theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of Chriſt, verely verely / onleſſe ye eat the fleſhe of the ſonne of man &amp;c. to be a figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2975:11"/>
ſpeache, becauſe after the bare lettre, it ſemeth vnprofitable, conſideryng, that fleſh profiteth nothyng in it ſelfe, eſtemed in thowne nature alone, but as the ſame fleſhe in Chriſt is vnited to the diuine nature, ſo is it, as Chriſt ſayd, (after Cyrilles expoſition) ſpirite and life, not chaunged into the diuine nature of the ſpirite, but for the ineffable v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the perſon of Chriſt therunto, it is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uificatrix (as Cyrill ſayd) and as the holy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſine councel decreed: a fleſhe geuyng life, accordyng to Chriſtes wordes: who eateth my fleſhe, and drinketh my bloud, hath eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, and I will raiſe him vp at the latter day. And then to declare vnto vs, how in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng this life to vs, Chriſt vſeth the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his verie humaine bodie: it foloweth. For my fleſhe is verely meat, and my bloud verely drinke. So like as Chriſt ſanctifieth, by his godlye ſpirite: ſo doth he ſanctifye vs by his godlie fleſhe, and therfore, repeteth againe, to inculcate the celeſtial thing of this myſterie, and ſayth: he that eateth my fleſhe and drinketh my bloud, dwelleth in me and I in him, whiche is the natural and corporal vnion, betwene vs and Chriſt. Wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that as Chriſt is naturally in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his father in him: ſo he that eateth verely the fleſhe of Chriſt, he is by nature in Chriſt, and Chriſt is naturally in him, and the worthy receauer, hath life encreaſed,
<pb facs="tcp:2975:12"/>
augmented, and confirmed by the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of the fleſhe of Chriſte. And becauſe of thin effable vnion of the two natures, Chriſt ſayd: This is the foode that came doune / fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen, becauſe God, whoſe proper fleſhe it is, came downe from heauen, and hath an other vertue, then Manna had, becauſe this geueth life to them that worthely receaue it: whiche Manna, beyng but a figure therof, did not, but beyng in this foode Chriſtes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie fleſhe inſeperably vnite to the godhed, the ſame is of ſuche efficacie, as he that worthely eateth of it, ſhall liue for euer. And thus I haue declared the ſence of Chriſtes wordes, brought forth out of the Goſpell of Sainct Iohn. Wherby appeareth, how euidentely they ſet forth the doctrine of the myſterie of the eatyng of Chriſtes fleſhe &amp; drinkyng his bloud in the Sacrament, whiche muſt nedes be vnderſtanded of a corporall eatyng, as Chriſt did after ordre, in thinſtitucion of the ſayd Sacrament, accordyng to his promiſe and doctrine here declared.</p>
               <p>Now, where thauctor to exclude the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of corporall manducacion, bryngeth forth of Sainct Auguſtine, ſuche wordes as entreat of theffect and operacion of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receauyng of the Sacrament: the hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng is not ſo ſyncere, as this matter requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. For as hereafter ſhalbe intreated, that is not worthely and well done, may, becauſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2975:12"/>
the principall entent fayleth, be called nor done, as ſo Sainct Auguſtine ſayth. Let him not thinke, to eat the bodie of Chriſt, that dwelleth not in Chriſt, not becauſe the body of Chriſt is not receaued, whiche by Sainct Auguſtines mynde, euill men do to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnacion, but becauſe theffecie of life fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth. And ſo thauctor by ſleight, to exclud the corporall manducacion of Chriſtes moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bodie, vttreth ſuche wordes as myght ſounde Chriſt to haue taught, the dwellyng in Chriſt to be an eatyng, whiche dwellyng may be without this corporal manducacion, in him that can not attaine the vſe of it, and dwellyng in Chriſt is an effecte of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy manducacion, and not the manducacion it ſelfe, whiche Chriſt doth ordre to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, in the mooſt precious Sacrament in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute in his ſupper. Here thou reader mayſt ſee, how this doctrine of Chriſt, as I haue declared it, openeth the corporall manduca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of his mooſt holie fleſhe, and drinkyng of his mooſt precious bloud, whiche he gaue in his ſupper vnder the formes of bread and wyne.</p>
               <p>Nowe let vs conſidre the textes of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſtes, and Sainct Paule, whiche be brought in by thauctor as foloweth.</p>
               <p>Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they wee catyng, Ieſus toke bread, <note place="margin">Mat. 26</note> and when he had geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thankes, he brake it, gaue it to his diſciples, and ſayd: Take, eat,
<pb facs="tcp:2975:13"/>
this is my bodie. And he toke the cup, and when he had geuen thankes, he gaue it to them, ſaiyng: drinke ye all of this, for this is my bloud of the new teſtament, that is ſhed for many, for the remiſſion of ſynnes. But I ſay vnto you, I wyll not drinke henceforth, of this frute of the vine, vntill that daye, when I ſhall drinke it new with you in my fathers kingdome.</p>
               <p>As they did eat, Ieſus toke bread, and <note place="margin">Mar. 14</note> when he had bleſſed, he brake it, and gaue it to them, &amp; ſayd: Take, eat, This is my bodie, &amp; taking the cup, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thankes, he gaue it to them, and they dranke of it. And he ſaid to them, This is my bloud of the new Teſtament, whiche is ſhed for many. Ue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely I ſay vnto you, I will drinke no more of the frute of the vine, vntill that daye, that I drinke it newe in the kyngdome of God.</p>
               <p>When the houre was come, he ſat doune, <note place="margin">Luc. 22.</note> and the .xij. Apoſtels with him: And he ſayd vnto them I haue greatly deſired to eat this Paſcha with you before I ſuffre. For I ſay vnto you henceforth, I will not eat of it any more, vntill it be fulfylled in the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. And he toke the cup, and gaue thankes, and ſayd: Take this and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide it among you. For I ſay vnto you, I will not drinke, of the frute of the vine, vntill the kyngdome of God come And he toke bread and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had geuen thankes,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2975:13"/>
he brake it and gaue it vnto them ſaiynge: This is my bodie, whiche is geuen for you: This do in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of me. Likewiſe alſo, when he had ſupped, he toke the cup, ſaiyng: This cup, is the new Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, in my bloud which is ſhed for you.</p>
               <p>Is not the cuppe of bleſſyng, whiche we <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10</note> bleſſe, a communion of the bloud of Chriſt? Is not the bread, whiche we breake, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the bodie of Chriſt: We beyng many are one bread, and one bodie, for we are all partakers of one bread and of one cuppe.</p>
               <p>That whiche I deliuered vnto you, I <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11</note> receaued of the Lord. For the Lorde Ieſus, the ſame night, in the whiche he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, toke bread, and when he had geuen thankes, he brake it and ſayd: Take eate, this is my bodie whiche is broken for you: do this in remembraunce of me. Likewiſe alſo, he toke the cup when ſupper was done, ſaiyng: This cup, is the new Teſtament in my bloud: do this, as often as ye drinke it, in remembraunce of me: For as often as you ſhall eate this bread &amp; drinke of this cup, ye ſhew forth the Lordes death till he come, wherfore, whoſoeuer ſhall eat of this bread, or drinke of this cuppe vnworthely, ſhalbe giltie of the bodie and bloud of the Lorde. But let a man examine him ſelfe, and ſo eat of the bread, and drinke of the cup, for he that eateth, &amp; drynketh vnworthely, eateth
<pb facs="tcp:2975:14"/>
and drynketh his owne damnacion, becauſe he maketh no difference of the Lordes bodie: For this cauſe, many are weake and ſycke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, and many do ſlepe.</p>
               <p>After theſe textes brought in, thauctor doth in the fourth chapter, begyn to trauers Chriſtes intent, that he inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded not by theſe wordes (This is my bodie) to make the bread his body: but to ſignify, that ſuche as receiue that worthely, be membres of Chriſtes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. The Catholique church acknowlegyng Chriſt to be verie God and verie man, hath fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginnyng of theſe textes of ſcripture co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed truely Chriſtes intent, and effectual myraculous woorke, to make the bread his body, and the wyne his bloud, to be verely meate, &amp; verely drinke, vſyng therin his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie wherwith to fead vs, as he vſed the ſame, wherwith to redeame vs, &amp; as he doth ſanctify vs by his holy ſpirite, ſo to ſanctify vs by his holy diuine fleſhe and bloud, and as life is renewed in vs by the gift of Chriſts holy ſpirite: ſo life to be encreaſed in vs, by the gift of his holy fleſhe. So as he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leueth in Chriſt, and receaueth the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of beleif, whiche is baptiſme, receiueth really Chriſtes ſpirite: So he, that hauyng Chriſts ſpirite, receaueth alſo the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſtes bodie and bloud: doth real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receaue in the ſame, and alſo effectually Chriſtes verie bodie and bloud. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt in thinſtitucion of this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2975:14"/>
ſayd, deliueryng that he conſecrated: This is my bodie. &amp;c. And likewiſe of the cuppe: This is my bloud. And although, to mans reaſon it ſemeth ſtraunge, that Chriſt ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng or ſittyng at the table, ſhould deliuer them his bodie to be eaten: yet when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membre Chriſt to be verie God, we muſte graunt him omnipotent, and by reaſon ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, repreſſe in oure thoughtes, all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacions how it might be, and conſidre Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes intent, by his will preached vnto vs by ſcriptures, and beleued vniuerſally in his church. But if it may now be thought ſemely for vs to be ſo boulde, in ſo high a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to begynne to diſcuſſe Chriſtes intent: what ſhould moue vs to thinke that Chriſt would vſe ſo many wordes, without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall and reall ſignificacion, as be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſed touchyng the myſterie of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament?</p>
               <p>Firſt, in the .vi. of Iohn, whan Chriſt had taught of the eatyng of him, beyng the bread deſcended from heauen, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that eating to ſignify beleuing, wherat was no murmuryng, that then he ſhould entre to ſpeake of geuyng of his fleſhe to be eaten, and his bloud to be dronken, and to ſay he would geue a bread, that is his fleſhe, whiche he would geue for the life of the worlde. In whiche wordes, Chriſt maketh mention of two giftes, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:2975:15"/>
as he is truth, muſt needes intend to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill them both. And therfore, as we beleue the gift of his fleſhe, to the Iewes to bee crucified: So we muſt beleue, the gift of his fleſhe to be eaten, &amp; of that gift, lyuerie and ſeiſme (as we ſay) to be made of him, that is in his ꝓmiſes faithful, as Chriſt is to be made in both. And therfore (whan he ſayd in his ſupper): Take / eat / This is my bodie: he muſt nedes intend plainely, as his wordes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe required, &amp; theſe woordes in his ſupper purport to geue as really then his bodie to be eaten of vs, as he gaue his bodie in dede to be crucified for vs, aptely neuertheleſſe and conueniently for eche effect, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in maner of geuyng diuerſely, but in the ſubſtaunce of the ſame geuen, to be as his wordes beare wytnes the ſame / and therfore ſayd. This is my bodie, that ſhalbe berrayed for you, expreſſyng alſo the vſe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſayd (Take / eat) which wordes, in deliueryng of materiall bread, had been ſuperfluous. For what ſhould men do with bread, when they take it, but eat it? ſpecially when it is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? But as (Cyrill ſaith) Chriſte opened there vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the practiſe of that doctrine he ſpake of in the .vi. of Sainct Iohn / &amp; becauſe he ſayd, he would geue his fleſhe for foode, whiche he would geue for the life of the worlde: he for fulfillyng of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſayd: Take / eate, this is my bodie / whiche wordes haue been taught, &amp; beleued
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2975:15"/>
to be of effecte and operatorie / and Chriſte vnder the forme of bread to haue been, his verie bodie. Accordyng wherunto (S. Paule noreth) the receauer to be giltie, when he doth not eſteme it our Lordes bodie / wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it pleaſeth Chriſt to fede ſuch as be in him regenerate, to thintente that as man was redemed by Chriſt, ſufferyng in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his humanitie: ſo to purchace for man the kingdome of heauen / ioſte by Adams fall. Euen likewiſe in the nature of the ſame humanitic, giuyng it to be eaten to noriſhe man &amp; make him ſtrong to walke and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his iorney, to emoye that kingdome. And therfore to ſet forth liuely vnto vs the communication of the ſubſtance of Chriſtes moſt precious bodie in the Sacrament, and the ſame to be in dede deliuered: Chriſt vſed plaine wordes / teſtified by the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſtes. S. Paule alſo reherſed the ſame wordes in the ſame plain termes in the .xi. to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians / and in the tenth, geuyng (as it were) an expoſion of theffecte, vſeth the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre wordes declaryng theffecte to be the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſtes bodie and bloud. And one thing is notable touching the ſcripture / that in ſuche notable ſpeaches vttered by Chriſt, as might haue an ambiguitie, the Euangeliſtes by ſome circumſtaunce decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, or ſome tyme opened it by plaine inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretacion, as when Chriſt ſayd / he would diſſolue the temple, and within three daies
<pb facs="tcp:2975:16"/>
buylde it againe: The Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gtliſtes by and by addeth for interpretacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: This he ſaid of the temple of his bodie. And when Chriſte ſayd / he is Helias, and I am the true vine: the circumſtaunce of the text openeth the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guitie. But to ſhew that Chriſt ſhould not meane of his verie bodie when he ſo ſpake: Neither S. Paule after, ne the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gtliſtes in the place, adde any wordes or circumſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, wherby to take away the propre ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacion of the wordes (bodie) and (bloud) ſo as the ſame might ſame not in dede geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as the Catholique faith reacheth) but in ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacion as thauctor would haue it. For as for the wordes of Chriſt: The ſpirit geueth life (the fleſhe profiteth nothing) be to declare the two natures in Chriſt eche in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie apart conſidered, but not as they be in Chriſtes perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnited, the myſterie of which vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſuche as beleued not Chriſt to be God could not conſider, and yet to inſinuate that vnto them, Chriſt made mention of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion from heauen, and after of his aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thither againe, wherby they might vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand him verie God, whoſe fleſhe taken in the virgyns wombe, and ſo geuen ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to be eaten of vs (as I haue before opened, viuiſike and geueth life. And this ſhall ſuffice here, to ſhew how Chriſtes inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was to geue verely (as he did in dede) his pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cious bodie and bloud to be eaten and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, accordyng as he taught the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be verely
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2975:16"/>
meat and drinke, and yet gaue and geueth them ſo vnder fourme of viſible creatures to vs, as we may conueniently, and without horror of our nature receaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Chriſt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in condiſcendyng to our infirmitie. As for ſuch other wranglyng, as is made in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandyng of the wordes of Chriſt, ſhall after be ſpoken of, by further occaſion.</p>
               <p>The auctor vttereth a great meny wordes, from the .viii. to the .xvii. chapter of the firſt booke, declaryng ſpirituall hungre and thurſt and the releuyng of the ſame by ſpirituall feadyng in Chriſt, and of Chriſt, as we conſtantly beleue in him, to the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of which beleif the auctor would haue the Sacramentes of Baptiſme, and of the bodie and bloud of Chriſt to be adminicles (as it were) and that we by them be preched vnto, as in water, bread and wyne, and by them all our ſences (as it were) ſpoken vnto, or proprely touched, whiche matter in the groſſe, although ther be ſome wordes by the way not tollerable, yet if thoſe wordes ſet apart, the ſame were in the ſumme graunted, to be good teachyng and holeſome exhorcacion, it conteyneth ſo no more but good matter, not well applyed. For the Catholique churche / that profeſſeth the truth of the preſence of Chriſtes bodie in the Sacrament, would therewith vſe that declaration of hungre of Chriſt / and
<pb facs="tcp:2975:17"/>
that ſpirituall refreſhyng in Chriſte, with the effect of Chriſtes paſſion and death, and the ſame to be thonely meane of mans rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracion, and feadyng alſo, with the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, of that feadyng fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bodiely feadyng for continuyng this yearthly life. But this toucheth not the principal point that ſhould be entreated. Whether Chriſt ſo ordered to fede ſuche as be regenerate in him, to geue to them in the Sacrament, the ſame his bodie, that he gaue to be crucified for vs. The good man is fedde by faith, and by the merites of Chriſtes paſſion, beyng the meane of the gift of that faith, &amp; other giftes alſo, and by the ſufferyng of the bodie of Chriſt, &amp; ſheddynge of his mooſt precyous bloud on thaultar of the Croſſe: whiche worke and paſſion of Chriſt is preached vnto vs / by wordes and ſacramentes, and the ſame doctrine receiued of vs by faith / &amp; the effecte of it alſo. And thus farre goeth the doctrine of this auctor.</p>
               <p>But the Catholique teachyng, by the ſcriptures, goth futher, confeſſing Chriſt to feade ſuch as be regenerate in him, not onely by his bodie and bloud: but alſo with his bodie and bloud deliuered in this ſacrament by him in dede to vs, whiche the faythfull, by his inſtitucion and commaundement, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue with their faith and with their mouth alſo, and with thoſe ſpecyall deynties, be fed ſpecially at Chriſtes table. And ſo God doth not onely preach in his ſacraments, but
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2975:17"/>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2975:18"/>
teachyng this auctor can not be ignoraunte. So as (thauctor) of this booke reporteth an vntruth wittyngly againſt his conſcience, to ſay they teache (callyng the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Papiſtes,) that Chriſt is in the bread &amp; wyne, but they agre in forme of teachyng with that the Churche of England teacheth at this day, in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of the holie communion, in that it is there ſayd the bodie and bloud of Chriſt to be vnder the forme of bread and wyne. And thus much ſerueth for declaracion of the wrong and vntrue reporte of the fayth of the Catholique church made of this auctor, in the ſettyng forth of this difference on that part. whiche it pleaſeth him to name Papiſtes. And nowe to ſpeake of the other parte of the difference on thauctors ſide, when he would tell what he and his ſay, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyeth a ſence craftely in wordes to ſerue for a difference: ſuche as no Catholique man would deny. For euery Catholique teacher graunteth, that no man can receaue worthely Chriſtes precious bodie and bloud in the Sacrament, onleſſe he hath by fayth and charitie Chriſt dwellyng in him, for otherwiſe, ſuche one as hath not Chriſt in him, receaueth Chriſtes bodie in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament vnworthely, to his condempnacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Chriſt can not be receaued worthely, but in to his owne temple, whiche be ye (S. Paule
<pb facs="tcp:2975:19"/>
ſayth) &amp; yet, he that hath not / Chriſtes ſpirit in him, is not his, As for callyng it bread and wyne, a Catholique man forbereth not that name, ſignifiyng, what thoſe creatures were before the conſecracion in ſubſtaunce. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appeareth, how thauctor of this boke in the lieu and place of a difference, whiche he pretendeth he would ſhew, bringeth in that vnder a (But) which euery Catholique man, muſt nedes confeſſe, that Chriſt is in them, who worthely eate and drinke the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his bodie &amp; bloud, or the bread and wyne as this auctor ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p>But and this auctor would haue ſpoken plainely, and compared truely the difference of the two teachynges / he ſhould in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part haue ſayd ſomewhat contrarie to that the Catholique churche teacheth, which he doth not / and therfore, as he ſheweth vntruth in the firſt reporte, ſo he ſheweth a ſleight and ſhifte in the declaracion of the ſecond part, to ſay that repungneth not to the firſt matter, &amp; that no Catholique man will deny / conſideryng that the ſayd two teachynges be not of one matter, nor ſhote not (as one might ſay) to one marke. For the firſt part, is of the ſubſtaunce of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be receaued, where it is truth, Chriſt to be preſent God and man: The ſecond part is of Chriſtes ſpiritual preſence in the man that receaueth, which in dede muſt be in him before he receaue the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or he can not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2975:19"/>
receyue the Sacrament worthely, as afore is ſayd, whiche two partes may ſtand well together, without any repugnaunce, and ſo both the differences, thus taught, make but one catholique doctrine. Let vs ſe what the auctor ſayth further.</p>
               <p>They ſay, that when any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eateth the bread and <note place="margin">The auctor.</note> drynketh the cup, Chriſt goeth into his mouth or ſtomoke with the bread and wyne, and no further: But we ſay / that Chriſt is in the hole man, both in body and ſoule, of him that worthely eateth the bread and drynketh the cup, and not in his mouth or ſtomoke onely.</p>
               <p>In this compariſon, thauctor termeth the <note place="margin">The anſwer.</note> true Catholique teachyng at his pleaſure, to bryng it in contempte. Whiche doyng in rude ſpeache would be called otherwiſe then I wyll terme it. Truth it is (as Sainct Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine ſayth) we receaue in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the body of Chriſt, with our mouthe, and ſuche ſpeache other vſe, as a booke ſet forth in the archbiſſhoppe of Cantorburies name called a Cathechiſme, willeth children to be taught that they receaue with their bodely mouth the body and bloud of, Chriſt, whiche I allege becauſe it ſhall appeare it is a teachyng ſet forth among vs of late as hath been alſo and is by the booke of comen prayor beyng the mooſt true Catholique do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the ſubſtaunce of the Sacrament, in that it is there ſo Catholiquely ſpoken of, whiche booke this auctor doth after ſpecially
<pb facs="tcp:2975:20"/>
allow, how ſo euer all the ſumme of his tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng doth improue it in that point. So much is he contrarie to him ſelfe in this worke, and here in this place not caryng (what he ſayth) reporteth ſuche a teachyng in the firſt parte of this difference, as I haue not hearde of before: There was neuer man of learnyng that I haue red, termed the matter ſo, that Chriſt goeth into the ſtomoke of the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that receaueth and no further. For that is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>contra Stercoroniſtas,</hi> is nothyng to this tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng, nor the ſpeache of any gloſe if there be any ſuch, were herein to be regarded. The Catholique doctrine is, that by the holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction in the Sacrament, we be ioyned to Chriſt really, becauſe we receaue in the holy ſupper, the moſt precious ſubſtaunce of his glorious body, whiche is a fleſhe geuyng life: And that is not digeſted into our fleſhe, but worketh in vs and attempereth, by heauenly nurrttor, our body and ſoule beyng parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his paſſyon to be conformable to his will and by ſuche ſpiritual foode to be made more ſpirituall. In the receauyng of whiche foode, in the moſt bleſſed Sacrament our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoule in them that duelie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate, worketh together in due ordre without other diſcuſſyon of the myſterie then God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred (that is to ſay) the ſoule to beleue as it is taught, and the body to do as God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, knowyng that gloryous fleſhe by our eatyng can not be conſumed or ſuffre, but to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2975:20"/>
be moſt profitable vnto ſuch as do accuſtonie worthely to receiue the ſame. But to ſay that the churche teacheth how we receaue Chriſt at our mouth, and he goeth into our ſtomoke and no further, is a reporte which by the iuſt iudgemente of God is ſuffred to come out of the mouthe of them that fyght againſt the truth in this moſt high myſterie.</p>
               <p>Now where this auctor in the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de part by an aduerſiteue with a (But) to make the compariſon, telleth what he and his ſay, he telleth in effect that which euery Catholique man muſt nedes, and doth confeſſe: For ſuch as receaue Chriſtes moſt precious body and bloud in the Sacrament worthly, they haue Chriſt dwellyng in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who conforteth both body and ſoule, whiche the church hath euer taught moſt plainely, ſo as this compariſon of differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in his two parties, is made of one open vntruth, &amp; a truth diſguiſed, as though it were now firſt opened by this auctor and his, whiche maner of handelyng declareth what ſleyght and ſhift is vſed in the matter.</p>
               <p>They ſay, that Chriſt is receyued in the mouth, &amp; <note place="margin">The auctor.</note> entreth in with the bread and wyne: We ſay, that he is receyued in the heart / and entreth in by faith.</p>

But (we ſay) that Chriſt remayneth in the man that worthely receaueth it, ſo long as the man remayneth a membre of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This compariſon is like the other before, <note place="margin">The anſwer.</note> wherof the firſt parte is garniſhed and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloſſed with vntruth, and the ſecond parte, that the church hath euer taught moſt truly, &amp; that al muſt beleue, and therfore that pece hath no vntruth in the matter, but in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner only, beyng ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as though it diffred fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the continuall open reachyng of the churche which is not ſo, wherfor in the maner of it in vtteraunce ſignifieth an vntruth, whiche in the matter it ſelfe is neuertheleſſe moſt true.

Thus ſayth S.

And the ſeconde part of the compariſon on thauctors ſide, conteyned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (we ſay) by them that in hypocriſye pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to be truthes frendes, conteyneth an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, to the ſimple reader, and yet hath a matter of wranglyng to the learned reader, becauſe of the worde (very) which referred to thefecte of eatyng the body of Chriſt, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to receyue life, may be ſo ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that none receyue the body of Chriſte with the very ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte of life, but ſuche as eate the ſacrament

ſpirituallye, that is to ſaye with true fayth worthely. And yet euill men as Iudas, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ſame very body, touchyng the truth of the preſence therof, that S. Peter did. For in the ſubſtaunce of the Sacrament, whiche is Goddes worke is no variete, who ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all (as afore) vniformely, but in man is the variete, amonges who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he that receyueth worthely Chriſtes body, receyueth life, and he that receyueth vnworthely, receyueth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>They ſay that good men eate the body of Chriſt <note place="margin">The auctor.</note> and drinke his bloud only at that tyme when they re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyue the Sacrament: we ſay that they eate / drinke and fede of Chriſt continually / ſo long as they be membres of his body.</p>
               <p>What forehede, I pray you, is ſo heatde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <note place="margin">The anſwer.</note> that can vtter this among them, that know any thing of the learnyng of Chriſtes churche? In whiche it is a moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that there is thre maner of eatynges of Chriſtes body and bloud: one ſpiritual only, whiche is here affirmed in the ſeconde parte (we ſay) wherein the auctor and his ſay, as the churche ſayth. Another eatyng is bothe ſacramentally &amp; ſpiritually, whiche is when men worthely communicate in the ſupper. The thyrd is ſacramentally only, whiche is by men vnworthy, who eate and drynke in the holy ſupper to their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dempnacion only. And the learned men in Chriſtes churche ſay that the ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; want of obſeruacion of

theſe thre maner of eatynges, cauſeth the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in thunderſtandyng of the ſcriptures &amp; ſuche fathers ſaiynges, as haue written of the Sacrament.

reache it, but in his diſcourſe ſhal as this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor doth, thinke it a vanitie and foliſheneſſe, Whiche foliſheneſſe, neuertheleſſe ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the wiſdome of the worlde. And thus I haue opened what they ſay on the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique parte. Now for the other parte wherof this auctor is, and with his fayth (we ſaye) the wordes ſeme to imply, that Chriſtes hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne body is not in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, in that it is ſayd, Chriſt to be there ſacramentally &amp; ſpirituallye, without fourme or quantitie, whiche ſaiyng hath no ſcripture for it. For the ſcripture ſpeaketh of Chriſts body which was betrayed for vs, to be geuen vs to be eaten. Where alſo Chriſtes diuinitie is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as accompaniyng his humanitie, which humanitie is ſpecially ſpoken of, the preſence of whiche humanite, when it is denyed, then is there no text to proue the preſence of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes diuinitie ſpecially, that is to ſay, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then it is by his omnipotencye preſente euery where. And to conclude this piece of compariſon, this maner of ſpeache was neuer I thinke redde, that Chriſt is preſent in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t without fourme or quantitie. And S. Paule ſpeaketh of a fourme in the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, <hi>(Qui quum in forma dei eſſet.)</hi> Who <note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> when he was in the fourme of God. So as if Chriſt be preſent in the Sacrament without all fourme, then is he there, neither as God nor man, whiche is a ſtraunger teachyng the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yet hath been heard or redde of, but into ſuch
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2975:28"/>
abſurdities in dede do they fall, who entreat irreuerently and vntruely this high miſterie. This is here worthy a ſpeciall note how by the maner of the ſpeache in the latter parte of this difference, the teachyng ſemeth to be, that Chriſt is ſpiritually preſent in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, becauſe of the worde (there) which thou reader mayeſt compare how it agreeth with the reſt of this auctors doctrine, Let vs go to the next.</p>
               <p>They ſay that the fathers, and Prophetes of the <note place="margin">The auctor.</note> old teſtament, did not eate the body, nor drinke the bloud of Chriſt. We ſay, that they did eat his body, and drinke his bloud, although he wer not yet borne nor incarnated.</p>
               <p>This compariſon of difference, is clerkely <note place="margin">The anſwer.</note> conceyued, as it wer of a ryddle, wherin, nay &amp; yea, when they be opened, agree &amp; conſent. The fathers did eate Chriſtes body &amp; drinke his bloud in truth of promyſe, whicht was effectual to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of redemption to be wrought, not in truth of preſence, (as we do) for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of redemption already wrought. They had a certayne promyſe, and we a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne preſent payment: they did eate Chriſt ſpiritually, beleuing in him that was to come but they did not eate Chriſtes body preſent in the Sacrament, ſacramentally, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, as we do. Their ſacramentes were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of the thynges, but out conteyne the very thinges. And therfore albeit in a ſence to the learned men, it may be verefyed, that the
<pb facs="tcp:2975:29"/>
fathers did eat the body of Chriſt &amp; drink his bloud, yet there is no ſuche forme of wordes in ſcripture, &amp; it is more agreable to the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of ſcripture, to ſay the fathers before Chriſtes natiuite, did not eate the body and bloud of Chriſt, whiche body &amp; bloud Chriſt himſelfe truely toke of the body of the virgin Marie. For although S. Paule in the tenth to the Corinthians, be ſo vnderſtanded of ſome, as the fathers ſhould eat the ſame ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tual meat, &amp; drinke the ſame ſpiritual drinke that we do, to which vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng, al do not agree, yet folowyng that vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng, we may not ſo preſſe the words, as there ſhould be no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce at al, &amp; this one ſpecial differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce S.

Thus he ſayth; &amp; this is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of it ſelfe, how to vs in the holy ſupper Chriſt ſayth: (This is my body that ſhall be betrayed for you (Take, eate) which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſayd to the fathers, although their fayth in ſubſtance agreed with our, hauyng al one Chriſt &amp; mediatour, whiche they loked for to come, &amp; we acknowledge to be already co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me.

               <p>This compariſon is out of the matter of the preſence of Chriſtes moſt precious body <note place="margin">The anſwer.</note> in the Sacrament, whiche preſence (this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor) in the firſt part of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon, ſemeth by implication to graunte, when he findeth faulte, that the prieſtes deuotion ſhould be a ſacrifice ſatiſfactorie, and not the thyng that is offred, whiche maner of doctrine (I neuer red) and I thinke it myſelfe it ought to be

improued, if any ſuch there be to make the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the prieſt a ſatiſfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly Chriſt is our ſatiſfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wholly &amp; fully, who hath payde our hole debte to god the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for thappeſing of his iuſt wrath againſt vs, and hath ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>celled the byll obligatory (as S.

Wherin was perfited the willyng ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, that he made of himſelfe to God the father for vs, of whom it was writen in the beginnyng of the booke that he ſhould be the body &amp; perfyte acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of al ſacrifices, as of whom all other ſacrifices before, were ſhadowes &amp; figures. And here is to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, howe the obedient wyl in Chriſtes ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, is ſpecially to be noted, who ſuffred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would. Whiche S. Paule ſetteth forth in declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſtes humilitie. And although that willyng obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was ended &amp; perfited on the croſſe, to the whiche it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the begining, by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is in S. Paules ſpeach, attribute ther vnto: yet as in the ſacrifice of abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he offred Iſaac, the erneſt wil of offryng, was
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2975:31"/>
acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted for the offryng in dede, wherpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is ſayd in ſcripture that Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> offred Iſaac, &amp; the declaration of the wil of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is called the offryng. So the declaration of Chriſtes wil in his laſt ſupper, was an offryng of him to God the father, aſſuryng there his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtels, of his wil &amp; determination, &amp; by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al the worlde, that his body ſhould be betrayed for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; vs, &amp; his precious bloud ſhedde for remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſynne, which his worde he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with the gift of his precious body to be eaten, &amp; his precious bloud to be dronken. In which miſtery, he declared his body and bloud to be the very ſacrifice of the worlde, by him offred to God the father, by the ſame wil, that he ſayd his body ſhuld be betrayed for vs. And therby aſcertayned vs to be in him willyng, that the Iewes on the croſſe ſemed to execute by violence &amp; force againſt his wil. And therfore as chriſt offred himſelf on the croſſe, in the execution of the worke of his wil, ſo he offred himſelfe in his ſupper, in declaration of his wil, wherby we might be the more aſſured of the effect of his deth which he ſuffred willyngly &amp; determinatly, for the redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the worlde, with a moſt perfite oblation &amp; ſatiſfaction for the ſynnes of the worlde, exhibite &amp; offred by him to God the father, for the reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of mannes nature to gods fauor &amp; grace. And this I wryte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this auctor ſpeaketh ſo preciſely, howe Chriſt offred himſelf neuer but ones, wherby (if he meane by ones offryng) the hole action
<pb facs="tcp:2975:32"/>
of our rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption, whiche was conſummate &amp; perfited vpon the croſſe: Al muſt confeſſe the ſubſtaunce of that worke of redemption, by thoblation of Chriſtes body on the croſſe, to haue been abſolutly finiſhed, &amp; ſo ones offred for al. But there is no ſcripture, wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we myght conclude, that Chriſt dyd in this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall life, but in one particuler mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of tyme offre himſelfe to his father. For S. Paule deſcribeth it to the Philippians, vnder the <note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> worde of humiliation, to haue continued the hole tyme of Chriſtes conuerſation here, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the death, the death of the croſſe. And that thys obedience to God in humilitie is called offeryng, appeareth by S. Paule when he exhorteth vs to offre our bodies, which mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a continual obedience in thobſeruation of Gods will, &amp; he calleth <hi>(Oblationem gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium)</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 12</note> to bryng them to fayth. And Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s willyng obedience, ready at Gods commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to offre Iſaac, is called the offerynge of Iſaac, and is in very dede a true offeryng and eche man offreth himſelfe to God, when he yeldeth to gods callyng, and preſenteth himſelfe ready to do gods wyl and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, who then may be ſay de to offre his ſeruyce (that is to ſay) to place his ſeruice in ſight and before him, before whom, it ſhould be done. And becauſe our ſauiour Chriſt, by the decree of the hole trinite roke mannes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vpon him, to ſuffre death for our redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, whiche death, in his laſt ſupper, he
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2975:32"/>
declared playnly, he would ſuffre. We reade in S. Cyprian how Chriſt offred himſelfe in his ſupper. fulfillyng the figure of Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech, who by thoffryng of bread and wyne ſignifyed that high miſtery of Chriſtes ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in which Chriſt vnder the forme of bread and wyne, gaue his very body and bloud to be eaten and dronken, and in the geuynge therof, declared the determination of his glorious Paſſion, and the fruite and effecte therof, Whiche doyng was a ſwete, &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunte oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to God the father, conteinyng a moſt perfyte obedience to Gods wyll and pleaſure. And in the miſtery of this ſupper, was writen, made and ſealed a moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte teſtimonie, for an effectuall memorye of Chriſtes offeryng of himſelfe to his father, and of his death and paſſion with the fruite therof. And therfore Chriſt ordeyned this ſupper, to be obſerued and continued for a memory to his cummyng: So as we that ſawe not, with our bodely eyes Chriſtes death and paſſion, may in the celebration of the ſupper, be moſt ſuredly aſcertayned of the truth, out of Chriſtes owne mouth. Who ſtyl ſpeaketh in the perſon of the miniſtre of the church: This is my body that is betrayed for you: This is my bloud that is ſhedde for you in remiſſion of ſynne: and therwith ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his very body truely preſent, and his precious bloud truely preſent, to be taken of vs, eaten and dronken. Wherby we be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb facs="tcp:2975:33"/>
that Chriſt is the ſame to vs, that he was to them, and vſeth vs as familiarly as he did them, offreth himſelf to his father for vs, aſwel as for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, declareth his wil in the fruit of his death, to perteyn aſwel to vs, as to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Of which death we be aſſured by his own mouth, that he ſuffred the ſame to thef: fecte he ſpake of, &amp; by the continual feadyng in this high myſtery, of the ſame very body that ſuffed, and feadyng of it without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, beyng continually exhibite vnto vs a liuyng body, and liuely bloud, not only our ſoule is ſpecially and ſpiritually comforted, and our body therby reduced to more confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable obedience to the ſoule, but alſo we by the participation of this moſt precious body and bloud, be aſcertayned of reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and regeneration of our bodyes &amp; fleſhe, to be by gods power made incorruptible, &amp; immortal to lyue &amp; haue fruition in God with our ſoule for euer. Wherfore hauyng this myſtery of Chriſtes ſupper, ſo many truthes in it, the churche hath celebrate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al, and knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them al, of one certayntie in truth, not as figures, but really in dede, that is to ſay, as our body ſhal be in the general reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> regenerate in dede, ſo we beleue we fede here of Chriſtes body in dede. And as it is true, that Chriſtes body in dede is betrayed for vs, ſo it is true, that he geueth vs to eate his very body in dede. And as it is true, that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2975:33"/>
Chriſt was in yearth and dyd celebrate this ſupper: So it is true that he commaunded it to be celebrate by vs, tyl he come: And as it is true that Chriſt was very God omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and very man: So it is true that he could do that he affirmed by his worde himſelfe to do, And as he is moſt ſincere truth: So may we be truely aſſured, that he would, and did as he ſayd. And as it is true that he is moſt iuſſ: ſo it is true that he aſſiſteth the doyng of his commaundement in the celebration of the holy ſupper. And therfore as he is auctor of this moſt holy Sacrament of his precious body and bloud: ſo is he the maker of it, &amp; is the inuiſible prieſt, who as Emiſſene ſayth, <note place="margin">Emiſſen</note> by his ſecrete power, with his worde, chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the viſible creatures, into the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his body and bloud. Wherin manne the viſible prieſt and miniſtre by ordre of the churche, is only a diſpenſer of the myſtery, doyng and ſaiyng, as the holy ghoſt hath taught the churche to be done and ſayd. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally as we be taught by fayth, all theſe to be true: ſo when wanton reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, (fayth beyng a ſhepe) goth about by curioſitie to empayre any one of theſe truthes, the chayne is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the lynkes ſparkle abroade, and all is brought in daungier to be ſcattered and ſcambled at. Truthes haue been abuſed, but yet they be true, as they were before. For no man can make that is true falſe,
<pb facs="tcp:2975:34"/>
&amp; abuſe, is mannes faulte &amp; not the thynges. Scripture in ſpeache geueth to man as gods miniſtre, the name of that actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which God ſpecially worketh in that miniſtery. So it pleaſeth God to honor the miniſtery of man in his churche, by whom it alſo pleaſeth him to worke effectually. And Chriſt ſayd, they that beleue in me, ſhall do the workes that I do, and greater. When all this honour is geuen to man, as ſpiritually to regenerate, when the miniſtre ſayth (I Baptize the) and to remitte ſynne, to ſuche as fall after, to be alſo a miniſtre in conſecration of Chriſtes moſt precious body, wyth the miniſtration of other ſacramentes, benedictions, &amp; prayour. If man ſhould then waxe proude, &amp; glorye (as of himſelfe) and extolle his owne deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in theſe miniſteries, ſuche men ſhould bewraye their owne noughtie hypocriſye, &amp; yet therby empayre not the very dignitie of the miniſtery, ne the very true frute &amp; effecte therof. And therfore when the church, by the miniſtre prayeth, that the creatures of bread and wyne, ſet on thaultare (as the booke of commen prayour in this realme hath ordred) may be vnto vs the body &amp; bloud of our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior Chriſt, we require then the celebration of the ſame ſupper, whiche Chriſt made to his Apoſtels, for to be the continual memory of his death, with all frute and effecte, ſuche as the ſame had in the firſt inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the miniſtre pronounſeth Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2975:34"/>
wordes, as ſpoken of his mouth, it is to be beleued, that Chriſt doth nowe, as he did then. And it is to be noted, that although in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of baptiſme, the miniſtre ſaith: I baptize the, yet in the celebratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this ſup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per, the wordes be ſpoken in Chriſts perſon, as ſaiyng himſelfe: This is my body that is broken for you, which is not to vs only a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, but an effectuall memory with the very preſence of Chriſtes body &amp; bloud, our very ſacrifice, who doyng now as he did then, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freth himſelfe to his father, as he did the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not to renewe that offryng as though it wer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfite, but continually to refreſhe vs, that dayly fall and decay. And as (S. Iohn ſayth) Chriſt is our aduocate &amp; entreateth for vs, or <note place="margin">1. Ioa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 2.</note> pleadeth for vs, not to ſupplye any wante on gods behalfe, but to releaue our wantes in edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherin the miniſtery of the church trauayleth to brynge manne to perfection in Chriſt, whiche Chriſt himſelfe dothe aſſiſte and abſolutely perfourme in his churche his myſtical body. Nowe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue Chriſtes body thus preſente in the celebration of the holy ſupper, and by Chriſtes mouth preſent vnto vs, ſaying: This is my body whiche is betrayed for you, Then haue we Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy recommended vnto vs (as oure ſacrifice) and a ſacrifice propiciatory for al the ſynnes of the worlde, beynge the onely ſacrifice of Chriſtes church, the pure and cleane ſacrifice whereof the prophete Malachie ſpake, and <note place="margin">Malach.</note>

As the ſonne is truly placed determinately in one place of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heauen, and yet is truely &amp; ſubſtantially preſent by meane of his beames elswhere in the worlde abrode: So (our Lorde) although he be comprehended in one place of the ſecret and diuine heauen, that is to ſay, the glorye of his father, yet neuer the leſſe by his worde and holy tokens, he is exhibite preſent truly, whole God and man, &amp; therfore in ſubſtance in his holy ſupper, whiche preſence mannes mynde geuyng credite to his wordes &amp; toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s with no leſſe certaintie acknowlegeth, then our eyes ſee, &amp; haue the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne preſent exhibite

This is a depe ſecrete matter of the newe teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; a matter of faith and therfore herin though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes be not to be receyued of ſuche a preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth in the maner of this lyfe tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſitorie and ſubiecte to ſuffre. We muſt ſimply cleaue to the worde of Chriſt, &amp; fayth muſt releue the defaulte of our ſences. Thus hath Bucer expreſſed his mynd, wher vnto becauſe the ſimilitude of the ſonne doth not anſwer in all partes, he noteth wiſely in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, how this is a matter of faith, &amp; therfore vpon the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of fayth, we muſt ſpeake of it; therby to ſupply where our ſences faile. For the preſence of Chriſt, and hole Chriſte God and man is true, althoughe we can not thinke of the maner (howe). The chief cauſe why I bring in Bucer is this, to ſhewe how in his iugement we haue not only in earth, the operation &amp; vertue of the ſonne, but alſo the ſubſtaunce of the ſonne, by meane of the ſonne beames, which be of the ſame ſuſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with the ſonne, &amp; can not be deuyded in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce from it, &amp; therfore we haue in yerth the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cial preſence of the ſonne, not onely the operation &amp; vertue. And howſoeuer the ſonne aboue in the diſtaunce appereth vnto vs of an other ſorte, yet the beames that touche the yerth, be of the ſame ſubſtaunce with it (as clerkes ſay) or at the leſt as Bucer ſayth, whom I neuer harde accompted Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, and yet for the reall and ſubſtannciall

the nature of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhuld with like comon effect worke, in eatyng &amp; drinkyng that heauenly meate &amp; drinke, as it doth in earthely &amp; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nali meates. In this myſterye man doth as Chriſt ordeyned, that is to ſay, receyue with his mouth, that is ordred to be receiued with his mouth, grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tyng it neuertheleſſe of that dignitie &amp; eſtimation, that Chriſtes wordes affirme, &amp; whither he ſo doth or no, Chriſtes ordinaunce is as it is in the ſubſtaunce of it ſelf alone, wherof no good man iudgeth car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally or groſſely ne diſcuſſeth the vnfayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (how) which he can not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceyue, but leueth the depenes thereof, &amp; doth as he is bidden. This miſterye receyueth no mans thoughtes. Chriſtes inſtitution hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie in it, whiche can not be diſcuſſed by mans ſenſual reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Chriſtes wordes be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite &amp; life, which this auctour wreſteth with his owne gloſe, to exclud the truth of the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng of Chriſtes fleſh in his ſupper. And yet for a ſhifte, if a man would ioyne iſſue with him, putteth to this ſpech the wordes (groſſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly) &amp; (carnally) which wordes in ſuche a rude vnderſtandyng, be termes meter to expreſſe howe dogges deuoure paunches, then to be inculked in ſpeakyng of this high myſterye. Wherin I wil make the iſſue with this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour <note place="margin">An iſſue.</note> that no Catholique teaching is ſo four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with ſuche termes as though we ſhould eate Chriſtes moſte precious bodye groſſely, carnaly, ioynyng thoſe wordes ſo together,
<pb facs="tcp:2975:42"/>
For els (carnally) alone may haue a good ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnification, as Hilarye vſeth it, but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywiſe ſpekyng in the Catholique teachyng of the maner of Chriſtes preſence, they call it a ſpiritual maner of preſence, and yet there is preſent by gods powre the very true natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral body &amp; bloud of Chriſt, hole God &amp; man, without leuyng his place in heauen, &amp; in the holy ſupper me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vſe their mouthes and teathe followyng Chriſtes commaundement in the receiuyng of that holy Sacrament, beyng in fayth ſufficiently inſtructe, that they do not ne can not teare, conſume or violate that moſte precious body and bloud but vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely receiuyng it are cauſe of theyr owne iugement and condempnation. Nowe I wil touche ſhortely, what maye bee ſayd to the particuler auctorities brought in by this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor. Origen is noted (among other writers <note place="margin">Orige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> of the churche) to drawe the texte to allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, who doth not therby meane to deſtroye the truth of the lettre, &amp; therfore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of a figure, ſayth not there is a only fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, whiche excluſiue (only) beyng away, (as it is not found by any auctor Catholike, taught that the ſpech of Chriſt of the eatyng of his fleſhe to be only a figure.)</p>
               <p>This auctor hath nothyng auaunced his purpoſe. As for ſpiritual vnderſtandyng meaneth not any deſtruction of the lettre where the ſame may ſtande with the rule of our fayth. All Chriſtes wordes be life and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2975:42"/>
ſpirite containyng in the lettre many tymes that is aboue our capacite, as ſpecially in this place of the eatyng of his fleſh, to diſcuſſe the particularities of (howe) and yet we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue to be true that Chriſt ſayth (although we can not tell howe:) For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we go about to diſcuſſe of gods miſterye (howe,) then we fall from fayth, and waxe carnall men, and would haue Gods wayes like ours.</p>
               <p>Sainete Chriſoſtome declareth himſelfe <note place="margin">Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſto.</note> howe myſteries muſt be conſidered with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde eyes, whiche is a ſpirituall vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng, wherby the truth of the myſterye is not, (as it were by a figuratiue ſpech empay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) but with an humilitie of vnderſtandyng in a certaine fayth of the truth merueyled at. And here thauetor of the boke vſeth a ſleight to ioyn figuratiuely to ſpiritually, as though they were alwayes all one, whiche is not ſo.</p>
               <p>Sainct Auguſtine accordyng to his rules <note place="margin">Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinus.</note> of a figuratiue and propre ſpeche, taketh this ſpeche.

And therfore becauſe only faithfull men can by fayth vnderſtande this myſterye of the eatyng of Chriſtes fleſhe in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in whiche we eate not the carnal fleſhe of a commen man as the lettre ſoundeth, but

<pb facs="tcp:2975:44"/>
Wherfore it foloweth by Tertullians co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion when Chriſt made the bread his body, that Chriſt ended the figure, and made it the truth, making now his body that was before the figure of his body. For if Chriſt did no more but make it a figure ſtyl, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did he not make it his body as Tertullian himſelf ſaith he did. And Tertullian therfore, beyng red thus, as appeareth to be moſt probable that (that is to ſay in Turtullian) ſhould be onely referred to the explicacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the firſt (this) as when Turtullia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had alleged Chriſts words ſaiyng (this is my body) &amp; putteth to of his owne (that is to ſay the figure of my body,) theſe wordes (that is to ſay) ſhould ſerue to declare the demonſtracion (this,) in this wiſe (that is to ſay) this, which the prophet called the figure of my body, is nowe my body, &amp; ſo Tertullian ſayd before that Chriſt had made bread his body, which bread was a figure of his body with the prophete, &amp; nowe endeth in the very truth, beyng made his body by conuerſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as (Cypria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſheweth) of the nature of bread into his body. Tertullian reaſoned againſt the Marcioniſtes, &amp; becauſe a figure in the prophete ſignifieth a certayne vnfay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned truth of that is ſignified, ſeyng Chriſtes bodye was figured by bread in the prophete Hieremy. It appeareth Chriſt had a true bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And that the bread was of Chriſt appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for a figure, he made it nowe his very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And this may be ſayd euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2975:44"/>
who reaſonyng againſt heretiques v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the commoditie of arguyng, and geueth no doctrine of the Sacrament to further this auctors purpoſe.

This place of Tertullian is no ſecrete poynte of lernyng, &amp; hath been of Decolampadius &amp; other alleged &amp; by other catholique men anſwered vnto it, wherof this auctor may not thinke nowe as vpon a wranglyng argument, to ſatiſfie a coniecture diuiſed, therby to confirme a newe teachyng.

This is my tranſlation who in the firſt ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce meane not to vary from the other tranſlations touchyng the remayne of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce, ſhape, forme, or figure, I will vſe all thoſe names.

And therfore in theſe two wordes that they be beleued, that they bee made &amp; be worſhiped, is declared by Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rete, his fayth of the very true real preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Chriſtes glorious fleſhe, whervnto the deite is vnite: which fleſhe.

in Theodoret, but leaue it to thy iudgement reader, what credite this auctor ought to haue that ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dleth the mater after this ſorte.</p>
               <p>As for the vſe of figuratiue ſpeches to be accuſtumed in ſcripture is not denyed. But Philip Melancton in an epiſtel to Decolam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padius <note place="margin">Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton.</note> of the Sacrement, geueth one good note of obſeruation in difference betwene the ſpeches in gods ordinaunces &amp; commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and otherwiſe. For if in thunderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng of gods ordinaunces and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, figures may be often receyued: truth ſhall by allegories be ſhortely ſubuerted and all our religion reduced to ſignifications. There is no ſpeache ſo plaine and ſimple, but it hath ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne peice of a figuratiue ſpeache, but ſuch as expreſſeth the common plaine vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandyng, and then the common vſe of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure cauſeth it to be taken as a common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre ſpeache, As theſe ſpeches, drinke vp this cup or eate this diſhe, is in dede a figuratiue ſpeche, but by cuſtume made ſo common that it is reputed the plaine ſpech, becauſe it hath but one only vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng commonly recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. And when Chriſt ſayd: This cuppe is the newe teſtament: the propre ſpeche therof in lettre, hath an abſurdite in reaſon &amp; fayth alſo. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt ſayd, This is my body, although the truth of the litteral ſence hath an abſurditie in carnall reaſon, yet hath it no abſurditie in humilite of fayth nor repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gneth not to any other truthe of ſcripture.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2975:48"/>
And ſeyng it is a ſinguler miracle of Chriſt wherby to exerciſe vs in the fayth, vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as the plaine wordes ſignifie in their propre ſence, there can no reaſonyng be made of other figuratiue ſpeches to make this to be their felowe and like vnto them. No man denyeth the vſe of figuratiue ſpeaches in Chriſtes ſupper, but ſuche as be equal with plaine propre ſpech, or be expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by other Euangeliſtes in plaine ſpeche.</p>
               <p>In the .lxxiiii. leef this auctor goth about to geue a general ſolution to all that may be ſaid of Chriſtes beyng in yearth, in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or the. Sacrament, and geueth inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s how theſe wordes of Chriſtes diuine nature figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiuely, ſpiritually, really, carnally, corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally, may be placed, and thus he ſayth: Chriſt in his diuine nature may be ſayd to be in the earth figuratiuely in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually in the man that receiueth, but really, carnally, corporally, only in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Let vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the placyng of theſe termes. When we ſay chriſtis in his diuine nature euery wher, is he not alſo really euery where, accordyng to the true eſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his godhed in dede euery where, that is to ſay, not in fanſye nor ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, but verely, truely, &amp; therfore really as we beleue ſo in dede euery where? And when Chriſte is ſpiritually in good men by grace, is not Chriſte in them really by grace? but in fanſye and imagination? And therfore whatſoeuer this auctor ſayth the worde
<pb facs="tcp:2975:49"/>
really may not haue ſuch reſtraint, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred only to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, onles the auctor would deny the ſubſtaunce of the godhed, which as it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehendeth all beyng inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehenſible, &amp; is euery wher without limitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of place, ſo as it is, truly it is, in dede is, &amp; therfore really is, &amp; therfore of Chriſt muſt be ſayd, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſouer he is in his diuine nature by powre or grace, he is ther really, whither we ſpeake of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or yearth. As for the termes carnally, &amp; corporaly, as this auctor ſemeth to vſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in other places of his booke, to expreſſe the maner of preſence of the humayne nature in Chriſt, I meruayle by what ſcripture he wil proue that Chriſtes body is ſo carnally and corporally in heauen, we be aſſured by fayth grounded vpon the ſcriptures of the truth of the beyng of Chriſtes fleſhe and body there, and the ſame to be a true fleſhe, and a true bodye, but yet in ſuche ſence as this auctor uſeth the termes carnai and corporal againſt the Sacrament, to implie a groſſenes, he can not ſo attribute thoſe termes to Chriſtes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in heauen. S. Auguſtine after the groſſe <note place="margin">Augu. de ciui tate dei Grego. Nazia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenꝰ de baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo.</note> ſence of carnally, ſayth: Chriſt reigneth not carnally in heauen. And Gregorie Nazia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>zen ſayth: Although Chriſt ſhall come in the laſt day to iudge, ſo as he ſhalbe ſeen, yet there is in him no groſſenes he ſayth. And refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the maner of his beyng to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege only. And our reſurrection ſainct Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2975:49"/>
ſayth, althoughe it ſhalbe of our true fleſhe: yet it ſhall not be carnally. And when this auctour hath diffamed as it were the termes carnally, and corporally, as termes of groſſenes, to whom he vſed alwaies to put as an aduerſatiue, the terme ſpiritually, as thought carnally, and ſpiritually might not agre in one. Nowe he would for al that, place them in heauen, where is no carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, but all the maner of beyng, ſpirituall, where is noo groſſenes at all, the ſecrecie of the maner of whiche life, is hidden from us, and ſuche as eye hath not ſeen, or eare herd, or aſcended in to the heart and thought of man. I knowe theſe termes carnally and corporally maye haue a good vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng out of the mouth of him that had not diffamed them with groſſenes or made them aduerſaryes to ſpirituall, and a man may ſaye Chriſt is corporally in heauen, becauſe the truth of his bodye is there, and carnally in heauen, becauſe his fleſhe is truely there, but in this vnderſtandyng both the wordes carnally and corporally, may be copled with the worde ſpiritually, which is againſt this auctors teaching who appointeth the worde ſpiritually to be ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſtes preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that receiued the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t worthely, which ſpeech I do not diſalowe, but as Chriſt is ſpiritually in the man that dothe receyue worthely the Sacrament: So is he in him ſpiritually before hereceyue, orels he can not
<pb facs="tcp:2975:50"/>
receiue worthely as I haue before ſayd. And by this appereth howe this auctor to frame his general ſolution hath vſed neither of the termes, really, carnally, corporally, or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in a conuenient ordre, but hath in his diſtribution myſuſed them notably. For Chriſte in his diuine nature is really euerye where, and in his humayne nature is carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and corporally as theſe wordes ſignifie ſubſtaunce of fleſhe and bodye continually in heauen to the daye of iudgement: &amp; neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe after that ſignification preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t alſo. And in thoſe termes in that ſignification the fathers haue ſpoken of the Sacrament as in the particuler ſolutions to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <p>Let vs nowe conſider what particuler anſwers this auctor diuiſeth to make to the fathers of the church, and firſt what he ſaith to ſainct Elementes Epiſtel, his handelyng wherof is worthie to be noted.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he ſayth the Epiſtel is not Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes but fayned as he ſayth many other thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges <note place="margin">Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> be for their purpoſe (he ſayth,) whiche ſolution is ſhorte and may be ſone learned of noughty men and noughtly applied further
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2975:50"/>
as they liſte: But this I may ſay, if this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtel wer fayned of the Bapiſtes, then do they ſhewe themſelfe fooles, that could fayne no better but ſo as this auctor mighte of their fayned Epiſtell gather thre notes againſte them. This auctors notes be theſe. Firſt that the bread in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is called the Lords body, and that the broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bread be called the peces and fragmentes of the Lordes body. Marke well reader this note that ſpeaketh ſo muche of bread, where the wordes of the Epiſtell, in the parte here alleged name no bread at all. If this auctor hath red ſo much mencion of bread in any other parte of the Epiſtel, why bryngeth he not that forth to fortifie his note? I haue red after in the ſame Epiſtel <hi>(panes ſanctuarij)</hi> but they would not helpe this auctors note, and yet for the other matter ioyned with them, they would ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre an other way. And therfore feyng this auctor hath lefte them out, I will go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is here alleged. The callyng of bread by enunciation, for a name is not material, becauſe it ſignifieth that was, but in that is here alleged, is no mention of bread to proue the note, and to faythfull men, the wordes of the Epiſtel, reuerently expreſſe the remayne of the myſteryes, in which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many hoſtes be offered in the aultare, accordynge to the multitude that ſhoulde communicate, thoſe many hoſtes, after conſecracion, be not many bodyes of Chriſte, but of many breades one
<pb facs="tcp:2975:51"/>
body of Chriſt, &amp; yet as we teach in England nowe, in the booke of como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prayour, in euery parte of that is broken, is the hole body of our ſauiour Chriſt. Mannes wordes can not ſuffice to expreſſe gods myſteryes, nor ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not vttre them ſo, as frowarde reaſon ſhall not fynde matter to wrangle. And yet, to ſtaye reaſon, maye ſuffiſe, that as in one loofe of bread broken, euery piece broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is a piece of that bread, &amp; euery piece of the bread broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is in it ſelfe a whole piece of bread, for euery piece hath an hole ſubſtaunce of bread in it. So we truely ſpeake of the hooſte co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrate, to auoyde the fanſie of multiplicacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes body, which in al the hoſtes, &amp; all partes of the hooſtes is but one, not broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor diſtri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bute by pieces, &amp; yet in a ſpech to tel, &amp; ſignifie that is broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, called in name the leauing pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the body, portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the body, reſidue of the body, in which neuerthleſſe, eche one pece is chriſts hole body. So as this ſpech hauing a figure, hath it of neceſſitie, to auoyde the ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſurditie, wherby to ſignifie a multitude of bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyes, which is not ſo, &amp; the ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de of the ſpech chriſten eares do abhorre. But this I aſke, where is the mater of this auctors note, that bread is called Chriſts body? where, there is no worde of bread, in the words alleged, &amp; if there were, as ther is not, it were worthy no note at all. For that name is not abhorred, &amp; the catholique faith teacheth that the fractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is in the outwarde ſigne, &amp; not in the body of Chriſt, inuiſibly preſent, &amp; ſignified, ſo to be

preſent by that viſible ſigne? The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de note of this auctor is, touchyng reſeruyng which Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t might ſeme to denye, becauſe he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the remaine, to be receiued of the clerks, thinkyng ſo beſt: not declaryng expreſſly that nothyng might be reſerued, to the vſe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be abſet.

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dacion of it, but note to the reader the thyrde note, gathered by this auctor of Clementes woordes, whiche is, that Prieſtes ought not to receyue alone, which the wordes of the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle proue not. It ſheweth in dede what was done, &amp; howe the feaſt is in dede prepared for the people, as well as the Prieſt.

And when the people is prepared for, &amp; then come not, but fearyng and tremblyng forbere to come, that then the Prieſt might not receyue his parte alone, the wordes of this Epiſtel ſhewe not.

caſe one Prieſt might receyue alone, &amp; ſo vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a chaunce kepe the feaſt alone.

And therfore if Chriſt hath taken verely the fleſhe of our body, and the man that was borne of the virgine Marie is verely Chriſt, and alſo we verely receyue vnder a myſterie the fleſhe of his bodye, by meanes wereof we ſhalbe one, for the father is in Chriſte and Chriſte in vs: howe ſhall that be called the vnitie of will, when the naturall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie brought to paſſe by the Sacrement, is the Sacrament of perfite vnitie?</p>

For the wordes (ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce) and (truth) be of one ſtrenght, and ſhewe a difference from a figure, wherin the truth is not in dede preſent, but ſignified to be abſent.

And where this auctor coupleth together the two Sacramentes, of Baptiſme, and of the body and bloud of Chriſt, as though there were no difference in the preſence of Chriſt in either, he putteth him ſelfe in daunger, to be reproued of malice, or ignoraunce. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe myſteryes be both great, and mans regeneracion in baptiſme is alſo a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterye and the ſecrete worke of God, &amp; hath a great maruayle in that effecte: yet it diffreth from the myſterye, of the Sacrament, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng

to their iudgement and condempnation. For they iudge not truely, after the ſimplicitie of a true Chriſten fayth, of the very preſence of Chriſtes bodye. And this ſuffiſeth to wype out, that this auctor hath ſpoken of Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſene againſte the truthe.</p>
               <p>As touchyng S.

For as philip Mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> writeth <note place="margin">Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton.</note> to Oecola<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>padius, S.

Nowe to anſwer the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, (as it were at the worde chaunge), this auctor ſhall come with a ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ral change whiche is a diuiſe in termes to blind the rude reader.

               <p>It is bread before the conſecration, but after it is the body of chriſt, Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a change be more plainly declared? The nerer way for this auctor had ben to haue ioyned Ambroſe with Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; called him fained by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes, rather then after theffect of conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo opened by ſainct Ambroſe himſelfe, to trauayll to proue what it maye ſignifie, if it were in an other matter. And then to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe the reader, howe the bread and wyne haue no holines, whiche forme of ſpeach, not vnderſtanded of the people engendreth ſome ſcruple that nedeth not, being no ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of doctrine, for S.

               <p>And in an other place this auctor ſayth, <note place="margin">Fo. 85.

Which matter I declare thus to ſhewe that as this auctor diſſenteth from truth in other, ſo he diſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth from that he vttereth for truth him ſelfe, &amp; walketh in a maze, impugnynge the verye truth in this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; would haue that take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique doctrine that is not one, &amp; the ſame doctrine through his hole booke, ſo far of is it from the hole of Chriſten teachynge, But nowe let vs conſidre what ſpeaches of.

Ambroſe ſaiyng: it is bread before the conſecration, but after, it is the body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Sainct Ambroſe as this auctor ſayth in an other place ſayth thus. Before the bene di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly wordes, it is called another kynde of thyng, but after the conſecration, is ſignified the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt. And an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſpeache thus. Before the conſecration,
<pb facs="tcp:2975:69"/>
it is called an other thyng, but after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cration it is named the bloud of Chriſt, &amp; yet a third ſpeach where the word (cal) is vſed be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore and after both, as thou reader mayſt ſe in this auctors booke in the. 82 leef. Nowe good reader was thereeuer man ſo ouerſeen as this auctor is who ſeeth not. S. Ambro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe in theſe thre latter ſpeaches to ſpeake as plainly as in the firſt. For in the laſt ſpeache S. ambroſe ſaith it is called bread before the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; called the body of Chriſt after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecration. And I wolde Demaunde of this auctor, doth not this word (call) ſignifie the truth that is bread in dede before the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſecration? whiche if it be ſo why ſhall not the ſame worde (call) ſignifie alſo the very truth added to the wordes of the bodye of Chriſte after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? &amp; likewiſe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith, ſpeakyng of the bodye of Chriſte the worde (ſignified) or (named) whiche is aſmuche as (call) Thee body of Chriſt is ſignified there, for Chriſt ſayd, This is my bodye &amp;c. vſyng the outwarde ſignes of the viſible creatures to ſignifie the body &amp; bloud preſent, &amp; not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

But in theſe places of S.

                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:2975:69"/>
ſignifieth aſmuch truth in the thyng where vnto it is added after conſecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as before, and therfore as it is by ſainct Ambroſe called bread before conſecration, ſignifiyng it was ſo in dede, ſo it is called, ſignified or named (whiche thre thus plated be all one in effect) the body of Chriſt after the conſecration and is ſo in dede, agreable to the plaine ſpeache of ſainct Ambroſe, where he ſayth: It is bread before the conſecration, and it is the body of Chriſt after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecration. As touchyng the ſpiritualtie of the meat of Chriſtes bodye, I haue ſpoken before, but where this auctor addeth it requireth no corporall preſence, he ſpeaketh in his dreame beynge oppreſſed with ſlepe of ignoraunce and can not tell what (corporall) meaneth as I haue opened before by thauctorite of Cyrill. Nowe let vs ſe what this auctor ſayth to Chriſoſtome.</p>
               <p>This auctor noteth in Chriſoſtome <note place="margin">Chriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome.</note> two places, and bryngeth them forth, and in handlyng the firſt place, declareth himſelfe to trifle in ſo great a matter, euidently to his owne reproufe. For where in the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d booke of his worke, entretyng tranſubſtanciation, he would the ſame words of Chriſoſtome by this fourme of ſpeache in the negatiue ſhould not denye preciſely. And when Chriſoſtome ſayth, do not thinke that you by man receiue the body of god, but that we ſhould not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidre man in the receiuyng of it. Here this

auctor doth allege thoſe wordes and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of them as though they were termes of were deny all. But I would aſke of this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor this queſtion. If Chriſoſtomes fayth had been, that we receyue not the bodye of God in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t verely: Why ſhould he vſe wordes Idelly to entreat of whome we receiued the body of God, whiche after this auctors doctrine we receiue not at all but in figure? &amp; no body at all whiche is of Chriſtes humanitie beyng Chriſt, as this auctor tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth ſpiritually, that is, by his diuine natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re in him onely that worthely receyueth, and in the verye Sacrament as he concludeth in his booke onely figuratiuely.

And thus I retourne to myne Iſſue with this auctor, that Theophilacte himſelfe hathe no ſuche meanynge expreſſed in wordes as this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour attributeth vnto him, but an euident contrarye meanynge, ſauyng herein I will agree with this auctour, that Theophilacte mente not groſſely, ſenſibly, and carnally, as theſe wordes ſounde in carnarall mennes iudgementes. For we maye not ſo thinke of Gods myſteryes, the worke wherof is not carnall, nor corporall, for the maner of it. But the maner ſpirituall, and yet in the Sacrament of the body and bloud of Chriſt, becauſe Chriſt is in his very true fleſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, he maye be ſayde ſo carnally preſent, and naturally, after Hylary, and corporally after Cyrill, vnderſtandyng the wordes of the truthe of that is preſent, Chriſtes verye body and fleſhe, and not of the maner of the preſence, whiche is onely ſpirituall, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, and aboue mannes cappacitie. And therfore a highe myſterye, a greate myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, a wonderfull worke: whiche it is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to beleue ſimplye with a ſyncere fayth,

               <p>This auctor, trauayleth to anſwer Saint <note place="margin">Hierom.</note> Hierome, and to make him the eaſyer for him to deale with, he cutteth of that foloweth in the ſame Saincte Hierome, whiche ſhould make the matter open and manifeſt: howe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually Sainct Hierome ſpeaketh of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Chriſtes body and bloud. Ther is (ſayth Sainct Hierome) as great differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene the loues called <hi>(Panes ꝓpoſitiones)</hi> and the body of Chriſt, as there is betwene the ſhadowe of a body, and the body it ſelfe, and as there is betwene an image and the true thyng it ſelfe, and betwene an example of thynges to come, and the thynges that be prefigured by them. Therfore as mekenes, pacience, ſobrietie, moderation, abſtinence of gayne, hoſpitalitie alſo, and liberalite ſhould be chiefly in a Byſhop, and among all laye men an excellencie in them: ſo their ſhould be in him a ſpecial chaſtite, and as I ſhould ſay, chaſtitie that is prieſtly, that he ſhoulde not onely abſteyne from an vncleane worke, but alſo from the caſte of his eye, and his mynde fre from error of thought, that ſhould make the body of Chriſt. Theſe be Sainct Hiero<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s words in this place. By the latter part wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, appeareth playnely how Sainct Hierom
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2975:74"/>
meaneth of Chriſtes body in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, of whiche the loues that were <hi>(Panes propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiones)</hi> were a ſhadow, (as Sainct Hierom ſayth) that bread beyng the image, and this the trueth, that the example, and this that was prefigured. So as if Chriſtes body in the Sacrament ſhould be there but figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely (as this auctor teacheth) then were the bread of propoſition, figure of a figure, and ſhadowe of a ſhadowe, whiche is ouer great an abſurdite in our religion. Therfore there cannot be a more playne proufe to ſhewe, that (by Saincte Hieroms mynde,) Chriſtes body is verely in the Sacrament, &amp; not figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiuely onely, then when he noteth, <hi>(Panes propoſitiones)</hi> to be the figure &amp; the ſhadowe of chriſtes body in the Sacrament. For as, Tertullia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſayth, <hi>(Figura non eſſet, niſi verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi>

For wemuſt conſidre the ſubſtance of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, of Chriſtes body and bloud to be always as of it ſelfe it is by Chriſtes ordinaunce, in the vnderſtandyng whereof, this auctor maketh variau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and wold haue it by Chriſtes ordinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce but a figure / which he hath not proued (but and he had prowed it) then is it in ſubſtaunce but a figure, and but a figure to good men. For it muſt be in ſubſtaunce one to good and bad: and ſo ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to good nor bad this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſpenſed then it is truely taught to be by preachyng. Wherfore if it be more then a figure, as it is in deade, &amp; if by Chriſtes ordy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2975:80"/>
it hath preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnder the forme of thoſe viſible ſygnes of the fourme of bread and wyne, the very body and bloud of Chriſt as hath been truly taught hitherto. Then is the ſubſtaunce of the Sacrament one always as the oyntement, was whether doues eate of it or betels. And this Iſſue, I ioyne with this <note place="margin">An iſſue.</note> auctor, that he ſhall not be able by any lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng to make any diuerſite in the ſubſtaunce of this ſacrament, what ſoeuer diuerſite fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe in theffect. For the diuerſite of theffect, is occaſioned in them that receyue as before is proued. And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to anuſwere this auctor, I ſay that onely good men eate and drinke the body and bloud of Chriſt ſpiritually, as I haue declared, but al good &amp; euel receiue the viſible Sacrament of that ſubſtaunce: God hath ordeyned it, whiche in it hathe no vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but is all one to good and euel. And as for the Scriptures and doctours which this auctor allegeth to proue that onely good men receyne the body and bloud of Chriſt, I grant it without contention ſpeakyng of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tituall manducation and with lyuely faythe without the Sacrament. But in the viſible Sacrament euell men receyue the ſame that good men do, for the ſubſtance of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment is by good ordinance all one. And if this auctor would vſe for a proufe that in the Sacrament Chriſtes verye bodye is not preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t becauſe euel me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> receiue it, that ſhalbe no argument, for the good ſeed when it was
<pb facs="tcp:2975:81"/>
ſowen did fall in the euell grounde, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought chriſt dwelleth not in the euel man, yet he maye be receyued of the euell man to his condempnation, becauſe he receyue him not to glorifie him as of God, as S. Paule ſayth <hi>(Non dijudicans corpus domini),</hi> not eſtemyng our Lordes bodye, And to all that euer this auctor bryngeth to proue that euel men eare not the body of chriſt, (may be ſaid wortely) that ſpiritually they eate it, not beſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t they eate it, not effectually to lyfe, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And that is, &amp; may be called a not eating, As they be ſaid not to heare the worde of God, that heare it not proufitably. And becauſe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt of it ſelfe is ordeyned to be eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for lyfe, thoſe that vnworthely eate condem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, although they eate in dede, maye be ſaid not eate, becauſe they eate vnworthely as a thyng not well done, may be in ſpeache called not done in reſpecte of the good effect. Wherfore it was chefly ordred to be done. And by this rule, thou reader maſt diſcuſſe al that this auctor bryngeth forth for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, eyther out of Scriptures or doctours. For euell men eate not the bodye of Chriſte, to haue any frute by it, as euell men be ſaid not to heare goddes worde to haue any frute by it, and yet as they here the worde of ſpirite and lyfe and neuer theles periſhe: ſo euel men eate in the viſible Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>As for ſainct Auguſtine whiche this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <note place="margin">Auguſti.</note> allegeth <hi>(De ciuitate dei),</hi> the ſame S.

As for ſainct Auguſtin ſhalbe herafter more playnely declared. Finally, he that receyueth worthely the body and bloud of Chriſt hath euerlaſting life, dwelleth in Chriſt, &amp; Chriſt in him, he that receyueth vnworthely, which can be onelye in the Sacrament receyueth not life, but condempnation. But to encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tre directly with this auctor, where he oppoſith by interrogation, and would be anuſwered, whither an vnrepentant ſynner that recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the Sacrme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, hath Chriſtes body with in him or no. Marke reader this queſtion whiche declareth that auctor talkyth of the Sacrament, not as himſelfe teacheth, but as the true teaching is, although he mean other wiſe, for els howe could an vnrepe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſynner receyue Chriſt, but onely in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthely? &amp; howe could he receyue him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthely &amp; he were not there? but to anuſwe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re to the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I anſwere no: for it foloueth not, he receyued him, <hi>(Ergo)</hi> he hathe him in him, for the veſſel being not mete, he departed
<pb facs="tcp:2975:82"/>
from him, becauſe he was a ſynner, in whom he dwelleth not. And where this auctor now become a queſtioniſte, maketh two queſtions of Chriſtes bodye, and his ſpirite, as tough Chriſtes body might be deuided from his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rite, he ſuppoſeth other to be as ignorant as himſelfe. For the lerned man will anſwere that the euel man by force of gods ordinance in the ſubſtance of the Sacrament receyued in deade Chriſtes very body there preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, hol Chriſt, god and man, but he taryed not, nor Dwelled not, nor fructified not in him, nor Chriſtes ſpirite entred not into that mannes ſowle, becauſe of the malice and vnworthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of him that receyued. For Chriſt wil not dwell with Belial nor abide with ſynners. <note place="margin">2. Cor. 6.</note> And what hath this auctor wonne nowe by his forked queſtion? wherin he ſemethe to glorie as though he had embraced an abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite that he hunted for, wherin he ſheweth onely his ignoraunce, who putteth no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence bytwen thentryag of Chriſte into an euell man by goddes ordynance in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and the dwellyng of Chriſtes ſpirite in an euel man, whiche by Scripture can not be, ne is by any Catholique man affirmed. For ſainct Paule ſaythe. In him that recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uethe vnworthely remaynethe iudgement, and condempnation. And yet Sainct Pauls wordes playnelye importe that thoſe did eate the verye bodye of Chriſte, whiche did eate vnworthely, and therfore were gyltie
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2975:82"/>
of the body and bloud of Chriſt. Now reader <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11</note> conſider what is before wryten, and thou ſhalt eaſelie ſee what a fonde cuncluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this auctor gathereth, in the. 97. leafe, as though the teachyng were that the ſame ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhould be both the temple of God and the temple of the dewel, with other termes wherwith it li<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth this auctour to refreſhe himſelfe and fayneth an aduerſarye, ſuche as he woulde haue, but hath none. For no Catholique man teacheth ſo, nor it is not all one to receyue Chriſt and to haue Chriſt dwellyng in him. And a figure therof was in Chriſtes conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation vpon earthe, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taryed not with all that receyued him in outward apparance. And there is noted a difference that ſumme beleued in Chriſt, and yet Chriſt committed <note place="margin">Ioh. 3.</note> not himſelfe to them. And the Goſpell pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them that heare the worde of God and <note place="margin">Luce. 11.</note> kepe it, ſignifiyng many to here the worde of God and not to kepe it, as they that receyue Chriſt by his ordinaunce in the Sacrament, and yet becauſe thei receyue him not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to thentent of his ordinance worthely, they are ſo much the worſe therby, through ther owne malyce. And therfore to conclude this place with thauctor who ſoeuer eateth Chriſtes fleſhe and drynketh his bloud hathe euerlaſtynge life with Saincte Paulles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, if he dothe it worthely, or elles by the ſame Saincte Paule he hathe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnacion. <note place="margin">1.

In the .xcvij. leafe and the ſeconde colu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, thauctor begynneth to trauerſe the wordes of Sainct Paul to the Corinthians, &amp; would diſtincte vnworthy eatyng in the ſubſtaunce of the Sacrament receyued, whiche cannot be. For oure vnworthynes cannot altare the ſubſtance of gods Sacramente, that is euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more all one, howeſoeuer we ſwarue frome worthines to vnworthines. And this I wold aſke of this auctor, why ſhoulde it be a faulte in the vnworthye, not to eſteme the Lordes body, when he is taught, if this auctors do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be true, that it is not there at al? If this bread after this auctors teachyng be but a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Chriſtes body it is then but as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>na</hi> was, the eatynge wherof, vnworthely, and vnfaythfully was no gilte of Chriſtes body. Eraſmus noteth theſe wordes of Saincte <note place="margin">Eraſmꝰ</note> Paul, to be gilty of our Lords body, to proue the prefence of Chriſtes body there, who com pareth ſuche an offender to the iewes that did ſhedde Chriſtes bloud maliciouſlye, as thoſe do prophane it vnprofitably, in which ſence the greke commentaryes do alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde it. And where this auctor bryngeth in the wordes of Saincte Paule, as it were to poynte out the mattiere.

And therfore as good men ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng Chriſt, haue ſaluation, ſo euell men ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng Chriſt, haue condempnation, and ſo for the diuerſitie of the eaters of Chriſtes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, foloweth as they be worthye and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, the effecte of condempnacion or lyfe, Chriſtes Sacrament and his worke alſo in the ſubſtance, of that Sacrament beyng al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes one, and what ſo euer this auctor tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth otherwiſe in this matter is mere trifles. And yet he goth about (becauſe he will make all thynge clere,) to anſwer ſuche authours as the Papiſtes he ſayth brynge for there <note place="margin">Auguſti.</note> purpoſe. And firſt he begynneth with ſainct Auguſtine who wryteth as playuelye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this auctours mynde, as I would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue diuiſed it, if I had no conſcience of truth more then I ſee ſum haue, and might with a ſecrete wiſhe haue altred S.

For the ſpirituall vnderſtandynge that ſainct Auguſtine ſpeaketh of, is not to exclude the truthe of goddes worke in the Sacrament, but to extlude carnall imagination, from muſyng of the maner of the worke, whiche is in myſterye ſuche as a carnall man can not comprehende. In whiche matter yf ſainct Auguſtine had had ſuche a faythe of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as this auctor ſayth himſelfe hath nowe of late, and calleth it Catholique ſainct Auguſtine would haue vttered it as an expoſitor playnely in this place and ſaid ther is but a figure of Chriſts body, Chriſtes bodye and fleſhe is in heuen, and not in this viſible Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, Chriſtes ſpeache that was eſtemed ſo hard, was but a figuratiue ſpeach and where Chriſt ſaid (This is my bodye) he ment onely of the figure of his body, whiche maner of ſaynges ſainct Auguſtine vſeth not in this place, and yet he coulde ſpeake playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſo doth he declarynge vs firſte the truthe of the fleſhe, that Chriſt geueth to be eaten, that is to ſaye the ſame fleſhe that he tooke of the virgen. And yet becauſe chriſt
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2975:89"/>
geneth it not in a viſible maner nor ſuche a maner as the Capharnaites thought on, nor ſuche a maner as any carnall man can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue, beynge alſo the fleſhe geuen in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not a common fleſhe but a lyuely, godly, and ſpirituall fleſhe.</p>
               <p>Therfore ſainct Auguſtine vſeth wordes and ſpeache, wherby he denieth the gift of that bodye of Chriſt, whiche we did ſee, and of the bloude that was ſhed: ſo as by affirmation and deniall ſo nere together of the ſame to be geuen and the ſame not to be geuen: the myſterye ſhoulde be thus far opened, that for the truthe of the thynge geuen it is the ſame, and touchynge the maner of the geuynge and the qualitie of the fleſhe geuen, it is not the ſame. And becauſe it is the ſame, Sainct Anguſtine ſayeth before we muſte worſhippe it, and yet becauſe it is nowe an hidden godly my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterye, we maye not haue carnall Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the ſame, but godly, ſpiritually, and inuiſibly vnderſtande it.

ſpiritually &amp; godly of whiche him ſelfe ſaid, my fleſhe is verely meat and my bloud is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely drynke, and onleſſe ye eat my fleſhe and drinke my bloud ye ſhal not haue euerlaſting life. Or the fleſhe whiche was crucified and bloud whiche was ſhed with the ſpere, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng to this diuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the diuerſite of fleſhe and bloud, is taken in Chriſtes ſainctes that there is one fleſhe, that ſhall ſee the ſalnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, an other fleſhe and bloud that can not poſſeſſe the kyngdome of heauen.</p>
               <p>Theſe be S. Iheromes wordes. In which thowe ſeeſt reader a denyall of that fleſhe of Chriſt to be geuen to be eaten that was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, but the fleſhe geuen to be eaten to be a godly and ſpirituall fleſhe, and a diſtinction made betwene them as is in oure fleſhe, of whiche it may be ſayde that the fleſhe we walke in here, ſhall not ſee God, that is to ſay, as it is corruptible accordyng to the text of S. Paul, fleſhe and bloud ſhal not poſſeſſe heauen and yet not withſtanding we muſte beleue and hope with Iob truely, that the ſame oure fleſhe ſhal ſee god in heauen, after whiche diuiſion, likewiſe we receyue not in the Sacrament Chriſtes fleſhe that was cru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cified, beyng ſo a viſible and mortall fleſhe, but Chriſtes fleſhe glorified incorruptible &amp; impaſſible a godly and ſpirituall fleſhe, And ſo that is but one in ſubſtaunce and alwayes ſo: the ſame one is neuertheleſſe for thaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the maner of the beyng of it diuided &amp;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2975:90"/>
ſo called not the ſame, wherin ſainct Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me and ſaincte Auguſtine, vſed both one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeakinge and ſainct Hierome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blinge the diuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he reherſith of chriſtes fleſh, to the diuiſion of oure fleſh in the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, dothe more plainely open, howe the ſame maye be called not the ſame, becauſe we beleue certainlye the reſurrection of the ſame fleſh we walke in, and yet it ſhall be by the garment of incorruptibilite not the ſame in qualite, and ſo be verified the ſcriptures that fleſh ſhall not poſſeſſ heauen and I ſhall ſee god in my fleſh. And here I will note to the reader by the waye ſainct Hierome wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth this diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſts fleſh, as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aggreed on, and then in catholique doctri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne receyued, not of his inuention, but in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique faythe, as aprincipal eſtabliſhed, whiche declareth the belef, to haue ben of that very godly, and ſpirituall fleſhe, geuen really in the Sacrament. For ells to eate onely in fayth is ſpiritually to remembre Chriſt fleſh, as it was viſiblie crucified, wherin was acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed thoblacon for oure ſinnes, and ſainct Poule willeth vs in the ſupper, to ſhew for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th, and to profeſſe the death of Chriſt, for ſo Chriſt wolde haue his death continually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, till his cumminge. And if ſainct Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome with other ſhoulde haue ment of the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge of Chriſt as he ſitteth in heauen reignin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge, this diſtinction of Chriſtes fleſh, were an idle mattier, and oute of purpoſe, to compare

the diſtinction in it, to be like the dinſtinction of our fleſh to entre into heauen, and not to entre in to heauen, the ſame and not the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.

Like as a man ſtanding in one place cannot touche the ſame one water twiſe in a runnynge ſtreame, no more can a man be touched the ſame man twiſe but he altreth as ſwiftely as doth the ſtreame. Theſe were laughed to ſkorne, yet they thought themſelfe wiſe in naturall ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation. Ariſtotel (that is muche eſtemed and worthely) fanſyed a firſt matter, in all things to be one, in whiche conſideracion he ſemeth to be as extreme in a ſtaye, as the other fonde Philoſophers were in mouynge. By whiche two extremites I condempne not naturall ſpeculation, wherwith I thinke God plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for man to meruayle in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>placion of his inferiour workes, and to tame his raſhe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the inexplicable, variete of it, but to vſe it ſo, as to make it an open aduerſary to relli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it is me ſemeth without all purpoſe. The doctrine of tranſubſtantiacion doth not teache no earthly thynge to remayne in the Sacrament, but contrary wiſe that the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble forme of bread and wyne is there as the viſible ſygne of the Sacramente, and to be the ſame in greatnes, in thicknes, in waight, in ſauor, &amp; taſte, in propriete alſo to corrupte, putrifie, and nurriſh as it did before, and yet the ſubſtaunce of thoſe viſible creatures, to be conuerted into the ſubſtance (as Emiſſene ſayth) of the bodye of Chriſt. And here will reaſon do ſeruice to fayth to ſaye if there be
<pb facs="tcp:2975:101"/>
a conuerſion in deade as faith teacheth, and none of the accidentes be conuerted, then the ſubſtaunce is conuerted, for in euery thynge all is ſubſtaunce and accidentes, but the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes be not chaunhed, and yet a chaunge there is, it muſte nedes be then that ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce is chaunged.

And yet in this Emiſſins authorite afteral the payne taken to reforge him. Emiſſens doctrine play nely confoundeth this authours teachynge. This author maketh a note that there is in man baptized, nothynge chaunged outwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely, and therfore in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t neyther, and it muſt be graunted. For the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation teacheth not in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament any outwarde chaunge. For the ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtance of the bread and wyne is an inwarde nature, and ſo is ſubſtance of one defined. And to ſpeake of the thyng changed, then as in man the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge is in the ſoule, which is the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of man: So for the thyng cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged in the viſible creatures ſhould be alſo changed, and is chaunged, the ſubſtance of the bread and wyne to anſwere theirin to the other. And we muſt conſidre howe this compariſon of the two chaunges is made as it were by proportion. Wherin eche chaunge hath his ſpecial ende and terme, (whervnto): and ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore accordynge to terme and ende, hath his worke of chaunge, ſpeciall and ſeuerall both by gods worke.

The ſoule of man hath his ende and terme a ſpirituall alteration, incorporall, to be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate the ſonne of God. And then the doctri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne of this Emiſſene is playne this, that eche change is of like truth, and then it foloweth that if the change of mannes ſoule in Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me be true and not in a figure: The chaunge likewiſe in the Sacrament is alſo true and not in a figure. And if manues ſoule be the chunge in Baptiſme be in deade that is to ſaye, really made the ſonne of God: then is the ſubſtance of the bread, whiche is as it were the ſoule of the bread.

And therfore I noted before, howe ſaincte Thomas did towche Chriſt, after his reſurrection truely, and yet it was by myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, as ſaincte Grigorie writeth. And further we may ſaye towching the compariſon that when a reſemblaunce is made, of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment to Chriſtes perſon, or contrarywiſe of Chriſtes perſon to declare the Sacrament, we may not preſſe all partes of the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, with a through equalitie in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racion of eche parte by it ſelfe, but onely haue reſpecte to thende, wherfore the reſemblaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce is made.

This is the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of vigilius, By whiche appereth howe theſe heriſies were both ſubtely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed, without ſo playne contradiction as this auctor either by ignoraunce or of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe fayneth, aſhthowh the neſtoria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould ſaye, Chriſt was a perfit man, but not God, and the Eutichian clene contrary very God, but not man. For if the heriſies had bene ſuche, vigilius had had no cauſe to ſpeake of any ſuche ambiguitie as he notith that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhoulde hardely ſpeake againſte the one, but he might be ſuſpected to fauour the other. And yet I graunte that the Neſtorians ſayinges might implie chriſt not to be God, becauſe they wolde two diſtincte different natures to make alſo two diſtincte perſons, and ſo as it were two Chriſtes, the one onely man, and the other onely God, ſo as by there teachinge God was neither incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, nor as Gregorie Nazianzene ſaith ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deitate, for ſo he is termed to ſaye. The Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichians as Sainct Auguſtine ſaith reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge againſt the Neſtoriaus, becam heriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques themſelfe, and becauſe we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe truly by faith but one Chriſt the ſonne of God very God, The Eutichians ſaye, although there were in the virgins wombe before tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunation two natures, yet after thaduna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2975:120"/>
in that myſtery of Chriſtes incarnacion there is but one nature, and that to be the nature of God, into which the nature of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was after there fanſye tranſfuſed &amp; ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, whervppon by implication a man might gather the nature of the humanitie not to remayne in Chriſt after the adunation in the virgines wombe. Gelaſius deteſtinge both Eutiches and Neſtorius in his proceſſe vtterith a catholique meaninge againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both, but he directith ſpeciall argumentes of the two natures in man, and of the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the ſacrament, chefely againſte the Eutichians to proue the nature of man to continue in Chriſt after the adunatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being no abſurditie for two different natures to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>And hereof I writte thuſmuche, becauſe it ſhoulde appeare that Gelaſius by his argumentes of the ſacrament, and of the two natures in man wente not aboute to proue that the godhed remayned in Chriſt after his incarnacion, as thauctour of this booke wolde haue it, for the Neſtorian ſayde the godhed was an acceſſion to Chriſt afterward by merite, and therfore with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there was no talke of remaynynge, when they eſtemed Chriſtes nature in his conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption ſinguler, and onely by goddes power conceyued, but onely man. And again theuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiane ſo affirmed the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuaunce of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature in Chriſt after the adunation, as Gelaſius had no cauſe to proue that was graunted, that is to ſaye, the remayne of the diuine nature, but one the other ſide to proue the remayne of the humaine nature in chriſt, whiche by the Eutichians, was by implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion rather denyed. Neſtorius deuided God and man, and graunted alwayes bothe to be in Chriſt continually, but as two perſons, and the perſon of Chriſt beynge God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge within the perſon of Chriſte beynge man, and as Chriſt man encreaſed, ſo Chriſt

God dignified him and ſo diuided one Chriſt in twoperſons, becauſe of the two natures ſo different, whiche was againſte the rules of oure faith and diſtroyed thereby the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of oure redemption. And the Euti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians affirmynge catholiquely to be but one perſon in Chriſte, did perniciouſly ſaye ther was therfore but one nature in Chriſt, accomptynge by implication the humaine nature tranſfuſed in to the diuine nature and ſo confounded.

And either parte abuſed many ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and had notable apparaunces for that they ſayde, ſo as he that were not well exerciſed in ſcriptures, and the rules of oure faith might be eaſely circumuented.

But Neſtorius as appeareth althowgh he vſed it ilfauerdly had muche learnynge and cloked his heriſie craftely, denying the groſſe matter that they imputed to him to teache two Chriſtes, and other ſpecialities layde to his charge, and yet condempnynge the doctrine of Cyrill, &amp; profeſſyng his owne faith in his owne ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, coulde not hide his heriſie ſo, but it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth to be and conteyne in effecte that he was charged with, and therfore an admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment was geuen by a catholique wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Beleue not Neſtorius thowgh he ſaye
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:2975:122"/>
he teache but one Chriſt. If one ſhould here aſke what is this to the purpoſe to talke ſo muche of theſe ſectes, I Anſwer, this knowledge ſhall generallye ſerue, to note the maner of them that goo a boute to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue the worlde with falſe doctrine, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiche is good to learne: An other ſpeciall ſeruice, is to declare howe the auctour of this booke, eyther doth not knowe the ſtate of the matter in theſe heriſes he ſpeaketh of, or elles miſreporteth them of purpoſe. And the arguynge of Gelaſius in this matter wel opened, ſhall geue light of the truth of the myſterie of the Sacrament. Who againſt the Eutichians vſeth two argumentes of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, one of the two different natures to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne in one perſon of man, and yet, the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichians diffamed that coniunction, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning of two different natures, and called it <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> one nature reſerue not one Chriſt and hole Chriſt. And if two differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t natures, that is to ſaye ſoule and body make but one man, why not ſo in Chriſt? For where ſcripture ſpeaketh of the outwarde man and inwarde man, that is to ſhewe (Gelaſius ſaith) two diuerſe qualities in the ſame man, and not to deuide the ſame man into two men, and ſo inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth to ſhewe there owght to be no ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to graunte two differente natures to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne in there propriete, for feare that euery
<pb facs="tcp:2975:123"/>
diuerſe nature ſhould make a diuerſe perſon, and ſo in Chriſt deuide the vnitie, concluding that the integritie of Chriſte cannot be but both the natures different remayning in ther propertie. Carual imagination troubled the Eutichians, to haue one perſon of two ſuche differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t natures remayning in ther properte, which the Neſtorians releued with deuiſe of two perſons, and the Eutichians by confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the humaine nature. Then cummeth Gelaſius, to the argument of example from the Sacrament of the bodye and bloude of Chriſt, and noteth the perſon of Chriſt to be a principall myſterye, and the Sacrament an image and ſimilitude of that myſterye, which ſence his wordes muſte nedes haue, becauſe he calleth Chriſte the principall myſterye, and as in one place he ſayth the image and ſimilitude of the bodye and bloud of Chriſte, ſo by and by he calleth the Sacramente the image of Chriſte. And here, the wordes ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge and ſimilitude, expreſſe the maner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the truth of the thinges repreſented, to be, vnderſtanded onely by faith, as inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly preſent. And Saincte Ambroſe by this worde mage, ſignifieth thexhibition of truth to man in this life. And to ſhewe the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be ſuche an image, as conteyneth the verye truthe of the thinge, whereof it is the image. Gelaſius declareth in framynge his argumente in theſe wordes. As breade and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:2975:123"/>
wyne go into the diuine ſubſtaunce the holy gooſte bringyng it to paſſe, and yet remayne in the proprietie of there nature, ſo that prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cipall myſterye, thoſe natures remayninge, whereof it is declared vnto vs true and hole Chriſt to continue. In theſe wordes of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſius where he ſaith the breade and wyne go into the diuine ſubſtaunce, is playnely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the preſence of the diuine ſubſtaunce, and this diuine ſubſtaunce, can ſignifie none other ſubſtaunce, but of the body and bloude of Chriſte, of whiche heauenly nature, and earthely nature of the breade and wyne, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth this Sacrament the image of the prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cipall myſterye of Chriſtes perſon. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as in the image be two diuers natures and different remayninge in there proprietie. So likewiſe in the perſon of Chriſt, whiche is the concluſion of Gelaſius argumente, ſhould remayne two natures. And here were a greate daunger, if we ſhoulde ſaye that Chriſtes body, whiche is the celeſtiall nature in the Sacramente, were there preſent but in a figure, for it ſhoulde then implye, that in Chriſtes perſonne the principall myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, it were alſo but in a figure. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as in the myſterye of Chriſtes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonne, ordened to redeme vs, beynge the principal miſtery there is no figure, but truth in conſideracion of the preſens of the two na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures, wherof Chriſt is: So in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t beyng a miſterye ordred to feade vs, &amp; the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb facs="tcp:2975:124"/>
of that principal miſtery, ther is not an onely figure, but truth of the preſens of the natures earthely &amp; celeſtiall. I ſpeake of the truth of preſence, and meane ſuche an integri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie of the natures preſent, as by the rules of our faith, is conſonante and agreable to that miſtery, that is to ſay, in the perſon of Chriſt perfit God &amp; perfit ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, perfite God to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, &amp; perfit man to be deitate, as Grego<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry Nazianzene termeth it. In the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the viſible matter of the earthely creature in his proprietie of nature, for the vſe of ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is neceſſariely required, &amp; alſo according to the truth of Chriſt his wordes, his very bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy, &amp; bloud, to be inuiſibly with integrite pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent, which Gelaſius calleth the diuine ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce. And I thinke it worthy to be noted, that Gelaſius ſpeking of the bread &amp; wyne, reciteth not preciſely the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to remaine, but ſaith the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or nature, which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re he calleth after proprietie, &amp; the diſiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctiue may be verified in the laſt, &amp; it is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, thexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples to be in al partes equal, as ruſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cus diacom<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

In the myſterye of Chriſtes perſon, becauſe there was not of any of the two different na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures eythex mutation, tranſition, conuerſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or trauſelementation, but onely aſſumption of the humanitie, and adunation in the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyns wombe, we cannot ſay the godhed, to haue ſuffred in that myſterye, which were an abſurditie, but to haue wrought the aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and adunation of mans nature with it, nor mans nature by that aſſumption, and adunation diminiſhed, and therfore profeſſe truly Chriſt to be hole God and whole man, and God in that myſterye, to be made man, and man God, where as in the Sacrament, becauſe of tranſition, mutation, and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of there earthely creatures, wrought by the holy gooſt, which declareth thoſe earthly creatures to ſuffer in this conuerſion, muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and tranſition, we knowledge no aſſum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ption of thoſe creatures, or adunation with the heauthly nature, and therfore, ſaye not, as we do, in the principal myſterye, that eche nature is holly the other, and as we profeſſe God incarnate, ſo the bodye of Chriſte brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and as man is deitate, ſo the bread is cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>porate: whiche we ſhould ſay, if the rules of our fayth could permitte, the conſtitution of eche myſterye to be taught a lyke, which the truth of gods morde doth not ſuffre. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although Gelaſius, and other argue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Sacrament, to declare the myſterye of Chriſtes perſon, yet we maye not preſſe the

For Chriſt is one perſonne of two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitte natures, whereof the one was before the other in perfection &amp; creator of the other, the one impaſſible, &amp; the other paſſible. Man is of the ſoule and bodye one, two different natures, but ſuche as for there perfection re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyred that vnitie, whereof none was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore other perfit, of Chriſt we ſaye, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiall to his father, by the ſubſtaunce
<pb facs="tcp:2975:126"/>
of his godhed, and conſubſtantiall to man, by the ſubſtance of his manhod, but we may not ſo ſay, man is conſubſtantial by his ſoule to angels, and conſubſtantiall in his body to beſtes, becauſe then we ſhould deduce alſo Chriſt by meane of vs to be conſubſtantial to beaſtes, &amp; thus I writ to ſhewe that we may not preſſe thexample in euery parte of it, as thauctor of this booke vpon Gelatius, who ouerturneth his doctrine of the figure. And if that I haue Here ſayde, be well conſidered, there maye appeare the greate ignoraunci of this author in the alleginge of Theodorete, the applinge of him, and ſpeakynge of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorius in the ende. For as the Eutichians reaſonynge (as Saincte Auguſtine ſaith) to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fonude the Neſtoria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, fel in to an abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the two natures in chriſt: ſo Theodoretus reaſonyng againſt the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, fel in a veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſuſpicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be a neſto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, like as S. Auguſtine reaſonyng againſt the maniches for defence of fre will ſemed to ſpeke that the Pellagia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s would alowe, and reaſoning againſt Pelagians, ſemed to ſay that the manachees woulde allowe, ſuch a daunger it is to reduce extremities to the meane, wherin Saincte Auguſtine was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter purged then Theodorete was, althowgh Theodorete was reconciled. But for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that I haue ſayde, this argumente of Theodoretus againſte the Eutichians to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde

confuſion of natures in Chriſte, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth howe in the ſacreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (where the truth of the myſterye of the two natures in Chriſt may be as it were in a ſimilitude lerned). the preſence of the bodye of Chriſte there in the Sacrament, doth not altre nature, that is to ſaye, the proprietie of the viſible creatures. This ſayinge was that the Neſtoryans woulde drawe for there purpoſe to proue diſtincre perſons, againſte whome, Cyril tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uayled to ſhewe that in the Sacrament the fleſhe of Chriſt that was geuen to be eaten, was geuen not as the fleſhe of a comen man, but as the fleſhe of Godde, wherby appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the vnitie of the godhed to the manhode in Chriſte in one perſon, and yet no confuſion as Theodoretus doth by his argument De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. But whither the prynters negligence, or this auctours ouerſight, hath confunded, or confuſed this matter in the vtterynge of it, I can not tell, For the auctour of this booke concludeth ſolemly thus by induction of the premiſſes, that euen ſo the bodye of Chriſte was after thaſcenſion Chaunged in to the godly ſubſtaunce. I wene the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter left out a (not) and ſhoulde haue ſayde not chaunged, in the Godlye Subſtaunce, for ſo the ſence ſhoulde be as Peter Martyr reaporteth Theodorete. And yet the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe this auctore makethe againſte them, he calleth for his pleaſure Papiſtes, with
<pb facs="tcp:2975:127"/>

               <p>This auctoure of the booke for the name of Neſtorius, ſhoulde haue put Entiches, and then ſayde for concluſion, the nature of manhode remayned not in Chriſte.

For and no propertye of breade remayne, it proueth not the

And from this poynte of the matter, the auctour of this booke, maketh a paſſage with a litell ſporte at the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he fanſieth or liketh to cal ſo Engliſhe Papiſtes by the waye, entrepriſe to anſwere all ſuche as he ſuppoſeth reaſons for tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtanciation and auctorites alſo.</p>

as he calleth them the Papiſtes, to ſaye that Chriſte is made a newe, whiche, fanſye if it were ſo, is againſte the reall prefence aſwell as tranſubſtantiacion. In whiche wordes becauſe euery wiſe reader may eſe howe this auctor playeth: I will ſaye no more but this, Chriſte is not made a newe, nor made of the ſubſtaunce of bread as of a matter, and that to be the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que doctrine, this auctor if he be right named knoweth welynough, and yet ſpendeth two leanes in it.</p>

The ſubſtance of bread is not adnihilate becauſe goddes worke is no adnihilation, who ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth all beynge, and adnihilacion is a defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the creature from God, and yet Chriſtes bodye is not augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of bread, in which body it endeth by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Chryſoſtome as I ſayde before ſpeakynge to the Chriſten man, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to aſke whither he vſeth his fayth or no, For if he ſeeth breade, he ſeeth not with faith, whiche ſeeth the bodye of Chriſt there preſence, and ſo no breade. If the Chriſten man thinke of paſſage throughe him of the celeſtiall fode, he hathe therein no ſpirituall thoughte, ſuche as fayth engendreth, and therfore ſayth Chryſoſtome <hi>(abſit)</hi> here in theſe wordes of Chriſoſtome is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall with compariſon, and therfore this auctour mighte haue ſpared his treatiſe in theſe thre leaues, For in thoſe wordes, when

Chriſoſtome ſaith, Thinke not thou recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt the bodye of Chriſte by a man. &amp;c. There this auctour ſo neglecteth his / owne rule, as in his thirde booke he maketh a ſolemne ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that by thoſe Chriſoſtomes wordes we receyue not the bodye of Chriſt at all, ſeyng Chriſoſtome ſayth, we may not thinke we receyue it by man. So lytell ſubſtancial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is this matter handled, as a man might ſaye here were many accidentall wordes withoute a ſubſtaunce, or myracle, howe ſtrange ſo euer the ſame ſeme to this auctor otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Nowe let vs here what this auctor will ſaye to Saincte Ambroſe. He reherſeth him at good lenght, but tranſlateth him for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage. As among other in one place where Saincte Ambroſe ſayth. This Sacramente whiche thou receyueſt, is made by the worde of Chriſt, this auctor tranſlateth, is done by the worde of Chriſt, becauſe makynge muſte be vnderſtanded in the ſubſtaunce of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament chiefly before it is receyued, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge maye be referred to the effecte chieflye, for whiche purpoſe, it ſhoulde ſeme thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of this booke cannot awaye with the worde made, where at it pleaſeth him in an other place of this booke to be merye, as at an abſurditie in the Papiſtes, when in dede both Saincte Ambroſe here, Saincte Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:2975:132"/>
and Sainct Hierome alſo in there pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vſe the ſame worde ſpeakynge of this Sacrament, and of the wonderfull worke of God in ordenyng the ſubſtance of it, by ſuch a conuerſion as breade is made the bodye of Chriſte. But as touchynge thanſwere of this auctor to Sainct Ambroſe, it is diuerſe. For firſt he doth trauerſe thauctoritie of the booke, whiche allegation hath been by other here to fore made, and anſwered vnto in ſuch wiſe, as the booke remayneth Saincte Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſes ſtill, and Mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cton ſaith it ſemeth not to him vnlike his, and therfore allegeth this verye place out of him againſt Oecolampa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius. This auctor will not ſticke in that alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation: but for anſwere ſayth that Saincte Ambroſe ſaith not that the ſubſtaunce of the breade, and wyne is gone, and that is true, he ſayth not ſo in ſyllables, but he ſayth ſo in ſence: becauſe he ſpeaketh of a chaunge ſo playnelye in the breade into that it was not, wherunto this auctor for declaration of change ſayth, the breade and wyne be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into an higher aſtate, nature, and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whiche thre wordes, of aſtate, nature, and condition, be good wordes, to expreſſe the chaunge of the breade into the bodye of Chriſte, whiche bodye is of an other nature, an other ſtate, and condition, then the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce of the breade without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gher.
<pb facs="tcp:2975:133"/>
But then this auctor addeth, (to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as holye meates, and drinkes) wherein if he meaneth to be taken ſo, but not to be ſo, as his teachynge in other places of this boke is, the breade to be neuer the holyer, But to ſignifie an holy thynge: then is the chaunge nothynge in dede touchynge nature, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye as a cowarde maye be channged in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell to playe Hercules, or Sampſons parte in a playe, himſelfe therby made neuer the hardyer man at all, but onelye appoynted to ſignifie an hardye man, of whiche mannes chaunge, althoughe his aſtate, and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might in ſpeache be called chaunged for the tyme of the playe, yet no man woulde terme it thus to ſaye, his nature were chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, whither he mente by the worde natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the ſubſtaunce of the mannes nature, or propertie, for in theſe two poyntes he were ſtill the ſame man in Hercules coote, that he was before the playe in his owne, ſo as if there be nothynge, but a figure in the bread, then for ſo much this auctors other teaching in this booke where he ſayth, the breade is neuer the holyer, is a doctrine better then this, to teache a chaunge of the breade to an higher nature, when it is onelye appoynted to ſignifie an holye thynge? And therfore this auctours anſwere garniſhed with theſe there gaye wordes of aſtate, nature, and condicion, is diuiſed but for a ſhifte, ſuche as
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:2975:133"/>
agreeth not with other places of this booke nor in it ſelfe neyther. And where Saincte Ambroſe merueyleth at goddes worke in the ſubſtaunce of the Sacrament, this auctour ſhifteth that alſo to the effecte in him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyueth, whiche is alſo meruelous in deade, but the ſubſtaunce of the Sacramente is by Saincte Ambroſe ſpiritually merueyled at, howe breade is made the bodye of Chriſt the viſible matter outwardely remayninge, and onelye by an inwarde chaunge, whiche is of the inwarde nature, called properlye ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce in learnynge, and a ſubſtaunce in dede, but perceyued onely by inwarde vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandynge as the ſubſtaunce preſent of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes moſte precious body, is a very ſubſtance in dede of the bodye inuiſiblye preſente, but preſent in dede, and onelye vnderſtanded by moſte true and certen knowledge of fayth. And although this auctor noteth howe in the examples of mutacion brought in by Sainct Ambroſe, the ſubſtaunces neuer the leſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned the ſame: that ſkilleth not, for the wonder of thoſe meruelles ſerue for an indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to releaue the weake fayth of man in this miracle of the Sacramente, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the arrogancie of reaſon, preſumynge to ſerche ſuche knowledge in goddes ſecrete workes, whereof if there might be a reaſon geuen, it neded no fayth. And where there is a like, there is no ſingularite as this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle in the Sacramente in notablye ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<pb facs="tcp:2975:134"/>
and therfore none other founde like vnto it. The Sacramentall mutation, which this auctor newly ſo termeth, is a mere ſhifte to auoyde amonge ſuche, as be not lerned, the truthe of goddes miracle in this chaunge, whiche is in dede ſuche as Sainct Ambroſe ſpeaketh of, that of bread is made the bodye of Chriſte, whiche Sainct Ambroſe in an other place, termeth it the grace of the body of Chriſte, and all is one for it is a greate grace, to haue the bodye of Chriſt for our foode preſent there. And out of Chriſtes mouth, callynge the bodye of Chriſte, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge the bodye of Chriſte, whiche wordes callyng, ſignifiynge, namynge vſed in ſainct Ambroſe wrytynges, do not limite Chriſtes wordes, and reſtrayne them to anonely cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng, an only ſignifiyng, or an only naming, but geue an vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng agreable to other of Sainrt Ambroſe wordes, that ſhewe the breade after conſecracion to be the bodye of Chriſt, the callyng to be vnderſtanded a real callynge of the thynge that ſo is made, and likewiſe a reall ſignifiynge of the thynge in dede preſent, and a reall namynge, as the thynge is in dede. As Chriſte was named <hi>(Ieſus),</hi> becauſe he is the ſauiour of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in dede. And thus peruſynge this auctors anſwers, I truſt I haue noted to the reader, with howe ſmall ſubſtaunce of matter this auctor impugneth tranſubſtanciation, and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2975:134"/>
howe ſlenderly he goeth about to anſwere ſuche auctors, as by their ſeueral writynges conferme the ſame, beſides the conſent of Chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dom vniuerſally receyuyng the ſame. And howe in the meane waye, this auctor hath by his owne handes pulled downe the ſame vntrue doctrine of the figuratiue ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache, that himſelfe ſo lately hath diuiſed, or rather becauſe this matter in his book goeth before, he hath in this ſeconde booke marred his frame, or euer he cummeth to the thirde booke to ſet it vp. In the ſeconde volume of the. 43. leef, the auctor goeth about to note. 6. abſurdites in the doctrine of tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whiche I entende alſo to peruſe, This firſt is this.</p>
               <p>Firſt if the Papiſtes be demanded what thyng it <note place="margin">The auctor</note> is, that is broken, what is eaten, and what is chawed, with the teath lippes, &amp; mouth in this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, they haue nothynge to anſwere, but thaccidentes. For as they ſay bread, and wyne be not the viſible elementes in this Sacrament, but onely ther accidentes, and ſo they be forſed to ſaye that accidentes be broken, eaten, Dronken, chawed, and ſwalowed without any ſubſtaunce at all, whiche is not onely againſte all reaſon, but alſo againſte the doctrine of all auncient auctors.</p>

But leauynge of the matter of philoſophie to the ſcoles, I wil grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes to be without ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is againſt the come<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> courſe of natural thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges, &amp; thefore theri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is a ſpecial miracle of god.

And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if he would aſke further, what that is, I would tell him the viſible matter of the Sacrament, vnder whiche is preſent Inuiſibly the ſubſtance of the moſt precious body of Chriſt, if he will aſke yet further, Is that bodye of Chriſt broken, I will ſay no. For I am lerned in fayth, that that glorious body nowe impaſſible can not be broken, or diuided, and therfore it is holy in euery parte of that is broken, as the ſubſtaunce of bread is in comen bread in euery parte that is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, accordyng wherunto, it is in the booke of comen prayour ſetforth, howe in eche part of that is broken, is the hole body of our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt. If this queſtioner be further cu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rious and ſaye, is not that, that is broken breade? I woulde anſwere, as a beleuynge man by fayth truely no, For in fayth I muſt call it, becauſe it is truely ſo, the bodye of Chriſte inuiſibly there, and the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge to be not in it, but in the viſible ſigne. Yea ye will call it ſo ſayth this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioner, but yet it is bread: Nay quod I, my

And this I write becauſe howſoeuer clerkes ſoberly entreate the matter (ſuch as mynde well I meane) to conſider accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce whiche termes the rude vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de not, it is not neceſſarye therfore in thoſe termes, to make anſwere to ſuche as be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentiouſly curious, who labour with queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the truth of the miſterie, in declaracio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of, we as men ſtumble and terme it otherwiſe then we ſhuld, that is no Inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the miſterie, but an imparfection in vs that be not able to expreſſe it, not hauinge ſuch giftes of god as other haue, nor ſtudyinge to atteyne lernyng as other haue done.

               <p>Fiftely they are not aſſhamed to ſaye that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance <note place="margin">The auctor.</note> is made of accidentes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bread mouldeth or is turned into wormes, or the wyne ſowreth.</p>

For Chriſts workes we knowe to be trewe by moſt certain fayth what mouldeth in bread, or ſowreth in wine, we be not ſo aſſured, or where on wormes engendre, it is not ſo fully agreed on amonge men. The learned lawer Ulpian writeth (as I haue before alleged) that wyne and vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre haue in maner one ſubſtance ſo as when wyne ſowreth and is vinagre in maner the ſame ſubſtaunce remayneth in whome it is thought no abſurditie to ſay by that meanes that the accidentes onely ſower. And if we agree with the Philoſophers that there is <hi>(Materia prima)</hi> whiche in all thinges is one, and altereth not, but as a newe forme cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, taketh a newe name, fanſinge that as one waue in the water thruſteth a way ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo doth one fourme an other: it ſhoulde ſeme by this concluſion all alteracion to be in accidentes, and the corruption of accidentes to be the generacion of newe accidentes, the
<pb facs="tcp:2975:139"/>
ſame <hi>(Materia prima)</hi> beyng as it were <hi>(ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancia)</hi> that altereth not. And this I wryte that maye be ſayde as it were to make a title to this auctours certayntie whiche is / not ſo ſure as he maketh it. Amonges men haue been meruelous fanſies in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideracion of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall thinges, and it is to me a verye greate abſurdite of that ſecrete, and therfore to our knowledge an vncertein worke, to deduce an argument, wherwith to impugne oure cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine faith. But to cum nerer to the purpoſe, it is wronge borne in hande, that we affirme wormes to be engendred of accidentes, but when the wormes be engendred we graunte the wormes to be, and will rather ſay wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they be we cannot tel, then to ſay that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is made of accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, and that doctrine is not annexed to the fayth of tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiacion, and ſuch as entreate thoſe chaunces and accidentes do not induce that concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but do reaſonably auoyde it. And yet by the waye in mouldyng and ſowrynge it ſhoulde me ſemeth be properly ſayd that the acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes moulde, and the accidentes ſowre, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe we call moulde bread, bread, ſo wer wyne, wyne, and in wyne as I ſayde before made vinigre, the former ſubſtaunce hathe been in lernyng accompted in maner to remayne, ſo as this auctor ouerſhoteth himſelfe when he matcheth generacion of wormes with moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng &amp; ſowryng, which differ ſo farre in ther ſpeculation. But euen as this auctors wyt is

I ſhal diſprowe the concluſion by thauctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te of fayth, who is it moſt mete ſhuld yelde to other? And if in nature many thinges be in experience countrarye to the generall rules, why maye not one ſinguler condition be in this viſible mattier of the Sacrament, that the ouelye ſubſtance beynge chaunged, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partes, proprieties, and effectes may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne? Is it an abſurdite for a mayde to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue a childe, becauſe it is againſte the rules of nature? Is it an abſurdite the worlde to be made of nothynge becauſe the philoſopher faith of nothynge cummeth nothynge? The principall of nature is that whatſoeuer hath a begynnynge hath an ende, and yet it is no abſurdite to beleue our ſoules, to haue a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnyng without ende, and to be immortall. Wherfore to conclude this mattier, it is a great abſurdite in this auctour, to note that for an abſurdite in our fayth, whiche repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth onely to the principles of philoſophie or reaſon, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is onely to be accompted for an abſurdite, that ſhoulde repugne to the ſcripture, and gods wil, whiche is the ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derd to trye the rule of oure faith.

Who recommendeth vnto vs ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Theodorete whom he calleth an hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Biſhop, and with him doth bringe forth a peace of an Epiſtle of Saincte Chriſoſtome. The doctrine of whiche two ioyned with the doctrine of this auctor in ſuche ſence as this auctour woulde haue all vnderſtanded to be called Catholique, touchynge the faith of the Sacrament hath ſuche an abſurdite in it as was neuer hearde of in religion.

As thus, It is in dede bread, quod this au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctor, but call it not ſo, quod this Theodorete, It is not in dede the body of Chriſt, quod this auctor, but yet in anywiſe cal it ſo quod Theo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dorete. Here is playne ſimulacion, and diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulacion both together. For by forberynge the name of breade accordynge to Theodore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes teachynge, we diſſemble &amp; hide that it is by this auctors teachinge, and by vſinge the name of our Lordes body accordyng to Theo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>doretes teachyng, we fayne it to be that it is not, by this auctors teachynge whiche ſayth there is only a figure, and by this meanes in ſo high a myſterye we ſhoulde vſe vntruthes on both ſides in ſimulacion and diſſimulacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is a meruelous teachyng. I denye not but thinges ſignifiyng may haue the name of that they ſignifie by a figure of ſpeache: but we reade not in any doctrine geuen that the thynge ſignifiynge ſhoulde haue the name by figure and be deliuered from the name of that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:2975:141"/>
it is in dede. And yet this is nowe the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of this auctour in defence of his newe Catholique fayth ioyned with the teachynge of Theodorete, and the ſecrete Epiſtel of S. Chriſoſtome, as this auctor would haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnderſtanded. But thoſe men Theodorete &amp; Chriſoſtome in the ſence they mente as I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taught a true doctrine. For they take the name of the body of Chriſt in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to be a reall namynge of the body of Chriſte there preſente in dede, and therfore a true perfite name, which as S. Chriſoſtomes ſecrete Epiſtel ſaith, the thyng is worthy to haue declaryng, by that worthynes the thing named to be their in dede. And likewiſe I vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtande the other name of bread worthely done awaye, becauſe the ſubſtaunce, Wheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon in reaſon the name was grounded, is chaunged accordynge to the true doctrine of tranſubſtantiacion, therfore that name of bread in there doctrine is truely layde away, although Theodorete wryteth the viſible matter of bread and wyne to be ſeen and felt as they were before, and therfore ſaith there ſubſtance which there ſignifieth the outward nature is ſeen and felt to remayne, which ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes with conuenient vnderſtandynge maye thus agree with the Catholique teachyng of tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſubſtantiacion and ſo in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t on euery part both in the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly &amp; earthely part to be a ful, hole, &amp; perfit truth, as the high mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtery beyng the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of our perfit vnite in

An other cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine token is the wondryng and great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelyng that the olde auctours make, howe the ſubſtance of this Sacrament is wrought by goddes omnipotencie. Baptiſme is merue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led at, for the wonderfull effecte that is in man by it, howe man is regenerat, not howe the water, or the holy ghooſt is there. But the wondre in this Sacrament is ſpecially dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the worke of God in the viſible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, howe they be ſo changed into the body and bloud of Chriſt, which is a worke of god wrought, before we receyue the Sacrament. Whiche worke Cyprian ſayth is ineſtable, that is to ſay, not ſpeakable, whiche is not ſo <note place="margin">Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an de coena dn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>i.</note> if it be but a figure, for then it may eaſely be ſpoken, as this auctour ſpeaketh it with eaſe (I thynke) he ſpeaketh it ſo often. Of a preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce by ſignification if it may ſo be called, euery man maye ſpeake and tell howe, but of the / verye preſence in dede and therfore the reall preſence of Chriſtes body in the Sacrament,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2975:144"/>
no creature can tell howe it maye be, that Chriſt aſcended into heauen with his humai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne body, and therwith coutinually reignying there ſhould make preſent in the Sacrament the ſame body in dede, whiche Chriſt in dede worketh, beynge neuertheleſſe then at the ſame houre preſent in heauen, as S. Chriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom doth with a maruayle ſay. If the mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uayle were onely of godes worke in man in theffect of the Sacrament, as it is in Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me, it were an other matter, but I ſaid before the wrondre is in the worke of God, in the ſubſtaunce of the Sacrament, before it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued, which declareth tholde auctours that ſo wondre to vnderſtande the reall preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of Chriſtes verye bodye, and not an one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye ſignification, whiche hathe no wondre at all. And therfore ſeyng S. Cyprian won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth at it, and calleth the worke ineſtable, S. Chriſoſtom wondreth at it, S. Ambroſe wondreth at it, Emiſſen wondreth at it, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill wondreth at it. What ſhould we nowe doubt whether their fayth were of a ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation onely as this auctour woulde haue it, which is no wondre at all, or of the reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence whiche is in dede a wonderfull worke. Wherfore where this manifeſt token, and certaine marke appeareth in the olde fathers their can no conſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſillables, or words diſſuade, or peruerte the truth thus teſtified. A third token their is by declaration of figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res as for example S. Hierom when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth
<pb facs="tcp:2975:145"/>
vpon thepiſtel <hi>(Ad Titum)</hi> ſo aduiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly at lenght howe <hi>(Panes prepoſitiones)</hi> were the figure of the bodie of Chriſt in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: that proceſſe declareth the mynds of that auctor to be that in the Sacrament is preſent the verie truth of Chriſtes body not in a figure again, to ioyne one ſhadowe to an other, but euen the very truth to anſwere the figure, and therfore no particuler wordes in S. Hierome can haue any vnderſtandynge contrarye to his mynde declared in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. Fourthly an other certaine marke is where the olde auctours wryte of the addra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Sacrament, whiche can not be but to the thynges, godly, really preſent. And therfore S. Auguſtine wrytynge in his booke de <hi>(Catechizandis rudibus)</hi> howe the Inuiſible thynges be honored in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, meanyng the bodie and bloud of Chriſt, and in the. 98. Pſalme ſpeaketh of adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Theodoretus alſo ſpekyng ſpecially of ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Theſe auctours by <note place="margin">Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doretus. Dialo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go. 3.</note> this marke that is moſt certaine, take awaye all ſuche ambiguite as men might by ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, diuination, gather ſumtyme of their ſeuerall wordes, and declare by this marke of adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> playnely their faith to haue bene, and alſo their doctrine vnderſtanded as they ment of the reall preſence of Chriſtes verye bodye and bloud in the Sacrament, and Chriſt himſelfe God, and man to be their
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:2975:145"/>
preſent, to whoſe diuine nature and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manite vnite thervnto, adoration may onely be directed of vs. And ſo to conclude vp this matter foraſmuch as one of theſe foure mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, and notes maye be founde teſtified and apparaunte in the anucient wryters, with other wordes and ſentences conformable to the ſame: this ſhuld ſuffiſe to exclude al argu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of any by ſentences &amp; ambiguons ſpeaches, and to vpholde the certeynte of the true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique fayth in dede, whiche this auctour by a wronge name of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique fayth impugneth, to the greate ſlaunder of the truth and his owne reproch.</p>
