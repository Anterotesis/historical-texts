            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Sufferer in the Cauſe of God, who held forth his Teſtimony unto the end of his dayes againſt the Oppreſſion of Tythes, for which he dyed a Priſoner at <hi>London,</hi> about one hundred and eighty Miles from his Habitation, being ſent thither by a perſecuting hireling Prieſt, becauſe for good Conſcience ſake he could not ſatsfie his greedy Appetite, in paying or giving him Tythes; which being in direct Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Government of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our High Prieſt, who was ſent by the Father, and offered up himſelf once for all, to put an end to the firſt Prieſthood, with Tythes and Offerings appertaining to the firſt Covenant: And therefore doth every one that believeth in Chriſt Ieſus the ſecond Covenant, and in Faithfulneſs obey him, deny to pay Tythes, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch Miniſters, who abide not in Chriſt's Doctrine, who ſaid, <hi>Freely ye have received freely give;</hi> which command, the Apoſtles and Miniſters of Chriſt, in dayes paſt, did keep, as do his Miniſters in this our Age, Glory to the Lord God forever.</p>

much Patience, even as a Lamb with out complaint, and as one not alrighted or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed at the appearance of Death) can give a further and ciearer Teſtimony of his Faithfulneſs to the pure Truth of God, which he ſpake and declared of, ſome few hours before his departure, being very weak, inſomuch that according to outward appearance his ſudden departure was much expected; and all about him did conclude, that his Breath was almoſt gone; but after he had lain ſtill a little while, being a little after the 12. hour of the night, at which time he began to ſpeak &amp; continued ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king till about the 3. hour, in Praiſing and magnifying the name of the Lord; but his Voice at firſt was ſo weak; that we could not clearly hear what he ſaid, only we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that he pray'd &amp; ſaid <hi>O Lord God of mercy, preſerve thy People,</hi> &amp; immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his ſpeech was ſtrengthned, &amp; he ſpake with an audible voice; ſo that he was heard over all the Chamber where he lay, and he began to ſing forth of the mercy &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lord, and ſaid, <q>O Lord God Everlaſting praiſes everlaſting, Glory and

Oh dear Friends, Brethren and Siſters, dwell in the light; he that dwelleth in the light, dwelleth in God; but he that dwelleth not in the light dwelleth not in God, but in darkneſs, and ſo in Wickedneſs, in Sin and Tranſgreſſion, in the pride of life, and the vanities of the world. So my dear Friends, Brethren and Siſters, love the Truth, believe in the Truth, and the Truth will make you free: And ſo all that abide in the Truth they ſpring forth and grow like as the Willows by the Water Courſes, and ſhall never be Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren or Unfruitful.

whatſoever: Chriſt Jeſus is come the promiſed Seed, which ſhall grow and proſper till it hath covered the Face of the whole Earth. <hi>And in Prayer he ſaid,</hi> O Lord preſerve all Friends, my dear Brethren and Siſters, in the Truth to the end and for ever.</q>

               <p>As Firſt, He ſpake much concerning <hi>The living Bread that came down from Heaven, the Heavenly Manna, the Souls</hi>

                  <hi>If you know the Truth</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>the Truth ſhall ſet you free; Truth, Truth, Truth, Oh the precious Truth, it is all, and more then all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And at another time ſaid, <hi>Oh! thy Pure Everlaſting Light, which is ſo much deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed amongſt men; thy precious light by which I ſee thy Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And at another time, two Friends ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by his Bed ſide, he turned his Face to them and ſaid, <hi>I know you both, pray for me.</hi> And ſome time after another Friend <hi>R.

His Anſwer was, <hi>I have had a great Skirmiſh, but through Mercy I have overcome;</hi> and ſaid alſo, <hi>Avoid Satan; I defie thee, get thee behind me Satan. I have got the Victory:</hi> And then in Exhortation ſaid, <hi>Reſiſt the Devil and he will flee from you, that ſubtil Serpent, that goes about like a Roaring Lion, ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> And ſpake much that the Devil would

have Chriſt <hi>To fall down and worſhip him,</hi> and how the Devil carried Chriſt up to ſhew him the Glory of the World, ſaying, <hi>All this will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And again exhorted Friends ſaying, <hi>Preſs forward to the End of your Dayes, my dear Brethren and Siſters that are here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with me, I know ye not</hi> (that is, after the outward man) <hi>but be ye all Faithful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He alſo ſpake very much concerning <hi>David</hi> (as well he might) being made a large Partaker of <hi>David</hi>'s Experiences of the Goodneſs and Mercies of the Lord un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Soul, as <hi>David</hi> did. <hi>Oh David,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>A man after God's own heart;</hi> and how <hi>David</hi> praiſed the Lord, and to ſhew the Goodneſs of God to <hi>David,</hi> he ſpake ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much.</p>
               <p>And often times in great Admiration of the Truth, and its Glorious Appearance, he uttered theſe and the like Words, <hi>Oh the Glory of</hi> England, <hi>the Appearance of Truth</hi> England<hi>'s Glory.</hi> And that <hi>The Lord hath begun a Good Work in</hi> England, <hi>and he will carry it on notwithſtanding all Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</hi>
