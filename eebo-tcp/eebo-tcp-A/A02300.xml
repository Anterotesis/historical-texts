            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſo that thoſe that he thought

not beſt to geue, nor yet wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
for other to take, ſeyng
that there is doubte to counſell
any in that they ought to do:
Howbeit myne aduice is, that
the ſage perſons choſe to liue
in a quiet ſtate, and to dwell in
ſuche a place, that he may leade
a life without reproche, &amp; chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianly
to dye. Oftentymes
men do remoue from one cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

to another, from one toune

one houſe, from one companye

that he had peine in the one, he
<pb facs="tcp:10117:19"/>
doeth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine himſelf vtterly

For all men knoweth that the

theſe thynges be of neceſſitie &amp;
nothyng of free wyll, nor yet
praiſe to them that ſo withdra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
theim for the cauſes afore
ſayd: but the true leuyng of the

when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> courtier is yong, ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g,
in fauor, riche, &amp; in helth, then
with good harte to leaue the

honeſt reſt after his degre: this
is ſayd, to the entente that he
whiche leaueth the court, ſhuld
leaue it merily and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting,

            <p>To our purpoſe, if we ſhuld

hath been the whole courſe of

muche, wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dered, ſpoken, ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,

would ſaye that his life hath

Remember aboue all thynges
gentle reader here &amp; els where,
<pb facs="tcp:10117:26"/>
that I ſpeake not but of the vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diſcrete
Courtiers that can not
refraine their appetite with an
honeſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which thing
moſt chiefly cauſeth many ſage
&amp; diſcrete perſons to geue ouer
the Courte, becauſe to refraine
the wil of the heart, is a greater
paine then to content the body:
for the bodye is ſoone werye of
ſinnyng, but the heart is neuer
ſatiſfied in deſiryng: One may
knowe eaſily the compleccion
of the bodye, but the mynde of
the heart neuer, and to conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng
leſſe, for the heart at euery
inſtaunt requireth nowe one
thyng now another, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a lytle tyme after forgetteth
all. O diſſemblyng heart that
vnder a prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to be clere and

To conclude, that euery man

may do: If a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> know himſelf
to be ambicious, impacient, &amp;

peaceable, and deſiryng reſt &amp;
quietnes, let him be dwellyng
in the village, and he ſhall

to learne vertue: conſideryng y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
vices enter our gates laughyng
and goeth out from our houſe
wepyng &amp; lamentyng. O how
muche greueth it y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ambicious
courtier, when he can not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde
as he was wont to do?
then it may be ſayd, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to forſake
the court is requiſite to a good
heart, &amp; a good witte to obtain
reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10117:31"/>
Thoſe that leaue the Court
for fainte heart, be of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that it is more painfull to
theim to ſee theimſelues abſent
from the Court, then their ioye
was when they wer in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court:
whiche ſayd perſons if they
would folow myne aduice and
counſel ſhould not onely leaue
the court, but forget it vtterly
for euer. And farther, the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
ought to retyre in ſuche
maner that he may come to the
Court againe, if the feare and
ſtudy in orderyng of his houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
conſtraine him eftſones
for to deſire the voluptuouſnes
of the court. In the heart of
the prudent courtier that forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the court, when there fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
biſhoprickes or other great
offices, the affeccions &amp; deſires
<pb facs="tcp:10117:32"/>
of the mynde ryngeth <hi>alarme,</hi>
when he ſhall thynke if I had
not come awaye ſo ſoone, that
office or that dignitie had been
myne: but he again reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bryng
that many ſuche thinges hath
fallen which he had not: ſo like
wiſe might he haue in the ſtede
of ye, a plain nay, of that which
fell when he was gone. Then,
is it not muche better to ouerſe
and trauaile his owne houſe
then to haue ſuche a ſhamefull
denial in the court?</p>
            <p>Therfore deſtinies of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
are ſo prompte and ready
that for the moſte parte one is
conſtrained to diſpiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more
by neceſſitie, then by wyll, and
in that meane while their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
is at an ende before they
themſelues beware therof, For
<pb facs="tcp:10117:32"/>
when the Courtier commeth to
be at a quiet w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> himſelfe, aboue
all thynges it is neceſſary that
he take hede of peſteryng of
himſelfe, for if he did liue in the
court euil willed, let him take
hede that in the village he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
not, by reaſon of charge,
the importunitie of his wife, of
his children, &amp; the ſautes of his
ſeruauntes, the grudgyng of
his neighbours may parcaſe
make him aſtonyed: but to
thinke again, that beyng eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
from the dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous golfe
of the court, he may repute him
ſelfe halfe a God. And beſides
this, none ought to thinke that
he dwellyng in a village in the
countrey ſhall putte awaye all
troubles and diſpleaſures, for
it can not be, but he that neuer
<pb facs="tcp:10117:33"/>
fell in the croked &amp; rough way
may happen to ſtumble in the
plaine way &amp; breake his necke:
and therfore it is neceſſary that
he retiryng fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the court, take
the tyme as it ſhall come, that
he may the more occupie him
ſelfe in vertuous exerciſes, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
entent that to much reſt, and to
much buſynes of minde let him
not from the great good that
commeth of this, to be well co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with a litle. Ioyne vnto
this alſo that there is none ſo
muche enemye vnto vertue as
is idlenes, of the which idlenes
be taken in the beginnyng
thoughtes ſuperfluous, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the diſtruccion of men.</p>
            <p>To the purpoſe, hath not the
courtier cauſe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine, that
occupieth himſelfe in nothyng
<pb facs="tcp:10117:33"/>
but in eatyng, drinkyng, &amp; ſlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng,
and in the meane ſeaſon
his better age, that is to ſay, his
youth conſumeth away, as the
fume of ſmoke, which procedes
of idlenes in the court &amp; doyng
nothyng? where contrarywyſe
he might in the village exerciſe
himſelf to his honor, and to the
helth of his body and profite of
his neighbour.</p>
            <p>In like maner alſo, the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
that withdraweth himſelfe
ſhuld vſe the company of ſuche
as be graue, ſage and honeſt, to
the entent that in the ſtede of
lyers, flatterers, &amp; triflers whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
he was aſſociate withall in

in the village with wiſe
and ſage frendes, or at the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
with good bokes, whereby
<pb facs="tcp:10117:34"/>
in the lokyng of theim he may
vertuouſly imploye the reſidue
of his tyme, and with ſobrietie
entertaine euery man, that men
may ſaye he is come from the
court to pleaſe the good, and
not to rule. And if parcaſe one
would make him baylief in the
village or other publique office
I would counſail him to take
hede therof as he would of the
peſtilence, for becauſe there is
nothyng ſo troubleous nor ſo
harde a burden to the mynde
as to take charge of the rude &amp;
ſymple. I do not ſaye naye, but
that he may and ought to help
the poore commons of the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
with ſuche knowlege as
he hath lerned in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court, or had
before he came ther, when they
ſhall haue nede, either for loue
<pb facs="tcp:10117:34"/>
or for money. Alſo if they be at
variaunce, healpe to appeace
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: if they be euil intreated, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende
them. And this doyng, he
ſhalbe eſtemed of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons &amp;
praiſed of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wiſe and prudent.
Aboue all thynges beware of
prodigal apparel, ſuperfluous
ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quetes, and delicate meates,
and ſtrong or precious wynes.
For the abſenting fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the court
ought to be to none other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
but to liue ſoberly in the
village, or els ſhall he make of
the village the court, whiche
ſhould make of the court, the
village. And the courtier rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the court ought to haue
in ſinguler co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dacion mercy,
as to viſite hoſpytalles, ſuccor
the poore, counſel the orphans,
vyſite the pryſoners, reade the

vertuouſly duryng his life, for
when he ſhalbe dead, euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
wyll clayme his goodes, but
none will or can diſcharge his

that I haue ſayd, let no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay

without ſeking of ſo many

with a meane eſtate, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
of al ſuche breake brai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
Another benefite of the

<pb facs="tcp:10117:36"/>
or burges that there doth
inhabite maye be one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chief

for there he ſhal ſe other go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

well in credite as in riches, as
wel in the houſe as without the

to liue in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> village with honor,
then in the court ouerthrowen

The difference betwene the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riyng
<pb facs="tcp:10117:37"/>
or abiding in a litle place
and a great place, is that in the

in the great place many riche
men wherby enuy is noriſhed.</p>
            <p>Another commoditie in the

thou ſhalt haue no craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

            <p>Another benefite of the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage

the whiche layſer courtiers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

the village is this, thoſe that
<pb facs="tcp:10117:38"/>
be dwellers there may go alone
from place to place without to
be noted to fall from grauitie,
they nede no Mule nor Horſe
with afoote clothe, nor page to
wayte of my lorde, or damoſell
to waite vpon my lady. And
that were ſcorneful to do in the
court alone: And without dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
one may walke fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor

to land, and not therby miniſh
any part of his honor.</p>
            <p>Another benefite is, that men
may go whether they will, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
ſimply with a ſtaffe in his
hande, a ſwearde by his ſide, or
hacbut in his necke, and if he
be wery of pounſed hoſen, lette
him wear ſloppes, if he be a
colde lette him take his furred
goune for all is one there. A

good Gentleman dwellyng in
the village and hauyng a good
cote of clothe, an honeſt Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe
cloke on his backe, a
paire of lether ſhooes, goeth as
wel trymmed to the churche as
doeth my lorde the courtier to
the court with his goune furde
with Marters or Sables. A
man of the village of what ſort
ſoeuer he be, is in as good caſe,
that rydeth to market or to the

(when all is ſayd) better is the

in the court, &amp; ſpecially ingreat
tounes they haue bread for the

            <p>Another commoditie in the

in mod thynges and better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy

               <pb facs="tcp:10117:40"/>
Another co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie is in the

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10117:41"/>
Another commoditie in the
village is, that ther are no yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
Phyſicians, nor olde ſicknes:
And contrary to this, the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
is conſtrained there to part

men of lawe, another to potte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries,
&amp; the fowerth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians.

And ſometyme they are
very well pleaſed with cabons

            <p>Another commoditie in the
village is, that thee daies there
ſeme to be more long, and they
are better imployed, then they
are either in the court or in the
great tounes, foraſmuch as the
yeres paſſe awaye there or one
be ware, and the daies without

beit that the ſportes and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
be more in the village
then in the tounes, yet ſo it is
that one day ſhall ſeine lenger

the village is happye and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,
<pb facs="tcp:10117:42"/>
foraſmuche as there the
Sunne ſemes to make a more

the dayes ſlyde away in
the court: In the village if it be
perceiued, it is beſtowed with
honeſt buſynes, whiche cannot
be done in the court.</p>
            <p>In the village alſo is muche
more plentie of wood then in
other places: hay, ſtrawe, Otes
much better chepe then in good
tounes. Alſo in the village a
man is at libertie to eate his
meate where he will, &amp; when he
will &amp; with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he will: but in
the court they eat late, the meat
euil dreſſed and colde, and with

<pb facs="tcp:10117:42"/>
worſt of al, for the moſt parte,
he muſt eate with his enemies,
where as the good felowes of

keping their thre good faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
that belongeth to good repaſt,
that is, firſt he erneth his meat
next that he eateth his meate
merely, &amp; thirdly he eateth with
good company.</p>
            <p>Another commoditie is that
the huſbandman of the village
hath how to occupy themſelfes
and howe to be mery, whiche
the courtier, nor the citezen
hath not, thathath enemies e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nother commoditie of
the village is, that thei
do fele y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trauailes leſſe
on the workyng day, &amp; reioyce
merely on the holy day: where
<pb facs="tcp:10117:43"/>
the courtier continually vexed
with weightie and troubleous
affaires, neuer knoweth when it
is holy day. O village, it is not
ſo in the, wheras on the feaſtful
daye the clerke ceaſeth not to
tolle the bell, to make clene the
churche, to make redy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> alters,
the people honeſtly apparelled
the feaſtes commaunded to be
obſerued, the curate preacheth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
goſpel, &amp; after diner they make
mery with a thouſande honeſt

the holydaies are knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when

when they conſume the

            <p>Another commoditie is this,
<pb facs="tcp:10117:44"/>
that where the courtiers vſe to
eate fleſhe and corrupt veniſon
&amp; wildefoule that is long kept,
they of the village haue their
meate freſhe and freſhe, tender
and holſome, &amp; as one may ſay,
in good ſeaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that is, houſdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
Partrige, pullettes, ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doues,
wodcockes, Feſauntes,
fatte Capons, Conyes, Hares,
and innumerable victayl of al
ſortes. And ouer and beſydes
this, to their great aduauntage
they haue ſhepe that beareth
woll to clothe them, good mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
to eate, dong to make fatte
their ground, and Kyddes and
Goates alſo, with Oxen to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
in the plough, and kyne to
milke and make butter &amp; cheſe:
and hogges to make bacon of,
Coltes for to noriſhe &amp; horſes
<pb facs="tcp:10117:44"/>
for to ſerue them and for to ſell
when nede requireth. And an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
priuelege of the village
is this, that the good ſhall be
honoured for a good man, and
the vnthriftie perſon knowen
as he is, whiche is not ſo in the
court, for ther is noma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> praiſed
for that he deſerueth to be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
but becauſe he hath aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
and riches.</p>
            <p>O how muche is the wiſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
honored in the village for his
wyſedome and good counſail?
how many tymes is he tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>keo
and how many preſentes hath
he? If parcaſe one of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bors
haue any goodfruit in his
garden, a good melon, a good
pear, or a good muſcadel grape
gladly they wyll preſent him
therewith, as to him that
<pb facs="tcp:10117:45"/>
hath deſerued it.</p>
            <p>Another preuilege of the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
is this, that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may
marry his daughters to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualles
and neighbours, that
thereby dayly he may receiue
bothe pleaſure and ſeruice, the
whiche the courtiers cannot do
that marry their doughters ſo
farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theim, that for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt
part they lament theim or they
ſee theim. O happy inhabitor
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> village that fyndes at his
gate huſbandes for his dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and wiues for his ſonnes.
He maryeth theim nigh to him
that he may eaſly ſee his ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes

poſteritie: he is beloued of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
ſuccoured in his affaires, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
&amp; noriſhed in his ſickenes,
and great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forte to him in his
age.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10117:45"/>
Another commoditie is, that
they are not to muche carefull
nor yet ireful or enuious: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
commoditie they of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court
and the citezens litle taſteth or
emoyeth: for the courtier many
times lacketh money, when his
great affaires ſhuld be brought
to paſſe. I ſay therfore o happy
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> village, that nedes not
to go at ten of the clocke to the
palice to beg counſel, to ſpeake
fayre to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vſſher, to waite vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the preſident &amp; make <hi>flectamus
ienua</hi> to the lawyer, and flatter
the kyng and his counſel, &amp; the
Magiſtrate: but hath in ſtede
of theſe Idolatries for a happy
ſolace, the benefites of nature
and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paſtimes therof, to heare
the ſhepe blete, the Bulles to
bray, the Horſe to neſe, the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyngales
<pb facs="tcp:10117:46"/>
to ſyng, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Thruſhes
to warble, the Lynets to mynſe
their ſonges, dogges to runne,
Lambes to leape, Kyddes to
gambolde, &amp; ſee the Pekockes
ſet vp their tailes like a whele,
He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nesto kecle, kockes to crow,
&amp; a thouſand kynde of beaſtes
and birdes play and ſporte.</p>
            <p>Another commoditie is, that
in the village one may be there
more vertuous &amp; leſſe vicious
then in the court or in the great
citiees, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reaſon is, for that
in great companyes we ſhall
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menly fynde a M. that kepe
men from good doyng &amp; x. M.
that will moue vs to do euill.
And in the village euery man
ſanctifyeth the Sabboth day,
kepeth the feaſtes, heareth the
ſermones, and by this meanes
<pb facs="tcp:10117:46"/>
with great labor worketh his
ſoule health aſſiſted by grace.</p>
            <p>Wherfore the village is to be
praiſed for that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> occaſions of
euil, and of our deſtruccion are
not ſo plentifull and practiſed
there, as they are in the court &amp;
in good tounes, no cokes hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to make them licorous: nor
there are no great eſtates wher
by enuy ſhuld ariſe: there is no
choppyng nor chaungyng by
vſury: whores to quarell and
fight for, nor courtiers to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
in armure, nor wanton and
lewde places to corrupt youth
withall: nor Iuſtices to feare
them, ye (and that beſt of all is)
no couetuouſnes whiche ſhuld
ſwalow vp and deuoure them.</p>
            <p>Another preuilege there is,
that there one may well gather
<pb facs="tcp:10117:47"/>
ſome good, and ſpende muche
leſſe then in the court. For eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man knowes well what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue

to be waſted in the court, &amp; ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in theſe dayes, that the
great apparellyng of ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kettes
is ſuche that they be well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

the reader of this: This is the
life of the courtier as it is here
diſcribed: and alſo of him that
<pb facs="tcp:10117:57"/>
liueth in the village the whiche
ſayd life of the peyſauntes ſhal
be muche praiſed of many, and

&amp; the more he readeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

cuſtomes. And to cal to reaſon
why it is ſo, it foloweth that the
court of pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces is good but for
two maner of menne, for theim
that be in fauor, &amp; for the yong
whiche be yet of a weake iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment.

            <p>The courtier alſo ought not to

how to kepe him from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptfull

thus y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> newecome courtier that

and that they haue a payment

him to lende him a certain ſum

no ſuche neceſſitie, but onely to

reade that they were ſo negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent

ſuche be ſene often to be good

neuer loſt battell, but onely in
truſtyng to muche to his owne
witte &amp; iudgement. And if we
beleue <hi>Hiarcas</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Philoſopher,
it is more hurtfull to a manne
to ſtand in his owne conceipt,
then to phanſye a woman: for
in louyng a woman, a manne
hurteth but himſelfe: but in
ſtickyng to muche to his owne
phantaſy, it may redound to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
hurt of a whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale.
All this that is ſayd, ſhalbe to
admoniſh them that tary in the
court, to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſant with the
graue and ſage perſons, &amp; with
ſuche as be learned, and ſuche
<pb facs="tcp:10117:66"/>

graue, learnes vertue: Scile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
is a certaine guide to a man: &amp;
experience, is the conſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>macion
of all. For although the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
beyng young, be neuer ſo
ſage, graue, riche or in fauor, he
ſhall nede a father to counſail
him, a brother to perſuade him,
a guyde to teache him the way,
and a maiſter to inſtruct him,
and a corrector to puniſh him:
becauſe the miſchiefes, craftes,
&amp; wickednes doeth ſo abounde
in the court that it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that a man alone may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende
him from all, and vtterly
reſiſt theim. For in the court
there is none ſo high awaye to
deſtruccion as for a man to be
gouerned onely by himſelfe, &amp;
haue his owne ſwinge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10117:67"/>
The court is a perpetuall
dreame, a botomeleſſe whorle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole,
an inchaunted phantaſy,
and a maſe: when he is in, he
cannot get out till he be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.
One of the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medyes
that the courtier may
get againſt ſo many euils, is to
haue a faythfull frende that
flatters him nothyng, but that
rather will correct and rebuke
him if he goe home late, if he
walke by night, if he be a falſe
player or whorehunter. But
where ſhall we fynde ſuche a
frende? For we ſe the frendſhip
in the court is commonly vſed
among yong courtiers in this
ſort, that ſo ſone as ii. or .iii. are
met together, ſtrayt fall they to
quarellyng, fightyng, ryoting,
ſo that there is rather occaſion
<pb facs="tcp:10117:67"/>
geuen to do euil, then good cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſail
to refraine. Therfore he
that haunteth the court, it wer
mete that he had ſome frende to
whom without feare he might
common of his buſynes, &amp; that
the multitude be alſo to him
common frendes, but aboue al
one perfite frende.</p>
            <p>I would alſo he ſhould kepe
himſelfe from the conuerſacion
of ſedicious perſons, from col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericke
perſons &amp; vacabondes,
for the raſcall ſorte will ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and ſay, the kyng payeth
naught that thoſe be in fauour
haue all the ſwynge, that the
officers are proude, that mens
ſeruice is euil recompenſed, &amp;
the good vnknowen: With
theſe wordes &amp; ſuche other like
the pore courtiers forgettes to
<pb facs="tcp:10117:68"/>
ſerue &amp; begynne to murmure.</p>
            <p>Alſo the good chriſtian man
ought not to ceaſſe to amende
his life, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hopeth to liue
long: although thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be olde
there occupy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelfes rather in
newe paſtance, then to correcte
their olde ſynnes. Ye ſhal fynde
theim that promiſe euery day
for to amende the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelfes in their
age, &amp; yet neuertheles dye there
worſe then deuils: the cauſe is
that they all ſay we wil do and
yet neuer do. There be ſome
old dotyng fooles, whiche ſhal
bragge of the kinges &amp; princes
whiche they haue ſerued, of the
chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gyng of offices y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei haue
ſeen, and of the warres paſſed,
and of the great mutabilitie &amp;
chaunge of fortune. And yet
notwithſtandyng all that they
<pb facs="tcp:10117:68"/>
haue ſeen and endured, they be
as gredy of gaine, and delight
in yong and fooliſhe paſtymes
as though thei wer newe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyn
to liue. Alas miſerable
men that in perpetual trauail,
and continuall ſorowe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
trouble haue paſſed their
liues, euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their fyrſt tyme
of knowlege (whiche is, xv. ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res)
to the time of manhod, and
then fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that tyme to their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng
age, &amp; all to haue gained
riches and increace in renoune:
not in all this tyme once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membre
that in the ſteade of
a true and perfite reſt, they
prepare for theim ſelues a hell
both for body and ſoule. The
courtier alſo ought not lightly
to complaine of aduerſities
whiche many tymes come to
<pb facs="tcp:10117:69"/>
him, thinking that oftentymes
(though it be our owne faulte)
we do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine of thinges whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
ſhould complaine of vs, if
they had a toungue.</p>
            <p>What tyme a man ſeeth him
ſelf baſe and is litle eſtemed, or
poore &amp; forgotten of the riche,
and deceiued of that he looked
ſurely to haue, incontinent he
curſes his fortune and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
his euil: In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane while
it is not fortune that hath thus
ſerued him, but him ſelfe that
hath ſerched it and founde it.
Suche a manne thinkes to be
quickely riche, honored &amp; eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhortely after ſeeth him
ſelfe poore, ouerthrowen, diſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and blamed of all men, and
cannot reuenge himſelfe, but
onely ſay, he is vnfortunate &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:10117:69"/>
vnhappy to the worlde, &amp; that
it is miſhap: whiche is not ſo,
but his owne folly that makes
him to leaue the ſuretie of his
houſe and prepareth himſelf to
the hazard of fortune, and ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
hath no cauſe to complain
but of himſelf whiche choſe the
waye to it. The beſt is, after
that a man purpoſeth himſelfe
to continue in the court, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> then
paciently he awayte and tarye
the tyme of auauncement or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage

with the tyme, let him not
remaine there, for contentacion
conſiſteth not in the place, but
in the ambicious heart, &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

a trueth, ye that be courtiers
that if .ii. or .iii. thinges ſuccede
<pb facs="tcp:10117:70"/>
to your purpoſe proſperouſſy,
there ſhall come a hundreth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthwarte

him more then the pleaſure he
hath of his owne happe: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is alwayes lacke or

moued a queſtion to
them, whiche of al their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon

The ſayd ambaſſadours, were
Romayns, Carthaginiens, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliens,

Lacedemoniens, &amp; Cicioniens:
among who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the queſtion was

commaunded that euery one of

that were in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth
thre pointes, and that therby it
might eſely be ſene whiche was
better ruled and deſerued more
praiſe. Then the ambaſſadour
of the Romaynes beganne and
ſayd, In Rome the temples be
honored, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gouernours obeyed
and the euil chaſtiſed. The am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour

the Philoſophers to teache.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10117:72"/>
The ambaſſadour of the Cici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liens
ſayd, In Cicill is true
iuſtice executed, trouth is belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and equalitie praiſed. The

ſayd, In Rhodes the olde men

            <p>When kyng Ptolome and

he praiſed greatly the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion

that he could not iudge whiche
was the beſt. This hiſtorie is
well worthy to be noted, and
better to be folowed: And I

entent that the chaſticement
ſhould be terrour to the euil, &amp;

more to be praiſed whiche may

            <p>There is in the court ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

the capitaine Antony Deleua:
at Tunes with the Emperour:
or at Turron w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Andrew Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.
And for all his brabling he
was no better then a ruffian or
a zacar of Tholydo, or a knaue
of Cordoua. We haue reherſed
theſe thynges before written, to

leaue mocking of the poore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitantes

            <p>Let vs ſay then, that very late

the whiche conſiſtes in this:
theipromiſe to pleaſe the deuil,

to be euer penſife, ſad and
ful of ſuſpicion: They promiſe
alwayes to be choppyng and
chaungyng, full of buſynes, to
bye, to ſel, to wepe, to ſinne, and
neuer to reforme themſelues:
They ꝓmiſe alſo to be iagged
and raggged, an hungred, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
and diſpiſed: They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb facs="tcp:10117:78"/>
to ſuffre rebukes of Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
theft of their neighbours,
iniuries of collerike men, moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keries
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, reproche of
their parentes: and finally,
miſſyng &amp; lackyng of frendes.</p>
            <p>Lo this is the profeſſion and
rule of the obſeruauntes of the
court: whiche I wyll not name
a rule, but a confuſion, not a
order but a diſorder, not a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery,
but a hel, and a religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
not of brethren, but of diſſolute

I haue wonder that any

is he that leadeth his life in the
village, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane buſynes
of his litle poſſeſſion, in compa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riſon
of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> courtier whoſe eſtate

hope of thynges vaine, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curyng
vniuſt thinges &amp; ſuche
thynges that neuer can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.
And if thoughtes
<pb facs="tcp:10117:82"/>
were wynde, &amp; his deſires wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
it ſhould be greater daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

choppyng and chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng,
and euermore diſpite &amp;
enuy: and that worſt is there is
no libertie to depart thence.</p>
            <p>The yoke of the court is hard,
the bondes faſte tyed and the
plough ſo tedious that thoſe
that wene to be the firſt to try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
are the firſt that labor &amp;
drawe the weightie burdens.
And ſuche as are poore &amp; igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt
men ſuffre theſe intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
trauailes, becauſe they
<pb facs="tcp:10117:82"/>
would not be as ſubiectes in

ſuche libertie coſteth them, that

trauail and perpetual bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.
The propertie of this
vicious libertie, or better to cal
it, this miſcheuous ſubieccion,
is, that at the beginnyng it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
ſomewhat pleaſaunt: but
in the ende al co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uertes to a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes,
ſorow, and lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tacion,
chiefly when a man hath expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
by litle &amp; litle of the vice
that this life conteyneth. For if
he accompany with women, he
muſt flatter them, ſerue them, &amp;
intreate theim: And if money
lacke, then muſt there be ſome
deuiliſhe ſhift made.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10117:83"/>
deuiliſhe nede. For why, when
one commeth new to the court,
my lady dame gorgious, ledes
him a trayne, ſhe entertaynes
him, ſhe makes muche on him,
ſhe colles him: but when ſhe
ſpyeth him to lacke, ſhe ſendes
him to paſture in the bare fiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.
And if the tyme of eatyng
come, the courtier muſt often
tymes fede with them, whom he
would ſee eaten without ſauce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Nowe, if his turne be to playe,
therin is litle profite: if he wyn,
he muſt liberally departe with
the gaine to thoſe that ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by:
&amp; if he looſe, they reſtore to him
neuer a penny. And if the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers

            <p>In the tyme when <hi>Marcus

an excellent Muſician out of

ſayd that the Emperoure

               <hi>Aurilianus Quintus</hi> toke a gret

immortall renoune for himſelf

And it is ſayd of him, that he
onely of all the Romaines did

when he came from Aſia &amp; ſaw
that the common welth was in
deuiſion betwixt <hi>Marius</hi> &amp; <hi>Silla,</hi>
he determined to leaue Rome &amp;
make a houſe in the countrey
nigh to Naples vpon the ſea
ſyde (nowe at this preſent tyme
called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Caſtel of Lobo) which
he edified and liued there xviii.

ſayth that <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romaines ſent vnto him

when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ambaſſadours ariued
at his houſe, they found him in
a litle garden wher he was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng

And hearyng what they ſayd
vnto him, he anſwered in this
wiſe: Do you not thynke my

for him that can ſowe his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys,
and afterwarde pleaſantly
and merely to eate theſame, ſo

I haue aſſaied bothe, I knowe
what it is to commaunde in the

I pray you ſuffre me here to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide

a grauitie was in him.</p>
            <p>Aboute the yeres of his age
whiche was .lx. he went from
Athens to a litle village, where
he ended the reſt of his dayes,
ſtudiyng and paſſing the tyme

I haue founde the porte of

him to be ſlaine, not for that he
had committed any crime wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

then an honeſt manne
ought to do: but onely becauſe
the lecherous <hi>Domicia</hi> hated

            <p>
               <hi>Scipio</hi> the Affrican was ſo eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

And yet made he warre in

And yet for all this, beyng of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

I haue had falſe reportes: I
haue been euen nowe glad and
mery, and furth with ſadde and
ſory: to daye riche, to morowe
poore: now mounted vpward,
&amp; ſtraite throwen dounewarde:
This hath been to me a maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng,
where I haue loſte both
money and tyme. And nowe I
ſaye to the my ſoule, what haſt
thou gotten of this great ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney?
The recompence is this,
that I haue gotten there a gray
head, fete ful of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goute: mouth
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out tethe: raines full of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel:
my goodes layd to pledge:
my body charged w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thought:
and my ſoule litle clenſed from
ſynne. And yet is there more
ſeyng y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I muſt nedes ſpeake,
that is, that I haue returned
my body ſo wery, my iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb facs="tcp:10117:99"/>
dull, my tyme ſo loſt, the beſt of
my age ſo paſſed, and that is
worſt of al, I founde no taſt in
any thing that is in the worlde:
ſo that to conclude, I am of my
ſelfe al wery of my ſelfe. What
ſhould I more tell or ſay of the
alteracion of my life, and of the
chaunges of fortune? I came
to the court innocent, and come
from it malicious: I went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
true and meanyng truth, &amp;
returned a lyar: I went thither
humble, &amp; returned preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous:
I we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thither ſobre, and
returned a gurmand &amp; glutto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
I wente thither gentle and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,
and returned cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
Finally in goyng thither
I marde my ſelf in all pointes:
And I haue no cauſe to laye y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
faut in my maſters, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vices
<pb facs="tcp:10117:99"/>
ſoone learned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out a maſter, &amp;
cannot be forgotten without a
corrector. O miſerable that I
am, I kept in the court an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
of my goodes, to knowe
how they were waſted, and not
for to diſtribute theim to the
poore: I toke hede of my honor
for to encreaſe it, not for to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
my ſelfe by the tyme: I toke
care of them that ſhuld pay me,
to know what was owyng me,
and not that I might gette to
profite the poore withal, but to
ꝓfite in riches and not in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
I helde an accoumpt with
my ſeruauntes, to none other
purpoſe, then to know how lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
thei had been with me &amp; ſerued
me, &amp; not to enquire what life
thei led: Finally, I held a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt
of my life, but it was more to
<pb facs="tcp:10117:100"/>
conſerue it, then to correct it.</p>
            <p>Lo, beholde, this was my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpt,
this was my calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
this was the Arſmetrique
that I learned in the court.</p>
            <p>Let vs yet go a litle further
and ſe mine exerciſes. I neuer
was yet in the court but I fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
to whom I bare malice, or els
that enuied me. I was neuer
yet in the palaice but I founde
a window open, and a courtier
murmur. I neuer yet ſpake to
princes, but I went from them
not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented in my mynde with
ſome parte of their anſwere. I
neuer yet went to bed without
complaint, nor neuer did ryſe
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out a ſigh. If I went about
to do any good thing, my great
affaires hyndered me. If I
would ſtudy, my felowes letted
<pb facs="tcp:10117:100"/>
me. If I went to take any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
and quiet paſtyme, myne
affaires would not permit me.
If I kept my ſelfe ſolitary and
from companye, my thoughtes
martyred me: Finally ther was
neuer any thyng that ſo vexed
my heart as the lacke of money
in my purſe. And yet all this is
nothyng, remembryng that I
was euer enuyous to ſuche as
were myne equalles: a flatterer
to my ſuperiors, and without
pitie to mine inferiors: &amp; where
I phanſied one, I bare hate al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
to all other. I found eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man worthy of reprofe, but
againſt my ſelfe I could not
ſuffre a worde to be ſpoken. O
howe forgetfull haue I been,
whiche ſhould forget or a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
of meate had been put in
<pb facs="tcp:10117:101"/>
my mouth, and haue talked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loude
to my ſelf alone, as it had
been one that had been mad? O
how often hath chaunced me y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
in commyng from the counſail
wery, or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> palaice thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
I would not heare myne
owne ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>res ſpeake, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patche
ſuche as I had to do w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all?
O how many tymes haue
I been ſo drouned in buſynes,
that I could not moderate my
penſiuenes, although my fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
did counſail me to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary?
O alas, how many times
hath my mynde preſſed me to
leaue the court and the worlde,
and to yelde my ſelfe to ſome
ſolitary deſert, as an Heremite?
becauſe I ſawe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng auau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
him and him, and I put backe
as a perſon halfe deſperate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10117:101"/>
Moreouer to fulfil my trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
alwaies I wente aſkyng &amp;
ſerchyng newes of the affaires
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court: alwaies harkenyng
what one ſayd of another: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
ſpiyng and watchyng: &amp;
all this conſidered, I found by
myne accoumpt, that I liued in
heauynes, captiuitie, and ſtate
of damnacion.</p>
            <p>Let vs yet go farther: If I
were riche, one or other ſerched
ſome meane to deuour me: If
I were poore, I found none to
ſuccour me: my frendes cryed
out vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, and mine enemies
ſought my death. Ouermuche
bablyng of the courtiers brake
my braines: and muche ſilence
made me to ſlepe, and the ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
cauſed me to be ſad: And
ouermuche company oppreſſed
<pb facs="tcp:10117:102"/>
me: muche exerciſe weryed me,
and idlenes confounded me.</p>
            <p>To co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, I ſo burdened and
vexed my ſelf in the court with
ſo muche trauail in naughty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I durſt not deſire death,
although I had no deſire to
liue.</p>

the difference betwixte him
that I was when I went firſt
to the court, &amp; that I am nowe

Firſt and before that I did caſt
my ſelfe into this perilous la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinthe
(which is to ſay a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
full of all ſnares) I was a
good deuout perſon, ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle and

and came from thence
deffe, &amp; more then ſpurblynde,
and nomore able to go then he
that is full of the goute: And
briefely and olde gryſard, ful of
ambicion, in ſuche wyſe, that I
am ſo variable, that ſcant I
knowe on what grounde to ſet
my feete. My heart was of ſo
depraued a ſort, that it deſired
to be diſcharged of all accions,
and yet for all that founde no
nother but peril and torment.</p>
            <p>Sondry tymes I purpoſed to
leaue the court, and ſodenly I
repented. Sometyme I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
not to come out of my

enforced to trot a trot to the
court. Sometyme I purpoſed
<pb facs="tcp:10117:103"/>
not to come to the palaice, and
or I were ware I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to go thither ſometyme
or it were day. I purpoſed to

that my good purpoſes
ceaſed and went fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me: and I
did that was leude &amp; naughty.
Behold how I liued of wynde
and of fooles imaginacions as
many a fooliſhe courtier doth.
I haue pha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taſied with my ſelf
(in the court ſometyme) that I
gouerned the kyng &amp; the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and that I came of a noble

in ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, great in fauor
and beloued of all men, ſage in
counſail, moderate in ſpeaking
eloquent in writyng, prudent
in ſeruice, and conformable to
<pb facs="tcp:10117:104"/>
all. But when I waked out of
my folly as from a dreame, and
looked to my feete, I knewe
eaſly that I had born falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to my ſelfe of this golden &amp;
pleaſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t imaginacion, &amp; ſawe of

Farewell worlde, ſythens by

            <p>Farewell world, for beyng in

our youth, in vices: our middle

all our tyme cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted together in

            <p>Farewell worlde, for in thy

the head full of migrain: the

            <p>Farewell worlde, for none of

witneſſe thoſe that daily we ſee,
are not falſe knaues marked in

to mocke one another? to

            <p>Farewell worlde, ſeyng no

bridges that brekes vnder vs:

            <p>Farewell worlde, foraſmuch
as in thy countrey there is litle
health: for ſome be lippers, and
ſome haue the French pockes:
ſome the Canker, and ſome the
<pb facs="tcp:10117:111"/>
goute: and ſome haue the foule
euil, and ſome the <hi>Sciatica,</hi> and
ſome the ſtone, and ſome <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidian</hi>
feuers: ſome wanderyng

feuers: ſpaſmes, paulſies, &amp; the
moſte parte ſicke offaire folly.</p>
            <p>Farewel worlde, foraſmuche
as there is not a manne in thy
houſe but he is noted with ſome
defaute in his perſon: For if
there be any talle man, the reſt
is lubberlike. If he haue a
fayre face, his iye ſhall be too
blacke: If he haue a good fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed,
it ſhalbe wrinkeled: If he
haue a welfauored mouthe, he
ſhall lacke teethe: If he haue
faire ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, he ſhal lacke faire
heer, And if he haue faire heer,
he ſhall haue a foule ſkynne.</p>
            <p>Farewel worlde, foraſmuch
<pb facs="tcp:10117:111"/>
as the inhabitau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes in thee are
ſo variable to maners and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicions,
that ſome will folowe
the court, ſome wil ſayle on the
ſea: and if one would be a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunt,
the other will be a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman:
If the one will be a
hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter, the other will be a fiſher:
If one wil gouerne a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other vnder prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>,
will pyll &amp; poll y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore people.</p>
            <p>Farewell worlde, for aſmuche
as in thy houſe there are none
that prepare themſelfes to liue,
and muche leſſe to dye: And yet
we ſee ſome die yong, and ſome
in middle age, ſome in old age,
ſome dye by ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gyng, and ſome
by drounyng: ſome dye for hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
&amp; ſome in eatyng, ſlepyng,
and reſtyng, and ſome or they
beware, and for the moſt parte
<pb facs="tcp:10117:112"/>
or they loke for death.</p>
            <p>Farewell worlde, foraſmuch
as we can neither knowe thy
diſpoſicion nor condicion: For
if one be wiſe, another is a fole:
If one be fyne, another is of a
groſſe witte: If one be valiant,
another is a coward: If one be
geuen to peace, another is ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious:
And if one be of a gentle
ſpirit, another is very froward.</p>
            <p>Farewell worlde, ſeyng no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
can liue with thee: for if a
man eate to lytle, he becommes
weake: if to muche, he waxeth
ſicke: if a man labour, ſtraite
he is wery: if he be idle, he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
beſtly: if he geue litle, he is
called a nigarde: if he geue
muche, he is called prodigal: if
a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> viſite his fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des often, he
is called importune: if to ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb facs="tcp:10117:112"/>
full of diſdaine: If a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſuffre wrong, he is called falſe
hearted: And if he do reuenge
then is he wilfull: If he haue
frendes, he is praiſed: If ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
he is purſued: if one tary
to long in a place, he waxeth
wery: and if he chaunge to oft,
he is grudged at. Finally, I
ſay, that ſuche thynges as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
me, I am forced to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe,
and that which I would,
I cannot come by.</p>
            <p>O worlde vncleane, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure
thee thou filthy worlde, I
pray O thou worlde, &amp; proteſt
againſt thee thou worlde, that
thou neuer haue part in me, for
I demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de nor deſire nothyng
that is in thee, neither hope of
