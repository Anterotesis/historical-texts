            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
People at and about
STAFFORD,
A Testimony for God and his Truth,
and against Deceit and Deceivers, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Hireling Priests, as a Warning, Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
&amp; Instruction in Righteousness, to
them (and all People elsewhere concerned)
by the Spirit of the Lord in his Suffering
Servant Thomas Taylor.</head>
            <opener>Hear, O People, and Fear; for the
LORD hath spoken:</opener>
            <p>THE false Teacher, the Hireling, who hath run and
God never sent him, but preaches for Hire and divines
for Money, can never profit your Souls, O people, at
all; but with their false Dreams, and lying Divinations, and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Sounds, they deceive your poor Souls: For what can the dead
words of a dead man (dead in Sins) raise up your dead Souls
from Death to Life: No, they cannot; they have no Life in
them; and such who have no spiritual Health for Soundness (by
their own Confession) in them, but are miserable Offenders, can
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55335:2"/>
they minister any healthful or sound Doctrine to your Souls; nay,
those cannot; for, what is their Chaff to the Wheat, their fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Words to the powerful Word of God; for, sow a Field
with Chaff, and what a Crop can you expect; but as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
saith, <hi>They sow the Wind, and reap the Whirlewind:</hi> So cease
from them, you that love God and your own Souls, and turn to
God: for I testifie for God, That the True Ministry, the Soul-saving
Ministry of Christ Jesus is not with the Parish-Hirelings
of these dayes; for neither their long black Robes, nor long
white Surplices, nor their humane Learning, nor the Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Man, men of like nature with themselves, doth any more
conduce to the making of them able Ministers of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
the Gospel of Christ, the Everlasting Covenant of God, than
the grey or brown Coat of the Plowman, or Artificer, or the
Skill of the Husbandman in Husbandry, or the Cunning of the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Worker in Wood, Brass or Iron doth furnish them for Gospel-service;
for the Vision of Gods Kingdom to all the world this day,
both wise and foolish, is like a Book sealed, as the Prophet saith,
which is given to the worldly wise to read, and he cannot read it,
because its seal'd; and to the foolish, and he cannot read it, because
he is unlearned, <hi>Isa.</hi> 29. 10, 11, 12. so though in the world there
is a difference betwixt the wise and foolish, yet as to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God there is none; for <hi>the wisdom of this world is foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10, &amp;c. for that which lieth hid from all
flesh, God reveals to his by his Spirit; for <hi>the Spirit searcheth all
things, yea the deep things of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6, 7, 8. And people,
the time of quickening and raising up of many that were dead in
sins is come again, after a long Night of Darkness, and the dead
this day hear the Voice of the Son of God (not of vain man)
and they that hear do live, <hi>John</hi> 5. 25. so people, look to your
Souls; for though your Parish-Teachers, who preach for Hire,
and divine for Money, and love to go in their long &amp; white Robes,
do boast of their being come out of <hi>Popery,</hi> yet upon the <hi>Popish</hi>
Maintenance of Tythes, Glebe-lands, Easter Reckonings, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuaries,
and Monies for preaching over and burying the Dead,
and such like things they live and make a Prey upon, not willing
to come to Christ (to this day) as the first <hi>Christians</hi> did, for a
thorow Reformation; and so, not a little, but a great deal of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55335:2"/>
old, sowr, <hi>popish</hi> Leven being yet found amongst them, both in
Doctrine and Practice; how should their whole lump but be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sowr? as appears by their Fruits, and the Fruits of such as
follow them: and so, for witnessing in Christ against them for
these evil things I suffer Imprisonment; yet for God's Mercy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling
me thereunto I rejoyce, and can truly from my heart praise
the Lord, that hath deliver'd my Soul from that horrible Pit, that
these ungodly men yet remain in, and will not be helped out of.</p>
            <p>And people of <hi>Stafford,</hi> for your sakes it was that the Lord
by my Mouth rebuked the <hi>Hireling,</hi> that you might not always
be deceived and kept in death with such Dreamers; but that you
might turn to the Lord God, from all such, to know his <hi>word</hi> and
<hi>spirit,</hi> that made you, in you, to teach you, and to lead your Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Souls to the Springs of living Waters; for you have too
long dwelt in the <hi>wilderness of sin, ignorance and unbelief,</hi> and now
it is high time for you to repent, and come to know the Baptism
of the holy Ghost &amp; Fire, which is Christ's proper Baptism, <hi>Mat.</hi>
3. 10, 11, 12. for, alas! you have but hitherto been carried on
by the <hi>Pharisees</hi> in the outward shadows and figures of things,
which reach not the soul, to purifie and perfect it unto God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd
therefore is the Lord come in mighty Power this day, to break
in sunder all the graven Images of the people, whether under the
Profession of the <hi>Popish</hi> or <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion; for the Lord is
on his Throne, to make all things new again, as in the beginning,
when all the sons of God in holiness sung for Joy, and rejoyced
in the Lord, for the blessed victory they had got through the
Blood of the Lamb over all their souls Enemies.</p>
            <p>But Wo and Alas for you, the poor people of <hi>Stafford,</hi> and
of many other places, who are under the Teachings of worldly-minded
men, miserable Offenders, like your selves, always doing
what ye should not do, &amp; leaving undone what ye should do, &amp; so
without all spiritual health, in the <hi>miserable captivity</hi> of sin; my soul
mourns for you, &amp; my Sufferings are for you, &amp; my soul prays for
you, that you may be recover'd out of the snare of your souls <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
by which ye are led captive at his will; for many days &amp; years
hath my soul mourned for you, and been oppressed, and the Lord
hath called to you early and late to <hi>Repent,</hi> and <hi>lay things to heart;</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:55335:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but, O the hardness of many of your hearts, and the carelesness
of the rest! O, why will ye dye? why will ye linger, and remain
still in spiritual <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> where the Witnesses lay slain,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 11? So whilst ye have time, prize it, lest the Lord lay you
upon a Bed of Sorrows, where no Ease is, and say unto you in his
Wrath, <hi>I gave them time to Repent, and they Repented not.</hi>

in any measure, and yet in your Ignorance
are seeking the Living among the Dead, the Living
God in Dead Observations, which by Tradition you

<hi>That he that was dead is now alive, and lives for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
more, and is ascended for above all Heavens, and out

with his holy Substance:</hi> And as in former days <hi>he gave
some Apostles, some Prophets, some Evangelists, and some
Pastors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints,
for the Work of the Ministry, for the edifying of the Body
of Christ, till we all</hi> (saith the Apos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Body not the Body of Sinful Earthly Flesh) <hi>come
in the Unity of the Faith, and the Knowledge of the Son of
God, to a perfect Man, unto the Measure of the Stature
and fulness of Christ,</hi> Ephes. 4. 11, 12, 13. Even
so the Lord is now giving forth of his Spirit to his
Children, born of his Spirit, for enabling them in
this Day of the Restitution of all things, for the Work
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55335:3"/>
of the Ministry, for the perfecting of the Saints, and
fitting them for Glory; and this now after a long
Night of Darkness and Desolation, is to the Praise
of his Glory, who hath made us in this his blessed Day,
as he did his Faithful Followers in the Beginning, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
in the Beloved, to shew forth his Praises to Ages to
come, whom he will also raise up by Christ Jesus, together
with us, to magnifie his Mercies for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that the Parish Teachers of these times, who
<hi>Preach for Hire,</hi> and <hi>Divine for Money,</hi> loving to be
called of Men <hi>Master;</hi> and like the <hi>Pharisees</hi> of old,
<hi>love to go in Long Robes, and receive Honour one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
John</hi> 5. are such, to wit, so given of Christ, and
begifted from Heaven, and fitted for so great a Work,
as to perfect the Saints, as those before (in <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4)
mentioned were, I utterly deny, and their Fruits, as
also the Fruits of their Hearers make manifest that
they are of another Sort, Seed and Generation, even
such as the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> speaks of and declares
against, <hi>who have run, and God never sent them;</hi> For
why? they waited not for the Word of God to speak
in them and by them, <hi>but stole the Words from their
Neighbour, and used their Tongues to say, The Lord saith,
when the Lord never spoke by them,</hi> (Jer. 23. 30.) <hi>and
therefore, saith the Lord, these Teachers shall not profit
the People at all</hi> (Vers. 32.) <hi>For what are their Chaffy
Words to the Word of God?</hi> (Vers. 28.) So the <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Parishes</hi> this day get into the <hi>Pulpit</hi> with the
Words of the Prophets and Apostles in their <hi>Hand,</hi>
and Sin in their <hi>Hearts,</hi> as those other did, dreaming
over them for Filthy Luere, &amp; cry to the People, <hi>BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOVED,</hi>
(yea, <hi>Beloved,</hi> because they put into their
Mouths) <hi>Hear the Word of the Lord, as you shall find it writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55335:4"/>
in such a Chapter, and such a Verse,</hi> when the Lord
never spoke to these <hi>Hirelings,</hi> nor sent them thus to
preach, but they are <hi>Men made Ministers, Men of the
Evil world, and great Lovers and Pleaders for it, and
therefore the world hears them,</hi> 1 John 4. 5. But the
true Messenger of Christ saith for himself and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<hi>We are of God, and the whole world lieth in Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness.</hi>
And saith Christ to his Disciples, <hi>Ye are not of
the World, as I am not of the World; for if you were of the
World, the World would love you; for the World loves
its own; but now I have chosen you out of the World,
therefore the World hates you,</hi> John 15. 18, 19.</p>
            <p>So all people fear the Lord God; for the Name of
<hi>Christians,</hi> without the Nature of Christ, will do you
no good at all; for the Lord is come to search all that
called <hi>Christendom</hi> with Candles, and to pull down
the lofty Hearts and Looks of all amongst them called
<hi>Christians</hi> first, and then of all the World besides; for
now is the Lord exalting his great Name over all, as
in the Beginning, before the Antichrist, Beast, False
Prophet and Whore got up; and who shall stop the
Passage of this mighty <hi>Jehovah,</hi> in the great Work
of setting up his Kingdom over all the Kingdoms of
the Man of Sin, that the Kingdoms of this World
may become the Kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ,
whose Right alone it is to Rule and Reign, according
to that Saying in the Prophet, <hi>I will Overturn, Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
Overturn, till he come to Rule whose Right it is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now Wo and Misery begins to take hold of all
Hypocrites, and all the Wicked, because of the ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and appearing of the great God from Heaven
this day, who is on his Throne, judging in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
and in Righteousness making War, whose
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55335:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Fiery Word, his Two-edged Sword, goes out of his
Mouth, not only to discover, but also to destroy and
consume the <hi>Man of Sin</hi> in all the Earth. And now
the <hi>Hireling Teachers</hi> of all sorts, the Merchants of
<hi>Mystery Babylon,</hi> shall cry, <hi>Alas! alas! that great City,
People begin to see us, and they will not trade with us, nor
buy our Merchandize, as in former dayes, but declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it;</hi> see <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 10, 11. O, yea; it cannot be
otherwise; for now the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> that lay slain in
the Streets of the great City, <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
so called, are arisen, and stand upon their Feet,
<hi>praised be God.</hi> And now Judgment is given to the
Saints of the Most High God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 12, 25, 26, 27.
So that though the great <hi>Antichrist,</hi> under many <hi>shapes</hi>
and <hi>appearances,</hi> ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

him, his Dominion shall be consumed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
and the Saints of the Most High God shall
have Dominion, and Reign with Christ, whose King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is an Everlasting Kingdom, and all Dominions
shall serve and obey him, <hi>to wit,</hi> our Lord Jesus Christ,
for whose blessed Name and Truth's sake, the Holy
Tremblers, who Tremble at his Word, and follow
him in the Regeneration, do this day suffer; it is so.</p>
