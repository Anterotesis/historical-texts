            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough the <hi>Jews</hi> inveterate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy againſt the Truth, hath juſtly render'd them the object of the Divine Diſpleaſure; yet their Primitive Anceſtry, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Privileges, ought ſtill to ſecure them a great meaſure of Regard. For this people, if any under heaven, may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glory of the Antiquity and Nobleſs of their Deſcent. There being no Nation can prove its Pedegree by ſuch clear and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentique Heraldry as the <hi>Jews.</hi> For though a ridiculous Vanity hath tempted ſome to date their Original before that of the <hi>world,</hi> and others with great aſſurance have made themſelves ſprung from their own Soil; yet the <hi>Jews,</hi> by an unqueſtionable Diſplay through all periods ſince the Creation, can prove their Deſcent from the firſt man. So that all other
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59218:6"/>
Nations muſt have recourſe to the Jewiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, to clear their Genealogies, and atteſt their Linage.</p>
            <p>And indeed their Progeny would be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently renowned if it were derived no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than whither their preſent Appellation doth entitle them. For the <hi>Jews</hi> have their Name from <hi>Judah (Jacob</hi>'s fourth ſon by his wife <hi>Leah</hi>) who notwithſtanding the degeneracy of his Deſcendents, was a Prince of a brave Nature and great Eloquence. An Eſſay of the former we finde in his endeavour to have ſaved his brother <hi>Joſeph</hi>; and it was a fair intimation of the later, that he was choſen Orator to his Brethren. Over whom he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a Soveraignty, and from whoſe Loins many Princes, Generals, States-men and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets have deſcended. And what is yet more remarkable, to <hi>Judah</hi> was made the famous Promiſe, <hi>That the Scepter ſhould not depart from his Tribe, nor a Law-giver from between his feet, until</hi> Shiloh <hi>came.</hi> Though I am not ignorant how it is the Opinion of ſome learned men, that the continuance of the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Soveraign Power, was not ſo fixed in <hi>Judah</hi>'s <hi>family,</hi> as to exclude all the reſt. For at leaſt after the Captivity, there were ſeveral of the other Tribes who attain'd to Kingly Honour among the <hi>Jews.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they underſtand <hi>Jacob's</hi> prediction of the whole <hi>Hebrew Nation,</hi> which he foreſaw in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59218:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
proceſs of time would derive their Name from <hi>Judah</hi>; and that they ſhould never to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally looſe the viſible Being of a Kingdom or Common-Wealth, or all form of Government among themſelves, until the coming of <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loh,</hi> or the Manifeſtation of <hi>Meſſiah</hi> in the fleſh. And we find the truth hereof abundantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted by the event. For notwithſtanding that the form and ſtate of the Jewiſh Government was often changed, its luſtre obſcured, and its puiſſance and Grandeur leſſen'd and impaired; yet they were never totally without a Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter till they were intirely brought under the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> yoke; which hapned about the time of our Saviour's Nativity, and a little after his Crucifixion. When the <hi>unbelieving Jews</hi> were ſo altogether inſlaved by the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they retain'd not the leaſt footſtep of a <hi>free State,</hi> but the Kingdom was utterly taken from them. And though this ought to be reckon'd for a Miſery in their Fortune, yet it was no debaſement in their Genealogy. For <hi>Affliction</hi> (according to the <hi>Jews</hi> own ſaying) <hi>may be a very great inconvenience, but no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if from the <hi>Jews Anceſtry</hi> we look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their <hi>Primitive Religion,</hi> they will be found to be no leſs <hi>happy</hi> in this, than <hi>honourable</hi> in the other. For it immediately (as all true Religion) had God for its Author, and was atteſted by ſuch numerous and apparent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,

as made its truth unqueſtionable, and the people (to whom it was firſt revealed) formidable, among all to whom the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof did arrive. And though for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years the <hi>Jews</hi> have been moſt vile adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of that Religion which was delivered them in greateſt purity, yet it muſt needs be reckon'd for no ordinary priviledge of the <hi>Hebrew Nation,</hi> to have received <hi>the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the World,</hi> and that too immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from the <hi>Almighty,</hi> and compriſed in a Breviary of <hi>Ten Words,</hi> containing an exact Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of Holineſs and Vertue, and more true Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom than all the Volumes that ever ſince have been Compiled by meer <hi>humane induſtry and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And together with this <hi>excellent Religion</hi> (which they have ſo foully depraved) they received <hi>other Priviledges</hi> of no inferiour concernment: for not only the <hi>Adoption, Covenants</hi> and <hi>Promiſes</hi> did firſt belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but alſo <hi>from their Fathers, as concerning the fleſh,</hi> Meſſiah <hi>came.</hi> And when we have cloth'd their <hi>preſent infidelity</hi> with the moſt aggravating Circumſtances, yet we muſt confeſs our ſelves beholden to them for the preſervation of that ineſtimable Jewel, <hi>The knowledge of the one true God,</hi> when the reſt of mankind was involved in the belief and adoration of many falſe Deities.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>Jews</hi> likewiſe we ſtand obliged for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59218:7"/>
the Original Hiſtory of the Creation, and that with indubitable integrity they have delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to us the infallible Memoires of all thoſe paſſages which hapned before and after the Deluge. Of which the faint glimpſes, retain'd by other Nations, were wrapt up in <hi>Stories ſo notoriouſly fabulous,</hi> that they were fitter to evidence the vanity of the Pagan Rhapſodies, than to confirm a Truth of ſo great an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Now ſeeing that they have been the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of ſo many benefits to the reſt of Mankind, they ought to be the matter of our thankful Reflection, and not of our obloquy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</p>
            <p>Nor have we been leſs benefited by their <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable miſeries,</hi> than <hi>matchleſs priviledges</hi>: ſeeing that their <hi>fall</hi> was our <hi>riſe,</hi> and their <hi>diminution</hi> our <hi>riches.</hi> But <hi>if the cutting off of the Jews (the natural branches</hi> in St. <hi>Paul</hi>) was the occaſion that the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> like Ciens <hi>were grafted in their place</hi>; and becauſe of their pride, contumacy and unbelief God hath dealt thus ſeverely with them, we ought not therefore to inſult over their <hi>Infidelity,</hi> but haſten their <hi>Converſion</hi>; not to triumph in their <hi>down-fall,</hi> but to labour their <hi>reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Being aſcertain'd, that if they abandon their obſtinacy and unbelief, God will revoke their Rejection, and receive them again into favour.

            <argument>
               <p>The preſent Condition of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary;</hi> their Places of Reſidence, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, Apparel, Stature and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, &amp;c.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>WHen I looked into the great number of <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Barbary,</hi> and ſaw how they were lorded over by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious and haughty <hi>Moor,</hi> I could not but reſent their Condition, and wiſh their Deliverance from that direful imprecation, <hi>His blood be upon us and our Children.</hi> One effect whereof may be ſeen in their preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition under the <hi>Moreſco</hi> Government; which is no other then a better ſort of ſlavery. For even in thoſe places where they have permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to inhabit, they are not only Tributary, but upon every ſmall diſguſt, in danger of Eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Inſomuch that they cannot promiſe to themſelves either any durable Settlement or Security. Indeed their calmeſt ſtate is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſtormy; and when they ſeem to enjoy the greateſt peace, they are vilely Hector'd by the <hi>Moors,</hi> againſt whom they dare not move a finger, or wag a tongue in their own defence
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59218:9"/>
and vindication; but with a Stoical patience ſupport all the Injuries and Contumelies to which they are dayly expoſed. For in the midſt of the greateſt abuſes, you ſhall never ſee a <hi>Jew</hi> with an angry countenance, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing concern'd; which cannot be imputed to any Heroick Temper in this People, but rather to their cuſtomary ſuffering, being born and Educated in this kind of ſlavery. By reaſon whereof, they were never acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the ſentiments of an ingenuous and manly Uſage. It is very common with the <hi>Moreſco</hi>-Boys to rally together, and by way of paſtime and divertiſement, to beat the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Children: which later, though they ſhould far exceed the former in numbers and age, yet dare not give them the leaſt reſiſtance or oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Moors</hi> permit not the <hi>Jews</hi> the poſſeſſion of any warlike Weapons, unleſs in point of Trade. And herein they do not ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain, as gratifie their diſpoſition; for they ſeem generally inclined to a great averſeneſs to every thing that is Military: being as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of true Courage, as good Nature. Nor doth this their cowardly humour at all render them unfit for the Muſters of their expected <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> for though they believe that his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance ſhall be Warlike, and that he ſhall lead all their Enemies Captive, and triumph in the Spoils of <hi>Eſau</hi>; yet they imagine there
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59218:9"/>
ſhall be ſuch a general ſurrender of the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> that there will need no Valour by dint of Sword to ſubdue them: and that this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting themſelves to his rod, ſhall be an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Teſtimony of the truth of his coming.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Barbary</hi> generally decline living in the Country, not out of any diſlike of a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Converſation, but becauſe it doth not yield ſufficient opportunities and ſafety for Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique. For this being their general Profeſſion, they can with more convenience and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage manage it (as we ſay) in good Towns: And in theſe they live in a heap, ſeldom (or not at all, if it be in their power to avoid it) mingling with the <hi>Moors.</hi> And the Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Town where they have permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to inhabit, is from them Called the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deria,</hi> or <hi>Jury</hi>; which in ſome places in <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary</hi> is ſo contrived, that the <hi>Moors</hi> can lock it up at night.</p>
            <p>Merchandize is their common Profeſſion, wherein they are notoriouſly dextrous and thriving. And as their Dexterity may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to their continual practice in Trade, ſo their Thriving therein to their Frugality in living. For both in Diet and Clothes, they ſeem to deſign nothing but Suſtenance and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering. And in this plain and frugal way of living, they greatly ſymbolize with the <hi>Moors,</hi> who (as I have obſerved in another Diſcourſe) take no care for ſumptuouſneſs or delicacy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59218:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>When 'tis ſaid that <hi>Merchandize</hi> is the <hi>Jews</hi> general Profeſſion in <hi>Barbary,</hi> it is not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude their darling <hi>Brokage</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury,</hi> in which they are very ſerviceable both to <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Moors.</hi> And indeed the latter do ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome uſe them for any other purpoſes, unleſs in ſending them upon hazardous Meſſages, or to Collect their Maritime Impoſts, in which they know them to be more exacting than any elſe they can imploy.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the <hi>Moors</hi> entertain but a very mean eſteem of this people, being taught by Tradition, which age hath made Authentique, that they are an <hi>anomalous iſſue,</hi> and not like other men deſcended from <hi>Adam</hi>; and that the end of their Being was to ſerve the <hi>Muſulmin</hi>: which Opinion the <hi>Jews</hi> ſufficiently deride, and give it no other confutation, but the citing of <hi>Oba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diah,</hi> which Propheſie they wholly apply to their Condition, upon the coming of their <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> when <hi>all Edom,</hi> that is, all Mankind who are not of their Religion, ſhall become their <hi>Hewers of Wood, and Drawers of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing which I promiſed to remark concerning the <hi>Jews,</hi> is their Apparel, in which thoſe who have been born and bred up in <hi>Barbary,</hi> differ little from the <hi>Moors.</hi> For firſt, they wear little black brimleſs Caps, as the <hi>Moors</hi> red; which they ſeldom move in greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another. They likewiſe, as the <hi>Moors,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59218:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
go ſlipſhod, and wear linnen Drawers and Veſt, over which they put a looſe Garment, called a <hi>Ganephe,</hi> which differs only in colour from the <hi>Mandilion,</hi> or <hi>Albornoz,</hi> which the <hi>Moors</hi> beſtow upon the Chriſtians when they are redeemed from ſlavery. This <hi>Ganephe</hi> is a black ſquare piece of courſe Hair-ſtuff, cloſed at the croſs corners, and all round it is a large Thrum, which at firſt ſight looks like their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Fringes, whereof we ſhall have occaſion in due time and place to diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> in this <hi>Continent</hi> much reſemble the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and <hi>Portuguez</hi> in their Stature and Complexion, but are much different in their nature and diſpoſition, as being more flexible and ſequacious, eſpecially in things whereby they may reap advantage. In point of Civil Government, they indifferently ſubmit to any that is able to ſecure their Intereſt; and boggle at no ſervile obeyſance that may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to their worldly ends. They are not peremptory in intitling themſelves to any pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Tribes, yet they generally believe that they are the remains of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a few among them of the Family of <hi>Levi:</hi> whom they conceive to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully preſerved, that they might not be deſtitute of competent perſons to officiate in the Synagogues.</p>
            <p>There are not any to be found among them who publickly own the <hi>Samaritan Schiſm,</hi> in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59218:11"/>
rejecting all books of Scripture, but the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch</hi> of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Of which Sect there were ſome not long ſince (ſaith a great Traveller) who worſhipt a <hi>Calf</hi> at <hi>Sichem,</hi> or <hi>Neapolis.</hi> Nor are there any to be met with who adhere to the <hi>Old Bible,</hi> without <hi>Talmud-Traditions.</hi> There are likewiſe none among them who are known by the peculiar Denomination of any Sect, ſuch as were the <hi>Aſſideans, Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, Sadduces, Eſſenes,</hi> or <hi>Gaulonitae</hi> of old. For however their private judgments may diſpoſe them, yet they are careful to preſerve an outward Unanimity in their Religion; and are ſignally vigilant to avoid Diviſions, as looking upon thoſe among Chriſtian Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, to be an Argument againſt the truth of the things they profeſs. And that the differences in matters of Religion, which are ſo offenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſible among Chriſtians, may be reckon'd for one impediment of the <hi>Jews</hi> Converſion, we may in another place have occaſion to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>

               <p>The Moral Converſation of the <hi>Barbary-Jews:</hi> the ingredients of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; their backwardneſs to Diſputes: their Creed, occaſion, Author; with a ſhort Paraphraſe thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>REſearching in the <hi>Converſation</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> here treated of, it ſeem'd to be very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and agreeable to the Laws of a well-civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized conduct: For ſetting aſide the <hi>Artifices of Commerce,</hi> and <hi>Colluſions of Trade,</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be charged with any of thoſe Debauches which are grown into reputation with whole Nations of Chriſtians, to the ſcandal and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of their Name and Profeſſion. Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Adultry, Drunkenneſs, Gluttony, Pride of Apparel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſo far from being in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt with them, that they are ſcandalized at their frequent practice in Chriſtians: And out of a malitious inſinuation, are ſorry to hear that any of their Nation ſhould give a Name to, and die for a people of ſuch Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>But how commendable ſoever they may be for their <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Temperance,</hi> and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59218:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other domeſtique obſervances, yet that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ought to be chiefly Orthodox, they are the moſt erroneous, namely their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. For however they may pretend the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> or that ſort of Religion and Worſhip which they now profeſs, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the <hi>Law and Prophets</hi>; Yet to thoſe who duely conſider the ingredients thereof, it will appear to be patcht up of the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the <hi>Maſters,</hi> and the Opinions of <hi>old Philoſophers</hi>; which are indeed ſo artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially interwoven with <hi>Scripture,</hi> that this laſt to an unwary Surveyor may ſtill ſeem to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant. The truth of which aſſertion will be manifeſted when we report the particulars of their Religion. But whatever it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of, there is but ſmall hope, as things now ſtand, to have it Reformed: for the <hi>Bible,</hi> the Rule of all Reformation, though it be not denyed the <hi>Peoples Reading,</hi> yet the giving the <hi>ſenſe</hi> thereof belongs only to the <hi>Maſters,</hi> in whoſe interpretation of the Text, the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar upon pain of Excommunication are bound to acquieſce. And this was told me as an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canum Judaiſmi</hi> by <hi>Rabbi Aaron Ben-Netas,</hi> a perſon not unlearned in their Law, and one who wanted nothing but Chriſtianity to render him acceptable to equal Eſteemers; to whoſe free Communication I owe many of theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks.</p>
            <p>Though theſe <hi>Jews</hi> are ſufficiently taught
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59218:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to <hi>Evade</hi> all thoſe Scriptures which relate to the Truth and Eſtabliſhment of <hi>Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> yet they are not forward to enter into <hi>Diſputes</hi> concerning them. And if it ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that they are forced thereunto, they will not be confined to the <hi>Laws</hi> of Diſputation, but uſually confront Text with Text, and never directly anſwer the Objection, but ſet up another againſt it. But as to their decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Diſputes about Religion, it ſeems very wary and prudent; for when any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is the matter controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they are generally ſo fiery and cholerick, that they cannot refrain from an ill-bred rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and thoſe blaſphemous contumelies, which are even deteſtable to common Ingenuity and Candour, are uſually vented by the <hi>Jews</hi> in their arguings about the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> Againſt which they are train'd up in an unmanly hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie: it being a part of their firſt Inſtitution, to imbibe a <hi>malitious prejudice</hi> againſt <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> And the better to manage this <hi>ill ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning,</hi> there is not a paſſage of the <hi>Old Bible</hi> any way relating to the proof of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>'s being already come, but it is ſo perverted by the Gloſſes of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> that the common people are not able to arrive its genuine intent and meaning. And what is more obſervable, and not leſs to be deplored, even the <hi>meaner ſort</hi> are ſo verſed in theſe <hi>ſpurious gloſſes,</hi> that ſcarce any can be met with who is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59218:13"/>
of one evaſion or other, to elude the plaineſt Text that proves the Advent of Chriſt to be already paſt. Nor need it be matter of wonder to hear that the very <hi>common Jews</hi> are ſo well ſkilled in what we now ſpeak of; ſeeing that it is the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>laſt</hi> of all their Inſtruction, to <hi>underſtand</hi> and <hi>defend</hi> their Religion, in a direct <hi>oppoſition</hi> to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</p>
            <p>And the better to facilitate the peoples <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi> of their Religion, and to prevent the dangers that may accrew by leaving them to the hazardous Toil of <hi>Collecting their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> out of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Maſters,</hi> they are provided with two Syſtems or Abridgments thereof; the one containing the Rule of their <hi>Actions,</hi> to wit, their book of Affirmative and Negative Precepts; the other the ſubſtance of their <hi>Faith,</hi> or the things to be <hi>believed,</hi> namely their <hi>Creed</hi>: which conſiſts of thirteen Articles, and commonly called, <hi>Sepher Ikka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim,</hi> or <hi>the Book of Fundamentals.</hi> They greatly glory in the immemorial Tradition of this <hi>Creed,</hi> and of the joynt agreement in the meaning thereof, ever ſince they were a people. 'Tis true, the committing of it to writing they grant to be but of a late date; and that <hi>Moſes Ben-Maimon</hi> (a <hi>Corduba-Jew,</hi> who died about the 1104 of Grace) foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dangers that would hardly be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the preſent Diſperſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:59218:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which might come upon a meer <hi>Oral Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of (ſo great a <hi>Depoſitum</hi>) their <hi>Creed,</hi> cauſed it to be enſured in <hi>writing</hi>; and in this condition it now remains.

            <p>Now becauſe this <hi>Creed</hi> is the ſum of the <hi>preſent Judaiſm,</hi> we will here inſert it, with the common and received ſenſe and meaning of every Article.</p>

               <p>In theſe thirteen Articles are compriſed the <hi>Jews Credenda,</hi> wherein they exhort and oblige all of their Communion to live and die, as they hope for any comfort in the <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

State.</hi> And notwithſtanding that many of theſe Articles may be capable of a good conſtruction, yet according to the preſent received interpretation thereof among the <hi>Jews,</hi> they are not ſo much a ſyſtem of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm, as a cuning and malitious contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſtianity. And the ſuttle <hi>Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam</hi> (who is ſaid to have firſt committed them to writing) ſeems rather to have deſigned the <hi>Jews</hi> confirmation in an ill opinion of the Chriſtian, than any inſtruction in their own Religion. And that they might imbibe a more implacable hatred againſt the Chriſtian Faith, the crafty <hi>Rabbi</hi> ſo compoſed (for he is thought to have been the Author there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) the <hi>Jews</hi> Creed, that it might one way or other wholly confront the Chriſtians. Not doubting but that they would hardly be induced to embrace a Religion, which they ſaw was ſo greatly oppoſite to that of their firſt Catechiſm, and wherein from their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy they had been taught to expect an happy immortality.</p>
               <p>Now this which we may ſuppoſe was but the Deſign of <hi>Maimonides,</hi> is become the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral practice of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Barbary.</hi> For I have heard from one (whoſe underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Religion had got him the Title of a Maſter,) That there was not an Article of their Faith which they did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand in a ſenſe wholly oppoſite to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59218:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And taking a freedom to rail at our Religion (in which they are all well gifted) he inſtanced in the Eleventh Article, as ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bear the leaſt ill-will to Chriſtianity, and from thence warmly beat down all thoughts of Redemption; with great aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance proteſting, That he would have none to pay his debts, nor any but himſelf to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy divine juſtice for his ſins: That he did not expect the felicity of the next world up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of any Merits but his own: That he was certain whoſoever lived pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and kept the Law, could not miſs of being happy: or arriving the bliſs to come upon his own leggs.

               <p>But wiſhing this poor obſtinate people an happy reſcue from ſuch impious thoughts, I ſhall cloſe up this Chapter with obſerving, that the <hi>Jews</hi> give their Creed a double note of Reſpect above any other part of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

            <head>CHAP. III.</head>
            <argument>
               <p> The <hi>Barbary-Jews</hi> Opinion of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Angels, ſeveral States of the Soul, the Law, Merit, Purgatory, Reſurrection, laſt Judgment, end of the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>NOtwithſtanding that the <hi>Jews</hi> are very unanimous in the literal Profeſſion of the ſame Fundamentals, yet they are not ſo well agreed in any Expoſition thereof, as that which moſt oppoſeth Chriſtianity. That the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Barbary</hi> are in many things differing from the ſentiments of the <hi>Jews</hi> in other parts of the world, and that too in points of no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour concernment, may be ſeen in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing particulars.</p>
            <p>And in the firſt place, both the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> accord in exploding the Trinity, which they look upon as an Hypochondriacal ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of the Chriſtians, whom they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of Polytheiſm, out of an ignorant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that we make every Perſon of the bleſſed Trinity a diſtinct Deity. Nor are they more malitious and blind in the utter denyal of the bleſſed Trinity, than extravagant in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59218:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their opinions concerning the Angels. 'Tis true, they all accord in dividing them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Natures and Imployments, into good and bad. The good Angels (they ſay) are imployed in Meſſages of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as were thoſe who brought <hi>Abraham</hi> the glad Tydings of his Wives Conception and time of Childbirth. Other Angels (they hold) are ſent upon Errands of Deſtruction; and they commonly place the inſtance in thoſe who came to <hi>Sodom.</hi> They likewiſe opine that there is another rank of Angels, to whom is committed the protection and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of particular perſons; and they give an example in the Angel which appeared with the three Children in the Babylonian Furnace.</p>
            <p>But beſide theſe more general Objects of the Angels Imployment, the <hi>Jews</hi> allot two of them to every individual perſon of their own Nation. Whereof one is a good Angel, and ſtands at the right hand of every <hi>Jew,</hi> to regiſter his good Actions, and to ſet down the particulars wherein he doth well. And at the left hand of the ſame <hi>Jew</hi> ſtands a bad Angel, and keeps an account of whatſoever he doth amiſs. And when the <hi>Jew</hi> dies, theſe Angels bring in accounts of all that he hath done when alive. And the good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel pleads in behalf of the deceaſed the good deeds, as the bad Angel doth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59218:20"/>
And according to the accounts theſe two Angels give in of his behaviour, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted <hi>Jew</hi> is puniſht or rewarded by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of Angels appointed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>But not only two Angels are thus allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to every one of the Jewiſh Religion, but alſo (according to the Doctrine of the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Jews</hi>) there is a diſtinct Order of Angels which is intruſted with the Care and Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of the whole <hi>Hebrew Nation,</hi> and who are always ready to prevent thoſe who would hurt them; like that Angel who would not let <hi>Balaam</hi> curſe their Fore-fathers, when <hi>Balak</hi> had ſent for him to that end.</p>
            <p>They hold likewiſe that every Governor has an Angel to aſſiſt him in Governing the people, and another to ſuggeſt to him what will be happy or otherwiſe. For they think it to exceed the power of one and the ſame Angel to aſſiſt the publick Magiſtrate both in the Counſel and Execution of what is fit. And the reaſon of this Opinion is chiefly drawn from the difficulty of right Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the various humours of <hi>the many.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are ſo liberal of the Angels ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that they proſtitute it to meaner Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces than can well be mention'd. For there is ſcarce any thing done among them in which they do not intereſs the Miniſtry of thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Spirits.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:59218:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>Next to Angels they place rational Souls, to which they aſſign a fourfold State. The firſt is that in which they were created. For they are ſtrongly of opinion that all Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Souls were created at once, and placed in a certain Region, whence, as out of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Store-houſe, the ſeveral bodies in their proper times are furniſhed, as they are ready to receive them. And if the Souls offend in this State, their puniſhment is to be ſent into infirm and unhealthy Bodies. And this pre-exiſtence of Souls they chiefly found in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4.3.</p>
            <p>The ſecond State of the Soul is that of its Conjunction with the Body, which they eſteem no better than an Impriſonment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it lives as a Bird in a Cage, and where it contracts that pollution which is afterward to be cleanſed in Purgatory.</p>
            <p>The third State of the Soul is that of its Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the Body, wherein it continues until the final Sentence, and is happy or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe according to what it has done in the body. And when at the Reſurrection the Souls are again united to their Bodies, then they enter into their fourth and laſt State, which is as durable as Eternity.</p>
            <p>Their next ſingularity of Opinion reſpects the Law of Nature, which alone they affirm to be obligatory of all Mankind. And to thoſe who obſerve this Law, they promiſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59218:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the <hi>World to come,</hi> which (in the phraſe of the preſent <hi>Jews</hi>) is all one with <hi>Eternal life.</hi> But when the <hi>Jews</hi> grant this hope to all Mankind, yet they reſerve a peculiar priviledge to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to whom alone God gave the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi>; to whoſe due obſervers there belongs a greater <hi>Glory</hi> &amp; <hi>Happineſs</hi> than to any other.</p>
            <p>There are ſome who have imagined that this Opinion of the <hi>Jews</hi> concerning the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal poſſibility of being ſaved by the <hi>Law,</hi> doth favour their fancy, who maintain an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency in the external profeſſion of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that a man without ſcandal may joyn himſelf to the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of the place he reſides in. And this Opinion was by ſome <hi>Beaux E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprits</hi> of <hi>France</hi> zealouſly promoted, till it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Learned Confutation by Sieur <hi>Moſes Amyraldus,</hi> a late <hi>Profeſſor</hi> in <hi>Saumur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the practice of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Barbary</hi> ſets them far diſtant to any ſuch conceit, there being no people under Heaven more averſe to communicate in the Rites of other Nations than they. And if they could have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the opinion of Indifferency, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated themſelves to the Religion of the Places and Countries where they came to reſide, the <hi>Jews</hi> might have obviated many exiles and penalties to which a contrary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream hath ſo long and often expoſed them.</p>
            <p>And yet it cannot be denyed but that there are ſeveral <hi>Jews</hi> who make uſe of a ſcandalous
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59218:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
complyance in this particular. Of which ſort are many of thoſe who coming within the cognizance and power of the Papal Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can joyn themſelves to a Crucifix and Roſary, as well as to the <hi>Zizith</hi> and <hi>Tephil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim.</hi> And I am aſſured that ſome <hi>Jews</hi> have have gone herein ſo far as to enter into Holy Orders, and the profeſſion of a <hi>Religious life,</hi> who yet coming to places where the <hi>Jews</hi> have publick Toleration have joyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Synagogue.</p>
            <p>And of this we have a very late inſtance of two <hi>Jews</hi> who in <hi>Spain</hi> having for ſeveral years profeſſed the Religion of Saint <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nique,</hi> coming to <hi>Legorn</hi> in their Fryar Habits they inſtantly changed their Cowle for a Ganephe, and of idle Fryers became prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <hi>Jews.</hi> Another <hi>Jew</hi> (of my acquaintance, who for about five years had Studied Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick at <hi>Saragoza</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi>) being aſked how he could comply with the Religion, he mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily made this reply, <hi>That his complyance was only the work of his Nerves and Muſcles, and that his Anatomy told him nothing of the heart was therein concerned.</hi> Another <hi>Jew</hi> who in <hi>Malaga</hi> counterfeited Chriſtianity ſo well as to be intruſted with the Sale of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, having made a good Market thereof in <hi>Spain,</hi> came with what he had left to a Chriſtian City in <hi>Barbary,</hi> where his Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences being all bought up by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59218:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
others of the Papal perſwaſion, he declared his Religion. The Papiſts who had bought his Indulgences impeach him to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor for a <hi>Cheat,</hi> and clamour to have him pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht according to demerit. The <hi>Jew</hi> plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Laws of the free Port, that he had neither imported nor ſold any thing but his profeſſed Merchandiſe, and therefore deſired (and obtained) the Liberty and Priviledges of ſuch as traffick'd to that Port. I report no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but matter of perſonal knowledge.</p>
            <p>That there are many ſuch Temporizing <hi>Jews,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> I have been aſſured from their own mouths: and what is more obſervable, ſome have ventured to affirm that there want not <hi>Jews</hi> among the very Judges of the Inquiſition; which may be one reaſon why of late ſo few are convict of <hi>Judaiſm</hi> by that dreadful Tribunal. But what kindneſs ſoever theſe Temporizers may bear to the Doctrine of Indifferency, I am ſure the <hi>Barbary-Jews</hi> bear it an irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enmity: for they are ſo far from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with other Religions, that they will not ſo much as eat of the meat which is dreſs'd by one of a differing perſwaſion; nor drink in the ſame Cup after a Chriſtian or Moor, till it be waſht.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> (now ſpoken of) conſidering the many irregularities to which through temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and humane Frailties they are hourly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59218:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
liable, conclude that the moſt vigilant and wary among them cannot live without contracting ſome ſtain and pollution, which muſt be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ere they can enter that place of reſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they eſteem the Holy of Holies to have been a figure. But leſt the doing away of this pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould by any means be thought a work of the Holy Ghoſt, whom by way of Deriſion they call the Chriſtians <hi>Sanctifier,</hi> they have reſolved upon a Purgatory for this purpoſe. Wherein all the Relicks of Uncleanneſs, which Repentance had left uncleanſed, are to be done away.</p>
            <p>How the <hi>Jews</hi> Purgatory differs from that of <hi>Virgil, Cicero,</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> it will not be worth our travail to ſet down. Yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but obſerve that they ſpeak herein much after the manner of thoſe Platoniſts, who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned a puniſhment to every ſin, yet held that all ſuch puniſhments, whether now or hereafter, did only tend to purge the Soul from her Enormities. <hi>S. Aug. Civitat. Dei, lib.</hi> 21. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. Neither would it more avail our preſent purpoſe to compare the Jewiſh with the Papal Purgatory; which how much ſoever they may differ in other Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, do ſufficiently harmonize in vain and groundleſs extravagancies. The Papiſts, 'tis true, have much diſputed the place of their Purgatory, and were not reſolved therein till Saint <hi>Patrick</hi> obtain'd the Key and open'd the Receptacle. But the <hi>Jews</hi> without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverting

the ſcituation thereof, unanimouſly agree, except a few that place it in tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of Souls, that it is in Hell. From whence they can never be deliver'd but by the power of the <hi>Kaddiſch</hi>: which is a Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that being for the ſpace of a year repeated once a day, by ſome ſurviving Relation of the party in Purgatory, is able thence to deliver him. And therefore if the dying perſon leave any behind who will be ſo courteous as to repeat the <hi>Kaddiſch,</hi> he need not fear that the pains of Purgatory ſhall endure above a year. And indeed the <hi>Jews</hi> generally hold that there ſhall none of them ſtay above twelve months under this purgation, though they have dyed never ſo impenitent or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void of Remorſe: and that they ſhall not tarry there above ſeven dayes, if at their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe they were penitent and ſorrowful for what they had done.</p>
            <p>Now if any ones Sins are ſo great and many, that a years Purgatory will not atone them, then the Soul is to return into a Body to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Penance. And to ſupport this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, theſe <hi>Jews</hi> hold a tranſmigration of the Soul from one body to another, but without changing of the Species or the Jewiſh Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And by this tranſmigration (they hold) that the Soul ſhall ſatisfie in the ſecond body what it had done amiſs in the firſt, and ſo ſucceſſively till it come to the ſeventh: where
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59218:23"/>
it is ſure of a Sabbath, and reſts from its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and ſatisfaction. And if the Soul in all the ſeven bodies has ſin'd more than it has ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for; yet having ſuffer'd what was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, God (they ſay) in mercy gives it a <hi>releaſe.</hi> But the portion of bliſs allotted to this incompleat penance, is far leſs than that of the Soul which has made entire ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And they ſo greatly magnify the <hi>peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> that they think him of greater value than one who never ſin'd: and that one day ſpent therein is more worth than Eternity. But a man would think the <hi>Jews</hi> needed not load Repentance with ſuch great Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums, ſeeing that the <hi>future bliſs</hi> may be attain'd for thirteen Moons durance in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory.</p>
            <p>To the expiation of thoſe faults whereby the neighbour is injured, the repentance of the offender and compaſſion of the offended is ſtrictly required by the Jewiſh Caſuiſts.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Barbary</hi> entertain no thoughts of Merit in a <hi>Papal ſenſe,</hi> but ſmile to hear any ſhould be ſo vain as to imagine they can do more than the Law requires. They hold that all reward proceeds from Divine Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that obedience is the only thing looked upon in mans ſervice; and that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſhall receive according to their obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiouſneſs to the Law. But that we may not imagine the <hi>Jews</hi> to deſign the Chriſtian any
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59218:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
kindneſs by this Doctrine, we muſt obſerve that all hope and promiſe of <hi>future Reward</hi> is confined to themſelves, and that to thoſe who are not of their Religion they allow nothing but a total perdition of their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Both the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> are of Opinion that the <hi>infernal</hi> Torments ſhall have an End: and that the faln Angels after many years of puniſhment ſhall be received to mercy. Which (ſaith <hi>St. Aug. Civit. Dei, lib.</hi> 21. <hi>cap.</hi> 17.) was the judgment of ſome tender hearts among the Old Chriſtians: and gives the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in <hi>Origen,</hi> whom for his Circumvolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Rotation of <hi>bliſs</hi> and <hi>miſery</hi> the Church did Excommunicate. And to carry this remark a little further, ſome of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are of opinion, that when God, after the Reſurrection, ſhall take accounts of mens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, he will not to magnifie his <hi>power</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> condemn any one to endleſs tortures, but that it is more agreable to Gods nature and the dayly expreſſes of his Providence to ſave all. And notwithſtanding they place the puniſhment of the Chriſtians in a ſort of Annihilation, yet to any of their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they hold no other miſery ſhall remain after the laſt Judgment, but a leſſer meaſure of Happineſs.</p>
            <p>As to what relates to the Conſummation of the World, the <hi>Jews</hi> do not place it in a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59218:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
confuſed Deſtruction of its preſent order and beauty, but in its reſtauration to that purity and perfection, which (ſay they) it poſſeſſed at the Creation. And that every part of this lower World ſhall attain that perfection, whereunto it was at firſt deſigned: and that ſeeing he is the inexhauſtible Fountain of all Goodneſs, that God will at laſt inveſt the Creatures with happineſs according to their Capacities.</p>
            <p>And though in leſſer matters, opinions of no ordinary extravagancie may be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, yet it is hainous to ſee them ſo looſe in their judgment concerning that Univerſal Article, <hi>The Reſurrection of the Body</hi>; which they will not permit to go beyond their own Tribes; for they plainly affirm that none ſhall be capable of the Reſurrection, who do not die in the Communion of the Synagogue. And that this may not be thought the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment only of the leſs cultivated <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary,</hi> we find it to be the general poſition of their Maſters: Who affirm that there are four priviledges ſo peculiar to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that no other Nation can thereof communicate. And theſe are the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Gift of <hi>Propheſie,</hi> and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</hi> And that this laſt might not be looked upon as a meer <hi>Talmud</hi>-fancy, they deny the Reſurrection to all but themſelves, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of <hi>Eſay</hi> 26.14. <hi>They are dead,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59218:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they ſhall not live: they are deceaſed, they ſhall not riſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But while they utterly expunge out of their Creed the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of other Nations, it were well if they agreed concerning their own Riſing. For ſome of their Maſters have expreſly held that both the bodies and ſouls of wicked <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall be totally annihilate, and that the Reſurrection ſhall only be of ſuch <hi>Jews</hi> as have lived godly. Some again hold that all the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall riſe again, but to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Conditions; for the <hi>perfectly juſt</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Reſurrection ſhall be inſtated in an undefeiſible happineſs: next, thoſe that have died in utter impenitence ſhall according to ſome of their <hi>Rabbins,</hi> riſe to be cruciated in <hi>Gehenna</hi>: and a middle ſort between both theſe ſhall at the Reſurrection for twelve months ſpace be puniſhed in Hell. But to ſpeak truly, theſe are the private opinions on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of their Maſters; for the Common people plainly acquieſce in the literal ſenſe of the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Article of their Creed.</p>
            <p>Before we diſmiſs this Chapter, it may not be incongruous to obſerve that the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Barbary</hi> much dote upon the judgment of <hi>Rabbi Solomon Jarchi,</hi> who held that <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Command to <hi>Joſeph</hi> to carry his bones into <hi>Canaan</hi> was not only becauſe he foreſaw that the duſt of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhould be turned to Lice; or for fear that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſhould idolize
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59218:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his Carkas: but becauſe that thoſe who are buried out of <hi>Canaan</hi> ſhould have a very troubleſom Reſurrection. For the <hi>Jews</hi> believe that the Reſurrection ſhall be in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> whither all of them that are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in other Countries, muſt inceſſantly rowle through the dark caverns of the Earth, that they may riſe there and be poſſeſſed of their <hi>final reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And however this may ſeem an Opinion too vain and abſurd for men even of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry parts to maintain, yet it is at this day a prevailing Doctrine among theſe <hi>Jews:</hi> who greatly deſire to be buried in <hi>Canaan,</hi> to the end they may eſcape that toilſom rowling through the Earth, which thoſe muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, whoſe hard lot it is to be buried out of the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> But to avoid this inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, as many of them as are able, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to return to <hi>Paleſtine</hi> when they grow old, that they may have an eaſie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious Reſurrection. And upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Barbary</hi> imagine their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be much happier than thoſe in Northern Countries, becauſe they are nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and therefore have a leſs way to tumble under ground for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</p>
            <p>We have already taken notice that ſome <hi>Jews</hi> place their Purgatory in a Tranſmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soul to ſeven bodies; and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59218:26"/>
one of them who was of this opinion, and ſhewing him that by this Doctrine at the Reſurrection either ſeven Bodies muſt have but one Soul, or ſix Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies muſt have none: he made light of the objection, ſaying, That at the Reſurrection all the ſeven Bodies ſhould be ſet together, and the ſix that had it firſt ſhall come to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Body, wherein the Soul is then placed as a Candle in a Candleſtick, and that all the Bodies like ſo many Tapers ſhall be lighted thereat: for the Soul ſhall communicate it ſelf juſt as a Lamp its flames, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I have been too tedious in theſe miſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laneous extravagancies already, which I hope to make ſome amends for in the ſucceeding Accounts; wherein I ſhall endeavour to be as ſuccinct and orderly as the ſubject will give leave.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>NOtwithſtanding that all civilized Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the World agree and conſent
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59218:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that Marriage is a State of Honour and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, and one of the ancienteſt <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> which any <hi>Tradition</hi> doth report: yet none are ſo warm Aſſertors thereof as the <hi>Jews</hi> in this Clime. Who do not only contract Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage early, but infinitely extol it above Single-life, and hold it a Condition more ſutable to Nature, more advantageous to Mankind, and more acceptable to God. Inſomuch that they admit not any unmarried Sect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, but on the contrary look very jealouſly upon ſuch of their Nation as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Marry not at all, or long defer it.</p>
            <p>And on this account their Eſpouſals are very early, their Daughters being uſually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troth'd at ten years of age; and if rich, are Married when very young. And when they have once enter'd this Solemn State, they are religiouſly careful to expreſs all faithfulneſs to their huſbands. And indeed the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> are ſuch great Enemies to a treacherous Bed, that if they had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty they would certainly puniſh Adultery according to the letter of <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.20.</p>
            <p>And in further teſtimony of the great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem the <hi>Jews</hi> have of Wedlock, they reckon it among the affirmative Precepts, which they make obligatory of their whole Nation. Beſides they are generally taught by the Maſters, that every Male coming to years of maturity is bound to take a Wife
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59218:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of his own Family or Tribe, for to preſerve and encreaſe it. There are ſome among them who allow of no other end of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony but Propagation, and account them, naughty perſons who therein do project any other ſatisfaction. And the <hi>Rabbies</hi> tell them, that augmenting and preſerving of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies include all other purpoſes of Marriage whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Their manner of taking of a Wife, which is next to be conſider'd, is ſufficiently order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and decent. For when any Male is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Marry, he enquires among his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred for a Virgin to whom he may be join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Sacred Bond, for the maintenance of his Name and Family in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed that there is ſuch an one, he acquaints himſelf with her Age, Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſtate of Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and after this begins to drive the bargain with the Virgins Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who if they like his Condition and Propoſals, admit him to viſit her. But the Virgins Relations are very cautious that the Viſit be ſhort; for ſhould the Match not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, the familiarity of ſuch an interview will much tend to the Damſels diſparagement. But if the parties like one another, and the friends agree about the Dowry, then the man has liberty to make her preſents, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.53. (which was alſo a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> as <hi>Suidas</hi> in <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.)
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59218:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And theſe he ſends by the hand of ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Female, who aſcertains the Virgin of the reality of his intention and good will.</p>
            <p>After the parties have given all proper aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of one anothers good liking, and thereof certified their Relations; theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently call for a Maſter, who at the Damſels houſe draws up the Articles of Marriage and Covenant of Dowry. In which is ſet down all that belongs to the intended Bride, the particulars of her Night-dreſs not being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. And a Bill of particulars being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd to the Bridegroom, by vertue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he has power at the day of Marriage to call for and recover whatſoever is therein ſpecified. I enquired, but could meet with no Form hereof, nor could I perceive that it was any thing but a bare Envois of the goods belonging to the Bride, Signed and Witneſſed.</p>
            <p>But beſides this on the womans part, there is alſo a Dowry made by the man; which varies in quantity according to the plenty or nearneſs of his fortunes. <hi>David</hi> we find being but poor, gave for his Wife ſo many ſkins of the <hi>Philiſtins</hi>: but <hi>Sechem</hi> being a man of wealth, was willing to give as much for <hi>Dinah</hi> as ever they would demand.

            </argument>
            <p>AMong the Ancient <hi>Jews</hi> there was ever a competent time intervening betwixt their Betrothing and Marriage; which Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom they deduced from the anſwer given by <hi>Rabecca</hi>'s friends to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſervant, when they deſired that the Maid might not depart preſently, but remain after the Eſpouſals ten daies, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.55. which yet ſeems rather to imply the Mothers unwillingneſs ſo ſoon to part with her Daughter, than any legal intervention of time between the affiancing and confirmation of Marriage. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the old <hi>Jews</hi> were perſwaded in this particular, the modern of whom we now treat of, think it very diſagreeable to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Amours</hi> to uſe any protraction of their Accompliſhment. And therefore they ſtay no longer for Marriage after the <hi>betrothing,</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:59218:30"/>
than is ſufficient to make preparation for ſo great a Solemnity. For after the Dowry-bill is finiſhed, the day of Marriage is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: and in the interim the Bride pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares her ſelf for the Celebration: And for eight daies uſeth bathing. Upon the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-Eve at the going down of the Sun, ſhe has her <hi>Tabila</hi> or Ciſtern filled full of pure water, whereinto ſhe is put by two diſcreet Matrons, who are very diligent that not an hair of her head appear above water: for if any part about her remain uncover'd with water, ſhe the ſecond time muſt be put into her <hi>Tabila.</hi> For this Bath (they ſay) ought to be very exact, becauſe it is to ſupply what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was defective in the other circumſtances of the Brides preparations. When ſhe comes out of this <hi>cold Waſh,</hi> her hair with great curioſity is tied up, and her perſon ſecluded from the eyes of all men, it being not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for her Father or Brothers to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, till ſhe be delivered to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
            <p>In ſome places, as I have been told, the Bride goes to this Bath through the Streets, accompanied with ſeveral women who dance and ſing as they paſs, and name the party that is ſhortly to be married. But this is a freedom would be very ſcandalous to the <hi>Jews</hi> neighbourhood in <hi>Barbary</hi>; beſides, the modeſty to which from their infancy the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

            <p>The dreſſing of the Brides hair when ſhe comes out of the Bath, (which was but now intimated) though the common people may look upon it as a meer act of handſomneſs and adorning; yet their Maſters teach it for an inſtance of Religion, and as a thing very acceptable to God. And thoſe words— <hi>And brought her unto the Man,</hi> Gen. 2.22. they thus expound: <hi>And God brought</hi> Eve <hi>to</hi> Adam, <hi>after the ſame manner that a Bride is brought to her husband, that is, elegantly dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, with her hair curiouſly curl'd and plated; and with joy and dancing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the day of Marriage the Bride puts on her wedding-Garment, and adorns her ſelf as ſumptuouſly as her fortunes will allow, and in an apartment by her ſelf, ſpends the time until the uſual hour of Marriage, in Faſting and Devotion. And though they have no Canonical hours for this Solemnity, yet it is moſt uſually kept toward night; which ſome gather (from St. <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.1.) was the cuſtom of the <hi>Jews</hi> in our Saviours time. Though the Parable (think others) relates ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Marriage-feaſt than the Marriage it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The Bridegroom likewiſe ſpends ſeveral hours in private Devotion before the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. And recommends his Condition unto
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59218:31"/>
God, begging happineſs upon his wedlock. After theſe private Devotions are ended, he goes to the Service of the Synagogue, whence he uſually returns accompanied with ſome choice friends, who ſtraightway con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct him to the chamber, where the Bride ſits in a chair on purpoſe to receive him, having a Virgin on each hand, as her atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants. And ſhe changes not this poſture, till ſome <hi>Rabbi</hi> (or other aged <hi>Jew,</hi> ſkilful in the Law) reads the Dowry-bill with an audible and diſtinct voice; and the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom hath put the <hi>Keduſim</hi> or wedding-Ring (of pure Gold, and without a Stone) on the Brides thumb, or third or any finger of her right hand, and called all that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to atteſt it; upon which the <hi>Rabbi</hi> ſaith unto the Bride, <hi>Thou art Married or Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to this Man with this Ring, according to the Law of</hi> Iſrael. And theſe Ceremonies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finiſhed, the <hi>Rabbi</hi> ſaith a Prayer, which is called the Nuptial-Bleſſing (the form follows preſently) and then takes a glaſs crowned with Wine, which having bleſſed and taſted of, he gives to the Bridegroom, who with a ſuddain violence breaks it, in memory of the Deſtruction of the Temple. And this being done, he takes off the Brides Vail, and giving her the right hand ſits down by her; and having entertained her with a ſhort diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſerious or otherwiſe as he beſt affects,

            <p>The Marriage-Feaſt begins next morning after the Marriage, and laſts preciſely eight daies.

Eight daies by a New <hi>Leviticus</hi> being allowed her for Purification after Marriage. And the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath which happens in this time they keep with more than ordinary feſtivity and mirth, becauſe ſomewhere in Scripture (they ſay) that the Sabbath is called a <hi>Bride.</hi>

               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:59218:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>In ſome places, we are told, that the young Men who wait upon the Bridegroom at the hearing of the Huſband giving the <hi>Miſſal Tob,</hi> or wiſhing happineſs to his Wife, break certain ſmall Earthen pots which for that purpoſe they hold in their hands. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſignifie their good wiſhes of proſperity and health to the new-married couple. As for the Cuſtom of the young Mens keeping the Bridegroom Company for the eight daies that he keeps within-doors, they found it upon the Story of <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Wedding, <hi>Judges</hi> 14.2. They alſo have an odd Cuſtom, whereby the New-Married during their eight daies ſeparation, are obliged to ſend girdles (a very myſterious utenſil among all the <hi>Jews</hi>) one to the other. That which the Wife ſends has a Silver-buckle, but that which he returns has a buckle of Gold.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Barbary</hi> uſually keep their Summer-Marriages in Bowers and Arbors, which reſemble, and perhaps are in ſtead of the <hi>Chuppa</hi> Canopy or Covering ſaid to be in uſe among the <hi>Jews</hi> of other Countries. And the Gueſts at the firſt entrance of theſe Bowers ſay, <hi>Baruch Habba, bleſſed is he that cometh</hi>; which they apply to the Bridegroom coming thither to his Bride.

ſhe walks thrice about him, becauſe the Scripture ſaith, <hi>A woman ſhall compaſs a man, Jer.</hi> 31.22. And the Man walks once round the Woman; but no Text is offer'd at to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie this Cuſtom. In ſome Countries the Gueſts bring with them handfuls of Corn, which they caſt at the New-Married, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Increaſe and Multiply.</hi> By which they alſo wiſh them <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Abundance.</hi> If the Bride be a Virgin, they give her Wine in a narrow Cup; if a Widow, in a wide one: for excellent reaſons, no doubt. While the Banquet which immediately follows the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is preparing, the Company have ſtore of Hens ſet before them, ready dreſſed, which when <hi>The Couple</hi> have taſted, they tear in pieces, and devour with ſtrange ſcuffling and diſorder: But without any other My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery than to make the New-Married pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime.</p>
            <p>This Counter-ſcuffle being over, the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom takes a raw Egg, which he caſts at the Bride; intimating thereby his deſire that ſhe may have both an eaſie and joyful Child-birth. The Marriage-day is taken up with theſe Ceremonies, which they conclude with a Supper and a Dance.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Barbary</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> admit no Chriſtians to be preſent at their Marriages, unleſs ſuch as are their <hi>Slaves.</hi> And for this they quote <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.20. For they are of opinion, that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59218:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to invite a Chriſtian, or any who are not of their Faith, to theſe Solemnities, is ſo diſpleaſing to the good Angels, that they force them to leave the Company.

               <p> Their Opinion of Sterility: their <hi>Lilis:</hi> their Rites of Child-birth.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>HAving taken this ſhort view of their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, the method will not be unnatural, if in the next place we look into the fruits thereof. For we may conclude that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are eſteemed by the <hi>Jews</hi> no ſmall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Wedlock, ſeeing that in all Ages they have thought the barren Womb not only to be a <hi>reproach</hi> but a <hi>Curſe</hi>; and that to want Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is to be civilly dead, according to the old Jewſh Proverb,— <hi>A Man childleſs is live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:59218:34"/>
And indeed the <hi>Jews</hi> now, as of old, have ſuch an high value for procreation of Children, that they place it among thoſe keys which God keeps in his own hand: and who therefore is ſaid to remember <hi>Rachel</hi> and open her womb, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. And if having Children be a token of Gods remembrance, the Jewiſh women are ſeldom forgotten. For they are ſo generally fruitful, that ſhe who proves otherwiſe is ſaid to have no <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zal</hi> in the Firmament, or to have been mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried under no <hi>good Planet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the Jewiſh Women in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try are fruitful in Children, ſo they are lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably decent in their Travails: obſerving therein ſuch orderly deportment as is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all well civilized humanity. 'Tis true, the <hi>Rabbins</hi> (who too much play the Poets with all their Rites) have not forborn even thoſe of Child-birth: but have devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeveral fabulous Stories and impertinent Rites concerning it. A taſte whereof we ſhall here inſert, for the ſatisfaction of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive.</p>
            <p>And in the firſt place the <hi>Rabbins</hi> have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that the Father of the Family, or any other religious <hi>Jew</hi> in his ſtead, upon the approach of Child-birth, ſhall draw ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Circles in the Chamber of the impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnate, as alſo upon the doors both within and without, on the walls, and about the bed,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59218:35"/>
Inſcribing every Circle with theſe words, <hi>Adam, Chava, chutz Lilis:</hi> that is, <hi>Adam, Eve,</hi> be gon <hi>Lilis.</hi> The meaning of which Conjuration depends upon the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of what is meant by <hi>Lilis.</hi> Now the <hi>Jews</hi> are not unanimous in their account hereof; yet the beſt we could collect take as foloweth.</p>
            <p>When God had made <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſaw that it was not good for him to be alone, he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Woman, and gave him her for a Wife; and ſhe was called <hi>Lilis.</hi> But being no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er brought unto <hi>Adam,</hi> than ſhe began to brawle and contend, and would not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that power over her wherewith <hi>Adam</hi> was inveſted. And when he adviſed her of her ſubjection, and that ſhe ought to obey his commands; ſhe inſultingly replyed, <hi>That ſubjection aroſe from inequality, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could have no place between them who were equal by Creation.</hi> And in this pelting and quarrelſom humour they lived ſo long, that <hi>Lilis</hi> foreſeeing little likelyhood either of its ending or amendment, ſhe named <hi>The moſt Holy Name,</hi> and thereupon was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately rapt out of <hi>Adam's</hi> ſight into the Air. <hi>Adam</hi> ſeeing this ſuddain departure of his Wife, is ſaid thus to have addreſſed himſelf unto God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O King of the World, the Wife which thou gaveſt me has forſaken me.</hi> Hereupon three
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59218:35"/>
Angels (<hi>Senoi, Sanfenoi,</hi> and <hi>Saumangeloph</hi>) were commanded to purſue and bring her back, and to threaten her with ſevere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments in caſe ſhe refuſed. The Angels purſuing overtook her at the Sea (wherein afterwards the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were drowned) which then was ſtormy and tempeſtuous. But <hi>Lilis</hi> refuſed to return, and pleaded that ſhe was not made to be ſubject to any Man, but that the deſign of her Creation was to moleſt and deſtroy the Male-Children for eight daies, and the Female for twenty after their Birth.</p>
            <p>But the Angels not approving her rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, they endeavoured to force her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; but perceiving in her a ſhreud reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, they agreed to diſmiſs her, upon this Condition, <hi>That ſhe ſhould never hurt any Infants wherever ſhe ſaw their Names writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</hi> And to this end, the <hi>Jews</hi> uſe to write the Angels Names in a Table or Parchment, and to hang them for Amulets about their Childrens Necks.</p>
            <p>As to the inſcribing of the foremention'd Circles with <hi>Adam, Eve, chutz Lilis,</hi> they imply that if the Mother bring forth a boy, God would not give him ſuch a brawling Wife as <hi>Lilis,</hi> but one like <hi>Eve,</hi> who would be mild and peaceable, loving and obſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſuch an one as may build his houſe in Peace. But enough of this ſtory. But
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59218:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the chief intent of theſe Circles is to fortifie the Chamber appointed for the Teeming wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man againſt all Haggs and Goblins.</p>
            <p>When the great Belly finds her pangs to be near, ſhe calls ſome diſcreet Matron to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt her delivery; but ſhe muſt be one of their own Religion. For nothing but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable neceſſity can induce them to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit either Chriſtian or Mooriſh Women to be at their Travails, out of a jealouſie that ſome miſchief may befal the Child. Nor is this the fancy only of the ſuſpicious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but a ſtrict preſcription of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who in no caſe but that wherein neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity gives a Diſpenſation, will give leave that a <hi>ſtrange Woman</hi> ſhould be Midwife to a daughter of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Woman is brought to Bed, the joy and feſtivity is according to the ſex that is born. At the birth of a daughter they uſe but little exultation, becauſe ſhe cannot ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the <hi>family,</hi> which is extinct without Males. Whence they have a ſaying, <hi>The Family of the Mother is not called a Family.</hi> And the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word for Woman is fetcht from a root ſignifying <hi>forgetfulneſs:</hi> becauſe the Fathers Family is forgotten in marriage of a daughter.</p>
            <p>But if the Woman be delivered of a Boy, there is great joy in the Family, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in teſtimony thereof preſently begins
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59218:36"/>
the Feaſt for his Sons Circumciſion, which is never deferr'd beyond the eighth day, unleſs want of health in the Child prevent it. The firſt ſeven daies after the Childs Nativity are wholly ſpent in feſtival Entertainments, at which none can be a Gueſt who has not paſt his thirteenth year. Neither muſt there be fewer than ten at this Feaſt. Upon the Eve of the Circumciſion, the Women viſit their Goſſip, with whom they uſually paſs the whole night in mirth and freedom; On purpoſe to conſole and recreate the Mother, that ſhe may not be over-troubled for the pains of her Sons Circumciſion, as alſo to prevent thoſe miſchiefs to which they imagine Childbed-women are very liable the ſeventh night after their Delivery.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>CIrcumciſion has ſo peculiar a veneration among the preſent <hi>Jews,</hi> that if all other parts of their Religion were to be changed, this like Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> would ſtand immoveable. And though many other Nations (of old)
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59218:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and at this day the whole <hi>profeſſion</hi> of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humediſm,</hi> uſe Circumciſion; yet none but the <hi>Hebrews</hi> embrace it as a <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the figurative Circumciſion of the Heart, Lips and Ears (whereof the Scripture makes mention) there is no conſiderable diſagreement among Chriſtians or <hi>Jews</hi>; nor is their harmony leſs about the literal Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion: for both grant it to be of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution, and appointed both for a ſigne and ſeal of the Covenant God made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul (Rom.</hi> 4.11.) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets <hi>Moſes (Gen.</hi> 17.11.) But the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of this point belongs not to this place, whereby the Method we have propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this Treatiſe, the modern Rites of Circumciſion are plainly to be recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>And in the firſt place, the <hi>Jews</hi> of whom I now write, are very conformable in their obſervation of the time appointed for the celebration of Circumciſion. For where they enjoy the free exerciſe of their Religion, they never defer it longer than the eighth day. But they Circumciſe indifferently at home or the Synagogue. Though for the greater pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade, the wealthier <hi>Jews</hi> ſeldom neglect to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their children to the Synagogue.</p>
            <p>The chief Officer at Circumciſion is the <hi>Mohel,</hi> or he that Circumciſeth, who is not bound to be of the Prieſthood; for any
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59218:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
has liberty to Circumciſe who has ſkill there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. The Rich admit none to perform this office upon their children, who have not been bred thereunto, and long make it their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. And it is uſual to ſerve a ſort of Apprenticeſhip to gain the Art and Credit of a ſkilful <hi>Mohel.</hi> To this end, thoſe who herein intend to be Artiſts, deal with the indigent <hi>Jews</hi> to Circumciſe their Sons, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Fathers money for ſo doing: and having gain'd a competent ſkill and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, they ſet up for Circumciſers. Who are eaſily diſcerned to be of that Profeſſion by their Thumb-nails, which they keep ſharp and long, as a badge of their <hi>Calling.</hi> And from one of theſe <hi>Mohels</hi> I received this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing account of Circumciſion, according to the Uſe of the Synagogue in <hi>Fez,</hi> the place of his Practice and Abode.</p>
            <p>The time intervening between the Childs Birth and Circumciſion is ſpent in fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent bathing it; which with more than ordinary Circumſpection is waſht at the time it is preſented to this Sacrament. Of which it is altogether incapable, if the leaſt filth be left about it. So that if any natural Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation happen as it is brought to the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hel,</hi> or before the Prepuce be taken away, he cannot proceed in his Office till the Child be new waſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:59218:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>The morning is the uſual time of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing; out of this ſuppoſal, that the flux of blood is then leaſt, and the child will be moſt patient: but this they do not by the advice of the <hi>Rabbi,</hi> but Phyſician; it being no rite of their Religion, but a rule in their Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatory.</p>
            <p>Upon the day when Circumciſion is ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, there are two ſeats ſet cloſe by the Ark in the Synagogue; the one for <hi>Elias,</hi> whoſe preſence they ſtill expect at this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity; and another for the <hi>Baal-Berith,</hi> or Godfather. By theſe two Seats ſtand the <hi>Mohel,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> that are invited. Then the child is brought in Parade, with ſeveral boys, whereof one carries a Torch of twelve lights, denoting the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> another brings a diſh of Sand; another the Circumciſing Inſtrument (which is of Wood, Stone, Iron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) Oyl, ſoft Linnen Rags. In ſome places they have a Cordial ready, in caſe the Child ſhould faint. And when the Men in the Synagogue have ſung the Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> as it is extant <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. and have Notice that the Women have brought the Child to the Door of the Synagogue, the whole Company ſtands up, and the <hi>Baal-Berith</hi> goes to receive and bring in the Child to the Congregation, who receive him with this Acclamation, <hi>Bleſſed is he that cometh:</hi> which they underſtand either of the Child,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59218:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who is ſo happy as to come to Circumciſion; or, of <hi>Elias,</hi> whom they believe to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with the Child, and to take his place by the <hi>Godfather,</hi> to obſerve and teſtifie that all things concerning Circumciſion were duly adminiſter'd.</p>
            <p>When the Congregation are ſetled in good order, the Godfather holds the Child to the <hi>Mohel,</hi> who gives God thanks that in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> he gave them this Sacrament, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſigned and ſealed them for his peculiar people. Then he takes away the Foreſkin, and in the interim the Father praiſeth the Lord that he gave <hi>Abraham</hi> a heart to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the Law of Circumciſion, and preſerved him to ſee this his Son Circumciſed. The Foreſkin being cut off, the <hi>Mohel</hi> caſts it into the diſh of Sand, with no leſs myſtical intimation, than that the Seed of the Child ſhould be numerous as the grains of that Sand; and that the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> to whom God gave this Sacrament, might ſtill verifie what was obſerved of them <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.10. But I rather think it to reflect upon <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.17.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Mohel</hi> has thus diſpoſed of the Prepuce, he prays that the Child may live and ſee his Sons thus initiated into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; may keep the Law, and do good works. Then he takes a cup of Wine, and bleſſeth God that he hath created the Vine,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59218:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and given it a power to exhilarate and nouriſh: then he dips the little finger of his left hand thrice in the Wine, and lets it drop into the Childs mouth; and having taſted of it himſelf, reaches it to the Congregation. This done, the <hi>Mohel</hi> again gives thanks, that God ſanctified the child in the Womb, and has brought it to the Foederal Sacrament. He prayes likewiſe that the children of this child may obey the Law. Then he takes the Infant from the <hi>Baal-Berith,</hi> and delivering it to the Father, giveth it a Name; praying for him, that by that Name there given him, he may <hi>quickly be healed, live proſperouſly,</hi> be a joy to his Parents, and beget children who may be zealous Aſſertors of the <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus far I have tranſcribed my old <hi>Mohel,</hi> who aſſured me that the whole Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual of Circumciſion was ſummarily contain'd in what is now ſet down.</p>
            <p>They have ſuch a great eſteem for this Sacrament, that they ſtill enjoyn it under its old penalty, <hi>That Soul ſhall be cut off from his people,</hi> Gen. 17. Which ſome interpret of Excommunication, or the bodily death of the Parents who out of contempt or neglect of the Inſtitution, omit the Circumciſion of their Males: and others underſtand it of thoſe who at years of Maturity took not care to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that themſelves, which through their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents negligence was omitted in their infancy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:59218:39"/>And though the party delinquent herein incur this penalty, yet theſe <hi>Jews</hi> do not ſo expound the precept of Circumciſing the eighth day, as if it admitted of no relaxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For in caſe of the childs ſickneſs, they generally hold that its Circumciſion may be put off till ſeven daies after its recovery. And thoſe likewiſe who are born where there is no Toleration of their Rites, do not incur this cenſure, if they take care to be Circumciſied when they come where their Religion is Tolerated. And they prove from the firſt Inſtitution of Circumciſion, that Age can priviledge none from under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going it: <hi>Abraham</hi> being ninety years old and nine, when he was Circumciſed in the fleſh of his Foreſkin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.24. And I knew one <hi>Jacob Iſrael Belgara,</hi> who being born in <hi>Spain,</hi> and a long time Student <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

And they are careful not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the firſt occaſion of being Circumciſed, becauſe every moment of ſuch delay is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct breach of the Commandment. 'Tis true, inſtances of the Parents negligence in this particular is very unuſual; they being ſo far from omitting this Sacrament, that they are but too rigorous in exacting it. But if any omiſſion happen herein through the Parents default, then the Maſters of the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59218:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Synagogue have power to convene and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (or to cut off from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Synagogue) the offending party, and to take and Circumciſe the child.</p>
            <p>If a child die ere the eighth day, it is Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed at the place of burial, but without any furder Ceremonies than giving a Name, and praying that God would be mindful of it in the day of the Reſurrection, and to give it life among thoſe who are Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed. Now they Circumciſe the child, to make it capable of Jewiſh Sepulchre, and to prevent all miſchief that might otherwiſe befal the uncircumciſed in the future State. For they are not yet argeed whether or no Circumciſion be of abſolute neceſſity to the life to come. Thoſe who adhere to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry letter of its Inſtitution, make Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo requiſite to the obtaining of future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, that they deny thoſe who want it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny portion in the Reſurrection; miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28.10. But others think there is nothing dangerous in the want there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but its contempt. And in the Chriſtian Church the Council of <hi>Braccara</hi> ordain'd that thoſe who deſpiſed their Baptiſm, and died in that opinion, ſhould, as guilty of their own eternal death, be buried with Self-Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</p>
            <p>But all we have hitherto mentioned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59218:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Circumciſion, is to be reſtrained to thoſe who are born in the <hi>Jews</hi> Religion. For as to the admiſſion of Proſelytes unto Judaiſm, Circumciſion, Baptiſm and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice were in ordinary courſe required. But theſe old Articles of Proſelytiſm are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by the mordern <hi>Jews.</hi> For Sacrifice has been utterly out of uſe ever ſince the Deſtruction of the Temple. And leſt the ſhame or pain of Circumciſion might deter any from proſelytizing, they are taught not rigorouſly to exact it. And there <hi>Moſes E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptius</hi> tells them, that many Proſelytes were admitted into the Jewiſh Communion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Circumciſion. <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Father in Law they hold to have been the firſt Proſelyte of Juſtice, who upon his turning <hi>Jew</hi> had his Name <hi>Jether</hi> changed to <hi>Jethro.</hi> But after him there were many made Proſelytes of the Gate, without Circumciſion, of which Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> gives ſeveral inſtances. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they diſpenſe with Sacrifice, and ſpeak warily of Circumciſion, yet Baptiſm is a conſtant initiatory of the Proſelyte, which has nothing common but the water with thoſe dayly Baptiſms of the <hi>Jews,</hi> reflected upon by <hi>Tertullian, lib.</hi> 6. <hi>de Baptiſmo, cap.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>I confeſs <hi>Barbary</hi> affords but few of theſe Proſelytes: for though there are frequent examples both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> turning
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59218:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Moors,</hi> yet very ſeldom are any met with who turn <hi>Jews</hi>; which made me leſs inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive after the preſent manner of receiving Proſelytes. And as to what relates to the antient Form of Proſelytiſm, enough is to be ſeen in Mr. <hi>Selden, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. <hi>de jure Naturali &amp; Gentium juxta Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinam Hebraeorum.</hi> If any Proſelytes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen among them, we may preſume they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the Rites herein uſed by the <hi>Jews</hi> of other Nations.

Next, they denounce and make known unto him the great ſtrictneſs of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that the <hi>Jews</hi> are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent an abject, vile, and deſpicable people, and that upon this account it is better for him to continue as he is. And if after all this he continues his purpoſe, then he is to Circumciſe himſelf; and as ſoon as he is whole,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59218:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he bathes himſelf all over in water in the preſence of the three foreſaid Maſters: and after this, he is accounted as good an <hi>Hebrew</hi> as the reſt. At the Circumciſion of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyte they uſe this Form of Prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bleſſed be thou O God and King of the World, who haſt ſanctified us with thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and commanded us to Circumciſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes, and to take from them the Blood of the Covenant.

            <p>Then the by-ſtanders ſay, <hi>As thou haſt brought him into thy Covenant, ſo guide us in thy Law and good Works, and bleſs us with protection and ſafety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now becauſe ſome other Nations have gotten a Traditionary Cuſtom of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, without turning <hi>Jews,</hi> or undertaking any degree of Proſelytiſm (as all the Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medans:) It is therefore reſolved among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that if any ſuch become a Proſelyte, though he cannot be Circumciſed again, yet on the eighth of his Proſelytiſm, ſome blood muſt be fetcht of that part, which they call the <hi>Breaking of the Skin.</hi> But they are ſo ingenuous as to confeſs that this is none of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59218:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but an Inſtitution of their own.</p>
            <p>And having thus briefly viewed the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual of Circumciſion, that which remains of this Chapter ſhall be filled up with this ſhort Account of their Purification after Child-birth. And the Law of this Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is, <hi>Levit.</hi> 12. from which they in no wiſe decline, unleſs in the number of dayes; for notwithſtanding that but ſixty ſix dayes are appointed by the Law for the Purification after the birth of a Daughter, yet in <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> obſerve ſeventy ſix: but for a Son they keep cloſe to what the Law has herein appointed. During the time appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Purification, the Child-bed woman abſtains from all intimate communion with her Huſband: who is not permitted ſo much as to touch her finger, or clothes, or to eat and drink with her out of the ſame diſh or cup. And at the end of theſe dayes allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to her Purification, ſhe returns not to the free converſation of her Huſband, till ſhe has been wholly waſht, and put on all ſuch accoutrements as are uſed in token of purity. And that there might be no colluſion herein, ſhe muſt prove by the Teſtimony of two credible Matrons that all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her Purification were duly obſerved. In the <hi>Bibliotheca Rabbinica</hi> there is Menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the <hi>Sepher Naſchim,</hi> where the whole

               <p>Of the <hi>Jews</hi> Polygamy: Divorce: A Copy of their Bill of Diſmiſſion, &amp;c.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>POlygamy</hi> reſpects both Sexes, and is of two ſorts; whereof the one is a having of many Wives or Huſbands at once, the other an having many ſucceſſively. Concerning which the <hi>Jews</hi> at no time have raiſed any conſiderable controverſie, ſaving that they have always refuſed the woman to have a plurality of huſbands at once. Though they denyed her not a liberty of a ſecond Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, when by Death or Divorce they were freed from the firſt.</p>
            <p>Among Chriſtian Authors this Point has been deeply controverted; and <hi>Tertullian</hi> was equally againſt both theſe ſorts of <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy</hi>; putting but little difference between having many wives at once, or by ſucceſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:59218:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>lib. de Monogam.</hi> But others granting the lawfulneſs of ſucceſſive Marriages, have yet wholly exploded the licence of many wives at one time, unleſs where Divine Revelation gave toleration. Mr. <hi>Grotius</hi> ſaith there was no reſtraint herein until the Coming of Chriſt. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 5. §. 8, 9. <hi>de jure Belli &amp; Pacis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as to what herein relates to the <hi>Jews Polygamy,</hi> has ever been ſo far from an ill name among them, that it has been reckon'd for one of the chief Priviledges confer'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them by Divine Preſcription. So that if we be herefrom abſtemious, it is not out of Conſcience, but worldly Intereſt. The <hi>Gemara Babylonia</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> writes) makes it lawful for any <hi>Jew</hi> to take as many wives as he can maintain: that is, according to the <hi>Barbary-Jews,</hi> Any one may take as many wives as he can find with meat and cloth, and the right of the Bed. For to all theſe he obligeth himſelf in his Marriage-Letters. And what the <hi>Jews</hi> herein pretend unto by Divine Law, other Nations pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice through evil Cuſtom. For <hi>Tacitus (de moribus German.)</hi> ſaith, That they uſed <hi>Polygamy</hi> as a mark of Nobleſs and Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Jews</hi> of whom I now write, though they greatly magnifie and extol the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of <hi>Polygamy,</hi> yet they are not very
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59218:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fond of its practice. For they are generally abſtinent herein, not out of Religion but po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, as finding one wife at a time enough for their maintenance and government. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if they find any grievance in being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways confined to one Female, they have a preſent remedie in Divorce or Concubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage. Of which we muſt now ſpeak a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
            <p>Now as touching Divorce, there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things thereunto required, which being all contain'd in the <hi>Sepher Kerithuth,</hi> need not any particular enumeration. And in this <hi>Sepher Kerithuth,</hi> or <hi>Book of Cutting off,</hi> (ſo called, becauſe the wife thereby was cut off from her huſbands Family) I have met with three ſeveral Copies hereof, one taken out of <hi>Moſes Kotſenſis,</hi> where, ſaith the citation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is another.

            </argument>
            <p>THoſe ſecondary Wives which were of old among the <hi>Jews,</hi> our Engliſh Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation

And <hi>Tertullian</hi> (ſpeaking hereof in the firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Book <hi>De unis Nuptiis ad <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem</hi>) affirms that not the Patriarchs alone, but alſo our Anceſtors had a right not only to Marry, but alſo to uſe Matrimony vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly: and that there were Concubines, before the <hi>Law</hi> we read of the Concubines of <hi>Abaham, Nahor, Jacob,</hi> &amp;c. And out of <hi>Philo</hi> we are told by Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> that the primary wives were called the <hi>juſt,</hi> and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary Concubines.</p>
            <p>A Learned man of our own Nation (in his Annotations upon the New Teſtament) ſeems to incline to another Opinion: for he ſaith that the Matrimonial Laws of the <hi>Jews</hi> forbad a ſervant, or Gentile woman to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wife to a <hi>Jew,</hi> but that ſhe was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Concubine. Whether or no this might be ſo by ſome new Inſtitute of the Maſters, I have no juſt occaſion here to enquire: But I am ſure the <hi>Egyptian Agar,</hi> who was <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Concubine, is called his wife, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.3. And that both ſhe and <hi>Kethu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> were called both his Wives and Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines; but <hi>Sarah</hi> bore only the name of his wife. <hi>Auguſt. Civitat. Dei, lib.</hi> 17. <hi>cap.</hi> 34. But grant that the Concubine by (ſome late Rabbinick) Matrimonial Laws of the <hi>Jews,</hi> was not called a wife, yet ſhe was far from the ill character of an Harlot, nor was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59218:45"/>
aſſociation with her any more unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than Polygamy, which was practiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Patriarchs, and is ſtill allowed of by the Modern <hi>Jews.</hi> And yet if we grant Concubines the Title of Wives (and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubinate to be Marriage) yet betwixt them and the primary wives there was and is ſtill no ſmall difference and diſparity. For the firſt ſort of wives were taken by Matrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Patent, or Dotal Covenant, with ſolemn Eſpouſals, and had a power to receive all ſuch preſents as might teſtifie both the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Affection and the Contract: but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines were taken without any of theſe Ceremonies or Aſſurances. Next, the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary wives</hi> were the Governeſſes of their huſbands Families, but the Concubines live therein as Servants, and equal to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in nothing but <hi>in the right of the Bed.</hi> In the third place, the children of the <hi>firſt wives</hi> had a right to ſucceed to the hereditary <hi>Eſtates</hi> and <hi>Titles</hi> of their Fathers, but thoſe of the Concubines were ſecluded all ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion therein, and inſtead thereof receive <hi>por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Gen.</hi> 25.6. And ſome think that it was upon this account, that <hi>Jephte</hi> being the Son of a Concubine, was denyed to co-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit with his brethren. Agreeable unto this Cuſtom is the <hi>Matrimonium Morgengabicum</hi> in ſome Countries, where the ſecond wife and her children are not taken in to a right
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59218:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the huſbands Eſtate, whereby the woman can have no part thereof for a <hi>Joynture,</hi> nor the children for their inheritance, but only certain portions are aſſigned them by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact; which are called <hi>Morgengab,</hi> or Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-Gifts.</p>
            <p>But not to purſue the Laws of the old Jewiſh Concubinage (whereof enough is to be met with in Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>;) Our preſent taſk is to ſtate the preſent uſe thereof among the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Barbary.</hi> Who are generally here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in very abſtemious: but when they make uſe of it, 'tis with ſuch Rites as have been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy mention'd. And we may eaſily imagine the unſettledneſs of their Condition to be the main reaſon why they are ſo reſerved in the uſe of this priviledge. People of an Ambulatory ſtate being uſually very careful not to multiply their lumber.</p>
            <p>The next thing to be accounted for, is the Marrying or refuſing of the Brothers wife who is dead without Iſſue. A cuſtom which is at this day in requeſt and practice among theſe <hi>Jews,</hi> according to its firſt Inſtitution, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. But if the ſurviving Brother re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe (as he may) to raiſe up ſeed to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, then they proceed to a very ſolemn ſeparation, which is after this manner.</p>
            <p>The man who refuſeth to pay this debt unto the dead, is bound to take two well-reported <hi>Jews</hi> of the Neighbourhood, and

with them to go to his Brothers widow; to whom he declares his reſolution of not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving her in Marriage, or of not perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto her the Duty of a huſbands Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This being done before the two cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible perſons whom we juſt now mention'd, the widow accompanied with the ſame wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and three more, makes her addreſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>chief of the Synagogue,</hi> who upon the receiving of her Petition, appoints a day of hearing; and both the parties according to Summons being preſent, the chief of the Synagogue propounds ſeveral queſtions. And firſt he demands of the widow, How long her huſband hath been dead? whether three months be fully paſſed ſince his death? for ſo much time is required to clear her from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with child by her late huſband. Next he demands, Whether her huſband left ever a brother behind him? whether the man who is there preſent be his full brother, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be a ſingle man? After this the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter demands their Age, and whether ſhe thinks they are compotent for generation? and whether the ſurviving Brother and the Defunct had both one Father?</p>
            <p>Theſe Propoſals being directly anſwer'd unto by the woman, the Maſter turns to the man, and aſks him, whether the woman there preſent was his dead brothers wife? and, whether he will Marry her, or ſuffer his
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59218:46"/>
ſhooe to be pulled off? If he there declare again his refuſal to Marry her, they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly execute the Law: and having firſt put and tyed a ſhooe on his right foot being bare, the ſlighted widow looſeth it with her right hand, and ſaith, calling the <hi>Synagogue</hi> or <hi>Congregation</hi> to witneſs it, <hi>This my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands brother refuſeth to raiſe up ſeed unto his brother.</hi> And then pulling off his ſhooe, ſhe contemptuouſly ſpits in his face, ſaying, <hi>So ſhall it be done to the Man, that will not build up his brothers houſe.</hi> Then the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Synagogue, with all that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, pronounce theſe words: <hi>The ſhooe is taken off.</hi> And from that time forward ſhe is at liberty to Marry to whom ſhe pleaſeth. It is required that all this be tranſacted when the woman is <hi>faſting</hi>; and though not in <hi>Barbary,</hi> yet in ſome other Nations, ſhe looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſhooe with her teeth. I have been informed that they have a Ritual of the whole proceſs, and a preſcript Form which they call, <hi>The pulling off of the ſhooe</hi>: And that a Copy hereof is given to the woman, which ſerves her for a Teſtimonial that her Separation was <hi>legal,</hi> and that ſhe may joyn her ſelf in Wedlock to whom ſhe has a mind.</p>
            <p>But if poſſible, the parties ſo accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the matter betwixt themſelves, that it ſeldome comes to this extremity. For this mode of Separation is generally looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            </argument>
            <p>HAving already treated of the <hi>Jews</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, with its ſeveral appendages, and viewed their Childbirth and Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: the Method cannot be unnatural if we next enquire into the Education of thoſe children, by whom they hope to preſerve <hi>Their Name</hi> in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And indeed the care of the <hi>Jews</hi> is very laudable in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, there being not many people in the World more watchful to have their children early tinctured with Religion than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Hebrews.</hi> And there needs not many other reaſons to be given of their unſhaken adherence to their preſent Faith, than that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59218:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they are therein ſo timely and deeply groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</p>
            <p>Nor is their diligence herein more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable than their orderly Method; for as ſoon as their children are able to pronounce, they are taught ſuch Sentences of <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> as ſeem to favour their Religion, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe into them the feeds of Piety and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. And to this purpoſe they frequently make uſe of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Exhortatory: <hi>Catechize a Child in the way that he ſhould walk when he is young, and his old age will not depart from it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Barbary</hi> uſually ſpeak <hi>Moreſco,</hi> the Language of their Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and a ſort of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> which inables them for Traffick; leſt they ſhould fall into an utter oblivion of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, they are careful that the Rudiments be in that Speech. And to facilitate their Childrens Learning thereof, they uſually teach them <hi>Hebrew</hi> for the Utenſils of the Houſe, Terms of Traffick and Negotiation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And by this Order they furniſh the Children with a <hi>Nomenclature</hi> of <hi>Hebrew</hi> Words; and all this before they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to Syntax and Conſtruction. Hence it is that in ſpeaking <hi>Moreſco</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> they ſo intermingle their firſt <hi>Vocabulary,</hi> that thereby it is not eaſie to be underſtood. But ſtill the main Deſign of their early Inſtruction is eſpecially ſpent in imprinting Religion
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59218:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
upon the tender minds of their Children. And becauſe the Sabbath is appointed for the more Solemn Celebration and Inſtruction in Religious Rites, and ordained to be one Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, whereby the <hi>Hebrew</hi> people is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from all other; for theſe Reaſons the <hi>Jews</hi> are ſignally diligent to implant into their Children a ſingular reverence thereof. And to this end they employ the Morn and Even of this Queen of Feaſts (as the Maſters call the Sabbath) in teaching their Children ſeveral pious Forms of Saluting their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and others. In which Greetings they permit not their Children to uſe the <hi>Name of God,</hi> till they are ſeven years old, that they may retain the greater veneration for that Name which is <hi>Holy and Reverend.</hi> And therefore the firſt Salutations of the Children are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>I wiſh you a good Sabbath: May you have a good day,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>When their Children are grown up to be fit for ſuch Converſation as <hi>Talk</hi> and <hi>Play,</hi> they permit them not the leaſt Society with the <hi>Mahumedan</hi> Children, but ſtrictly forbid them their company; that hereby they may timely poſſeſs them with an averſeneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all <hi>Mahumediſm.</hi> And this they pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice out of a conſideration that there is ſo great likeneſs between many of their own and the <hi>Moreſco</hi> Cuſtoms, that a Child may be eaſily induced to a promiſcuous imbibing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59218:48"/>
of either. And as for the Divine Myſteries of Chriſtianity, the <hi>Jews</hi> repreſent them to their Children in ſuch monſtrous ſhapes, that they are fitter for their affrightment than embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Beſides, they teach their Children that Chriſtian Religion is ſo utterly deſtructive of their Ceremonies, that they ought to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void all fellowſhip with thoſe who profeſs them.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Jews</hi> have taught their Children ſome decent Modes of Salutation, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed them with an awful Reverence of <hi>Gods Name,</hi> and the Eſſays of hating all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions but their own; Their next endeavour is to inſtruct them in the Elements of Book-learning. Where the firſt Leſſons are about the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Figure</hi> of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Letters: in which they uſe this Method: Firſt, upon a ſmooth ſtone or board they caſt two or more Letters of the Alphabet, and acquaint the Child with the Name and Figure thereof. And when the Child is able to pronounce theſe Letters, they proceed to more, according to the capacity and towardlineſs of the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. And ſo forward, till the whole Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet be run over. When this taſk is finiſhed, the children are taught to joyn the Letters into ſhort and eaſie Sillables; and having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to read a little, they are put into the firſt Book of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo paſs through the whole <hi>Pentateuch.</hi> In teaching their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59218:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to write they uſe as the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> a <hi>Plana,</hi> which is a draught of very <hi>large Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> upon a fair Paper, which they imitate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a thin Paper laid thereon.</p>
            <p>When the Parents have at home pretty-well grounded their Children in theſe preluſory Rudiments, they ſend them to School; and every Morning before they go thither, it is the Mothers Office to provide them ſomething to eat, which is ſweetned with Sugar or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; which ſerves them both for Beakfaſt and an Inſtruction. For at giving the Child the ſweet Morſel ſhe uſeth theſe words; <hi>As this is ſweet to thy Palate, ſo let Learning be ſweet to thy mind.</hi> And ſhe gives directions how to behave himſelf at School, as that he is to uſe no filthy words, but ſuch as he reads in the <hi>Law</hi>: becauſe God loves <hi>clean Lips,</hi> pure, wholſom diſcourſe, and that all communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought to be agreeable to the Divine Word. Next, that the Child muſt not ſpend his time in idle talk to his own hindrance, or his fellows. With other ſuch directions as a Mothers Care and Affection ſhall ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt.</p>
            <p>They have a ſaying very common among them, <hi>That there is no fruit at Autumn, where there is no budding in the Spring</hi>; which they apply to the Education of their Children, whoſe riper years they hope to have pious and well-governed, when their tender minds
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59218:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are duly inſtructed in Religion and Vertue. And much to this purpoſe may be met with in their Homilies.</p>
            <p>At five year old the Children go to School, where they ſpend five years in Learning the <hi>Pentateuch</hi>; and at ten year old they are put (if they prove towardly) to read the <hi>Miſchua</hi> and ſome choice parcels of the <hi>Talmud</hi>; which contain the Body of their Inſtitutes. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time that <hi>boy</hi> is learning the <hi>five books</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> he is called <hi>Ben Mickra,</hi> the Son of the Law; and when he is thirteen year old he is <hi>Ben Mitzva, the Son of the Precept:</hi> for now the youth receives the <hi>Paſsover</hi> and is purified. For until he comes to be <hi>a Son of the Commandment,</hi> the Father ſtands charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Miſcarriages. But at thirteen year old the Lad being ſuppoſed to be able to diſcern Vertue from Vice, and Good from Evil, he is bound to anſwer for his faults. Therefore the Father having before a Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of ten antient <hi>Jews</hi> declared that his Son whom he there produces has been well Catechized in the Law, and underſtands the general Deciſions of the <hi>Miſchua</hi> and <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud,</hi> and that he can repeat the dayly Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, he lets them know that he no longer chargeth himſelf with his Crimes, but that he leaves him to anſwer therein for himſelf, and to be puniſhed if he ſhall be delinquent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Commandments. Where note by
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59218:50"/>
the way, that by <hi>Commandments</hi> here muſt not be underſtood either the Decalogue or the Ritual of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but thoſe 313 Precepts into which they have reſolved their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and the Bible. <hi>Druſius</hi> (in <hi>Exod.</hi> 26.) obſerves, that the <hi>Jews</hi> old manner of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting was by Interrogations and Queſtions, or Catechiſm. By which preſent Method there is no youth under Heaven can at thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years old give ſo exact account of the Rites of their Religion as the Jewiſh.</p>
            <p>I meddle not here with the ſpecial places which were of old appointed for the Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of youth, becauſe thoſe ancient <hi>Gebaoth</hi> or Colledges, Houſes of Doctrine, and Hills of the Teachers, which the <hi>Divine writings</hi> often mention, are now faln under a fatal Devaſtation. Neither doth it concern the preſent Subject to reflect upon the <hi>Miſhne,</hi> or Colledge in <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> where the <hi>Repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the Law was Studied: this being alſo extinct. Only I obſerve at this day the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Barbary,</hi> like their neighbour <hi>Moors,</hi> are wholly deſtitute of Places for liberal Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore when any of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Studie Phyſick or the like, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair <hi>incognito</hi> to the <hi>European</hi> Univerſities, and more eſpecially to thoſe of <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return: The Jewiſh Fathers are not more careful in the Catechiſm of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59218:50"/>
than the Mothers in their Nurſerie. In which they do not follow their own delicacie, but the preſcriptions of their Maſters: who appoint that the Nurſe (who is always the Mother, unleſs ſome unavoidable neceſſity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe) eat ſuch Viands as yield good nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment, to the end that the child may the ſooner grow up, and come to the publick Worſhip, and take the impreſſions of their Religion. And the Mother who is diligent herein, is ſaid <hi>To walk</hi> in the wayes of the Lord: (for ſo they are taught to underſtand <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.9.) who feeds his Creatures with a <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>aſonable and liberal hand. They have very odd conceits about the Situation of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Breaſts, which they uſe as natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of affection and tenderneſs toward their Infants. And to imprint in the woman a greater averſeneſs to nurſe their children at anothers Boſome, their Maſters tell them ſtrange Stories of ſeveral men who have been miraculouſly enabled to give their children ſuck upon the death of their wives.</p>
            <p>During the time of Nurſing, the women are not permitted to go with open Breſts, nor to keep Faſts, nor to expoſe their tender Sucklings to the Sun or Moon. Neither when the Child is able, do they permit it to go bare-headed out of doors, becauſe on a time one of their Maſters ſeeing a child in this poſture, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced it unlawfully begotten, and that his
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59218:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Mother was either menſtruous or unchaſte in her Embraces.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> uſually Girdle their children as ſoon as their bodies will endure it; and when they are grown up none of them go ungirt to the Synagogues: for if they ſhould do ſo, they think that not only thereby the benefit of the Prayers is forfeited, but alſo the Divine diſpleaſure is provoked. Hence is that ſaying, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngirt, unbleſs'd.</hi> Albeit I know the <hi>Jews</hi> uſe to Girdle their children, leſt from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuition of their own nakedneſs, they ſhould imbibe an immodeſt Confidence.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>THe Synagogue in the <hi>N. T.</hi> is often taken for any place of publick concourſe: But its uſual acception is either Civil or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick. In the former acception it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes the place of their Conſiſtories and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatures; in the later the Houſe or Room where the Law and Prophets are read and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and the whole Syſtem of <hi>publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> performed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:59218:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>The <hi>Rulers</hi> or <hi>Chief</hi> of the Synagogue, or ſuch as negotiated their Myſteries, were dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the Rulers of the Conſiſtory or Judicature. But we are here to ſpeak of the Synagogue as a place wherein they tolerated the publick Exerciſe of Religious Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Which Toleration the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> purchaſe with their Coin. For it is uſual with the <hi>Moreſco</hi> Governours, when faln in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any Exigence of Moneys, to ſhut up the <hi>Jews</hi> Synagogue, out of certain experience that its Redemption is the readieſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidie.</p>
            <p>In this part of the World, the ſenſe of their Ambulatory condition will not permit the <hi>Jews</hi> to be at the pains and charges of Erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new Synagogues. But they hire Houſes or ſingle Apartments proportionable to their Number, to aſſemble in. In whoſe Furniture they ſeem to neglect all other <hi>Ornament</hi> and <hi>Sumptuouſneſs</hi> but cleanlineſs and decency. But as if they vyed the ſtore of <hi>Moreſco</hi> Moſchs, they ſtrive much to have their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues numerous. And in this they do not recede from the practice of their Anceſtors, who had four hundred and eighty Synagogues at once in <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> So <hi>Sigonius, de Rep. Hebr. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 8. And in other Provinces and Cities (as we read in the <hi>Acts</hi>) there was the like plenty. And the numerouſneſs of theſe Holy Houſes may eaſily be granted, ſeeing
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59218:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that a very few make up a Jewiſh Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. For they have a Tradition, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ten men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are, there ought to be a Synagogue.</p>
            <p>Of old, the <hi>Jews</hi> wrote the Entrances of their Synagogues with devout and cautionary Sentences, as <hi>Buxtorf</hi> hath obſerved in ſeveral Pages of his Abbreviatures; which Cuſtom is wholly out of faſhion with the <hi>Jews</hi> here diſcourſed of: which ſeems chiefly to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the uncertain tenure of the Houſes which they hire for Synagogues, and not to any diſlike of the practice. For doubtleſs the Inſcriptions now ſpoken of were very laudable, as directing thoſe who enter'd in their deportment in the Divine Worſhip. Of old, the Walls within as well as Entrances of the Synagogues were written with Sentences tending to the ſame purpoſe: As, <hi>Enter the Houſe of the Lord thy God with humility: Be attentive in time of Prayer; Think upon thy Creator,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To every Synagogue there belongs ſix Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; firſt the <hi>Summas,</hi> or <hi>Sacriſtan,</hi> anſwerable to our Sexton: whoſe Office is to ſweep &amp; keep clean the Synagogue, and to trim the Lamps. The Second is the <hi>Pernas,</hi> to whom belongs the care of providing the Holy Wine, which is given to the <hi>Youth</hi> at the entrance and end of their Sabbaths and Feſtivals. The Third Officer is the <hi>Mari-Acatab,</hi> who folds up and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59218:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
unfolds the Law, and ſhows it to the people. The fourth (whoſe title I remember not) is he to whom belongs the Elevation of the Law, and the bearing it in <hi>proceſſion</hi> through the Synagogue; which is an honourable Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and his who gives moſt. The fifth Office belongs to the <hi>Elhaim,</hi> or thoſe who touch the two ſtaves (which they call the trees of life) whereon the Law is rolled up, when it is carryed in <hi>proceſſion.</hi> The ſixth is the <hi>Cheſau</hi> (or <hi>Praecentor.</hi>) All theſe Offices are bought and ſold upon the day when the laſt Section of the Law is read, and without a new Election are not held above a year by the ſame perſons. To expreſs their Zeal to the Service of God, they canvas for theſe Offices, and give Monies to obtain them, which goes to the Poor-ſtock. The <hi>folding up and unfolding of the Law,</hi> being an Office of the greateſt eſteem, none carry it but he who is able to give liberally to the <hi>Corban</hi>; by which they raiſe a comfortable ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for thoſe are grown indigent: as in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Chapter we ſhall have occaſion to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p>Their times of repairing to the Synagogue, or <hi>hours of Prayer,</hi> are next to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. To the Holy Exerciſe of Prayer, the <hi>Jews</hi> thrice every day aſſemble at their Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories; firſt at Sun-riſing, which they call <hi>Tephilla Sabarit,</hi> or Morning-Prayer. Their
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59218:53"/>
ſecond time of going to the Synagogue is about three in the Afternoon, which is their <hi>Tephilla Mincha,</hi> or Evening-Prayer. The laſt is after <hi>Sun-ſet,</hi> and this they call the <hi>Tephilla Arvit,</hi> or Night-Prayer. To every one of which times there are proper Offices appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as is to be ſeen in the <hi>Sepher Tephilot.</hi> But the Office for the Morning far exceeds the other two in length. For they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two hours in the Synagogue at Morning-Prayer, and not above half ſo much at both the other.</p>
            <p>They have no perfect difference between <hi>Proſeuchae,</hi> Synagogues, Schools and Houſes of Prayer, as was of old. For if there be or ever was herein <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            </argument>
            <p>THe apprehenſion of the Divine Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Majeſty of God, which by all Civilized Religions is acknowledged for the ſole and proper object of their Worſhip, hath moved men of all Faiths to ordain ſome Rites of preparation to ſo ſolemn an Addreſs. This I have already obſerved in <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſm,</hi> the moſt conſiderable Religion for ſecular Grandeur in the World. And the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Judaiſm is no way thereunto inferiour in this particular. For before the <hi>Jews</hi> go to the Synagogue to celebrate the Publick Service of God, they carefully obſerve all ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations as they have learned from Cuſtom, Superſtition, or their Maſters. In whoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation they are rather too punctual and preciſe, than any way negligent or remiſs. And firſt of all, the <hi>Jews</hi> are vigilant to Pray betimes in the morning, out of an Opinion that the more early the Oraiſon, the more acceptable it is to God. And this they found on the third Verſe of the fifth <hi>Pſalm: My voice ſhalt thou hear betimes, O Lord; early in the

Morning will I direct my Prayer unto thee, and will look up.</hi> When at any time they find themſelves backward to theſe Morning-Devotions, they upbraid it with their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs to purſue their Secular intereſt, and ſhew how far the concerns of Religion doth exceed all worldly buſineſs: and that their care to ſeek God ought at leaſt to equal that in ſeeking <hi>Mammon.</hi> There is a ſaying com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all <hi>Jews; That in Winter they raiſe the day, and in Summer the day them.</hi> The meaning whereof depends upon their riſing before day to Prayers from the fifteenth of <hi>June</hi> till <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> and after from <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> till the fifteenth of <hi>June.</hi> Let the Reader un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it.</p>
            <p>There are ſome <hi>Jews</hi> who to be eſteemed Devout, riſe very early every morning to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ruines of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> and the Temple: and they hope by the merit of ſo doing to move God to haſten their reparation, and the reſtoring of the Kingdom to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And there are thoſe who believe that the <hi>Planets</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> weep with thoſe who in the night ſhed tears for the City: and that when they run down their cheeks, God puts the tears in a bottle, and keeps them to blot out all the Edicts which at any time ſhall be made by their Enemies for their Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>But to return to their Mattens. There is a general Tradition among the <hi>Jews,</hi> That at
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59218:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
night the Gates of Heaven are ſhut up, and that the good Angels ſit ſilent by them, and that the Evil Spirits are then at liberty to wander up and down to effect their projects: And that a little after Midnight the Gates of Heaven are opened with ſo great a noiſe, that the Cocks here below are therewith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken'd, and Crow to awaken them to their Prayers: And that this might not be thought to be the melancholy of ſome few imagining <hi>Jews,</hi> they have put it into their general Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie, wherein for this good Office of the Cock they thus give thanks: <hi>Bendito tu</hi> Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai, <hi>nueſtro Dio Rey del Mundo d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But the Oraiſons we have now been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of relate to their private Devotions, which are preparative to the publick. To which later they are not ſuffer'd to repair till they have dreſſed their bodies according to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. And to a ſtranger they ſeem here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in very antick and humourſom. For begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with their Shirt, that muſt not be put on but after ſuch a ſecret manner, that the very beams of the houſe muſt not be privy to their Nakedneſs; and therefore they creep under the Counterpane or Coverlet while they put
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59218:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
on their Mutands. And for this they cite and praiſe the Example of one Maſter <hi>Joſe,</hi> who upon his Death-bed gave God thanks that through the whole courſe of his life the timber of his Bed never diſcovered his <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral retirements.</hi> Much of this ſtuff might be ſet down relating to their preſent manner of dreſſing themſelves, as how that the left-foot-ſhooe muſt be put on before the right, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the love of brevity has prevailed with me to omit them.</p>
            <p>When they have accoutred themſelves for the Synagogue, at the leaving of their Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they are commanded moderately to bow down their Heads, to expreſs thereby their great ſadneſs for the deſolation of the Temple. Before they go to publick Prayers they uſe all manner of needful Evacuations of the Body; and when for this purpoſe they enter their Retraits, the Devouter beſeech the Angels to ſtay at door till they come out: whom they thus accoſt.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Moſt Holy and moſt Glorious Miniſters of the moſt High, I beſeech you keep, preſerve and help me: wait till I go in and come out: for this is the cuſtom and way of all men.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>They account it a hainous Sin to retard the Natural Purgations of the Body, becauſe thereby they may incur Diſtempers. And to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59218:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this unſavoury purpoſe they alledge <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.25. but for what reaſon, is not ſo eaſily to be comprehended.</p>

And the hands, which (according to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters) after ſleep are venemous and impure (by reaſon of the noxious ſpirits lodged as they opine in the palms thereof when they are aſleep) are firſt of all to be punctually waſht. For they hold, that if a <hi>Jew</hi> ſhould touch his eyes, noſe, ears or mouth with unwaſht hands, he ſhould be troubled with dimneſs of Sight, Catarrhs, Deafneſs, and a ſtinking Breath. In waſhing their hands they hold them up, that the water may run down to their Elbows. Which elevation of their hands, Ceremony of waſhings, help to explain the <gap reason="foreign">

ſtrict Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> in this particular, but of the Tradition of their Elders, or injunctions of their Antient <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> by which they are bound to waſh not only when they go to the Synagogue, but alſo whenſoever they eat.

               <p>Of the <hi>Jews Zizith</hi> and <hi>Tephillim,</hi> or <hi>Phylactery</hi> or <hi>Prayer-Ornaments.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>WHen the <hi>Jews</hi> prepare for Morning-Service they with ſingular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection put on their <hi>Zizith</hi> and <hi>Tephillim,</hi> which are properly their Prayer-Ornaments, and ſo neceſſary an accoutrement for the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, that they are the chief Cognizances and badges of Religion, without which they cannot hope that their Church-Services ſhould be accepted. The wearing of the <hi>Zizith</hi> or Fringe, they collect from <hi>Exodus</hi> 15.37. And they very confidently aſſert, that a careful obſervation of the Commandment concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Zizith,</hi> is a fulfilling of the whole Law. And they ground this peremptory po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition upon a Myſtery which their <hi>Gemalria</hi> has found in the word and manner of its making. For (ſay they) the <hi>Zizith</hi> hath five knots repreſenting the five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the eight threds added thereunto make thirteen, which together with the <hi>Numeral Letters</hi> in the word it ſelf amount to ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirteen, which is the number of all the Commandments contained in the Law.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59218:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And therefore they conclude that the right wearing of the <hi>Zizith</hi> is an obſervation of the whole Law. <hi>Credat Judaeus!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as to the form and matter of the <hi>Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zith,</hi> it is a quadrangular piece of Linnen-cloth (or Silk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) with Fringes, worn next the Shirt, hanging down upon the Breaſt and Shoulders. At the putting of it on, they uſe theſe words:— <hi>Bendito tu A. N. B. Rey del mundo,</hi> &amp;c. Bleſſed be thou, O Lord our God, King of the World, who haſt ſanctified us with thy Precepts, and commanded us to wear the <hi>Zizith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this Religious Utenſil no fewer Miracles are aſcribed then to the Cowle of St. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis:</hi> for the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay it can deliver from ſin, and make Proſelytes to their Faith: And that it is an Amulet againſt Sorceries, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves thoſe from receiving any hurt from evil Angels who conſtantly put it on. But all are not admitted to the honour of wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Holy Ornament: for it being a part of the habit to be worn at the Synagogue, the women are totally forbid it, as being excluded the publick Service.</p>
            <p>Their next Prayer-Ornament is the <hi>Tephil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim,</hi> which are Scrowles of Parchment writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with ſeveral Sentences of the Law; and tyed upon their Fore-heads and left-Arms. And this they obſerve upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſixth of <hi>Deut.</hi> the ſixth and eighth
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59218:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Verſes. The Sentences wherewith the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacteries were antiently inſcribed, are conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured to have been <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. from verſe the 11<hi>th</hi> to the 17<hi>th, Exod.</hi> 13.2. to the 11<hi>th, Deut.</hi> 6. from verſe 4. to the 10<hi>th,</hi> and <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. from the 13<hi>th</hi> to the 22. Others are of Opinion that the Phylacteries were written with the Decalogue. But for mine own part, I believe the Inſcription to be concealed: for the <hi>Jews</hi> with whom I have practiſed in this particular, would not be moved either to ſhow or explain their Phylacteries. At the putting them on, they ſay this Euchariſt: <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dito tu,</hi> &amp;c. Bleſſed be thou O God our Lord, Governour of the Univerſe, who haſt hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed us with thy Law, and commanded us to wear the <hi>Tephillim. i. e.</hi> Phylacteries.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Phylactery</hi> worn upon the Fore-head is folded up, and hangs between the <hi>brows,</hi> ſo as they may ſee it, and thereby be minded of walking according to Gods Statutes. There has been no ſmall diſpute among the Criticks and Interpreters concerning the Name and Office of the <hi>Tephillim</hi>: but if they will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in the meaning which the Modern <hi>Jews</hi> give thereof, they ſignifie no more than <hi>Ornaments</hi> to be worn at <hi>publick Prayer,</hi> in which ſuch Sentences of Scripture are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as they deem moſt proper to remember them of their Duties, according to the firſt appointment hereof, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.8.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59218:58"/>
'Tis true, the firſt, plain, and wholeſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thereof has in courſe of time been much corrupted chiefly by the Schiſmatical <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,</hi> who in ſtead of binding them for a <hi>ſign</hi> upon their <hi>hands,</hi> and as <hi>Frontlets</hi> between their <hi>Eyes,</hi> hung them as Charms about their Necks, ſuppoſing in them a ſecret Power to defend them from Dangers. Out of which corruption 'tis probable did ariſe that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Cuſtom of ſome women in St. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s time, of wearing their <hi>Parvula Evangelia,</hi> or ſhort Sentences of the Goſpel, to keep them from Inchantments and other Miſchiefs. And at this day the Papiſts permit the wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about their Necks the beginning of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, as a <hi>Defenſative</hi> from Evil. That the wearing hereof was not unlawful, ſome produce Chriſts wearing them for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Argument, St. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.44. but the Fringe or Border of the Garment there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd may belong to the <hi>Zizith,</hi> but no way to the <hi>Tephillim.</hi> However, the <hi>Jews</hi> were not condemn'd by our Saviour for the <hi>uſe,</hi> but <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> of this <hi>Ornament</hi>: and becauſe they made their Phylacteries larger and broader than commanded, and this too to the end that they might appear more holy than others. And we may conceive the whole matter to be briefly thus: <hi>Tephillim</hi> or Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacteries are with the later <hi>Jews</hi> become a great part of their Religion, which they
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59218:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ground upon the laſt mention'd Texts, taking them in a literal, which were intended in a figurative ſenſe, according to their explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.7. But this carnal people, which have ever been apt to turn all <hi>inward Piety</hi> into <hi>outward form,</hi> and to make that matter of Ambition and Oſtentation, which was deſigned for humility and holineſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Precept concerning the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacteries meerly according to the <hi>Letter.</hi> And therefore make them Scrowles of Parchment, in which they write the four Sections of the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> which were named before; and wear them on their Arms and Foreheads. As we have ſaid already.</p>
            <p>In preparing theſe Scrowles, theſe Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are ſtill in uſe: firſt, the ſkins whereof they are made muſt be of Beaſts which the Law has pronounced clean. Secondly, none but a <hi>Jew</hi> muſt kill the Beaſt and dreſs the ſkin for this purpoſe: for if a Chriſtian, or in their Language, any other <hi>Edomite</hi> have a hand therein, it is wolly polluted and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable. Thirdly, the Ink wherewith the Sections of the Law are writ, muſt not be black, nor of the ordinary confection. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they muſt be writ with the <hi>right hand,</hi> without interlining. Theſe, with other ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceties concerning columning and cutting the Parchments, are uſed about the Phylacte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. And being thus Canonically made, they
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59218:59"/>
ſit and apply them to their Foreheads and Hand-wriſts, and call them <hi>Tephillim,</hi> becauſe they are eſpecially uſed in Praying. The Greek <hi>Phylacteria</hi> relates to the end hereof, namely to keep the Law in memory. Though there is a preſent ſuperſtition which layes claim to the Phylacteries, becauſe they keep thoſe that wear them from Sorceries and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, and the <hi>Malus Genius.</hi> Now what is principally blameable herein, is their affixing on God their own carnal obſervation and frivolous Ceremonies of theſe <hi>Tephillim,</hi> as if they were his own Inſtitution and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And it was the peculiar fault of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> to wear the <hi>Tephillim</hi> of a greater breadth than any other <hi>Jews,</hi> that they might be looked upon as perſons of a greater Sanctity than the reſt.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>THrice every day (as we have ſaid) the <hi>Jews</hi> repair to the Synagogue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59218:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
herein they expreſs a great chearfulneſs and delight. For they leave their houſes in a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty poſture, and with great willingneſs; and ſeem to ſtrive who ſhall be firſt at the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue. But they return thence in a far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner. For when they leave the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue they go backward, and uſe a very ſlow pace therein. By which they teſtifie their delight in Gods publick Worſhip, and their unwillingneſs to go from it. And they interpret <hi>Hoſea</hi> 6.3. of that diſpatch, ready<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and alacrity wherewith they ought to come unto Gods Houſe. And to thoſe who are backward and come late to the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, they apply that of <hi>Eſay</hi> 50.2. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there no man to anſwer?</hi> And of him who comes not to Prayers at all, they underſtand <hi>Eſay</hi> 50.10, 11.</p>
            <p>At the Entrance of the Synagogue they either make clean or put off their ſhooes, in obedience to <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4.17. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Put off thy ſhooes,</hi> &amp;c. And this ſaves them the uncovering of their Heads: for their little black brimleſs Caps are never moved all the time they ſtay in the Synagogue.</p>
            <p>At their ſtepping into the Synagogue, they firſt ſpend a few minutes in the meditation of his Attributes whom they come to invoke; which is to beget in them a Deportment humble and reverend. And when they have
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59218:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
duly poſſeſſed their minds with an awful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of Gods Majeſty, they repeat to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.5. <hi>How goodly are thy Tents, O</hi> Jacob, <hi>and thy Tabernacles, O</hi> Iſrael! And <hi>Pſalm</hi> 26.8. <hi>O Lord, I have loved the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of thy houſe, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.</hi> And the 6<hi>th</hi> Verſe of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 95. <hi>O come let us worſhip, and bow down: let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.</hi> This Meditation being ended, they lay the right hand upon the heart, and bowing their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies toward the Cheſt where the Law is laid up, they begin the publick Service with the 7<hi>th</hi> of the fifth <hi>Pſalm: I will come into thy houſe in the multitude of thy mercies, and humble my ſelf with fear in the Temple of thy Holineſs:</hi> So it is <hi>Verbatim</hi> in an old <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tranſlation of the Jewiſh Lytur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie.</p>
            <p>They Pray ſtanding, girt, with their faces toward <hi>Canaan,</hi> their heads moderately bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down, and hands upon their heart. They utter their Prayers in a ſort of Plain-Song, ſometimes ſtraining their Voices to a very harſh and unpleaſant Note, and then on a ſudden letting it fall into a kind of whiſper. Their bodies are always in a wagging un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteddy poſture: which they ſay expreſſes joy and ſatisfaction in Devotion. But to him that knows not the intent hereof, this wavering and (ſometime) exulting of the body, will
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59218:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſeem very careleſs and negligent, and that they Pray with none, or very little intention and devotion of mind.</p>
            <p>Thoſe which cannot read the Service in <hi>Hebrew</hi> (who are but few) are bound to learn when to ſay <hi>Amen.</hi> A thing the more eaſily attain'd unto, becauſe they have a <hi>preſcript Form.</hi> And how heedleſs ſoever they may appear in other parts of Prayer, yet they uſe a ſignal diligence in the right timing and pronouncing of the [<hi>Amen.</hi>] Becauſe who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſaith it with all his might, the Gate of the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> is open'd to him.</p>
            <p>In time of Prayers none are permitted open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſpit, belch, yawn, or blow the Noſe. All which they do with great Secrecy in the Synagogue, when they have occaſion. Neither may they ſpit, or any ſuch thing, to the right hand or before them; becauſe of the Angels, which have made thoſe places their Situation in the Synagogue.</p>
            <p>And from this ſhort Account of the <hi>Jews</hi> entering, and behaviour in the Synagogue; we come to take a general view of the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers made therein. And here we ſhall follow the <hi>Breviary</hi> in preſent uſe with the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Barbary,</hi> which was Printed at <hi>Venice</hi> in the 1622 Year of Grace.</p>
            <p>And firſt of all, they begin the Morning-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice with the eighteen <hi>Benedictions,</hi> of which, ſaith <hi>Moſes Maimon, Ezra</hi> was the Author.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59218:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> returned from the Captivity, their Native Language was ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with that of their Bondage, that they were not able to praiſe or ſerve God in a continued Speech: And upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion <hi>Ezra</hi> is thought to have compoſed eighteen ſhort <hi>Benedictions,</hi> wherein they might praiſe God, and beg at his hands the ſupply of his dayly bleſſings. But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are of opinion that theſe eighteen <hi>Benedictions</hi> were compoſed as a <hi>Directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> whereby they might guide themſelves both in the private and publick Service of God: to which purpoſe they are imployed at this day.</p>
            <p>After the <hi>Benedictions,</hi> follows a large Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for Sacrifice and Oblations: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with the Hiſtory of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s going to Offer up his Son. To this ſucceeds a long courſe of <hi>Pſalms</hi>: then a tedious Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. Then a Confeſſion of Sins; at the ſaying whereof they throw themſelves pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and expreſs a great ſenſe of their own vileneſs and miſery, and that they have no ſtrength but in the Almighty. Then all on the ſudden they ſtart up, and comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Oath God made unto <hi>Ahra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> when he went to Sacrifice his only Son. And now with great chearfulneſs they bleſs their Lot, that God has choſen them for his Heritage and the people of his Covenant.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59218:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But beſides all this, they have in this Office a peculiar Thanksgiving for the Delivery of the <hi>Law</hi>; and a Prayer (which they ſay with a low voice) for the reſtauration of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; That in their dayes God would rebuild the Houſe of his Sanctuary, which they hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope for. And they ſhut all with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God would lead them in his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and make plain his way before them.</p>
            <p>And this is the ſum of their dayly <hi>Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Service</hi>; for whoſe more regular Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there are Rubricks intermingled with it, directing them to the Reſponſes, Praiſes, and how every part muſt come in courſe. This Morning-Office (as was ſaid) is very long; for which they make ſufficient amends in the <hi>brevity</hi> of the other two. In ſome places they have a Cuſtom for thoſe to ſhut the <hi>Prayer-Book</hi> who are at <hi>Variance</hi> with their Neighbours: thereby ſignifying that they will not Pray at all, becauſe they cannot pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, till the difference be reconciled. At the ſaying of [<hi>Give Ear O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the Lord our God is one God,</hi>] they turn themſelves <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>North</hi>: at the pronouncing of [<hi>Holy, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Holy Lord God of Sabbath,</hi>] they jump up three times. They dare not turn their Backs on the Cheſt where the <hi>Law</hi> is depoſit; and leſt they ſhould do otherwiſe, they go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward out of the Synagogue, having their
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59218:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
eyes always fixed thereon. They are very careful that nothing may interrupt them in their Devotions, at which if they ſneeze, they account it a lucky token of being therein ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, but to break wind prepoſterouſly is a very unhappy abodement.</p>
            <p>I have omitted in the former Paragraph to obſerve that after the appointed courſe of <hi>Pſalms</hi> they have two Leſſons; the firſt out of the Law, which is always read by the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſán,</hi> or ſome eminent <hi>Jew.</hi> The ſecond Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is taken out of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and is read by any ordinary <hi>Jew</hi> who is able to read di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly. And in the difference of the perſons imployed in theſe <hi>Leſſons,</hi> they ſhow the great value and eſteem which they have for the <hi>Law</hi> above the <hi>Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is an univerſal Agreement among the <hi>Jews</hi> of all Countries, that they ought every day to repeat a hundred <hi>Benedictions</hi>; which they thus compute: At w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Which if they reckon right make up the ſum.</p>
            <p>At the ſaying of the <hi>Benediction</hi> for Gods giving them the Law, they ſtand up with
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59218:62"/>
their heels joyn'd together, and their toes opened, bowing their heads toward <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> They have alſo a Prayer which is ſaid by the Prieſt alone, wherein he deſires God that he would be pleaſed to pardon all thoſe who have been negligent and unattentive at the time of Prayer. But I could not finde this Prayer in their <hi>Breviary,</hi> though with ſome curioſity I peruſed it to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>Beſides the Sabbath, they keep <hi>Monday</hi> and <hi>Thurſday</hi> as weekly <hi>Holy days.</hi> On each of which they read three Sections of the Law: the firſt by a <hi>Koên,</hi> whom they ſuppoſe to be deſcended of <hi>Aaron</hi>; the ſecond by a Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Levite</hi>; and the third Section by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Jew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As concerning the keeping of <hi>Monday</hi> and <hi>Thurſday Holy,</hi> and reading the <hi>Law</hi> thereon as well as on the Sabbath, after a more Solemn manner: the Vulgar <hi>Jews</hi> give no other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof but Cuſtom and the Pleaſure of the Maſters. But thoſe who pretend to give a <hi>Rationale</hi> of their Rites, refer it to an Inſtitution of <hi>Ezdras,</hi> grounded upon the peoples wandring three dayes without water in the Deſart of <hi>Sur,</hi> in memory whereof he appointed the Law to be thrice ſolemnly read every week. Now to be without water, ſay they, is to be without the Law: for which interpretation they bring <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.1.

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>IT is a Canon ſtrictly obſerved by the <hi>Jews,</hi> That a Book of the Law is neceſſary to the Conſtitution of a Synagogue: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59218:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the firſt thing they provide in order to ſet up a Synagogue, is a Copy of the Law, and a Cheſt or Ark wherein to lay it up. Now that which is called the Book of the Law is, The <hi>Pentateuch</hi> written in a large Character on Parchment, which is dreſſed according to the manner of the <hi>Phylacteries.</hi> The Parchment is rolled up upon two ſtaves, to make it the more convenient to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in Proceſſion. It is alſo uſually wrapt up in a covering of Linnen, Silk, Tiſſue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for the piece of Tapiſtry pictured with divers Birds, which was the old-faſhion'd Covering of the Ark, the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Barbary</hi> uſe no ſuch thing, for they abhor all manner of Imagery in their Service, as minding them of the Idolatry of their Fathers, for which they conceive themſelves to be ſtill puniſhed; and alſo out of an averſeneſs to be thought to imitate thoſe Chriſtians, who have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively introduced Pictures into their Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, not only for Ornament but Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Law: The <hi>Jews</hi> pay <hi>the five Books of Moſes</hi> ſo great a <hi>Reverence,</hi> that they never ſuffer them to be taken out of the <hi>Cheſt,</hi> or looked upon, but on three dayes (namely <hi>Monday, Thurſday</hi> and <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>) when they are read: and this too in the Morning, becauſe it is eſteemed the pureſt part of the day. 'Tis true, they uſe alſo to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59218:65"/>
ſhow the <hi>Law</hi> to the people on the Sabbath-night, but it is becauſe the whole <hi>day</hi> is <hi>hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</hi> The taking out of the <hi>Law</hi> belongs to a <hi>Noted Rabbi,</hi> or in his abſence to one of the more ancient and <hi>Devouter Jews.</hi> But to carry it in <hi>Proceſſion</hi> within the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> is ſold to him who is able to give moſt for the <hi>Place.</hi> As we have obſerved in the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Synagogue. At the taking out of the Law, the Officer turns himſelf to the <hi>people,</hi> and repeats this Verſicle: <hi>Come and extol God with me, and let us praiſe his Name together.</hi> And at the <hi>Elevation of the Law,</hi> the people bow their Faces toward it, and make a long Reſpond, wherein they declare their own vileneſs, and magnifie the Majeſty of God. And when the <hi>Rabbi holds up the Law</hi> and opens it, he ſpeaks theſe words: <hi>This is the Law which</hi> Moſes <hi>laid before the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and which proceeded from God, whoſe ways are all juſt: The word of the Lord is pure, and a defence to all thoſe who believe it.</hi> When the <hi>Law</hi> is carried from the Ark to the place where it is appointed to be read, all the people there preſent ſing the <hi>Hymn</hi> of <hi>Moſes, Numb.</hi> 10.35. <hi>Riſe up Lord, and let thine Enemies be ſcatter'd, and let them that hate thee flee before thee.</hi> By which they wiſh and pray for the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all thoſe who are not of their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> When they carry the Law either to the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59218:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Reading-place</hi> or in <hi>Proceſſion,</hi> there is always one who ſteps up to <hi>him</hi> that carries it, and kiſſeth the <hi>Covering thereof</hi>; for it were to defile the Law, to kiſs either the Letters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or the Parchment whereon they are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. And he who doth this, with a Voice moderately elevated <hi>bleſſeth</hi> God for having made the <hi>Jews</hi> his peculiar people, and that he hath given them his Law. When the Book returns from <hi>Proceſſion,</hi> and has put on its <hi>Coverings,</hi> all the <hi>Males</hi> in the Synagogue kiſs it in Order, as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do their <hi>Pax:</hi> and when they have done, the <hi>Officer</hi> gives the Book an <hi>Elevation,</hi> and ſo lays it up in the Cheſt. And as it returns thither they ſay the words of <hi>Moſes</hi> at the reſting of the Ark, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.36. <hi>Return, O Lord, unto the ten thouſand thouſands of</hi> Iſrael.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pentateuch</hi> is divided into fifty two <hi>Sections,</hi> to the end that it may be read over upon the fifty two Sundaies in the Year. And in reading it they are bound to be very plain, audible, and articulate. Becauſe every tittle thereof is of ſingular weight and moment. The laſt Leſſon conſtantly falls upon <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> the twenty fifth, which immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Feaſt of Tabernacles. And when this Section is read over, the <hi>Chaſans,</hi> or thoſe who read the Law, declare a great joy and ſatisfaction, that they lived to make an end of the <hi>Annual Leſſon.</hi> They alſo praiſe God
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59218:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that notwithſtanding the many Miſeries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faln them, they are ſtill in poſſeſſion of the Law, in which all other Bleſſings are abridg'd.</p>
            <p>On the day when this laſt Section is read, all the Copies of the Law are brought forth of the Ark, about which the people dance in imitation and remembrance of <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.16. During the time that the Law is out of the Ark, they place <hi>burning Torches</hi> therein, in token that the Law performs all the duties of a light to thoſe that obey it. On this day alſo the Elder <hi>Jews</hi> make themſelves merry in ſeeing the Youth ſcramble for the fruits they caſt among them. On this day alſo are ſold the <hi>Offices</hi> of the Synagogue to them that will give moſt. And all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing orderly conſummate, every one leaves the Synagogue with this Prayer: <hi>The Lord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve my going out, and my coming in, from henceforth and for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing that we are to account for in this Chapter, is the Manner of their keeping the Sabbath, and the Offices thereon celebrated. A Theme large enough for a whole Volume, if we were to give an exact deſcription of all <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Caſes</hi> thereunto belonging. But I ſhall confine the diſcourſe at preſent, to the Cuſtoms of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Barbary,</hi> among whom and the reſt of the Jewiſh Nation there is but ſmall diſagreement in the <hi>Sabbatarian
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59218:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Ritual.</hi> Though it muſt be confeſſed that the <hi>Barbary-Jews</hi> are neither ſo <hi>ſtrict</hi> nor <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious</hi> in this matter, as the <hi>Jews</hi> of other Countries, if we may believe the account which good Authours have given of the later.</p>
            <p>The whole Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſufficiently accord in the notice of the word Sabbath, and grant that it barely ſignifies no more than Reſt; and that ſometimes too it is uſed both for working-dayes and Feſtivals, and that it puts on a more peculiar and reſtrained ſenſe, when it is conciſely taken for that <hi>ſeventh day</hi> which God ſet apart for his Worſhip. And in the Obſervation of this <hi>Sabbath</hi> or <hi>Reſt,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> practice numerous Ceremonies: ſome antecedent, and relating to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration; and others concomitant, or waiting upon the day. Their antecedent Ceremonies are ſeen in dreſſing and preparing on the Eve of the Sabbath the Victuals that are thereon to be eaten: According to the Commandment <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.23. <hi>To Morrow is the reſt of the Holy Sabbath unto the Lord; bake that which ye will bake to day, and ſeeth that ye will ſeeth,</hi> &amp;c. From which they conclude, That all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Sabbath, and for the Honor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ought to be provided over night, that there may be nothing to interrupt <hi>this Reſt.</hi> If it falls out that the Servants are not able to make all things ready, the Maſters aſſiſt
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59218:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them, to the end that the Sabbath by no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily labour may be tranſgreſſed. And they are able to cite many great <hi>Rabbins</hi> who have help'd their Servants in preparing for this <hi>Reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this ſtrict Cuſtom of dreſſing no Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals upon the Sabbath, is not univerſal with the <hi>Jews</hi> we now ſpeak off. With whom I have been entertain'd with good cheer on the Sabbath that was thereon prepared. And aſking them how they durſt or would act ſo contrary to their own pretences; the Reply was, That they thought the Crime of a low nature, if it was done without giving ſcandal to others, that is, ſecretly. Which was then the Caſe.</p>
            <p>Every Sabbath is obſerved with three Feaſts, and four Offices. The firſt Feaſt is upon the <hi>Friday</hi>-night, or rather at the very entrance and begining of the Sabbath: The ſecond is their Sabbath-dinner; and the third Feaſt concludes the Sabbath. Now the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of this triple Feaſt they deduce from the triple repetition which <hi>Moſes</hi> uſed of the word [<hi>To day</hi>] when he gave out Orders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning gathering of the <hi>Manna, Exod.</hi> 16.25. Some of the more hoſpitable and weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier <hi>Jews</hi> keep their Tables ſpread during the whole time of the Sabbath. And in this as other things they generally tread in their Fore-fathers ſteps, who were excellent at
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59218:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
turning the power and intention of the <hi>Law</hi> into <hi>Carnal Form</hi> and <hi>Superſtition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But beſides their greater <hi>apparatus</hi> in Diet for the Sabbath, they uſe other preparative Rites in order to the Solemnity of <hi>This Great Day</hi>: All which are bodily and external, and not worth our recital, if it were not to let us ſee into what follies a people may fall in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, when they have once renounced the Truth. All the <hi>Friday</hi>-afternoon is uſually taken up in Sabbatical preparations, as waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the head and hands, the trimming of their beards (whoſe corners the Graver ſort ſuffer not to be cut, according to Law) and in a peculiar Superſtition of paring their nails; on which parings they are forbid to tread; in prevention whereof they uſually burn or bury them. In like manner, they ſpend no ſmall time in whetting the Knives, and preparing other Utenſils of the Table. The women on the <hi>Friday</hi> comb and dreſs their heads, and make ready all accoutre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the body. For they eſteem a neglect in any of theſe particulars, a down-right vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of the <hi>Reſt.</hi> And becauſe their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters uſe a word for Sabbath ſignifying Queen, they think it reaſonable that they as duly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themſelves thereunto, as they would for the reception of ſo great a Perſonage. And he (ſaith the Jewiſh Canon) is greatly to be praiſed, who honoureth the Sabbath
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59218:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with his Body, Clothes and Dyet: with his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by duely dreſſing it: with his clothes, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Sabbath-days Suit: and with his dyet, which on the Sabbath ſhould be both more and better than on other dayes.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Barbary</hi> they have their Sabbath-Lamps, which are lighted by the women, to which being lighted they hold up their hands and ſay this <hi>Benediction:— Bleſſed be thou, O Lord our God, King of the World, who haſt ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied us with thy Precepts, and commanded us to light the Sabbatine-Lamps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any mans curioſity lead him to enquire into the reaſon why the Office of lighting theſe Lamps belongs to the women: I ſhall only tell him, that among many other reaſons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be given hereof, the chief is the keeping the women in minde of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of <hi>Eve,</hi> who ſeducing <hi>Adam</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, thereby put out, ſay they, and extinguiſhed his <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Glory.</hi> But the women do it upon the account of a received Opinion among them, that thereby they fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate their Child-birth. There being theſe three Precepts recommended to them for that end, <hi>viz. To keep the Sabbath-bread, light the Lamps, and carefully to attend their Months.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Sabbath-lights</hi> we now ſpeak of are ſo contrived, that they may laſt the whole Sabbath, on which they are not allowed ſo
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59218:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
much as to ſnuff them, for fear of tranſgreſſing the <hi>fourth Precept.</hi> But notwithſtanding that the <hi>Jews</hi> in this <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently rigorous in the obſervation of the Sabbath, yet I neither could finde nor hear of any of them, who would if ſurpriſed with the Sabbath, expoſe themſelves to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of abiding in Woods and Deſarts, rather than on the Sabbath to travel a few furlongs to gain a ſafer reſidence. For they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to let things neceſſary to ſave mans life thereon to be provided for. And ſome will not doubt to ſay, that if ever they be Maſters again of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> they will not looſe it for fear of tranſgreſſing the Sabbath. And they have an uſual ſaying, <hi>Paligro del alma quaebra el Sabbato:</hi> That the hazard of looſing a mans life diſpenſeth with the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</p>
            <p>They have a Cuſtom in ſome places on the <hi>Friday</hi> to put water into little pits, and to draw no place dry, to the end that the Souls in Purgatory may therein cool and refreſh them. For on the time that is over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove added to the Sabbath, they ſuppoſe the Souls in Purgatory have liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create. There are many other Rites belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereunto, the moſt whereof will fall in with the Offices: which are now to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for.</p>
            <p>Upon the <hi>Arvit</hi> or Eve of the Sabbath,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59218:69"/>
they have a peculiar Office, which begins with the twenty ninth <hi>Pſalm: Give unto the Lord, ye ſons of the mighty, give unto the Lord honour and ſtrength. Give unto the Lord the honour of his Name, and bow your ſelves to the Lord with the beauty of Holineſs. The voice of the Lord is upon the waters. The God of honour hath made it thunder. The Lord is upon much waters. The voice of the Lord is with ſtrength, the voice of the Lord is with beauty. The voice of the Lord break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Cedars, and hath broken the Cedars of</hi> Libanus. <hi>And he hath made them leap as a Calf</hi>; Libanus <hi>and</hi> Sirion <hi>like the ſons of Elephants. The voice of the Lord cutteth the flames of fire; the voice of the Lord vexeth the Wilderneſs, he vexeth the Wilderneſs of</hi> Cades. <hi>The voice of the Lord maketh the Hinds to be in pain, and diſcovereth the Foreſts, and in his Palace every thing ſpeaketh honour. The Lord hath been upon the water, and the Lord hath ſate King for ever. The Lord will give ſtrength unto his people, the Lord will bleſs his people with peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Tranſlation I have here given of this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which begins the Office of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths <hi>Arvit,</hi> is <hi>Verbatim</hi> out of the old <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> wherein the Jewiſh Liturgy is extant. And it is here inſerted for no other purpoſe, but to ſhow how it differs from our preſent Tranſlation. Where the Reader may obſerve,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59218:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the word <hi>Adonai</hi> is here and through all their Liturgy uſed for Lord; it being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unlawful for them to mention even in their Devotions the word <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this <hi>Pſalm</hi> immediately follows in their Liturgy a very large Expoſtulation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the oyl and weke, and whole confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Sabbath-Lamps. Where the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of ſeveral <hi>antient Maſters</hi> are recited concerning this matter: as the Opinions of <hi>Rabbi Iſmael, Rabbi Tarphon, Rabbi Elihezer, Rabbi Aquiba, Rabbi Jehudah.</hi> Which <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Maſter gives them leave to put out their Lamps on the Sabbath-night, for fear the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (thoſe that are not <hi>Jews</hi>) and evil Spirits ſhould do hurt therewith.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>Arvit</hi> they make confeſſion of the three ſins, for which, as hath been ſaid, women die in Child-bed. And among theſe three deadly ſins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the want of due lighting the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-Lamps is none of the leaſt.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>Arvit</hi> likewiſe when it grows dark they are bound to propound and anſwer theſe three Queſtions: <hi>Haſt thou paid Tythes? Haſt thou made the Hirub? Haſt thou lighted a Candle?</hi> After this they repeat ſuch <hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>Pſalms</hi> out of <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> as commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Gods gracious Promiſes to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of which they make a comfortable application to themſelves. There are likewiſe repeated ſome ſhort periods of Scripture relating to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59218:70"/>
the Seaſon of the year: as in the Spring— <hi>He ſhall make his dew to fall:</hi> and in Autumn— <hi>Thou makeſt the winde to blow and the rain to deſcend,</hi> &amp;c. Having done this, they uſe a Thanksgiving unto God, for that he refreſheth the dead with his mercies, and confirms his Truth to thoſe that ſleep in the duſt: that he puniſheth Apoſtates, looſeth the impriſon'd, redeemeth the captive, provideth Medicines for, and healeth the ſick. And at the end of this long Thanksgiving follows this <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction</hi> for the Inſtitution of the Sabbath.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord our God the Holy, Thou haſt Sanctified the ſeventh day for thy Glory (having firſt finiſhed the Heavens and the Earth) and haſt bleſſed it above all dayes, and ſanctified it above all times, as it is written in the Law.</hi> And here the Inſtitution of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath out of <hi>Geneſis</hi> is diſtinctly repeated.</p>
            <p>Theſe things with the reſt of the Office of the Sabbath-<hi>Arvit,</hi> which is very long, is concluded with a thankful recapitulation of Gods favours toward them, eſpecially in that he has made them his peculiar people, given them his Law, and promiſed that it ſhall never be changed, nor they deprived of it. Then they moſt humbly implore the Almighty, that at laſt he would fulfil his promiſe, retarded ſo long by reaſon of their ſins, and ſend them their deſired <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:59218:70"/>The next Office is that of the Sabbath-Morning, where the <hi>Rubrick</hi> directs them to riſe before the Sun, and to read the ordinary courſe of <hi>Pſalms</hi> till they come to the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth: And then to begin their Mattins. Which for the moſt part are collected out of the Scriptures; ſome portions wherof are ſaid by the <hi>Cazan</hi> alone, and others by the <hi>Kahal</hi> and <hi>Kohen,</hi> as the <hi>Rubrick</hi> all along directs them. This day the Law has always a ſolemn <hi>Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> and is openly ſhown to the people. When it is brought to be laid up in the <hi>Hehal</hi> or Cheſt, he that bears it ſaith theſe words: <hi>Turn again to thy reſting place, and to the houſe of thy deſire, that every Mouth and Tongue may give praiſe and glory to thy Kingdom. And turn unto the million of the thouſands of</hi> Iſrael: and, <hi>O Lord, turn us unto thee, and we ſhall be turned; renew our dayes as in former time.</hi> And with this Prayer they conclude the <hi>Morning-Office</hi> for the Sabbath.</p>
            <p>The third Office is the <hi>Muſaf</hi> or Afternoon-Service, which begins thus— <hi>O Lord, thou ſhalt open our lips, and our mouth ſhall ſhew forth thy praiſe.</hi> After they have ſaid this, they bleſs and laud God for the continuance of his favours both to <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>dead.</hi> Next, they recount how God gave their Great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Moſes</hi> the Commandment for the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. After this they make a gratulatory Oration unto God for that he has been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59218:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to aſſiſt and accept their Services. And the whole Office is ſhut up with a diſtinct enumeration of the Divine attributes: and recommending themſelves unto the Divine Protection, beſeeching God to take the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of them both when they ſleep and watch.</p>
            <p>Their fourth Office is that of the <hi>Minha,</hi> or Sabbath-night: which being of the ſame tenor with the laſt we but now mention'd, there needs no more but to name it. At the determination of the Sabbath, they have an additional <hi>Service,</hi> at which though none are bound to be, yet all are preſent, to ſhow their Devotion to the Sabbath, and how loath they are to part therewith. But others hold that they ought to protract this Reſt as long as they can poſſible, for the ſake of the Souls in Purgatory, eſpecially for ſuch as were condemn'd thither for the violation of the Sabbath.</p>
            <p>Through all their <hi>Offices</hi> there is ſtill ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing peculiarly relating to the haſtening of <hi>Elias,</hi> to the end that he may not only looſe their knots, or reſolve their ſcruples, but give them timely notice of the advent of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias.</hi> But notwithſtanding that their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for the Sabbath contain excellent things, according to <hi>their way</hi> of Worſhip, yet they have therein many things apparently trivial and ridiculous. Of which we may give ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59218:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in their praying over the Lamps, Wine and Spices which are brought unto the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue. Where the Wine being conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is carried home, that therewith they may ſprinkle their houſes, to preſerve them from Witchcraft and Sorcerous Incantations. Some likewiſe waſh therewith the parts of the <hi>Body</hi> that are infirm, and conceive that the conſecrate Wine yields preſent cure. The Spices alſo being hallowed, are made uſe of to refreſh the Soul that is left alone in the Body when the Sabbath is ended; for on that day only they hold that every Male-<hi>Jew</hi> has two Souls. But the conſecrate Wine and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have yet an higher purpoſe and vertue. For with the Spices they refreſh the Souls below on the week-dayes, becauſe the fire of Purgatory thereon is believed to ſend forth a very grievous ſtench. And by pouring ſome of the conſecrate Wine upon the ground, they imagine <hi>Corah</hi> and his fellow-Mutineers to be aſſiſted. For they are of Opinion that that factious crew are ſtill living in flames un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denyed, that albeit the Sabbath-<hi>Offices</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> are taken for the greater part out of Scripture, but that they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a very Carnal ſenſe thereof, and that the whole <hi>Reſt</hi> tends more to gratifie the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy than to ſerve God. And to engroſs this Eaſe unto themſelves, and to ſhow that the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59218:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Sabbath was purpoſely appointed for their ſakes, and that none other have thereunto any right or title, as alſo to declare their juſt Dominion over all other people in the world, the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Barbary</hi> imploy their <hi>Slaves</hi> in all manner of ſervile Offices upon this day. And on it too give ſolemn thanks unto God, <hi>That he has put no leſs difference between</hi> Iſrael <hi>and the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>than between light and darkneſs, the ſix days and the ſeventh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> obſerves out of their <hi>Rabbins</hi> that there were three things peculiarly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>; namely Circumciſion, the <hi>Tephillim,</hi> and the Sabbath. The firſt was expreſly commanded <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. the ſecond in <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. and the third, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. Now this laſt was ſo particularly commanded to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that the <hi>Jews</hi> think no <hi>Gentile</hi> has any ſhare therein; that they are not bound to its obſervation, and therefore cannot be puniſhed for the breach thereof. And upon this account, as we but now intimated, they imploy their ſervants and ſlaves who are not of their Religion, in every ſort of drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon the Sabbath: that their Doctrine may be illuſtrated by their Practice.</p>
            <p>And for a further Argument of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation of the Sabbath to the <hi>Jews,</hi> they wear thereon no Phylacteries, becauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe, the Celebration of the Sabbath is thought ſufficient to diſtinguiſh them
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59218:72"/>
from all other Religions in the World.</p>
            <p>The Jewiſh Maſters have raiſed no few diſputes concerning the cauſe and reaſon of the Inſtitution of the Sabbath: with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom it belongs: the time when its obſervation began: together with its obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation both upon the Originarie and Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte <hi>Jews.</hi> All which are induſtriouſly col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and learnedly diſcourſed by Mr. <hi>Selden, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13, <hi>&amp;c. de jure Nat. &amp; Gentium juxta Diſciplinam Hebraeorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What we have already ſet down concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Sabbatine Rites, hath reſpect unto the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Barbary,</hi> whom I find to harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize herein with the <hi>Jews</hi> of other Countries. Now becauſe the Sabbath and its <hi>Rites</hi> make up a great part of their preſent Religion, I thought it not improper to inſert the Rules of the Sabbath which are practiſed by the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean Hebrews,</hi> as they are ſet down by Mr. <hi>Buxtorf</hi> in the tenth and eleventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his Synagogue. I have been enforced to make uſe of a <hi>young Pen</hi> in the Tranſlation thereof, and to deliver them to the Preſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either Peruſal or Tranſcribing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſire the Reader to correct and pardon what faults may therein occur.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>How the <hi>Jews</hi> Prepare themſelves for the Sabbath, and how they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin it.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>WE read how the <hi>Jews</hi> prepared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the ſixth day, according to that of <hi>Exodus</hi> 16.5, 23. <hi>To morrow is the reſt of the Holy Sabbath unto the Lord; bake that which ye will bake to day, and ſeeth that which ye will ſeeth.</hi> Which they interpret of providing all neceſſary things againſt the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, that they may the better honour it; but eſpecially all Dyet is to be prepared and dreſs'd, that they may have the better leaſure to hallow the Day. And to this end, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they intend to eat on the Sabbath, they make ready on <hi>Friday</hi> before night: the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men chiefly are employed in making ſweet-meats of divers ſorts; and when they make ready their dough, they make it in a great lump undivided; but if the lump be ſo great, as it is in large families, that it muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, the remaining part is kept covered, leſt a neighbour ſeeing it may be aſhamed that others have provided for the next Sabbath, and he not for the preſent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:59218:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>Every one according to his Ability hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Day with three ſplendid Banquets. They begin the firſt on <hi>Friday</hi>-night before the Sabbath: the ſecond on <hi>Saturday</hi> at noon: the laſt in the evening of the Sabbath. And they juſtifie the performance of this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from <hi>Moſes</hi> his writings, where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Manna</hi> it is thus expreſſed: <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.25. <hi>Eat that to day, for to day is a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath unto the Lord, to day ye ſhall not find it in the fields.</hi> Here the <hi>Rabbies</hi> ſay that <hi>Moſes</hi> meant (by repeating the word Day three times) that they ſhould in their Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets on the Sabbath thrice eat of the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi> But the repetition of thoſe Banquets hath ſome other meaning, as is evident by their Book of Ceremonies written in the <hi>German</hi> Dialect. For unleſs they had been commanded to eat at three ſet-times, they would have ſo indulged themſelves, that the whole Sabbath would have been a time only to eat and drink: but becauſe all knew when they were preſent at one Banquet, that they muſt attend on two more, every one obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that moderation agreeable to their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular appetites, and befitting ſuch a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, thinking on the dainties which they ſhould again ſhortly taſte. What is moreover meant by this Banquet, and how much they reckon of it, ſhall a little after be declared</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:59218:74"/>Moreover, none, whether noble, rich or wiſe, ought to think it beneath him to do ſomething in the honour of the Day. For though a man have an hundred maids, yea though he have the command of a thouſand ſervants, yet he himſelf ought with his own hands to do ſomething in the honour of the Sabbath: And ſo we read in the <hi>Talmud</hi> that <hi>Rabbi Chaſdam</hi> cut the Pot-herbs, <hi>Rabbi Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> clave the Wood, <hi>Rabbi Sira</hi> kindled the Fire, <hi>Rabbi Nachman</hi> ſwept the Houſe and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Table.</p>
            <p>Their Meat whether roaſt or boyled is kept hot in a Cauldron, as being then moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful.</p>
            <p>The Table is night and day, whileſt the Sabbath laſts, kept covered: for which they have a particular reaſon (as ſhall be afterwards ſhewed.)</p>
            <p>They waſh their heads: the men, if it be the Cuſtom, are ſhaved; the women comb their hair, plaiting it decently, and binding it with Fillets; they either waſh their hands and feet, or elſe bathe themſelves in hot Baths.</p>
            <p>They every <hi>Fryday</hi> (ſuperſtitiouſly) pare their nails, beginning with the left hand; they firſt pare the nail of the fourth finger, then of the ſecond, then of the fifth, then of the third, and end with the thumb: ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they never cut the nails of two fingers together, but ſtill leave one betwixt. When
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59218:74"/>
they pare the nails of the right hand, they begin with the ſecond finger, and ſo paſs to the fourth, and ſo on to the reſt.</p>
            <p>'Tis impious to caſt the excreſcencies under foot, for ſo the Devil gets power over them; but he who burieth them is reputed <hi>juſt,</hi> and he who burns them is <hi>righteous,</hi> and obtains a full pardon. And all this is grounded upon the place before mentioned, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. <hi>And the ſixth day they made ready,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, every one polliſheth and whets his Knife; and that is juſtified from <hi>Job, And thou ſhalt viſit thy Habitation, and know that thy Tabernacle ſhall be in peace,</hi> &amp;c. Hence the <hi>Jewiſh Doctors</hi> obſerve, that if the Knife be dull that it will not cut, there is no peace to the Houſe or Table.</p>
            <p>They have Garments deſigned only for the honour of the day, and every one is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his ability decently clad, becauſe <hi>Eſaiah</hi> ſayes, <hi>Eſay</hi> 58.13. <hi>Thou ſhalt honour him.</hi> And how canſt thou do it in thy every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>They cover the Table with clean white <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

other things convenient, that the Queen, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sabbath coming, may find all things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently placed; and he that honours the day with his Body, his Rayment, Meat and Drink, is very commendable.</p>
            <p>'Twas antiently a Cuſtom to winde a Horn, or ſound a Trumpet ſix times, that every one might prepare for the Sabbath; but now in well-order'd Aſſemblies, 'tis proclaimed by a Cryer. That they may ceaſe from work, and provide honourably to entertain the Bride, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sabbath.</p>
            <p>And therefore when the Evening draws nigh, they do no buſineſs abroad, but early begin the Sabbath, ſolemnizing ſome part of the remaining week: they repair to the Synagogue, and hallow the time with Hymns and Prayer.</p>
            <p>Now when the Sun begins to leave their Hemiſphere, the Candles appointed only for the Sabbath are ſet up: as ſoon as they are kindled, a Jewiſh woman lifts up both hands towards them, and ſayes; <hi>Bleſſed art thou, O Lord God, King of the World, that thou haſt devoted us to thy Service, and haſt command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to light Candles on the Sabbath.</hi> And the like Cuſtom is obſerved by them on Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-day-Eves. If it be troubleſome weather, ſo that the ſkie be cloudy, the hens teach them their duty; for when they ſee them go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to rooſt, then the time of providing
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59218:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Candles is approaching: but if any live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the City, where they want ſuch infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, they are inſtructed by Ravens and Daws; for thoſe Birds provide themſelves a Lodging in the evening. But the reaſons that women light up the Candles, and not men, are by tradition chiefly two: The firſt is, when <hi>Eve</hi> after eating the forbidden fruit perceived by certain tokens that ſhe ſhould dye, ſhe perſwaded her huſband to taſte it too, and told him, If I muſt die thou ſhalt die with me; but when her perſwaſions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed not over his conſtancie, ſhe brake off a branch from the tree, and beat him till he did eat; as it is expreſſed in <hi>Geneſis</hi> 3.2. <hi>The Woman which thou gaveſt to be with me, ſhe gave me of the Tree,</hi> (that is, ſhe pluck't off a bough from the Tree, and with it beat me) <hi>and I did eat</hi>; ſo it is expounded in the Book <hi>Chajim</hi> (that is, the way of Life.) And by this means poor <hi>Adam</hi> was ſubject to his wife, brake the command of God, and brought death upon himſelf, and bequeathed it to all his poſterity.</p>
            <p>But before <hi>Eve</hi> had ſinned, the Sun ſhined bright, as it will in the World to come on the juſt; then they wanted not the inſtruction of Hens and Daws to teach them their duty: but as ſoon as ſhe had tranſgreſſed, the Sun was clouded, and the Light of Heaven was ſoon darkned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:59218:77"/>The ſecond reaſon why the women light the Candles is, becauſe they are alwayes at home, but the men often abroad: Moreover, we read <hi>Exod.</hi> 27.20. <hi>Thou ſhalt command the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that they bring thee pure oil-olive beaten for the light, to cauſe the lamp to burn alwayes in the Tabernacle before the teſtimony.</hi> The <hi>Rabbies</hi> moreover count that if a godly woman attend on the lighting of the Candles, ſhe doth as holy a deed as if ſhe had kindled Candles for the Golden Candleſticks in the Holy Temple at <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> Moreover, we have it in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> that a woman guilty of theſe ſins ſhall die in Childbed: firſt, if ſhe have not provided a Cake: ſecondly, if ſhe have not lighted up the Candles: thirdly, if ſhe have not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken great care of her menſtruous cloaths. But if the women diligently obſerve theſe Precepts, they ſooner conceive, and are eaſier delivered. Of theſe Candles they have commonly two, ſome times more, according to the capacity of the houſe or dining-bed.</p>
            <p>And in thoſe Candles all the members of man and womans bodies are ſecretly contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: according to Jewiſh Anatomizing, men have 248 members, women 252, which being added together make 500, which number the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Ner</hi> (ſignifying a Candle) doth ſignifie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59218:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>They uſe Candles of two ſorts, becauſe the light of life loſt in <hi>Eden,</hi> may be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red again both to man and woman. The reaſon that they lift up both hands towards the light is, to guard their faces from the rayes of the Candle, whileſt they repeat a ſhort Prayer, which is not to be ſaid till the Candles are lighted up.</p>
            <p>The matter whereof the wekes of theſe Candles is made, and what oyl they make the Candles with, may be ſeen at large in the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud,</hi> to which I refer the Reader.</p>
            <p>That they ſet apart ſome time of the week-dayes, in which they early begin the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, is in love to the dead, whoſe Souls, they ſay, come from Hell or Purgatory to keep the Sabbath: for as ſoon as they enter the Synagogue they ſing a ſhort Hymn, at the hearing of which, the Souls of the deceaſed haſten from Purgatory, and ruſh into the water they firſt meet with, to waſh off the ſtink of the ſmoak, and cool their flames; and therefore the <hi>Rabbies</hi> have ſtrictly charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that no water ſhould be drawn at that time, leſt thoſe ſad Souls ſhould be diſturbed, as we read in <hi>Ritualibus eorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilſt they are intent on their Devotion, two Angels approach, one good, another evil, and place themſelves one againſt another in the Synagogue: if they hear any one pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or repeating his Lecture with a godly
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59218:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
intention, him the two Angels lead forth with their hands on his head, ſaying, <hi>Thy iniquity is taken away, and thy ſin is purged.</hi> And if at their entrance into the Synagogue they find the Candles well kindled, the Table well furniſhed, the Bed covered with clean Linnen; then the good Angel ſaith, <hi>I wiſh I may ſee all things in this poſture the next Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> and the bad Angel is forced to ſay <hi>Amen.</hi> But if things are not well order'd, then the bad Angel ſayes (as the good before) <hi>I wiſh I may find all things thus the next Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>; to which the good Spirit, though unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſayes <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they come home, they ſit down at the chief place of the Table, where the Salt is placed with a Cup of Wine and two Loaves covered with a Napkin: Then the Maſter of the Family taking the Cup of Wine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrates the Sabbath, ſaying; <hi>The ſixth day the Heavens and the Earth were finiſhed, and all the hoſt of them, and on the ſeventh day God ended his work which he had made, and reſted the ſeventh day from all his work which he had made: and God bleſſed the ſeventh day, and ſanctified it, becauſe that in it he had reſted from all his work which God had created and made.</hi> Gen. 2.1. &amp;c. Then adds; <hi>Bleſſed art thou O Lord our God, Creator of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, who haſt created the fruit of the Vine. Bleſſed art thou O Lord God, Creator of the

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, who haſt devoted us to thy Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and haſt given us a holy Sabbath, and in thy good pleaſure haſt left us an heritage as a remembrance of the Creation: it is a token of the Communion of Saints, and a remembrance of the departure out of</hi> Egypt; <hi>for thou haſt choſen and ſanctified us among all Nations; thou out of thine abundant goodneſs haſt left to us thy holy Sabbath: Bleſſed art thou O Lord who haſt hallowed the Sabbath.</hi> When he hath ſaid this, he taſts the Wine, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it to all preſent to taſte: then he removes the Napkin, and takes the two Loaves, but cuts them not before Prayers, as they do on week-dayes, but forthwith ſayes, <hi>Bleſſed art thou, O Lord our God, Lord of the World, who haſt cauſed the Earth to bring forth bread.</hi> After this, he cuts and eats a piece of bread, and gives to all that are preſent, in larger ſhares than on week-dayes; and all to honour the Sabbath, wherein all niggard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is contemned.</p>
            <p>Whil'ſt the Wine is conſecrating, every one looks diligently on the Candle, becauſe the wiſe <hi>Rabbies</hi> write, that if they travel hard on week-dayes they looſe much of the ſtrength of their eyes; and looking on the Candles at the Conſecration of the Wine is an effectual remedy.</p>
            <p>The Bread is covered on the Table, that its vileneſs in reſpect of the Wine may not be
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59218:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſeen; for in the Law it is mentioned before the Wine, though conſecrated after it, as it is written <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.8. <hi>A Land of Wheat and Barley, and Vines.</hi> Where the Wheat and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of which the Bread is made are firſt named, yet conſecrated laſt on the Sabbath; and if it were not covered, it would be much deſpiſed. The <hi>Rabbies</hi> ſay, that it is covered in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the <hi>Manna.</hi> For in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Dew fell, then the <hi>Manna,</hi> after that the Dew; ſo that the <hi>Manna</hi> lay betwixt the Dew, after the ſame manner as the Bread is laid on a Table-cloth, and covered with a Napkin: and for this reaſon, the holy women bake a ſort of Wafers which they eat inſtead of <hi>Manna.</hi> Their Fleſh-pyes are made like ours; the Meat is laid on a thin cake, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with another of the ſame ſort, ſo that it lyes as the <hi>Manna</hi> did betwixt the Dew. And they take two loaves, becauſe on <hi>Fridays</hi> in the Wilderneſs they gathered a double quantity of <hi>Manna,</hi> as it is written, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.22. <hi>But on the ſixth day they gathered twice as much Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What we ſhall chiefly Note, is, that on the Sabbath they much indulge their Genius, as is obſervable in the Law, <hi>Eſay</hi> 58.13. where the Sabbath is called a delight; that is, that we may enjoy all delights that day; and ſo ought all our Feaſts to be according to that: Thou ſhalt rejoyce in thy Feaſts,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59218:79"/>
that all may be done to the honour of God; wherefore thou may'ſt eat and drink, and cloath thee decently, that ſo thou may'ſt truly honour the Sabbath; but don't be exceſſive in thy charge.</p>

            <p>But leſt the curious Reader may think theſe to be meer fictions, I ſhall inſtance ſome pleaſant paſſages out of the <hi>Talmud</hi> relating to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Where we read that one <hi>Rabbi Chaja</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned to lodge one Sabbath with a Butcher, and there was ſet before him a Golden Table, burthen enough for ſixteen men, on which there hung ſixteen ſilver Chains, and on it many veſſels of the like Metal were ſet, as Spoons, Plates, and Cups furniſhed with plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of dainties. When all things were ſet in order, he praiſed God, thus: <hi>The Earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof:</hi> and when the Banquet was ended, he gave thanks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner: <hi>The Heavens are the Lords, but the Earth hath he given to the ſons of men.</hi> And then the <hi>Rabbi</hi> began to enquire of the Butcher how he had gotten ſuch riches, and what good works he had done? the Butcher replyed, <hi>Hitherto have I been a Butcher, and when ever I lighted on a Beaſt fatter than uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, I reſerved it for the Sabbath, that I might
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59218:81"/>
do as I am commanded, and therefore God has given me much riches, for the honour I do to his day.</hi> And when the <hi>Rabbi</hi> heard this, he gave God thanks that he had beſtowed on him ſuch abundance. And here we leave the Butcher.</p>
            <p>Moreover, we read in the ſame Page of a man truly Charitable, named <hi>Joſeph</hi>; if any thing extraordinary came to the Market, eſpecially Fiſh, he ſpared no charge to buy it; and he had a rich neighbour, who would often mock him, aſking him what good this ſtrict obſerving Sabbath-duties did him? thou getteſt nought by it, ſaith he; I am much richer than thou, yet do not obſerve it ſo punctually: but <hi>Joſeph</hi> took of his words but little notice, and anſwered, <hi>That God was able to recompence him.</hi> And at the ſame time, there came Aſtrologers to the rich man, ſaying: <hi>What good haſt thou of thy riches? thou dareſt not buy a good Fiſh with it: we finde that the Fates have given all thy ſtore to</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph <hi>the Sabbath-obſerver: he ſpares no charge to honour the day.</hi> The rich man took ſome notice of what they ſaid, and went and ſold all his poſſeſſions, and with it bought Jewels, and hung them in his hat, and reſolved to travel, to ſecure his riches from <hi>Joſeph</hi>; and taking ſhip, he was ſo toſs'd with a Tempeſt, that he loſt his Hat and Jewels in the Sea; there came a great Fiſh and ſwallowed them
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59218:81"/>
up: and a little after, the ſame Fiſh was brought into the Market to be ſold; many cheapened it, but thought it too dear: at length came this <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and ſoon bought it; and dreſſing it, found the Hat and Jewels which the rich Traveller had loſt: So the Aſtrologers Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions were verified, and <hi>Joſeph</hi> grew Rich on a ſudden. Then there came a Wiſe Old man to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>He who beſtows much on the Sabbath, him the day recompenſeth; but he that of a little beſtows a little, to him God gives fourfold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We read of another Paſſage in the Talmud concerning Feaſts; how a certain <hi>Rabbi</hi> every Friday ſent his Servants into the Market to buy off all the Herbs which the Sellers could not vent, and then he caſt them into the River: and the <hi>Rabbies</hi> inquiring the cauſe why he had not diſtributed them to the poor <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites,</hi> the Anſwer was this: <hi>That if he had given them to the Poor, then they in expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of having them given ſtill, would not have provided for the Sabbath; and therefore if it ſhould happen that the Sellers had ſold all, and the Poor not provided for themſelves, then the Sabbath would not have had its due honour.</hi> But why then did he not cauſe them to be given to the Cattel? it had been better to do ſo, than to caſt them careleſly away. The Anſwer was, <hi>That he would not give thoſe things to Cattel which men might eat, and from
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59218:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which they might have profit; for they might perchance take them out of the water.</hi> But why did he command them to be bought? the Reaſon is, <hi>That thoſe who ſold ſuch Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties might willinglier come to the Market: for ſuppoſe them to come often and ſell nought, they would ſoon be weary, and not frequent the Market; and then the Poor would have had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to eat on the Sabbath, and thereby would have deprived it of its due honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, we read in a Treatiſe of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, that if any one on the Sabbath let looſe the Reins to pleaſure, and ſo paſs the day, that <hi>God giveth him an Heritage for ever,</hi> as it is written: <hi>When thou ſhalt call the Sabbath a Delight, then ſhalt thou delight thy ſelf in the Lord: and I will cauſe thee to ride upon the high places of the Earth, and feed thee with the Heritage of thy Father Jacob:</hi> of which Heritage it is largely ſpoken; <hi>For thou ſhalt be ſpread abroad to the Eaſt, and to the West, and to the North, and to the South<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rabbi Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that feeds high on the Sabbath, and is joyful, ſhall be free from the Servitude of Kings,</hi> as it is, <hi>I will lift thee above the high places of the Earth, and thy Enemies ſhall be found Lyars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another <hi>Rabbi</hi> ſaith, <hi>That he who merrily paſſeth the Sabbath, hath whatſoever he will ask of God,</hi> as 'tis written; <hi>Delight thou in the Lord, and he will give thee thy hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:59218:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>Seeing therefore that the <hi>Jews</hi> have not conquered their Enemies, nor obtained their deſire, that they have not yet ſubdued the Chriſtians, nor are Lords of the whole Earth according to their prayers on the Sabbath and Feaſt-days, may be imputed to their want of a right Hallowing the Sabbath, or at leaſt, that they have not thereon been ſufficiently mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>When they have thus joyfully finiſhed the firſt Banquet, they again go to Prayers; but the Table is kept covered, and the Candles burn till the evening of the Sabbath. And they diſpute much what is to be done with thoſe Candles, whether it be lawful to catch Fleas or Lice with them; but reading by them is forbidden, leſt when the light is dim he that reads ſhould ſnuff the Candle and ſo violate the Sabbath. And becauſe the Sabbath is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Delight, they often marrie on it, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the ſociety of their Wives; they ſay thoſe who are conceived on the Sabbath live to a good age, if their Parents don't reſpect the pleaſure as the honour of the day.</p>
            <p>Finally, when a <hi>Jew</hi> travelleth on Friday, and hath a greater Journey than the Sabbath alloweth of, he ought to take up his Lodgings in the Fields or Woods at the approaching of the Sabbath, and there to continue till it be ended, expoſing himſelf to the danger of Thieves, and want of ſuſtenance. There is
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59218:83"/>
a memorable Story in their Hiſtories to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Three <hi>Jews</hi> on a time took a Journey on Friday when the Evening drew nigh, and the Sabbath approached; two of them ſpake thus to each other: <hi>What ſhall we do? we are in certain danger, the way is beſet with Thieves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the wood barbours wild Beaſts; we had therefore better keep on our Journy and ſave our lives, than with certain danger both of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and life hallow the Sabbath.</hi> But the third repli'd; <hi>Truly we ought not to ſtir hence but here to keep the Sabbath; God who hath commanded us ſo to do, is able to preſerve <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſafe.</hi> The other two perſiſted, and broke the Sabbath, but the third pitched his Tent and there abode; he covered the Ground (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Table) with a Cloth, and on it laid the Proviſion he had with him, and ſo betook himſelf to Prayers; that being ended, he ſat<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> down to eat of the firſt Banquet of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: the Attendance he had was a terrible Bear almoſt pin'd with hunger: the good <hi>Jew</hi> was almoſt afraid, and gave the Gueſt a piec<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of Bread, and had faith that God would pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerve him; the Bear took the Bread, and at<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tended on him. The <hi>Jew</hi> after ſupper betook himſelf again to prayer, and ſo to ſleep, and the Bear lay down by him; in the morn h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was very glad that the hungrie Bear was ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> kinde as to ſpare his fleſh, and for it gave God
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59218:83"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hanks, and ſo provided for his Morning-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: he then dined, and after ſup't, and did all his duty. When the Sabbath was ended he went on his Journey, the Bear ſtill following him. The ſame night it fortuned that his Companions fell among Thieves, who ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped them of all they had. At length this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout <hi>Jew</hi> and the Bear overtook them; and though the Beaſt was ſo kinde to him, it was not for want of natural fietceneſs, for he ſoon tore the other two in pieces. Then the Godly <hi>Jew</hi> began to be afraid; but whilſt he muſed with himſelf, the Thieves beſet him, and aſked who he was, whence he came, and whither he was going? he told them he was a <hi>Jew,</hi> and that he came from the Kings Palace; they aſked whence he had that Bear; he anſwered, The King gave it as a Companion. One of the Thieves told the other, that ſurely this Perſon was beloved of the King, that he had given him ſuch a guard. The other ſaid, Let us give him all our money, and follow him through this Wood, that the Bear hurt us not. So they gave him all their money to conceal them; and going far with him, at length de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, the Bear alſo returned to the Wood. And from this ſtorie the <hi>Jews</hi> conclude that they ought to obſerve the Sabbath in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever place they are, and commit themſelves wholly to the protection <hi>of God Almighty.</hi>

            <argument>
               <p>How the <hi>Jews</hi> hallow the Sabbath, and how they end it.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IN the morning they riſe not up ſo early as on other days; but for the greater pleaſure in honouring the day, they ſleep a good part of the morning. And for this cuſtom the <hi>Rabbies</hi> have conſulted the Writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and finde in <hi>Numb.</hi> 28. where it is ſpoken of daily Offerings, that it is expreſſed by the word <hi>Babboker mane,</hi> that is, the morning: but when it is ſpoken of the Offering of the Seventh day, it is expreſſed by the words <hi>Die Sabbathi</hi> (that is) the Sabbath day; intending this meaning, that the daily Offerings were to be performed <hi>Antelucano tempore,</hi> that is, at break of day; and inſtead of this on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath they had Morning-prayers, and referred their Offering till later in the morn: therefore the <hi>Jews</hi> ſleep longer than on other daies, to prepare them for Prayers.</p>
            <p>When they repair to the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> they pray as on other, but longer, and ſing more Hymns to honour the day; they put not on their Phylacteries as on other daies, becauſe they think the Sabbath it ſelf is a ſufficient ſigne of the <hi>Jewiſh Faith,</hi> and ordained only
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59218:84"/>
for them to hallow; and have therefore no need of Circumciſion and Phylacteries, though both are ſignes by which <hi>Jews</hi> are diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and known.</p>
            <p>They bring the Book of the Law out of the Ark after the ſame manner as is declared in the ninth Chapter. They read a Section out of the Law, and divide each Section into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Leſſons, to be read by ſeven choice men.</p>
            <p>After the reading of the Law, they read Leſſons out of the Prophets, which are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi>; of which cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom this is the Original: When in old time they were forbidden to read <hi>Moſes,</hi> they choſe a Section out of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> which agreed with the Writings of <hi>Moſes:</hi> of this there is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> Act. 13.27. <hi>They which dwell at Jeruſalem, and their Rulers knew him not, nor the Voices of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets which are read every Sabbath day.</hi> And again, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.21. <hi>Moſes of old time hath in every City them that Preach him, being read in the Synagogue every Sabbath.</hi> But though they are not forbidden the reading of <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet they keep the Old cuſtom, and read the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> after <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They pray alſo for the Souls of the dead who have not kept the Sabbath aright: For the <hi>Rabbies</hi> ſuppoſe that they, both before and after the Sabbath, are tortured in Hell-fire; and therefore they pray for them on the Sabbath,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59218:85"/>
that thereon they may have reſt. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in prayer not after the ſixth hour of the day, being forbidden to faſt or pray longer, as they plead, from the place ſo often recited, <hi>Thou ſhalt call the Sabbath a Delight.</hi> Here they ſay that the word ſignifying in Hebrew Delight, is written without the Letter ד, which ſignifies ſix; by which the Prophet meant im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly that they ſhould pray but till the ſixth hour.</p>
            <p>When Morning-prayer is ended, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the ſecond Banquet; and to honour the day, they generally indulge their Appetites: but if it happen that any one have a ſtrange Dream, as if he ſhould ſee the Book of the Law or his houſe burn, or his teeth ſtrook out, or ſuchlike portending evil, he has liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to abſtain from meat till the evening. He who in a dream is offended with meat, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in faſting, may do as he himſelf pleaſeth; and he that is ſo grieved that he cannot refrain from tears, he may weep, for by it grief is eaſed, and ſuch pleaſant weeping honours the day; but he that faſts on purpoſe on the Sabbath, is bound to faſt the next day after, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may do Penance for detracting from the honour of the day.</p>
            <p>After Dinner the <hi>Rabbies</hi> have thought fit to ſtudie or read in Sacred Writ: for one of the chief <hi>Rabbies</hi> relates, that the Sabbath made complaint that God had given to every thing
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59218:85"/>
a companion and equal, except to it; and God anſwered, <hi>Iſrael ſhall be thy companion</hi>; for on the Sabbath they ſhall learn the Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as others are idle. The Law alſo came and complained, ſaying, <hi>When Iſarel returns into his own Land, one poſſeſſeth his Vine, another his Field: Who then ſhall regard me?</hi> To which God ſaid, <hi>Iſrael ſhall reſpect thee,</hi> for on the Sabbath they ſhall not labour. And conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, they have thought it fit to ſpend ſome time after dinner in ſtudying the word of God, that the Sabbath or the Law might have no more reaſon of complaint.</p>
            <p>At the time of Evening Sacrifice they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair again to the Synagogue, and ſay their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening-prayers, and then eat the third and laſt time on the Sabbath: when it begins to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, they take leave of it with a Bleſſing.</p>
            <p>They look upon the obſervance of theſe three Banquets to be of much concern; for they think that he who thus obſerves the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath ſhall eſcape Hell, and be preſerved from the dreadful War of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and alſo be free from the perplexities that ſhall attend the coming of the <hi>Meſſia:</hi> and therefore one of the <hi>Rabbies</hi> pray'd that his Portion might be with thoſe who celebrate the Sabbath with three Banquets.</p>
            <p>At Evening they are again prohibited to draw water out of the River or Well, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Souls of the wicked deceaſed, which
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59218:86"/>
again refreſh themſelves as they are returning to Hell.</p>
            <p>At the very departure of the Sabbath, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſupper, one very nimbly draws the Cloth from off the Table; for they ſay that he who doth it, ſhall in a ſhort time be ſet at libertie. <hi>Aere Alieno.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the Evening they again go to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in which they make mention of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Elias</hi>; for they ſay that his coming was promiſed in the evening of the Sabbath or ſome Feaſt-day: and when the Sabbath is gone, they aſk him if he will come the next Sabbath and acquaint them with the coming of the <hi>Meſſia.</hi> Some of them alſo write, that the Prophet ſate under the Tree of Life in <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,</hi> and regiſtred the good Works the <hi>Jews</hi> did on the Sabbath.</p>
            <p>They continue theſe Prayers till late in the night, out of love to the Souls of the wicked, that they may have the more reſpit from tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: for as it is in the Evening on Friday proclaimed in Hell, by <hi>Dumah</hi> an Angel that is Ruler among the Spirits, that the wicked may go to their reſt as the <hi>Jews</hi> do and all <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> on the Sabbath: So when the Prayers are ended, the Spirit cries again, <hi>Return ye wicked into Hell, for the</hi> Jews <hi>have done Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Hymn <hi>Benedicite</hi> is ended, the women go with haſte to the wells and draw
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59218:86"/>
water: for they write that the well <hi>Mara</hi> whereof they drink in the <hi>Deſart,</hi> runs into the Sea of <hi>Tyberias,</hi> and thence in the end of the Sabbath did mixt it ſelf with the water of all their wells; and if a woman ſhould chance to draw in that inſtant, ſhe would have an Antidote for all Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>A certain woman gave teſtimony to this moſt precious <hi>Panacea,</hi> who immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prayers going to draw water, came in that inſtant in which the Well had mixt it ſelf with hers; but being ſomewhat ſlow in drawing, her Huſband was verie angrie: The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for fear let the Pitcher fall out of her hands, and it happened that ſome drops fell upon her Huſband, and thoſe parts which the water touched were immediately healed.</p>
            <p>See the effect of this his anger! for he was only healed in part, whereas if he had drank, he had been totally cured, and clean as a new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Child. Hence is that notable Saying of the <hi>Rabbies; Iracundus nihil aliud quam i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram ſuam reportabit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, they ſeparate the Sabbath from the Week following, and give God thanks that he hath enabled them ſo to hallow the Sabbath. They do it after this manner.</p>
            <p>A great Taper like a Torch is kindled, which they call the Candle of Separation; they have alſo a little Box full of ſweet Spices provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: Then the Maſter of the Family takes
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59218:87"/>
the cup of Wine in his right hand, and ſings with a loud voice, <hi>Behold, God is my Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I will truſt and not be afraid: I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the cup of Salvation, and call upon the Name of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Which done, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrates the Wine, and (ſpilling a little on the ground) ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed art thou O Lord who haſt created the Fruit of the Vine.</hi> Then he ſmells to the ſweet Spice, and delivers it to all preſent to ſmell to: afterwards he takes the Cup in his right hand, and going to the great Taper, looks diligently on the nails of his left hand, bowing his fingers inwards towards the palm of his hand, that they may cauſe a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; after that he opens them again, and looks on the outſide ſo diligently, that he may diſcern the nails to be whiter than the fleſh, and ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed art thou O Lord who haſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a clear light:</hi> then taking the Cup in his left hand, he vieweth the nails of his right hand; which done, he removeth the Cup into his right hand, and ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed art thou who haſt made difference betwixt things holy and prophane; betwixt Iſrael and other Nations; betwixt the ſeventh day and the other ſix days of the week:</hi> and while he ſaith this, he ſpills a little of the Wine on the ground, and then drinks, and giveth to all preſent to drink. And ſo the Sabbath is ended, and the Week be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.</p>
            <p>They prove the difference between the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59218:87"/>
and the Week-daies by theſe words: <hi>And that ye may put difference between things holy and unholy</hi>; and, <hi>God divided the light from the darkneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ſmell to the ſweet Spice to avoid do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, becauſe they are deprived of a Soul at the end of the Sabbath, which Soul they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain receive at the beginning of it, and enjoy more than on week-daies. <hi>Antonius Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rita</hi> in his Book <hi>de ſide Judaica</hi> has ſomething to this purpoſe. The <hi>Jews</hi> write in the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud,</hi> that every man hath three Souls; and prove it from <hi>Eſay</hi> 42.5. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, he that created the heavens, and ſtretched them out; he that ſpread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath to the people upon it, and ſpirit to them that walk therein.</hi> From this Text they attribute to man two Souls, which with the true Natural Soul always inherent make three: moreover they ſay, that when a man ſleeps, theſe two adventitious Souls ſteal from him; one aſcends to Heaven, and there hears all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Events; the other roves about the Earth, and there beholds nought but folly and vanity; and this they call the Irrational or Brutiſh Soul: but that Soul wherewith every man is firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, hath its immoveable reſidence in the heart, and ſees all that thoſe two Souls that have forſaken the body, do or ſee. Hence all dreams ariſe, and therefore not always to be
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59218:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
lightly eſteemed. But on the Sabbath a fourth Soul cometh as a freſh ſupply, which elevates their minds, that ſo they may the better ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Sabbath; and when the Sabbath is ended, this Soul leaveth them again: Hence it is that they are dull, and ſmell to the ſweet Spices to refreſh their Spirits. (So much of <hi>Margarita</hi>; but whence he collected this, cannot as yet be underſtood by the <hi>Jews</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.)</p>
            <p>Some more wiſe than the reſt ſmell to the ſweet Spices, becauſe on the Sabbath the fire of Hell doth not ſtink; but as ſoon as the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is ended, and the Gates of Hell opened, that the Souls of the wicked may again enter in, it ſends forth an ill ſent; and theſe Spices are preſervatives againſt it (as they ſay.)</p>
            <p>They ſpill a little of the Wine in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, as a ſigne of plenty and abundance in their houſes; for they ſay where the Wine is not ſpilt, there is no bleſſing: ſome think it is done to refreſh <hi>Core</hi> and his company whom the Earth ſwallowed up; as if they were yet alive, and could perceive refreſhment from this waſte.</p>
            <p>They take ſtrict notice of their nails, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their ſoon growing; for though they pare them every Friday, they grow up again by the next. Some ſay it is by reaſon of the great difference betwixt the nails and the fleſh, which made <hi>Adam</hi> ſo much to wonder when
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59218:88"/>
he ſaw the world dark, and cried out, <hi>Ah me miſerable creature, for my fault was the world darkned:</hi> and hereupon God was ſo merciful to him, that he gave him diſcretion to knock two Flints together, from which there came fire, with which he lighted a Candle; and when he ſaw himſelf all naked ſave only the tops of his fingers, he burſt out into admiration, and praiſed God.</p>
            <p>To prove their Opinion of the ſtench of Hell, they produce this ſtory out of the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud:</hi> One <hi>Turnus Ruphus</hi> a wicked fellow, aſked one of the <hi>Rabbies</hi> what the Sabbath was better than other week-daies? whom the <hi>Rabbi</hi> aſked again, <hi>Why art thou more honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than other men?</hi> he anſwered, <hi>Becauſe it was the good pleaſure of his Lord and King: So,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Rabbi, it was the good pleaſure of the Lord of Hoſts, to command us to prefer the Sabbath before other days.</hi> But ſaith <hi>Turnus, How knoweſt thou that the ſeventh day is your true Sabbath? it may be ſome other day: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the firſt, ſecond, third,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Rabbi</hi> told him that <hi>this was firſt revealed to them by a certain River which flows ſo ſtrong ſix days that it hurls with it great ſtones, and is not navigable all the week; but on the Sabbath it moveth not at all. A ſecond Proof of it,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Rabbi, is from thy own Fathers Sepulchre, which all the week is infected with a loathſome vapor cauſed by the ſtench of Hell-fire, in which
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59218:89"/>
he is tormented; but on the ſeventh day it hath no ill ſmell, becauſe on the Sabbath thy Father cometh from Hell, and the evil Spirits have no power over him, and therefore alſo Hell-fire has no ill ſmell on the Sabbath.</hi> When <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> heard this, <hi>Perhaps</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ended.</hi> The <hi>Rabbi</hi> bid him go to the Sepulchre after the Sabbath, and he ſhould ſmell a ſtench. When <hi>Turnus</hi> had made trial and found it ſo, he by the help of Magick raiſed his Father's Ghoſt, and ſpake thus to him: <hi>Whilſt thou livedſt thou did'ſt not regard the Sabbath, but now thou art dead thou hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweſt it: How long haſt thou been a</hi> Jew? His Father anſwered, <hi>Dear Son, he who living obſerveth not the Sabbath willingly, in Hell ſhall be forced to do it.</hi> His Son proceeds, <hi>What is your imployment in Hell on week days?</hi> His Father anſwered, <hi>We are tortured in the fire, but on the Sabbath we enjoy our eaſe; for Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in the evening, which is the preparation for the Sabbath, Proclamation is made in Hell,</hi> 'Tis a time of reſt, therefore reſt ye wicked; <hi>ſo are we eaſed, and do hallow the Sabbath; but at the end of the Sabbath, when the</hi> Jews <hi>have ended their cuſtomary Prayers, an evil Spirit called</hi> Dumah, <hi>who is our Ruler, calleth us back again to Hell, becauſe the people of</hi> Iſrael <hi>have ended the Sabbath, where we renew our tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and endure them till the next Sabbath. And this is our Employment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:59218:89"/>He who deſireth to know more of this, let him conſult <hi>Rabbi Bochai</hi> in his Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the eighteenth Chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> where he writes much concerning the Sabbath. And becauſe God hath commanded in the Law, that not only Man but Beaſt alſo ſhould reſt on the Sabbath; they make great inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry how far a Horſe or an Aſs may travel on the Sabbath, and whether it may carry any thing on it? And here they ſay, that no beaſt ought to carry any thing on the Sabbath, but that with which it is led, as a Horſe or Aſs may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a Bridle or Halter; and theſe too muſt be put on on Friday before the Sabbath begins. They ought not to let a Horſe go abroad with a Saddle on, much leſs muſt one ride upon it. If any one come home on the Sabbath with a Saddle on, they may looſe the Girts, but not take off the Saddle; if the Horſe ſhake it off, then the <hi>Jew</hi> is free.</p>
            <p>The Cock is not to be let looſe with a piece of cloth tied to his leg or wing, but is to be looſed on Friday, that it may reſt on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</p>
            <p>If a Beaſt fall into a Pit on the Sabbath, and cannot get forth of it ſelf, it is to be fed in the place till the Sabbath is ended, and then to be holpen out. If the place be ſo deep that the beaſt is in danger of being drowned, then they are to put ſtraw (and ſuch-like ſtuff) under it, to preſerve it; and if it get out of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59218:90"/>
it ſelf, then the <hi>Jew</hi> is free. But this ſeems to contradict that anſwer Chriſt made to the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they blamed him for healing on the Sabbath-day, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Which of you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>having an Ox or an Aſs fallen into a pit, will not ſtraightway help him out on the Sabbath-day?</hi> But this is the injunction of the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the Sabbath, a Chriſtian may milk the <hi>Jews</hi> Cows or Goats; but the <hi>Jews</hi> muſt not eat the milk, unleſs they buy it of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as they uſually do. The men or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men muſt not run on the Sabbath, unleſs they be commanded of God; neither muſt they ſtep more than the length of a Cubit at once, leſt they hurt the eye-ſight. No man ought to carry any ſort of weapon, neither muſt a Taylor carry needles on his ſleeve.</p>
            <p>If any one be lame or ſick, ſo that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not walk without a ſtaff, he may uſe it; but he who is blinde may not. They muſt not uſe Stilts to help them over the water; for though they ſeem to carry a man, yet are they born of him; and any burthen is forbidden on the Sabbath. They muſt carry no moneys with them on the Sabbath. They may ſhake off the dirt from their ſhoos againſt a wall, but not on the ground, leſt they may ſeem to fill the ditch. If any one have dirt on his hands, he may wipe them on his horſe-mane; but waſhing is forbidden. They are forbidden
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59218:90"/>
to catch Flies or Gnats which ſtick on their Garments, or creep on the ground; but if they offend them, they may catch them, not hurting them, and throw them away. A Louſe may be killed; but one of the <hi>Rabbies</hi> ſaith, He who kills a Louſe on the Sabbath, breaks it as much as he who kills a Camel: and this rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a diſpute, what was to be done with ſuch offenſive creatures; and it was agreed, that thoſe creatures which were generated by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural coition, ſhould not be hurt; (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Flies were free) but thoſe which were bred of corrupt, putrified matter, were to be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (and therefore Lice.)</p>
            <p>They are forbidden to climb trees, leſt they ſhould break the boughs. He who feeds his Hen and Chickens in any open place where the rain may fall, with any Corn, muſt not give them more than they can eat, leſt when it rains it ſhould grow, and ſo he might be ſaid to ſow on the Sabbath; which is a ſin unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. They muſt not knock at the dore with the iron hammer, leſt they may ſeem to drive a nail; and therefore <hi>Chaſſan,</hi> the Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, doth knock with his fiſt. They may not knock with the fingers on the table, nor write on ſand or aſhes, but they may in the Air. No Picture, either in paper or wax, is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced.</p>
            <p>The ſum of all that they are forbidden, is contained in 39 Articles, to which all leſſer matters are reducible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:59218:91"/>The Firſt Article concerns Plowing; under which, is comprehended dreſſing of Gardens, removing Herbs, ſetting Trees, planting Vines, digging, pruning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby the growth of any thing may be improved: and becauſe it is not lawful to fill Ditches, the <hi>Rabbies</hi> have thought fit that the Chambers ſhould be ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with water, that the duſt might not ariſe; but ſweeping is forbidden, leſt thereby any little chink in the Chamber ſhould be filled: and for this reaſon, they would not throw nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhels towards the Ditch, leſt peradventure they might fall into it.</p>
            <p>The Second Article concerns Reaping; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which, is contained gathering any kinde of Fruit, which they are forbidden; as alſo to take honey from the Bees, and ſuch-like. They may on the Sabbath eat any Fruit as it hangs on the ſtalk, but not break the ſtalk: they may not go over a Corn-field newly ſown, leſt the Corn ſhould ſtick to their ſhoos, which is, as if they had purpoſed to take it. And it ſeems that the <hi>Jews</hi> were offended with our Saviour, for the breach of this Article, when his Diſciples pluckt off the ears of Corn on the Sabbath, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>The Third Article reſpects Thraſhing; to which pertaineth beating of Hemp or Flax, to preſs any moiſt Fruits, as Grapes, and ſuch-like. Milking is alſo contained under this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle; but the <hi>Rabbies</hi> don't as yet agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:59218:91"/>You may judge of the other Articles ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: The difference betwixt the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ones, and thoſe contained under them, is not great. He who beareth falſe witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another, is to be ſtoned; and he who willingly ſins, him God ſhall judge, and root out of the Land of the Living. Theſe are explained in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> in <hi>Tractatu de Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batho,</hi> Chapter 7. with many more, but they are too tedious to be named.</p>
            <p>And though the <hi>Jews</hi> think that they right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve the Sabbath, yet they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the contrary from their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: For we read in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> that he who obſerveth all the Ceremonies of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath to do them, ſhall have free pardon of all ſins; yea though he be an Idolater, as <hi>Enoch,</hi> in whoſe time they ſay this ſin had its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. According to <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.26. <hi>Then began men to call upon the Name of the Lord:</hi> And <hi>Eſay</hi> the 56.2. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it. Rabbi Juda</hi> ſaid, If the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had kept the firſt Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath aright, immediately after the Law was given, no Nation would ever have overcome them. And another <hi>Rabbi</hi> ſaid, If they had kept the two firſt Sabbaths aright, they had ſoon been ſet at liberty; according to <hi>Eſay</hi> 56.4. <hi>They that keep my Sabbaths aright, them will I bring back into my holy Mountain,</hi> (that is, <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>) But ſeeing they are not, neither
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59218:92"/>
are like to be ſet at liberty, it muſt needs be becauſe they have not kept the Sabbath aright, as they confeſſed, while the Temple ſtood at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> As the <hi>Talmud</hi> expreſly ſpeaketh; <hi>For no other reaſon was the Temple at</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem <hi>deſtroyed, but becauſe the</hi> Jews <hi>obſerved not the Sabbath aright.</hi> As it is written, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.27. <hi>They have hid their eyes from my Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and I am polluted among them.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> celebrate the Sabbath with Wine, Fiſh, and Fleſh, and all kinde of Delights: they abſtain from work, and are not at any time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to do any thing, but only command the poor Chriſtians; and therefore boaſt, that they are Lords over them.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this Chapt. with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint which God made to <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eſay,</hi> Eſay 1.13. <hi>Incenſe is an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation unto me: the new Moons and Sabbaths, the calling of Aſſemblies, I cannot away with: it is iniquity, even the ſolemn meetings. Your new Moons, and your appointed Seaſons my Soul hateth, they are a trouble unto me, I am weary to bear them.</hi>

            <argument>
               <p>Of the <hi>Jews</hi> Feaſts: The manner of their Celebration.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IN the Order of Prayers according to the Hebrew Uſe, the Offices for the Feſtivals immediately follow thoſe of the Sabbath, though the Service-book doth not yield Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for every Feaſt which are in preſent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation with them. For beſides a peculiar Order for the <hi>Purim,</hi> there is but one general Office for all the reſt.</p>
            <p>Now beſides what occurs in Holy Writ concerning the inſtitution and reaſon of the Jewiſh Feſtivals, there are ſome modern Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms chiefly therein to be conſidered, which we ſhall refer to the <hi>ſeveral Feaſts,</hi> and only give them a naked enumeration.</p>
            <p>The chief both of the Antient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Jewiſh Feſtivals, are the <hi>Paſſover, the Feast of Weeks or Pentecost,</hi> and the Feaſt of Tabernacles. The Paſſover is the firſt both in time and dignity, and the Divine Scriptures exhibit enough in teſtimony both of its Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and Deſigne: So that we ſhall only ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinctly ſet down the uſual Rites of its preſent obſervation.</p>
            <p>And in the firſt place, the <hi>Jews</hi> eſteem the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59218:93"/>
Paſſover of ſo great moment, that their prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for its ſolemnity is much more great, than to all the other Feſtivals. For the Wealthier and Devouter ſort ſpend above a Lunar Month in preparing for its coming. But their preparations conſiſt not in any Spiritual exerciſe, but in a carnal providing for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Where they uſe no ſmall curioſity and diligence in getting the fineſt Wheat for the unleavened bread, which by Divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is thereon to be eaten. And what is very commendable, the <hi>Richer</hi> are careful to provide the Poorer with fine Wheat for the ſame purpoſe <hi>gratis,</hi> out of their own Store. For they account it a great Scandal to their Religion, that any <hi>Jew</hi> ſhould be unprovided of things requiſite to ſo ſacred a celebration. The two or three daies before the Paſſover, are ſpent in cleanſing their houſes, and waſhing their Furniture of braſs, pewter, and iron. On the Eve of the Feaſt, the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily always faſts: and the reſt of the houſhold are imployed in ſearching every corner, that not a crum of leaven'd bread may remain till the Paſſover. And becauſe they pray that not the leaſt mite may eſcape their diſcovery, it is ordinary with them to caſt ſome pieces of hard cruſts into the ſecret corners, that find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, they may not be ſaid to have pray'd in vain. Whatſoever crums they meet with, they are carefully laid up till the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59218:93"/>
when they are burn'd; and all this to teſtifie their eſpecial diligence to obſerve the Law concerning the Paſſover.</p>
            <p>The Sabbath immediately antecedent to this Feſtival, is for its ſingular and peculiar Sanctity, ſtiled the <hi>Great Sabbath:</hi> which name was occaſioned by a Miracle that thereon happned: of which the <hi>Rabbies</hi> give this ſhort Legend.</p>
            <p>Our Anceſtors, when they lived in <hi>Egypt,</hi> taking their Paſchal Lambs, according to Gods appointment, upon the tenth day of the month, and tying them to their bed-poſts, that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

The <hi>Egyptians</hi> demanding a reaſon of their ſo doing, the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> told them, that their Lambs were kept to be killed at their Paſſover. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> murmured greatly thereat, and grew very much incenſed againſt the <hi>Hebrews</hi> for killing the Lamb, becauſe it ſo much reſembled one of their Gods. For they had placed <hi>Aries,</hi> the Ram, one of the Celeſtial ſignes, in the number of their Deities. Whereupon the <hi>Egyptians</hi> began to complot the <hi>Hebrews</hi> Ruine, but were ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſtruck with ſo much horrour, that they durſt not open their lips, nor move a finger, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59218:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them: And becauſe this happened the next Sabbath before the Paſſover, it was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the <hi>Great Sabbath</hi>: On which they make long diſcourſes, relating to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Uſe of the Paſſover.</p>
            <p>While they are ſearching and cleanſing their houſes, they are either to be ſilent, or to ſpeak of nothing but finding out and burning the leavened bread. And at the lighting of the Candle wherewith the Crums are ſought for, the Father of the Family ſaith this Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction:
<q>Bleſſed art thou, O Lord our God, the Lord of the whole earth, who haſt Sanctified with thy Precepts, and commanded us to caſt out the Leaven.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And all his Domeſticks diſtinctly anſwer, <hi>Amen.</hi> Some <hi>Jews</hi> will not ſuffer the women to cleanſe the houſe, becauſe they ſay, Talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſs is ſo natural to that Sex, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perform that Office with ſo great ſilence as is required. The Father of the Family has alwaies the inſpection of purging the houſe, who leſt any leaven'd bread might be left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcern'd, uſeth this Execration: <hi>Let all the leaven which I have not found and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, vaniſh into the duſt of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While ſome of the Family are making clean the houſe, others grinde the Wheat for the <hi>Azima,</hi> or unleavened Cakes. Where their firſt care is to ſee the Mill throughly cleanſed
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59218:94"/>
from all Grain that was deſigned for leavened bread. And in <hi>Barbary</hi> this taſk is not long or difficult, becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> uſe ſmall hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mills, like the <hi>Moors.</hi> Next, the Maſter of the houſe, betwixt Sun-ſet and Star-light, draws water and puts it in ſuch conſecrate Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels as are purpoſely ſet apart for their Feſtivals. And when all things are in readineſs, they fall to making of the Paſcal Cakes: Which are of a round figure, and without any other ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, than pure water and fine flour; which muſt have been two or three daies ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they uſe it. And this they do, leſt the heat it takes in grinding, ſhould make it ſmell, and grow leaveniſh. If in kneading or moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Cakes, any part of the dough happen to fall to the earth, they muſt not take it up, but leave it to be eaten by any creature that has a minde thereunto. For they are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the leaſt crum falling to the ground, being taken and put to the reſt, will ſower the whole lump.</p>
            <p>The woman that makes the Cakes, bakes firſt one alone, over which ſhe ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed art thou our God, who haſt commanded us to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the leavened Cake.</hi> And having ſaid theſe words, ſhe inſtantly burns it to aſhes, and then begins to bake the reſt.</p>
            <p>Upon the Eve of the Paſſover, at the time of the <hi>Mincha,</hi> they go to the Synagogue, where they celebrate the Office of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-Arvit.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59218:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The <hi>Prayers</hi> for the Paſſover, are for the moſt part the ſame with thoſe of the Sabbath; ſave that they intermingle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſome of the <hi>Roſhodes.</hi> During the time that the men ſtay at the Synagogue, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſpread the Tables, and adorn their Cub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bords, not for Oſtentation, but honour of the Feſtival. Againſt they return from Publick Oraiſons, there is a Cuſhion, the beſt they can provide, laid for the Head of the Houſe, at the upper end of the Room where they are to dine: For their poſture of eating, is exactly Eaſtern, or lying upon the ground. But this is no part of their Religion, but a conformity to the mode of their Reſidence. Upon the day of the Paſſover, they compoſe themſelves to a ſtately Geſture of body, and an imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Carriage, only to ſignifie thereby their deliverance from <hi>Egyptian Bondage.</hi> And the women which at other times ſit hanging their heads, at this Feaſt look loftily, expreſſing thereby Alacrity and Triumph.</p>
            <p>In eating the Paſchal Lamb, the <hi>Jews</hi> of all Countries uſe the ſame Ritual. Four Diſhes make up their Bill of Fare; which are theſe: The firſt Diſh contains three Paſchal Cakes; the uppermoſt whereof repreſents the High-Prieſt; the middle, the Levite; &amp; the lowermoſt, the Common Hebrews. The ſecond Diſh, is a Leg of Lamb or Kid roſted, together with an Hen-egg: The myſtery of which laſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59218:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I could never meet with any <hi>Jew</hi> was able to reveal. The third Diſh, is a deal of thick Stuff much like the <hi>Moors</hi> Cuſcuſſow; but of much better ingredients: For the <hi>Moors</hi> make theirs of meer water and flour, or crum'd bread; but the <hi>Jews</hi> put ſeveral ſpices in theirs: and the better to make it repreſent the colour of the bricks they made in <hi>Egypt,</hi> they tincture it with Saffron. The fourth Diſh, is a green Salad attended with Vinegre, in which they dipping the Salad, call to minde the ſower herbs wherewith their Fathers were commanded to eat the Paſſover. At this Feaſt every <hi>Jew</hi> is to drink Wine, but none to exceed four glaſſes, and none to refuſe ſo many. Before they lie down to eat, the Chief of the Family conſecrates the Viands. And when the Cakes are broken, and every one hath eaten a piece, and drank a cup of Wine, the whole Family ſing an Hymn: In which they remember the bread of Sorrow eaten by their Fathers in <hi>Egypt</hi>; concluding with their hopes of a ſpeedie Reſtauration unto <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the breaking of the ſecond Cake, the Maſter of the houſe puts a piece thereof in his Napkin, in memory of their Anceſtors wrapping up their Dough in haſte before it was leaven'd, when they poſted out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> And then they drink a ſecond glaſs of Wine, and ſing an Hymn; wherein they comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59218:96"/>
their deliverance. And having paſt the afternoon and part of the night in libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral refreſhment; they eat the third Cake, and drink a glaſs of Wine: Then the Father of the Family ſaith Grace, and with the fourth cup of Wine in his hand, repeats the 6 verſe of the 79 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and the laſt verſe of <hi>Lamentations</hi> the 3. and utters moſt direful Execrations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all that are not of their Religion. And immediately upon this, they go to ſleep. On the night of the Paſſover they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo ſafe from danger, that they let the doors ſtand open, which at other times are bolted and locked with all imaginable ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But ſome tell us, that they leave their doors open upon the night of the Paſſover, that there may be nothing to hinder the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of <hi>Elias,</hi> whoſe coming on that night is expected.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>rationale</hi> of the four Cups of Wine, the number of the Cakes, time of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecration, and other myſterious Rites of this Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival, it is to be learned out of their Maſters, whither the Curious are remitted. All that I have here to take notice of, is their Cuſtom of ſhowing the Paſchal Cakes to their Children, and inſtructing them in the Inſtitution and Ceremonies of the Paſſover: Wherein they pretend to be very faithful obſervers of <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.26, 27. As for the other daies of this Feaſt, there is little to be obſerved concerning
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59218:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them, except that thereon the <hi>Jews</hi> eat better, and go finer than at other times.</p>

               <p>Of their <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> or Feaſt of weeks.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe meaning and inſtitution of this Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val may partly be learned from its name. For <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> denotes the time of its obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was the fiftieth day, reckoning from the ſecond of the Paſſover. It was alſo called the Feaſt of Harveſt, and of <hi>First-fruits</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> then began their Harveſt, and offered the firſt Fruits of the Earth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.16. And ſeeing they cannot keep this Feaſt according to its firſt Inſtitution, they ſpend the time allotted thereunto in praying for their Reſtauration, that God would haſten their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the rebuilding of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: For which they uſe this form.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let it be thy good pleaſure, O Lord our God, and the God of our Fathers, that the houſe of thy Sanctuary may ſpeedily be rebuilt in our daies: and give us our portion in thy Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, this Feaſt may well bear the Title of the Feaſt of Harveſt, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the weeks uſual for that ſeaſon: which were bounded with two remarkable daies, whereof the one began, and the other ended
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59218:97"/>
the Harveſt. The former was called <hi>the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of the</hi> Paſſover, and the later the Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt. And from this ſecond day of the Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, they number their Sabbaths, which Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom explains the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batum,</hi> uſed in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>At this Feſtival, the preſent Ceremonies are but few: only they carry the Law twice in <hi>Proceſſion,</hi> and read out of it ſuch portions as concern the Oblations which were of old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to be offered. And theſe parcels of the Law are after a moſt ſolemn manner read by five ſelect <hi>Jews.</hi> Their entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments likewiſe are at this time very plain and frugal; uſing little fleſh-diet, though they are bound to uſe ſome, that they may not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict their own rule: <hi>A Feaſt without fleſh, is without joy.</hi> But ſtill white meats, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of milks, are their prime Delicacies. And this ſort of Viand is at this time made uſe, of, out of no leſs myſtery, than that by its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and dulcour, they might be remember'd of the purity and delightfulneſs of the Law. To which they allude the 10 verſe of the 19 <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They have a Cuſtom at this Feaſt to ſtrow the Synagogues, their dwelling Houſes, and the Streets (if they have leave) with Greens, and to wear ſome upon their heads; out of no deeper myſtery, than to commemorate that pleaſant Verdure which was upon Mount
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59218:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Sinai</hi> when the Law was there given unto their great Maſter <hi>Moſes.</hi> A Cuſtom they have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to bake a Cake of ſeven folds, to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie (ſay they) the ſeven Heavens, into which God aſcended when he went up from the Mount.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of this Feaſt, the <hi>Jews</hi> with great Devotion make this Prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bleſſed art thou, O Lord our God, the King of the World, who haſt ſanctified us with thy Precepts, and haſt inabled us rightly to number the days, as thou haſt commanded us, this being the firſt day.</hi> Thus they proceed to number until the whole fifty daies be expired, every day uſing the ſame Benediction.</p>

               <p>Of the Feaſt of Tabernacles.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THis is the third Capital Feaſt of Divine appointment among the <hi>Jews,</hi> which thoſe of <hi>Barbary</hi> keep at preſent as their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did antiently, in Booths, which being made of green Canes, it is now generally known among them by the Spaniſh name of <hi>Fieſta de las</hi> (writing as it is pronounced) <hi>Caunias,</hi> or <hi>the Feaſt of Reeds.</hi> And the end of this Feaſt is to preſerve the memory of their Anceſtors long Pilgrimage in the Wilderneſs;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59218:98"/>
and it laſts eight daies. The Inſtitution here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is to be met with, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 23, and 34. Now, as of old, the chief Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and obſervation of this Feſtival is confined to the firſt and ſecond day thereof.</p>
            <p>In that Liturgie of the <hi>Jews</hi> (which I have ſo often named) there is no proper Office for this Feaſt; ſo that thereon they do no more but go to the Synagogue, and there ſolemnize the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſual Service,</hi> and thence haſten home to their Booths, Bowers, Tents, or Tabernacles; which they finde furniſhed as richly as their Eſtate and Fortunes will make them. During the whole eight daies of this Feſtival, they live in their Booths, and adorn them with the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of their houſes; and conſtantly lodge therein, unleſs it fall out that the rains (which in <hi>Barbary</hi> often begin in <hi>September,</hi> the time of this Feaſt) force them into more comfortable lodgings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paulus Fagius</hi> (on <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.) reports out of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> that every man was bound e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very morning to bring a burden of Cittern, Palm, Mirtle or Willow-boughs, toward the making of theſe Booths. And this burden was called <hi>Hoſanna.</hi> And the cutting down of the Boughs, and ſtrowing them in the way, and crying <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to Chriſt as he rode to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> is thought to have been in alluſion to this Cuſtom. And the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Barbary</hi> are wont at this Feſtival, to take any ſort of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59218:98"/>
boughs in their hands, and to ſhake them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the four Cardinal Points of Heaven; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at the Eaſt. And by this action they foretel and threaten deſtruction to all the ends of the Earth that oppoſe them. With theſe Boughs alſo they make a great noiſe, in alluſion to the 12 verſe of the 69 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and alſo to terrifie the Devil, and triumph over ſin. At the ſhaking of theſe Boughs, they uſe theſe words:
<q>
                  <hi>Bleſſed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the World, who haſt ſanctified us with thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and commanded us to carry a bundle of Palm.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>At this time alſo, the Law is brought to the Reading-place, about which they walk with great ſtate; and nothing but threatning and victory appear in their looks. This they do ſeven times, in memory of their Fathers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing the walls of <hi>Hiericho.</hi> But others ſay, That this compaſſing of the Reading-place ſeven times, is in prediction of the certain ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of their Enemies. And this notice of the Ceremonie, is very agreeable to the <hi>Execrato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> which is now uſed by them: Wherein they profoundly curſe the Chriſtians; deſiring that God would ſmite them as he did the Firſt-born of <hi>Egypt.</hi> And though this <hi>Direful Prayer</hi> is not found in that Liturgie printed at <hi>Venice,</hi> (as I above-mentioned) yet I am aſſured by a good Author, that it is extant in the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59218:99"/>
               <hi>Machſor</hi> of the <hi>Cracovian Impreſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the laſt day of this Feſtival, the <hi>last Section</hi> of the Law is conſtantly read, and the firſt Section begun. For they begin and end the Leſſon of the Law on the ſame day, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their joy therein. This laſt day of the Feaſt of Tents, is called the <hi>Great day of the Feaſt,</hi> S. <hi>John</hi> 7.37. where <hi>Tremelius</hi> obſerves, that on the laſt of Tabernacles, the antient <hi>Jews</hi> uſed to incompaſs the Altar (as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Jews</hi> now the Reading-place) with Palms in their hands, crying <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> that is, <hi>Preſerve us we beſeech thee:</hi> Whence it was called <hi>Haſanna Rabba,</hi> or the Great Hoſanna, or the Chief of the Feaſt: And that on the ſame day they drew water from the <hi>Well</hi> of <hi>Shiloah</hi> at the foot of Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and brought it to the Temple, where the Prieſts mingled it with the beſt Wine, and poured it on the Altar: and that the people ſang theſe words of <hi>Eſay; With joy ſhall they draw water out of the</hi> Wells <hi>of Salvation.</hi> To which our Saviour is thought to have alluded, in that ſpeech which on this day he made uſe of, S. <hi>John</hi> 7.38. <hi>Every one that believeth in me, out of his belly ſhall flow living waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they have built their Tabernacles, they may not uſe them till the Father of the Family hath conſecrated both them and all the Utenſils of the Feaſt: wherein he gives God thanks that he hath choſen and ſanctified
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59218:99"/>
the <hi>Jews</hi> above all other Nations, and that to them only belongs the habitation in Tents. At the expiration of the Feaſt, when they come out of their Tabernacles, <hi>the Chief</hi> of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily ſaith theſe words: <hi>God grant that the following year we may dwell in the Tent of the Leviathan.</hi> The myſtery of which Prayer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the Opinion that the <hi>Jews</hi> have of eating with their <hi>Meſſias</hi> of the great Fiſh cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Leviathan</hi>; which they imagine to be of a Poetical Magnitude, and preſerved on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for that great Entertainment to which they ſhall all be invited by <hi>Meſſias,</hi> at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And the Prayer above-named, has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to this Opinion, and deſignes no more than their deſires that their <hi>King</hi> may have a ſpeedy advent.</p>
            <p>And having now taken this ſhort view of the preſent Rites wherewith the <hi>Jews</hi> celebrate their three <hi>Cardinal Feaſts,</hi> their Minor Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals come next to be conſidered. Among which, their <hi>Purim</hi> or <hi>Feaſt of Lots</hi> merits the firſt remembrance: For to it is allotted a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Office, which honour is not granted to any of the reſt.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Of the <hi>Jews</hi> Purim, or Feaſt of Lots.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe word Purim is <hi>Perſick,</hi> and ſignifies Lots; and the Feaſt bears this name from the occaſion of its Inſtitution, which without the trouble of tranſcribing, is to be ſeen at large in the Book of <hi>Eſther.</hi> The Miſchiefs plotted againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Enemies, and thoſe being killed by them who deſigned their deſtruction; and all this happening upon the 13 of the Month <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar,</hi> anſwering to our <hi>February,</hi> and ending upon the 14 of the ſame Month: in memory of their own deliverance, and the deſtruction of their Enemies, the <hi>Jews</hi> keep thoſe two daies Feſtival, whereon they both happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>In the Celebration of this Feaſt, they at preſent uſe theſe Ceremonies: Firſt they light up great ſtore of Lamps, that thereby they may teſtifie their joy; and read over the Book of <hi>Eſther:</hi> At which, both the women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are bound to be preſent. Who at the naming of <hi>Haman,</hi> make an hideous noiſe, beating with their hands, and ſtamping with their feet: and at the ſame time pronounce
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59218:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
theſe words; <hi>Let his name be blotted out: Let the name of the ungodly come to naught: Curſed be</hi> Haman; <hi>bleſſed be</hi> Mordachee: <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be</hi> Zereſch, <hi>but bleſſed be</hi> Eſther: <hi>Curſed be all Idolaters, and bleſſed be all</hi> Iſraelites. Which Maledictions are now applied to the Chriſtians. And when they come to that paſſage concerning the death of <hi>Haman</hi>'s Sons, they huddle it over without pauſe or diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; intimating that they were all killed in a moment, and that they hate to be long men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning them.</p>
            <p>When they come out of the Synagogue, they fall to eating and drinking; and are therein much more liberal at this, than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time. And they have a Rule, that at the Feaſt of Purim they ſhould drink till they cannot diſtinguiſh between, <hi>Curſed be</hi> Haman, <hi>and bleſſed be</hi> Mordachee. At this Feaſt, the Rich ſupply the <hi>Poor</hi> with Wine and Viands; and for two daies none undertake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Servile work:</hi> The women eſpecially are to keep Holy-day, in honour of her who was the occaſion of their Deliverance. At this Feaſt alſo they ſalute one another with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, and beſtow large Alms upon the Needy, in compliance with what their Great <hi>Patriot</hi> commanded, <hi>Eſther</hi> 9 20, 21, 22. Where he eſtabliſhed the Inſtitution of the Feaſt of Lots.</p>
            <p>The Mattins of this Feaſt, begin with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59218:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>

            <p>Purim is the laſt of their Anniverſary Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals: for happening in <hi>Adar,</hi> there is none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and Eaſter; which alwaies falls in <hi>Niſan,</hi> the Month that began the Year when the <hi>Hebrews</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and which ſtill keeps that place in the Computation of their Greater Feaſts. Beſides their <hi>Purim,</hi> and the three Capital Feaſts which we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy conſidered, the <hi>Jews</hi> have other Minor Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivals, as that of Reconciliation, Dedication, Church-Officers, New year, and Lunar Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; of which take this ſhort account in their Order.</p>
            <p>And beginning with their Feaſt of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement or Expiation, we finde the ground thereof in <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. and an expreſs Statute for its Celebration, v. 29. <hi>In the ſeventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye ſhall afflict your ſouls, and do no work at all, whether he be one of your own Country, or a ſtranger ihat ſojourneth among you:</hi> v. 30. <hi>For on that day ſhall the Prieſt make
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59218:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
an Atonement for you to cleanſe you, that you may be clean from all your ſins before the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In obedience unto which Law, the <hi>Jews</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the 10 of <hi>Tizri</hi> repair to their Synagogues, and in places of open Toleration, carry wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in their hands, which when they have lighted, they begin in a very diſmal note to lament their ſins, and continue faſting and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ten daies, which are called <hi>the daies of Contrition:</hi> for which their Liturgy has a proper Office.</p>
            <p>Every morning, during this Feaſt of Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, they thrice repeat this Confeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O Lord, thy people, the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>they have ſin'd, they have done wickedly, they have tranſgreſſed before thee; I beſeech thee now, O Lord, pardon the ſins, iniquities, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, with which the people, the houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>have ſin'd, done wickedly, and tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before thee, as it is written in the Law of thy Servant</hi> Moſes: <hi>That in that day he ſhall make an Atonement for you, that he might cleanſe you, and that you might be clean from all your iniquities before the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Confeſſion, ſaith <hi>P. Fagius,</hi> is of very great Antiquity, and was made by the High-Prieſt when he diſburden'd the ſins of the whole Congregation upon the Head of the Scape-goat. Since the deſtruction of their <hi>City,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> have no place for a proper Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; and therefore, inſtead thereof, when
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59218:102"/>
they come from the Synagogue, every Father of a Family takes a Cock, (a white one if poſſible) upon the 9th day of the Feaſt, and calling his Houſehold about him, repeats ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Sentences of Scripture; among which, the principal are the 17 verſ. of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 107. <hi>Fools becauſe of their tranſgreſſion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their iniquities are afflicted.</hi> And 23 verſ. of <hi>Job</hi> 13. <hi>How many are mine iniquities and ſins! Make me to know my tranſgreſſion and my ſin.</hi> After the repetition of theſe Scriptures, he waves the Cock three times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his head, at each of which he uſeth theſe or the like words: <hi>Let this Cock be a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for me: Let it be my ſubſtitute: Let it be an Expiation for me: Let the Bird die; but let life and happineſs be to me and to all</hi> Iſrael. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> Then he again ſwings the Cock thrice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his head, once for himſelf, once for his Sons, and once for the <hi>Strangers</hi> that are with him. Then he kills the Cock, and ſaith, <hi>I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved thus to die.</hi> The Woman takes a Hen, and doth the like for thoſe of her Sex. In <hi>Barbary</hi> where the Houſes are flat-roofed, they caſt the Garbage thereon, to be devoured by ſome ravenous Birds, in token that their ſins are removed as the Entrails they caſt out. Now the reaſon why they chuſe a Cock for the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory,</hi> is drawn from the ambiguous <hi>word</hi> in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> which may ſignifie either Man or Cock. So that they repute the death of a
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59218:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Cock, as much as that of a Man: and to this Domeſtick bird the 53 of <hi>Eſay,</hi> with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paſſages of <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> are prophanely and ridiculouſly applied. But however they may at this Feaſt greatly extol<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Merits of the Cock, and imagine all their ſins to be atoned by his death: yet when themſelves come to die, they acknowledge no Commutation, but ſkin for ſkin according to this ſaying of one of their Maſters when he was a dying: <hi>Let my own death be the Expiation and Satisfaction for all my ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they have done with the Cock, they repair to the Sepulchres, where they repeat, enlarge, and enforce their Prayers, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions. They beſtow the value of their Cocks upon the Poor, to whom formerly they gave their Carkaſſes, which they now keep to furniſh out their own Tables. Beſides that form of publick Confeſſion which we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, they uſe private Confeſſion one to another: which they thus perform. About the middle of the Service they make an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and two by two ſtep aſide in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue and confeſs their ſins to each other. During the time of Confeſſion, he that confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth turns his face Northward, and with great ſeeming Contrition bows his body, beats his breſt, and readily ſubmits his back to ſuch ſtripes as his friend will inflict; who yet never exceeds the number of 39. And the firſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59218:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thus made Confeſſion, the ſecond goes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame duty.</p>
            <p>This Feaſt as it has the name of <hi>Expiation</hi> (becauſe according to its firſt Inſtitution, the High-Prieſt did then confeſs his own ſins and the ſins of the people; and by certain Rites did expiate, and make atonement to God for them) ſo is it likewiſe called the Feaſt of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,</hi> becauſe at this time they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour a general <hi>Amneſty</hi> and <hi>Pardon.</hi> For they labour that no quarrel among them remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconciled. He that ſeeks to be at peace with his Neighbour, though he be refuſed, is looked upon as innocent. They hold this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation ſo neceſſary, that if the offended die without it, the <hi>offender</hi> muſt go to his Gr<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e, and in the preſence and hearing of ten Witneſſes, confeſs his treſpaſs.</p>
            <p>Upon the <hi>Even</hi> of the 9th of this Feaſt, they repair to the Synagogue, where they trim and encreaſe the number of their Lamps. The women do the like at home. If the Lamps burn cleer, it is a good ſigne that their ſins are pardoned, and that they ſhall live chearful and happy. But if the Lamps burn dim, it is a ſad abodement their treſpaſſes are not expiated. Whereupon ſome of them renew their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and uſe ſeveral abſtinences, and remain reſtleſs till the Omen alter. Some are repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at this time to bribe the Devil that he may not accuſe them; and ſome again are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of their Expiation, that they bid the Devil do his worſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:59218:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>That the <hi>Expiation</hi> &amp; <hi>Reconcilement</hi> might be extended unto all, upon the <hi>Eve</hi> of the 9th of this Feaſt, they abſolve all Offenders, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the Excommunicate, and admit to the Prayers and Communion of the Synagogue, even the ſtubborn and <hi>refractary.</hi> At laſt the <hi>Chaſan</hi> bleſſeth the people, ſtretching out his hands toward them: which hands the people dare not ſtedfaſtly look upon while they are elevate, becauſe they ſuppoſe them for that time to be full of the Holy Ghoſt. After the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation</hi> is thus ended, they continue a ſpace faſting at the Synagogue, and then return home to feaſt: and to teſtifie their mutual Peace and Reconcilement.</p>
            <p>Their next Feaſt is that of <hi>Dedication,</hi> whoſe Inſtitution we meet with in 1 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 4.59. <hi>Moreover Judas and his brethren,</hi> &amp;c. And this our Saviour honour'd with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, S. <hi>John</hi> 10.22. not to countenance the abuſes, but to own its appointment, and to approve the Conſecration and Dedication of times and places to Gods ſervice. This Feaſt in the <hi>N. T.</hi> is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or Renovations, or a Feaſt wherein ſomething is renewed, and is in memory of ſecond Dedications. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues 8 daies, during which time the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues are full of Candles; which may be the reaſon that the Spaniſh <hi>Jews</hi> call it <hi>Fieſta de las Candelas</hi>; and ſome call it <hi>the Feaſt of Oyl:</hi> and both give this reaſon of the name.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:59218:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>In the Dedication of the Temple, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of the Divine Worſhip, there want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Oyl for the Holy Lamps; whereupon <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das Maccabaeus</hi> diligently ſeeking every corner of the Temple for Oyl, at length found a Jar full, which was ſealed with the High-Prieſts Seal, and had never fallen into the deſecrating hands of the Enemy. But the Oyl was of ſo ſmall a quantity, that it was but enough for one night. Whereupon, he and the people became very ſorrowful, not being able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Oyl for the preſent neceſſity. For the place where it was to be bought, ſtood three daies journey from <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> But God (ſaith the ſtory) by a bountiful Miracle made the ſmall Jar of Oyl to laſt the whole eight daies of the Feaſt. In memory of which mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous ſupply, ſome, as I ſaid, have called it the <hi>Feaſt of Candles,</hi> and others, <hi>the Feaſt of Oyl.</hi> They ſpend the eight daies in junketing and Games; little of Religion appearing through the whole Solemnity.</p>
            <p>They have another Feaſt in remembrance of giving the Law, at which time they ſell thoſe Eccleſiaſtick Offices we ſpoke of before: and which always falls out upon the ſame day that the laſt Section of the Law is finiſhed, and the firſt begun. And they begin the Law the ſame day they end it, that the Devil may not tell God, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> is weary of his Law. On this Feaſt all the Copies of Law are taken
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59218:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>
out of the Ark, and in very ſolemn Proceſſion is carri'd through the Synagogue with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Exultation and rejoycing. And after this, they make the beſt proviſion they can poſſible, which they call the Supper upon the finiſhing the Law. And it is founded upon the Act of <hi>Solomon,</hi> who coming to <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and there offering Burnt-Offerings and Peace-Offerings before the Ark of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Law, made a Feaſt to all his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.15.</p>
            <p>The next Feaſt, is that of the <hi>New year,</hi> which is kept in <hi>Tizri</hi>; for that is the firſt Month according to their Secular, though but the ſeventh according to their Eccleſiaſtical Computation. On the day of this Feſtival, they repair to the Synagogue; and the Uſual Service being ended, with a ſhort Prayer they conſecrate the Feaſt, and drink, if they can poſſible procure it, ſome <hi>Muſtum,</hi> becauſe it is Wine of a good abodement of an happy Year, which they then wiſh one to another.</p>
            <p>The Younger ſort do now receive the Chief Prieſts Benediction, which he gives them by laying his hands upon their heads, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they may have a Good Year. In ſome places Rams horns are ſounded at this Feaſt, in memory (think ſome) of the Ram which was ſacrificed in ſtead of <hi>Iſaac</hi>; ſome, in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the giving of the Law with ſound of Cornets; and ſome, to minde them of the day
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59218:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Judgement, to which they ſhall be ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ſound of Trumpets. Now the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and the giving of the Law did, and the laſt Judgement (ſay they) ſhall happen upon the firſt day of <hi>Tizri,</hi> anſwering to our <hi>September.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> have had a Cuſtome on this day to run into the Rivers, and there to ſhake off their Sins, that according to <hi>Micah</hi> 7.19. <hi>they may be carried into the depths of the Sea.</hi> If at this <hi>Luſtration</hi> they have the good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to ſee a Fiſh, they ſhake themſelves lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily on purpoſe to load it with their Sins, that it may ſwim away with them, and be as the Scape-goat of old, which carried the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Sins into the Deſart. Some among them would have this repairing to the running-Water, to be in memory of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s being led by an Evil Spirit into a River, (when he went to Sacrifice his Son) where being in great danger of Drowning, he prai'd unto God, and the River upon the ſudden became dry Land. But he that ſhall converſe with the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſhall be furniſhed with plenty of Stories of this nature; and if upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion I ſhould have ſet down the Miracles wherewith their moſt ridiculous and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Rites are atteſted, I might have made this <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> Voluminous to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Their laſt Feaſt I ſhall take notice of, is that of their New-Moons, which are a ſort of <hi>Half
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59218:105"/>
Holy-days</hi>; the Morning, as on other daies, being ſpent in the Synagogues, and the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon in <hi>Good Company.</hi> At the firſt ſight of the New-moon, they have a <hi>Benediction,</hi> wherein they bleſs God, that with the breath of his Mouth he hath created the Heavens and all the Hoſt thereof, and appointed them Laws which they obſerve: That he renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Moon, and makes it aſſiſt the pregnant <hi>Hebrews.</hi> And then they leap as 'twere to catch her, and wiſh their Enemies may come no nearer them, than they to the Moon. Then they extol her good qualities; for which they have but little reaſon, ſeeing that they are told how in the beginning God deprived the Moon of Light for Murmuring againſt Him; to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate which Crime of the Moon, the <hi>Jews</hi> were appointed to keep this Feaſt.</p>
            <p>At the Feaſt of Tabernacles, they Divine from the rays of the Moon, of the accidents of the whole Year. If the Shadows of their Bodies appear defective, they accordingly foretel their own or Friends Deaths. As if a man ſee his Shadow without a Head, then he is to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to danger of Death, or die, the following year. If it wants a Finger, he ſhall looſe a good Friend. If the Right hand, a Son: If the Left, a Daughter. If no Shadow at all appear, then the man's death is unavoidable.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Of the Jewiſh Faſts.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Jewiſh Faſts, except that upon the Expiation, are eſteem'd to be all of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Inſtitution. Their firſt Faſt, is in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Siege of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> which happened upon the tenth of <hi>Tebeth,</hi> anſwering to our <hi>December</hi>; for which their Liturgy hath a ſmall <hi>Office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their ſecond, is in memory of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the two Tables of the <hi>Law</hi>; for the loſs of their daily Sacrifice; for ſetting Idolatry in the Temple; for the ſecond Siege of the City, and breaking down the Walls thereof. And this conſtantly falls upon the 17th of <hi>Thamuz,</hi> correſponding to our <hi>June,</hi> and laſts till the ninth of <hi>Ab.</hi> All the daies of this Faſt are accounted ominous and unlucky; ſo that thereon they avoid all buſineſs of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and if poſſible to begin Journeys, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ought that is conſiderable: And ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are they hereon to be idle, that School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boys are not thereon to be Corrected. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fifth of <hi>Ab,</hi> or <hi>July,</hi> they ſit on the Ground, read <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s Lamentations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail the Dead, and the loſs of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi>; and for ten daies live ſo ſeverely, that they abſtain
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59218:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from every thing wherein is ſuppoſed to be delight.</p>
            <p>Their third Faſt is for the death of <hi>Geda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,</hi> whom we read was Treacherouſly Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, <hi>Jer.</hi> 41.2. and it falls out in <hi>Tizri,</hi> or <hi>September.</hi> Beſides theſe Faſts which are of publick Inſtitution, they have ſeveral that are private, as thoſe of Munday and Thurſday: one for the death of <hi>Miriam</hi> and <hi>Eli</hi>; and another for the turning of the Bible out of holy Hebrew into profane Greek, by the Seventy Tranſlators. But theſe Faſts being the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Exerciſes but of ſome <hi>Jews,</hi> their Rites fall under no certain annotation.</p>
            <p>The general Rule in all their Faſting, is to abſtain from all manner of Meat and Drink till the Stars appear: and if the <hi>Jews</hi> were Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox in the circumſtances of this Afflictive, no people would therein exceed them. But in this, as all other things, they are palpably Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, relying upon the very doing of the work, and eſteeming a meer <hi>Corporal abſtinence</hi> high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meritorious. Beſides, there are not a few Miracles aſcribed to the bare act of Faſting.</p>

And though for greater Decorum and Solemnity, the <hi>Grand Segnor</hi> keeps his Muſti, whom he makes his Pope, and pretended Oracle in Religion; yet he has no power to chaſtize any by Spiritual Cenſures, be their Enormities never ſo hainous. And upon this account the <hi>Jews</hi> upbraid <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſm</hi> with great deficiency, becauſe it has no power to terrifie Evil doers, to preſerve the broken from the whole, and to prevent and divert Gods Judgements; to bring Offenders to amendment, and to maintain the credit and power of their Religion. To all which ends the <hi>Jews</hi> manage and hold Excommunication neceſſary. Concerning which, this enſuing Chapter ſhall give the Reader a ſhort account of the cauſes of Excommunication, its kindes and form.</p>
            <p>Some have thought that the <hi>Jews</hi> of old uſed Excommunications onely in caſe of Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions: of which they held chiefly theſe three
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59218:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> by Leproſie, touching of the Dead, and an Iſſue. And that to theſe three ſorts of Pollutions, were adapted as many kindes of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, namely, the <hi>Niddui, Herem,</hi> and <hi>Shammatha.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But beſides theſe three cauſes of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication among the Primitive <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Modern</hi> aſſigne twenty four more; for all, or any of which, they at preſent Excommunicate, that is, forbid thoſe of their Religion the free enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Civil and Religious Society.</p>
            <p>The cauſes of Excommunication among the <hi>Jews,</hi> are chiefly theſe.</p>

               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Theſe were the old primarie Cauſes of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, moſt of which are now in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent uſe with the <hi>Jews.</hi> Thoſe indeed rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Sacrifices, (becauſe they now have none) are quite out of uſe: As alſo that which reſpects their ſelling of <hi>Land</hi> or <hi>Houſe</hi>; for in <hi>Barbary</hi> they have none but what they hire.</p>
            <p>The kindes, or rather the Degrees of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication in antient uſe with the <hi>Jews,</hi> were the three above-named, whereof the <hi>Niddui</hi> is by ſome Chriſtian Authors reckoned the loweſt ſort; and by which they underſtand a Separation from, or a caſting out of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue; which uſually laſted 30 days; but might be of a ſhorter or longer continuance, as the Offended gave ſignes of Repentance. During the time of this Excommunication,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59218:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the party was not to come within four Cubits either of a man or Woman, nor to dreſs or trim himſelf as at other times: yet they ſay he was admitted to Inſtruction, to hear Divine Service, to hire others, &amp; to let out himſelf to work; on condition of obſerving the four Cubits diſtance but now mentioned. But if the Conſiſtory plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, upon the contumacie of the Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, they might retrench theſe Priviledges, and aggravate the Penance, even to the denial of his Son Circumciſion, and the Burial of his Dead. Alſo if himſelf died, he was denied all uſual Rites of Burial, and a great Stone laid upon his Grave, in token that he deſerved to have been Stoned to death.</p>
            <p>The denouncing of this Excommunication was not always confined to the Court or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory: (which at this day cannot conſiſt of fewer than three Maſters) for it was in the power of any private perſon to Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate thoſe whom they found guilty of the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth cauſe of Excommunication; and he that was herein negligent incurr'd the like pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty: But they were preſently abſolved, leſt it ſhould become a Snare and an offence unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And to reſtrain them to Sobriety here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the Court had power to puniſh him, that did it raſhly. From theſe private Excommunications their Superiours, <hi>Rabbins,</hi> and chief Lawyers, were Exempt: for theſe had a priviledge to Excommunicate and Abſolve themſelves. The
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59218:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
form both of Extrajudicial and legal Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, was one and the ſame, which is this: <hi>N. Let him be Excommunicate.</hi> And the Excommunicate upon Repentance, was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in this form: <hi>N. Thou haſt Abſolution, or thy offence is forgiven thee.</hi> But at the time of Abſolution, the Court had power to correct the Treſpaſſer with Stripes.</p>
            <p>The ſecond kinde of Excommunication was called <hi>Shammatha,</hi> the ſame with the <hi>Maran-Atha</hi> think the moſt. And it ſounds (ſaith Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> according to the opinion of ſome) <hi>The Lord cometh.</hi> He would not have his <hi>Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matha</hi> at all to differ from <hi>Niddui</hi>; which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion he grounds upon ſome ſayings in the <hi>Talmudick</hi> Commentaries. But <hi>J. Druſius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates otherwiſe, when he ſaith, the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to Excommunicate <hi>per maledictionem,</hi> that was their <hi>Cherem,</hi> or <hi>Anathema; per Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parationem,</hi> that was their <hi>Niddui</hi>; and by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranatha,</hi> the ſame with <hi>Shammatha</hi>; and by others of that kinde. By this laſt intimation, I conceive, may be meant the <hi>Anathema Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranatha.</hi> Their <hi>Shammatha</hi> was a total Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Church, a blotting them out of the Book of Life, and not permitting them the leaſt communion in things of publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And by the word <hi>Shammatha,</hi> they ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the coming of the Lord, to take Vengeance upon thoſe who are thus Excommunicate. And it was never pronounced upon the offender,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59218:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
till he became deſperately irreclaimable.</p>
            <p>A third kind of Excommunication was the <hi>Cherem,</hi> which enforced the <hi>Niddui</hi> when the offender within 30 daies gave no ſignes of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, nor ſought to be reconciled. A new form of Excommunication was now uſed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining dreadful Execrations, Imprecations and Curſings of it.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Maranatha,</hi> an old Spaniſh Author tells us, it got the ſignification of <hi>Anathema</hi> upon this occaſion: The <hi>Jews</hi> glorying of their <hi>Meſſias</hi> to come, commonly uſed the word <hi>Maran</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Our Lord: in oppoſition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, the Chriſtians uſed to ſay <hi>Maran Atha</hi>; Our Lord or <hi>Meſſias</hi> is come already. Whereupon no ſmall ſtrife aroſe betwixt them. The <hi>Jews</hi> frequently out of contempt ſaying <hi>Maran,</hi> and contumeliouſly called the Chriſtians <hi>Maranites.</hi> On the contrary, the Chriſtians replied <hi>Maran Atha,</hi> affirming that their Lord was come already. And hence it grew that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call thoſe <hi>Maranos,</hi> who being diſcended of Jewiſh Parents, and being Chriſtians, turn Apoſtates, and yet expect the coming of <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Maranatha</hi> is certainly of far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er antiquity, than in this ſtory it can pretend to. For it was uſed in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. doth cleerly teſtifie. Where an old Engliſh Tranſlation (cited by Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>) of an hundred twenty and five years ſtanding, renders <hi>Anathema Maranatha,</hi> Let him be had in Execration to death: Meaning (perhaps) that the Excommunicate ſhould die under this ſevere Cenſure. For <hi>Anathema</hi> being added to <hi>Maranatha,</hi> by a general agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59218:111"/>
was the higheſt degree of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. There were indeed two ſorts of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem</hi> in the Old Teſtament: the one a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of things to Gods Service, by ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them from Common and Ordinary uſe: Of which we read, <hi>Lev.</hi> 27.28. And as in the caſe of <hi>Hierio<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> where pilfering or ſtealth of ſuch things as were devoted, was puniſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by death. <hi>Joſ.</hi> 7. The other ſort of <hi>Cherem,</hi> was a devoting of perſons unto death. But the <hi>Cherem</hi> we now ſpeak of, was in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours time a very fearful kinde of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication among the <hi>Jews.</hi> In which, with Solemnity and Authority, and a heap of dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Execrations and Curſings, a man was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Synagogue. And this ſort of Excommunication was ſo dreadful, that for fear of it, many principal <hi>Jews</hi> who believed on Chriſt, durſt not confeſs him, S. <hi>John</hi> 9.22. &amp; 12.42. and 16.2. Of the manifold uſe of this <hi>Cherem</hi> among the antient <hi>Jews,</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> has made ſo plentiful a Collection, that the Reader may there beſt be ſatisfied, <hi>De jure naturali &amp; gentium,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 7, &amp;c. That which upon this ſubject I have here to take further notice of, is the <hi>Antient</hi> Form of their General <hi>Cherem</hi> or <hi>Anathema,</hi> as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes the ſevereſt Cenſure of the Jewiſh Church. The Form I ſhall here inſert, is taken out of that <hi>Ritual,</hi> which they call <hi>Sepher Colbo,</hi> or <hi>Pandects</hi>; and which was uſed againſt all thoſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> who wilfully and knowing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

But that which is the ſubject of the preſent remark, is the manner of legal proceeding in the caſe of <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi>; which is plainly and compendiouſly thus: When any conteſt ariſeth among them concerning Debts, Bargains, Contracts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a <hi>Juncto</hi> of <hi>Sabios, Chachams</hi> or <hi>Maſters,</hi> are appointed to hear and determine in the Cauſe. This Court of <hi>Chachams</hi> conſiſts of 11, 9, 7, 5.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59218:114"/>
and can never be of fewer than three. To theſe the party promovent makes his addreſs, in a ſhort and plain Allegation of the Caſe: which the Judges examine by Witneſſes; who muſt be perſons well reported of, and very ſober: For ſo much is required by their 212 Precept. In caſe of want of Witneſſes, the bare Oath of the party producent is ſufficient: if he be a man of known integrity and good fame. If the <hi>Creditor</hi> have any thing under the <hi>Debtor</hi>'s hand, he has the priviledge of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting the truth thereof by his own Oath. But if he demands a debt for which he can produce no Writing, the Debtor has leave to ſwear the <hi>Negative.</hi> If the Witneſſes whoſe names are at the <hi>Bill</hi> be dead, and there be none to atteſt their Hands, the Bill is invalid, &amp; caſt out of <hi>Court.</hi> That which much renowns their Judicial Procedures, is cheapneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition; the whole matter being tried and determined in a few hours. Yet if either party finde himſelf agrieved, he has the liberty of appealing to another <hi>Court,</hi> and may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Appeal as far as <hi>Hieruſalem:</hi> beyond which, there lies none. But though they may diſlike, yet they dare not revile the Sentence of any <hi>Court.</hi> For to ſpeak evil of any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Juſtice, is <hi>ipſo facto</hi> Excommunication. And he incurs the like puniſhment, who ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to appeal to a ſecond <hi>Court,</hi> before he has obtain'd leave from the firſt: which laies
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59218:115"/>
ſo great a reſtraint upon Appeals, that few now happen, unleſs in ſome ſuch important Caſe, as Marriage and Divorce.</p>
            <p>It is very obſervable, that the <hi>Jews</hi> have made very cautious Proviſion to conſerve the Eſteem and Reverence of their Maſters. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that none in word or carriage can offer them the leaſt diſreſpect, but he is Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, and his Teſtimony render'd invalid. And if within three daies he make not his Peace with the offended <hi>Rabbi,</hi> the Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication is aggravated, and pronounced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore witneſs in open <hi>Court</hi> by a <hi>Rabbi,</hi> who ſuperaddes thereunto a Solemn Malediction. If the Excommunicate flie to another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the <hi>Curſe</hi> follows him, and he is ſent before to beg pardon and be abſolved in the ſame place where the <hi>Crime</hi> was committed; or in caſe of contumacie, the <hi>Execration</hi> is aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

            <p>The Maſters, of which the <hi>Court</hi> conſiſts, are choſen upon their Reputation for their Learnedneſs in the Law, and Integrity of their Manners: and for a clearer teſtimony of the former, they ſometime are tried by Diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But beſides <hi>

               <p>The manner of the <hi>Jews</hi> Alms, and of their making proviſion for the Poor.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THoſe who have obſerved that the <hi>Jews</hi> have no Beggers, ſeem not well informed of the manner of their Alms, and their way of providing for the Poor. Whom 'tis true we may not reckon among <hi>Beggers,</hi> as that word uſually implies a ſeeking Relief from houſe to houſe. For though among the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Barbary</hi> there is great ſtore of needy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yet they are ſupplied after a manner which much conceals (as to men of other Religions) their Poverty. For the Weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier take care to provide for them, and very
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:59218:116"/>
much magnifie their Religion upon this very ſcore, that they live under its profeſſion in a more mutual Charity of Alms than either the <hi>Moore</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian</hi>; both which (with great inſulting) I have heard them upbraiding with their common Beggers.</p>
            <p>And it cannot be denied, but that the <hi>Jews</hi> manner of Relieving their Poor is Regular and Commendable. For firſt they ſuffer them not to take Alms of any man who is of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Religion from their own: and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of them and their wants, is conſigned to no meaner perſons than their chief <hi>Maſters,</hi> who once or oftener every Year (as occaſion requires) are very ſolemn in this Inſpection. In every Synagogue they have in ſtore ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Copies of the Law, which they ſell for great ſums of Money: But the Buyers are not permitted to carrie theſe Copies out of the Synagogue, or any further to impropriate them to their own uſe, than that (if any of them fall into Neceſſity) they may be ſold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to relieve them. And therefore the Name of the Buyer is upon a Label annexed to the Copie of the Law, that they may know to whom it belongs, and for whoſe uſe it may be ſold, if any of the Buyer's Relations be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to <hi>Want.</hi> Inſomuch that the buying of one of theſe Copies of the Law, is a certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion againſt Poverty, if it ſhall happen. But that which is here chiefly to be remarked,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59218:116"/>
is their raiſing of Maintenance for the <hi>Poor</hi> with the prizes of theſe <hi>Copies.</hi> And to make more ready Chapmen, the buying of them is accounted very <hi>Honourable,</hi> and <hi>Meritorious,</hi> &amp; of no ſmall <hi>Intereſt</hi> to the Buyer's Familie.</p>
            <p>Another way of raiſing Proviſions for the <hi>Poor,</hi> are the Legacies and Bequeathments of dying perſons: For the <hi>Jews</hi> have a Rule, that none die ſafely, who bequeath not ſome part of their Eſtates to the Corban of the <hi>Poor.</hi> Next they have their Contributions; and out of all theſe together they raiſe Portions, and make proviſions for Orphans and indigent Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, and the Neceſſitous in general. And to prevent all Sophiſtication and partiality here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the poorer Females are provided for by Lot; and without reſpect of Circumſtances, thoſe on whom the Lot falls, are firſt placed in Marriage. They moreover permit the <hi>Poor</hi> upon every Friday and Holy-day-eve to receive private Alms, to honour (that is, to keep) the <hi>Sabbath</hi> and the Feſtival with. They have alſo their <hi>Kibbuz,</hi> or <hi>Letters of Collection,</hi> by which the Indigent has liberty to go from Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue to Synagogue, to receive the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence of their Country-men. And theſe <hi>Kibbuz</hi> much reſemble our Briefs. In them the Poverty, Religion and Honeſty of the Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are certified, who are firſt to produce them to the <hi>Chief Maſter</hi> of the Synagogue; and he having given his approbation thereof, appoints
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59218:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a day for the Collection, which is uſually made at the door of the Synagogue. By theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters alſo the neceſſitous Father raiſeth Portions for his Daughters. When any poor <hi>Jew</hi> is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Journey, it is the cuſtom for him to repair for relief to thoſe of his own Religion, who are oblidgd to treat him civilly; but his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany quickly becomes troubleſom, according to the old ſaying among them: <hi>The firſt day a Gueſt; the ſecond a Burden; the third day a Vagamond.</hi>

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>WHen a <hi>Jew</hi> falling ſick apprehends his Diſeaſe to be mortal, he ſends for a <hi>Sabio,</hi> or Maſter, and ſome of his more inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Friends, with whoſe advice and aſſiſtance he ſets his houſe in order. The <hi>Rabbi</hi> firſt draws up an <hi>Envois</hi> of his Eſtate: then he takes account of his Debts, and making firſt proviſion for their payment out of the Eſtate, the reſt is diſpoſed of in <hi>Legacies</hi> and <hi>Alms.</hi> The object of the later, are Orphans, Widows, Synagogues, and the <hi>Holy houſe</hi>; for ſo they call the Temple, which they expect ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built at the coming of their <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> And
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59218:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
therefore toward the ſtructure thereof, every dying <hi>Jew</hi> that is able, contributes ſomething. For they have erected a Treaſury to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; which is managed by the <hi>Maſters,</hi> and carefully improved by them. The reſt of the Eſtate is divided among the Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: The Wives firſt taking out their Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries doubled. If the Children of the dying perſon be very young, the <hi>Maſter</hi> is to be their Guardian; who with a ſignal care labours to improve their Fortunes. The Alms like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are depoſite in the <hi>Rabbies</hi> hands, who out of them diſpoſeth of ſome Females every year in Marriage.</p>
            <p>When the ſick man has ſet his houſe in order, and is under evident indications of Death, He makes confeſſion of his Faith, and in a ſhort Oraiſon is recommended to Mercie. And the breath is no ſooner out of his Noſtrils, but they prepare for his Funeral, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways within the natural day of his Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And firſt the Corps is waſhed in clean water; or if he be rich, in water of Roſes, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range-flowers, or any thing that is Aromatick. While the Corps is thus making clean, they pray that God would cleanſe the Soul from all the defilements that it had contracted in the body. This ceremony of waſhing being fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, they put the Corps in a clean Shirt and Drawers, and then a Strip of linnen reſembling the <hi>Zizith</hi>; and after all, they ſow him in a
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59218:118"/>
very white Sheet, and put him into a Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin.</p>
            <p>The relations of the Deceaſed, for ſeven daies after the Interment, ſtir not abroad; or if by ſome extraordinary occaſion they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to go out of doors, it is without Shoos; which is a token with them, that they have loſt a dear <hi>Friend.</hi> For the ſeven daies that they ſtay within, the Neighbours come to the houſe to pray with them; and their Mourning habit is either a black <hi>Ganiphe,</hi> or the ſame clothes they wore when the party died.</p>
            <p>The Corps is born by four to the place of Burial, in this proceſſion: In the firſt rank march the <hi>Chachams</hi> or Prieſts, next to them the kindred of the Deceaſed, after whom come thoſe that are Invited to the Funeral; and all ſinging in a ſort of plain-ſong the 49th <hi>Pſalm.</hi> And if it laſt not till they come to the Grave, they begin it again. At the Grave, ten <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies,</hi> or ſo many old <hi>Jews</hi> in their room, ſay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſome certain Pſalms, compoſed by the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins</hi> for that purpoſe. And when they are ended, the Corps is laid in the Grave and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Earth; and the <hi>Rabbies</hi> compaſſing the Grave ſeven times, ſay, <hi>From the Earth thou cameſt, and to the Earth thou art returned.</hi> After this is done, they return from the Grave to the houſe of the Deceaſed, where one, who as chief Mourner receives them, with his Jaws tied up with a linnen Cloth, after the ſame
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59218:118"/>
manner that they binde up the Dead. And by this the Mourner is ſaid to teſtifie that he was ready to die with his Friend. And thus muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled the Mourner goes for ſeven daies; during which time the reſt of his Friends come twice every twenty four hours to pray with him. At the end of theſe ſeven daies, the Friends of the Deceaſed repair to his Grave, which they cover with a black Cloth, and ſay this Prayer, <hi>Vide Syracides</hi> 22.23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judge of the Truth, who Judgeſt truly, be Judge of the Truth; for all thy Judgements are Juſtice and Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then the Kindred of the Dead wiſh one another good health and Comfort. And the ſame Ceremonie is repeated preciſely that day twelvemonth; till which time the Obſequies are incompleat.</p>
            <p>If the Friends of the Deceaſed be devout, they often every Week repair to his Grave, where they make great Lamentation and bitter Wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping over him; they pray at the ſame time, <hi>That God would pardon his Sins, and receive him into the Garden.</hi> Meaning the Garden out of which <hi>Adam</hi> was caſt, when he became diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient.</p>
            <p>In the Funeral-Rites of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the ſame order is obſerved for both Sexes: only with this Decorum, that the Women meddle not with
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:59218:119"/>
the Men, nor the Men with the Women: but each Waſh and Shrowd thoſe of their own Sex. They never bury their Dead promiſcuouſly with thoſe of another Faith; but have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed diſtinct Burying-places where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, which they very much reſpect, and to which they often reſort, both in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of their own Mortality, and to lament and pray for thoſe who are dead already.</p>
            <p>It may not be unfit to obſerve, that though the Modern Ceremonies of Burial are neither ſo numerous nor coſtly as thoſe of old among the <hi>Jews</hi>; yet they do not much varie from them: For the waſhing of the Body was in uſe at the time of <hi>Tabitha</hi>'s death; and the Chief Mourner, ſpoken of before, as alſo the Weekly Lamenting of the Dead, refers to the Women hired to lament at Burials: And which the Scripture calls <hi>Mourning-Women, Jerem.</hi> 9.17. the ſame with the <hi>Praeficae</hi> among the <hi>Romans.</hi> They likewiſe agree in the places of Burial, which are now as formerly without the Towns or Cities where they live, except that in <hi>Fez</hi> they have a Burying-place within the City, adjoyning to the <hi>Juderia,</hi> or the part where they live; as was ſaid in the entrance of this Diſcourſe. Enquiring after Inſcriptions or Epitaphs, and though often in the Burying-place for that end, I could ſee none, nor any other State about the Graves than Green Turf and Boughs. But this remark reſpects the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59218:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Barbary,</hi> whom I conceive to come far ſhort of thoſe of other Countries, in this ſort of Funeral Pomp. But we are told that they were not without Inſcriptions upon their Sepulchers, as <hi>Hic jacet N. Memoria ejus ſit in Benedictione.</hi> Though this I confeſs be now uſed, rather as an honourable Commemoration, when any Author of worth being dead, is ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Maſters, than as a common Epitaph. But when they uſe Sepulchral Inſcriptions, they are uſually a Prayer for the Dead, ſuch as, <hi>Let his Soul be received into the</hi> Garden of Eden. Or, <hi>Let his Soul be bound in the bundle of Life with the reſt of the Juſt.</hi>

As to the former, the <hi>Jews</hi> are Notorious therein above all other people; though the latter be a thing common to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> with other Nations. For not onely
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59218:122"/>
               <hi>Cotta</hi> in <hi>Cicero,</hi> but moſt men of any parts or Education, have thought themſelves under no ſmall obligation to keep cloſe to the Traditions of their Fathers; although no rational Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence could be produced for the matter of the Tradition. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num mihi ſatis eſt Majores no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtros ita Tradidiſſe</hi> (which was <hi>Cotta</hi>'s) is the ultimate Reſolution of the <hi>Jews</hi> Religion. And not to ſpeak of the obſtinacie of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this particular, we finde even the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Propagators of Chriſtianity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of a <hi>Prioribus Credere,</hi> as the moſt knotty and ſtubborn objection they met with. And when the <hi>Jews</hi> (ſuch I mean as are conſiderate and ingenious) do freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Religion of Chriſtians to be very conformable to the Law of Nature, which they account the Principal; yet leſt they ſhould ſeem to think themſelves Wiſer than their Anceſtors, and ſo incur the imputation of <hi>being Proud,</hi> or upon the change of their Faith to be branded for <hi>Inconſtancy</hi>; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely retain the Religion in which their Forefathers lived and died, and thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves happy and ſecure. And this is ſpoken not upon <hi>Truſt,</hi> but <hi>Experience</hi>: For upon a fair occaſion preſſing a <hi>Spaniſh Jew</hi> with the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent danger he was in, if after means of Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction he ſhould obſtinately die in his Judaiſm; he made no other Reply, but that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be in no better State, nor to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59218:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wiſer than the <hi>Sabies</hi> or <hi>Wiſe men</hi> of his Nation. And that if he was Damn'd, ſo would <hi>Rabbi Ben Maimon, Rabbi Salomon Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi> (and ſo run over a large Catalogue of their <hi>Rabbins</hi>) placing great conſolation to have ſuch good company in Perdition.</p>
            <p>But beſide all this, they eſteem it ſo ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous a thing for any man to forſake his Native Religion, that even thoſe who turn <hi>Jews</hi> are ſtill under a very jealous aſpect, according to their own old Proverb: <hi>Beware of Proſelytes to the tenth Generation.</hi> Which is alſo the Genius of the <hi>Moors:</hi> for albeit that with a ſeeming <hi>Triumph</hi> they receive a Renegado for a Muſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; yet they never repoſe in him any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Truſt, nor look upon him as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of any worth or Gallantry.</p>
            <p>As to the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which ſome reckon among the Internal Obſtacles of the <hi>Jews</hi> Converſion, if thereby be meant their ignorance, either in their own Rites, or in evading the Arguments brought againſt them; thoſe that ſhall practiſe them herein, will finde they have arrived to no contemptible knowledge in both; there being no Rite of their Religion whereof they have not been taught (according to their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) a probable Rationale; nor any objection brought by Chriſtians againſt the preſent Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm, for which they are not furniſhed with an Evaſion. For the Jewiſh Maſters take an eſpecial care, and uſe an utmoſt diligence, to
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59218:123"/>
ſee the <hi>Youth</hi> be ſo profoundly inſtructed in the Elements of their Religion, that it may be no eaſie task to efface the Characters of their firſt Catechiſm, or to pull down the Fortreſs of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation. And above all, it is in this point highly conſiderable, that the common ſort of <hi>Jews</hi> are bound to acquieſce in the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their <hi>Rabbins,</hi> to whom they make their laſt appeal, when preſſed with Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments too difficult for their own Solution. Of which I could produce a numerous Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but I ſhall content my ſelf with the ſingle inſtance of one <hi>Jacob Iſrael Belgara,</hi> who from <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.7. being clearly confuted that the time of <hi>Meſſias</hi>'s Advent was already paſt, eluded the whole Argument, by referring himſelf to the Sentiments of their Maſters.</p>
            <p>The next thing which may be reckon'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the grand impediments of the <hi>Jews</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, are the Chriſtians uncharitable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions and Diviſions, which they ſuppoſe proceedeth from a want of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of Truth in the Foundation: And which they can no way make agreeable to that mutual peace and affection foretold to flouriſh among the Profeſſors of the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and to be the ſignals of his Kingdom, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 11.6, 7, &amp;c. This I alwaies found a ſtring continually harp'd upon by the <hi>Jews</hi>; &amp; one ſcoffingly told me, that if he ſhould turn Chriſtian, he knew not what Sect to be of: reflecting upon the manifold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59218:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that are wofully hapned under the general denomination of Chriſtian. <hi>In the body, a wound is worſe than corruption; the former being a Solution of Continuity, the later but a diſorder of ſome Humour. In Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, evil manners are wholly contradictions of the Purity of their Religion, but Schiſm brings its Truth into queſtion; and is of that wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conſequence, that it keeps thoſe out that are without, and drives thoſe out that are within. For our ſpeaking with different tongues, will make the Atheiſt, as well as Infidel, ſay that we are mad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But were the ſcandal of our Diviſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, yet the Naughtineſs of our <hi>lives</hi> would become a new hinderance of the <hi>Jews</hi> conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; who are very greatly ſcandalized with the open, and even profeſſed, tranſgreſſion of the third Commandment, ſo apparent in thoſe Blaſphemies which helliſh mouthes dart up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and thoſe horrid Oaths which are become, with ſome, meer Interjections of Speech, and with others, Phraſes of Gallantry. And that thoſe ſins which the <hi>Jews</hi> ſeverely puniſh, ſhould become the Chriſtians Phyſick and Recreations: and that we ſhould live in ſo palpable a contradiction to our <hi>Vow</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> of a cleer contrary Carriage. And it was <hi>this Licentiouſneſs of Converſation</hi> that made a leud <hi>Jew</hi> (in <hi>Spain</hi> turn'd to Popery) magnifie the happineſs of his change, becauſe
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59218:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he had light on a Religion, wherein at once he could enjoy <hi>Both his Beads and his Whore.</hi> Reflecting upon that old Spaniſh Proverb, <hi>Las quentas en la Máno, y el Diáblo en el Capillo:</hi> Good words, and wicked works.</p>
            <p>And if this obſtacle were alſo taken away, and Chriſtians would take care to be as regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar as their Religion doth oblige them; yet there wants proper means for the <hi>Jews</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, as being vouchſafed neither compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent converſation, nor Books for that purpoſe. As to the firſt, none I think will deny it high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requiſite in this affair, unleſs ſuch as would make the Goſpel (like weapon-Salve) to work at a diſtance. Now we know that in our own Nation there is no ſuch competent familiarity or civil Society held with the <hi>Jews,</hi> as in any degree of probability may in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry courſe be ſufficient for their Converſion. For ſince their Expulſion out of <hi>England</hi> by King <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, about the year 1290, the greateſt converſation with them has been managed by Tradeſmen upon the account of Trafick, and ſecular purpoſes: as is evident at this day. And we have been ſo far from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring their converſion to Chriſtianity, that that which might greatly have encouraged it, is quite taken away. I mean, the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Converts</hi> erected by our <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, (which he piouſly indowed for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of poor <hi>Jews</hi> converted to Chriſtianity,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59218:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
where every one during their lives was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two pence a day) and appointed by <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Third for Records to be kept there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, now called the <hi>Rowles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor hath it fared any better with the <hi>Jews</hi> in other Nations than in our own: for ſince from <hi>France</hi> they were baniſhed by <hi>Philippus Pulcher, Anno</hi> 1307: From <hi>Spain</hi> by <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand, Anno</hi> 1492: From <hi>Portugal</hi> by <hi>Emanuel, Anno</hi> 1497: Out of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> by <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, <hi>Anno</hi> 1539. they have in theſe Kingdoms been ſo far from any enjoyment of that Society requiſite to make them converts, that they dare not ſet a foot within their Borders without running ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great adventures: as is known to all, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Regiment of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. 'Tis true, in the Juriſdiction of <hi>Avig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> (the Popes State) the <hi>Jews</hi> are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: And they are very numerous in <hi>Rome, Venice, Legorn,</hi> &amp;c. (not to ſpeak of their Toleration in <hi>Germany, Bohemia, Polonia, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuania, Ruſſia,</hi>) yet they are ſo little invited to Chriſtianity, that they meet with no ſmall motives to the contrary. For in the <hi>Papal</hi> Dominions no <hi>Jew</hi> can be admitted to Baptiſm till he has renounced the World; that is, till he confeſs all the Eſtate gotten in Judaiſm was ill gotten, and that he doth and ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it, and leave it to the Church. And it is but cold comfort to a <hi>Jew,</hi> ſo notoriouſly
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:59218:125"/>
devoted to the world, to take a final farewel of his beloved <hi>Mammon,</hi> and to deveſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and Family of all maintenance, at his <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> into Chriſtianity; without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient proviſion for his future ſubſiſtence, unleſs he will betake himſelf to a Cloyſter; a kinde of life very unpleaſing to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as contrary to the deſigne of Nature, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended man for Society, and each to be helpful to other in civil duties. Beſides that Monke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is a trade which they never finde commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or injoyn'd by God; never practiſed or counſelled by their renowned Anceſtors, who received continual inſtruction and inſpiration from above; which none of their <hi>Patriarchs</hi> or <hi>Prophets</hi> have given Example of; only in three or four thouſand years, <hi>Elias</hi> and ſome one or other have been found upon very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary cauſe to have taken alſo an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe of life, though of other nature, and to other purpoſe, then the <hi>Votaries</hi> of the Roman Church. 'Tis true, the <hi>Pope</hi> has power to diſpenſe in this particular, and to grant the <hi>Jew Baptiſm</hi> without confiſcation of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; yet this is ſo ſeldom and uncertain, that few <hi>Jews</hi> are found ſo hardy as to trie the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment.</p>
            <p>In the next place, as to Books tending to further the <hi>Jews</hi> converſion, it muſt be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that there is no ſmall impediment ariſing from this particular. For notwithſtanding
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59218:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that many learned Treatiſes have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled upon this Theme; yet they have either been pen'd in Languages unknown to moſt of this <hi>antient people,</hi> or in a Method exceeding the generality of their capacities, or, no means have been uſed to bring ſuch <hi>Books</hi> to their peruſal. And what is herein not the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, Tracts againſt Judaiſm, or rather for Chriſtianity, have been compoſed by Bookiſh and Retired perſons, who undertook the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of ſuch Jewiſh Tenets, as the courſe of their Studies beſt inabled them to encounter. And others have ſpent much oyl and time in demoliſhing a fortreſs which moſt of the Modern <hi>Jews</hi> never undertook to defend. An inſtance whereof, I found in a learned Diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> in which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor excellently confuting that Calumny of the <hi>Diſciples ſtealing away their Maſter while the Guard ſlept:</hi> The <hi>Jews,</hi> with whom I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed this Article, profeſſed a deep ſilence therein, and that they medled no further with our <hi>Meſſias,</hi> than to bring him to the Croſs; not being at all concern'd for what hapned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward. So that all the Arguments brought to vindicate Chriſts Reſurrection from the <hi>Jews</hi> belying the Diſciples in conveying away ſecretly the Body of their Bleſſed Maſter, was anſwered by denying the ſuppoſition.</p>
            <p>Several Volumes (as I have ſeen) are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten both in Spaniſh and Portuguez upon the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:59218:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſame ſubject; but ſo far from any likelihood to confute the obſtinacie of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that there is a greater probability they may add to its confirmation. For the Books (I ſpeak of) are ſtuffed with ſuch ridiculous and irrational Miracles, that in reading of them the <hi>Jews</hi> take no ſmall contentment, as being ſo ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to their purpoſes of ſpeaking evil of the Chriſtian Faith, which they hope cannot long ſtand, while they imagine it is ſupported by ſuch frail and chimerical buttreſſes. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, the <hi>Jews</hi> have ever been as dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to detect, as the Fryars to contrive their fictitious Miracles. And what is herein truely deplorable, Chriſtianity has the hard fate to be weighed in theſe Scales, and all its Sacred Truths to be rejected for a few Monkiſh trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries. For I have heard ſome maligning <hi>Jews</hi> urging the brainleſs conceits of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Fryars (who of all others ſeem herein the moſt Hypocondricaal) for the principles of Chriſtianity; which they are the more ready to believe, as finding it advantageous to their deſigne; and that the Books wherein they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur are of no ſurreptitious <hi>Edition,</hi> but <hi>Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu Superiorum,</hi> and allowed of by that Church, which calls her ſelf the <hi>Catholick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What I now ſpeak of, reſpects the Obſtacles of the converſion of thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> who converſe with the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and live even in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf: Where more <hi>Monks</hi> turn <hi>Jews,</hi> than <hi>Jews
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:59218:126"/>
Monks</hi>; as all Ages have obſerved. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, through all the Papal Countries there is but little probability to make the <hi>Jews</hi> have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>good will</hi> for Chriſtianity, if we conſider the manifold offences apparently ariſing from the whole Oeconomy of their Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Doctrine, of which I ſhall for brevity ſake give inſtances onely in the <hi>Vows</hi> and <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> made to Saints and Angels, which the <hi>Jews</hi> in all Ages have eſteem'd a duty peculiar unto God. And they obſerve too, that more De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions are made to the Virgin, whom all Chriſtians acknowledge to be but a Creature, than to Chriſt, who by all Orthodox Chriſtians is believed to be God. But that which of all other yields greateſt matter of Scandal to the <hi>Jews,</hi> is the worſhiping of Images, for which both the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Mahumedan</hi> lay Idolatrie to their charge; from which nought is left to defend, them but an unintelligible diſtinction of <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and of a final and Inſtrumental intention in Worſhip. At which the <hi>Jew</hi> has no ſmall occaſion to be Scandalized, when they conſider that yet the <hi>Sun</hi> never roſe upon a Nation that was ſo blockiſh, as to make a Stock or a Stone the <hi>Final Object</hi> of their <hi>Worſhip</hi>; but looked upon their <hi>Simulachra</hi> as the repreſentations of ſome abſent Divinity, or things wherein the Divine Power did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times inhabit, and by his vertue work Miracles, even as the Papiſts opine the B. Lady in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59218:127"/>
places of Chriſtendom, doth in her Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. And whatever apprehenſions and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions theſe venturous Votaries of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church may be furniſhed with, to ſave them from <hi>Idolatry,</hi> when they fall down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Images; yet ſeeing they uſe therein all the circumſtances appointed and fitting to wait upon the immediate Addreſſes which are made unto God, the <hi>Jews</hi> can perceive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing viſibly fit to vindicate the <hi>Service</hi> from being thought Idolatrous. For, as to the mental affection, ſo much ſpoken of, it lies altogether hid to the <hi>Beholder,</hi> and no leſs perhaps to the blunt and undiſtinguiſhing Wits of the Vulgar, who therein are concern'd. It would be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of no great difficulty to enlarge the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to many particulars of the <hi>Roman</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, whereat the <hi>Jews</hi> (in no mean degree) are daily Scandalized, as may be exemplified in their Tranſubſtantiation, where the <hi>Jews</hi> are told <hi>Meſſias</hi> to be comprehended under the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of a <hi>Wafer</hi>; which is a thing to them ſo egregiouſly offenſive, that they ſpit at its men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning. Thoſe that have met with the <hi>Roman</hi> Catechiſm, obſerve the ſecond Commandment to be wanting, and the tenth to be cloven into two, to keep up the Decalogue. Now all theſe things, and many more, are of ſo much the greater Scandal and indignity, as being believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Jews</hi> to be the Univerſal Tenets of Chriſtians; and that Chriſts (pretended)
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:59218:127" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Vicar doth herein follow the Footſteps of his <hi>Maſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Diſcourſing once with an <hi>Italian Jew</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Conditions of <hi>Rome,</hi> (where he had long dwelt) he began with great aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to tell me, That at <hi>Rome</hi> great wonders were to be ſeen, as, a <hi>Man</hi> that could make his God, make and unmake Sins at his pleaſure: and ſo run inveighing againſt the filthy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowed Converſations of the principal <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Clergy; cloſing up his Diſcourſe with a deep proteſtation, That if he were a Chriſtian, the vices and Doctrines of <hi>Italy</hi> would ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tempt him to diſown that Name.</p>
            <p>And what in the laſt place is not the leaſt conſiderable, even at thoſe Sermons in <hi>Italy,</hi> to which the <hi>Jews</hi> are bound to reſort, little or nothing is to be heard directly tending to the ſubverſion of thoſe points, wherein they place their ſtrongeſt Sanctuary: But <hi>obiter,</hi> and by the by, the Preacher Sallies out into a numerous invective againſt their obſtinate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, without laying down ſuch plain Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as may rationally move them to forſake it. And if herein there were no fault, yet as long as the <hi>Jews</hi> (coming to the Chriſtian Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons) ſhall ſee the Preacher begin his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with an <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> (which is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cuſtom with the Papiſts) and frequently to direct his Speech and Prayer to the B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and the little (Wooden) <hi>Crucifix</hi> which
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:59218:128"/>
ſtands on the Pulpit by him; to call that <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi> his Lord and Saviour, to Kneel down to it, to Embrace and Kiſs it, to Weep over it, and after all perhaps to caſt it to the Ground, (to let the people ſee they meant not there to terminate their Worſhip) the very ſight hereof doth as much induce the <hi>Jews</hi> to hate Chriſtianity, as any reaſon can be alledged to perſwade them to love and Embrace it.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Terms, in which the <hi>Jews</hi> (with whom I have converſed) do ſtand, who above all that has been ſaid, derive the greateſt obſtruction of their Converſion from their own obſtinacy; being not more ſcandalized, than ſtifneckt; nor leſs untractable within, than offended without: And as proud of their opinions, as they are deſpiſed for them. Glorying in their Anceſtors and Founders; in Gods Temple, and Oracles, peculiar promiſes, and Prerogatives, long continuance in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Proſperity; and indefatigable in their Expectation of being Triumphantly recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and Victoriouſly to Reign over the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> when the promiſe of their <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhall be perform'd, which has (as they ſay) ſo long beyond the appointed time been protra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, by reaſon of their own <hi>

            <p>And waving all <hi>Critical reſerches</hi> into the word <hi>Talmud</hi> (which makes ſo great a Noiſe in the World) it may ſuffice to obſerve, that by a ſort of Metonymy, it ſignifies the <hi>Book</hi> containing the main Doctrines of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which by way of <hi>Eminence</hi> is called the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud</hi> or <hi>Doctrinal.</hi> So that the word <hi>Talmud</hi> may as well be uſed for a Syſtem of Chriſtian, as Jewiſh Doctrines, for any thing therein to the contrary.</p>

For it is very obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the <hi>Talmud</hi> is oftener brought in Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of their Religion, than <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophets, and Holy Writings: Inſomuch that they make <hi>it,</hi> and not the <hi>Old Bible,</hi> the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of their Doctrine, and that into which they reſolve the Deciſion of all their <hi>Caſes.</hi> Nor are they herein greatly blameable, ſeeing they eſteem the <hi>Talmud</hi> of equal Authority with the Canonical Scriptures, and no more inferiour thereunto, than a Law given by word of mouth is to one in Writing. For the <hi>Jews</hi> hold there is a twofold Law, which they are bound to obſerve: the one written, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the five Books of <hi>Moſes</hi>; the other <hi>Oral,</hi> which they call the <hi>Miſna,</hi> or Traditional Law which God gave to <hi>Moſes</hi> at the ſame time he did the other; but did not commit it to Writing, but left it to be preſerved and propagated Orally.</p>
            <p>Some of the Maſters gifted with a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sagacity, with great aſſurance maintain
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59218:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that <hi>Moſes,</hi> during his abode in the <hi>Mount,</hi> could not diſcern the time of Night from the Day, but by the delivery of theſe two Laws: That when God gave the <hi>Written</hi> Law, he knew it was Day; and that it was Night when he gave the Oral. And <hi>R. Elieſar</hi> (as a late Author writes) affirms that <hi>Moſes</hi> read the Scripture by Day, and the <hi>Miſna</hi> by Night. But this will ſcarce ſound congruouſly, if it be conſidered that the <hi>Miſna</hi> was not written, and therefore could not be Read, till ſome thouſand years after <hi>Moſes</hi> received it in the Mount.</p>
            <p>And as to the reaſon why God would not ſuffer it to be written, it was the profound My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriouſneſs of its Nature (ſay the Maſters) which to have communicated by writing to the Vulgar <hi>People,</hi> would have been no better than to give <hi>Holy things unto Dogs, and to caſt Pearls before Swine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others are of opinion, that God foreſeeing how the Nations would Tranſcribe the Books of the Law, Prophets, and Holy Writings, and pervert them to Heretical and Impious Doctrines; leſt they ſhould to the like to the <hi>Miſna</hi> or the <hi>Second Law</hi> (for ſo <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifies) he would not ſuffer it to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Letters.</p>
            <p>And here it may be pardonable to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of two things; firſt, that by the <hi>Holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> call <hi>Cetaphim,</hi> they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:59218:130"/>
the Books of <hi>Daniel, Pſalms, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs, Job, Canticles, Ruth, Lamentations, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtes, Ezra, Nehemiah, Chronicles</hi>; and that they were Compiled or Collected by <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras,</hi> and the <hi>Seniors</hi> of the Synagogue, after the <hi>Jews</hi> returned from <hi>Babylon.</hi> Next, that the <hi>Jews</hi> were of old ſo cautious of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Law ſecret to themſelves, that they would not ſuffer it to be Tranſlated into any other Language out of their own. Inſomuch that in the daies of <hi>Ptolemy</hi> when the <hi>Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch</hi> was put in Greek by the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> they ſay that as if God had been there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with diſpleaſed, there happened three daies of darkneſs over the whole Earth. And to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie their own abhorrence of ſo execrable a fact, the <hi>Jews</hi> appointed a ſolemn Faſt to be kept upon the eighth of <hi>Tebeth,</hi> as the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>Joſeph Scaliger</hi> hath obſerved. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Mount did receive from God not onely the <hi>Written Law,</hi> but alſo a ſecret Explanation thereof, ſeems to have been the opinion of <hi>Origen</hi> (of the third) and <hi>Hillary</hi> (of the fourth Age.) And this <hi>Explanation</hi> is ſuppoſed to have been none other but the <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> or the Oral and Second Law we now ſpeak of, which was preſerved as the <hi>Cabala</hi> of the Creation, and of the things happening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Flood,</hi> by Tradition from minde to minde (to uſe <hi>Mirandula</hi>) without Letters,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59218:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by word of mouth. For <hi>Moſes</hi> thus delivered it to <hi>Aaron</hi>; and he to his Sons; they to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua; Joſhua</hi> to the <hi>Elders</hi>; the <hi>Elders</hi> to the <hi>Prophets</hi>; the <hi>Prophets</hi> to the <hi>Great Synagogue</hi>; and ſo it was drawn down by the <hi>Rabbins</hi> of ſucceſſive Ages, of whom the Famous <hi>Ramban</hi> has given an account.</p>
            <p>And in this ſtate the <hi>Miſna</hi> continued till many years after the Nativity of our Bleſſed Saviour; even till <hi>Rabbi Jehuda</hi> (who for his Piety was called <hi>the Saint,</hi> and for his ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar love to his Nation, and knowledge in their Law, <hi>the Prince)</hi> perceiving that this <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> grew difficult, and that thereby the <hi>Miſna</hi> was in no ſmall hazard to be utterly loſt or grievouſly corrupted, by reaſon of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme diſperſion of his Nation, collected all the Notes (taken by the <hi>Jews</hi> to aſſiſt their Memories) which contain'd any thing of the <hi>Miſna,</hi> and digeſted them into one Volume, which he called the <hi>Sepher Miſnaioth,</hi> or the Book of <hi>Traditions.</hi> And this was no ſooner compiled, than it gain'd ſuch credit with the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as to be publickly taught in their Colledges, and to be made the Catechiſm of their Youth; as in another Diſcourſe I have obſerved. The time when this <hi>Syntagm</hi> was finiſhed by <hi>Rabbi Jehuda</hi> is not certain; but moſt conjecture it was about an hundred and twenty years after the Deſtruction of the Temple, and near upon the 190th year of the <hi>Crucifixion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:59218:131"/>About an hundred and eighty years after that <hi>Rabbi Jehuda</hi> had thus compoſed the <hi>Miſna,</hi> one <hi>R. Jochanan</hi> (who for many years had been the Head of a Colledge in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine</hi>) added to the <hi>Miſna</hi> of <hi>Jehuda,</hi> his <hi>Gemara</hi>; which together with the <hi>Miſna</hi> made up the <hi>Hieruſalem-Talmud,</hi> or the <hi>Doctrinal</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> who dwelt in the <hi>Citie</hi> and <hi>Judea.</hi> But this was looked upon as not ſufficient for all the Conſtitutions and Deciſions of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> (in Captivity and Diſperſion) eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally after they were paſſed from under the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> to the <hi>Perſick</hi> Empire. And therefore one <hi>Rabbi Aſhi,</hi> or <hi>Aſe,</hi> compoſed a Second <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mara,</hi> about an hundred years after the Firſt; which being effected by him when he lived in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and for the uſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> there, it with the <hi>Miſna</hi> was called the <hi>Babylonian Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud.</hi> And notwithſtanding that the <hi>Talmud</hi> of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> is confeſſed by the <hi>Jews</hi> to have fewer Myſterious (that is <hi>Fabulous</hi>) Stories than the <hi>Talmud</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi>; yet this later hath obtain'd publick Honour and Belief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: and at this day is univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as the Authentick Body of their Law. In this Compilement the <hi>Miſna</hi> is as the <hi>Text,</hi> and the <hi>Gemara</hi> as the <hi>Comment</hi>; in which the different Opinions of the Ancient Maſters are reported and diſcuſs'd, and a final and abſolute Deciſion thereunto annexed.</p>
            <p>And thus we have ſeen (in brief) the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:59218:131"/>
of the <hi>Talmud,</hi> which by way of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence is often ſtiled <hi>the Law</hi>; and indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed for the <hi>Miſna</hi> or the <hi>Secundary Law,</hi> which contains the Traditions of <hi>Moſes</hi>; and the <hi>Gemara,</hi> containing the Diſputations and Deciſions that have been made upon thoſe Traditions; though properly ſpeaking, theſe two are conſtituent parts of the <hi>Talmud.</hi> In which many paſſages are inſerted, which if ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken literally, the <hi>Jews</hi> confeſs, would look like the moſt idle and Romantick Tales that ever fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Legend.</hi> And therefore they aſſigne them a ſecret and reſerved interpretation, which, ſay they, fall not under the comprehenſion of Vulgar and Ordinary Capacities.</p>
            <p>But after all this, it muſt be granted, that ſome Chriſtian Writers underſtand the <hi>Talmud</hi> to be nothing elſe but a Syſtem of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or Traditions of the Jewiſh Fathers; which if granted, can at moſt reſpect but one part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, namely the <hi>Miſna.</hi> It is true, that theſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> were highly valued by the <hi>Phariſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Jews,</hi> and as meanly looked upon by the <hi>Sadduces</hi>; who pleaded as eagerly for their Non-obſervance, as the other did to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. And the fierce and impetuous conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which hapned about theſe Traditions in the School of <hi>Antigonus Sochaeus,</hi> gave name and birth to the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces,</hi> the firſt factious Sectaries notorious among the <hi>Jews. Joſephus</hi> ſpeaks much of their Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:59218:132"/>
and Strife; and how the <hi>Sadduces</hi> were abetted by the <hi>Wealthy,</hi> and the <hi>Phariſees</hi> by the <hi>Multitude:</hi> And that in the end the later ſo prevailed with the <hi>Populacie</hi> as to have the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to be taught for Doctrine, and to be made an Authentick Inſtitution of their Schools. Of which numerous are ſaid to have been erected purpoſely to advance the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical</hi> Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>Yet it muſt here be remarked, that the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe Traditions did not totally exclude, though greatly diminiſh the inſtruction of the written Law. For in every Colledge of the Univerſity of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> there were two Schools, the one called the <hi>Bibliotheca,</hi> becauſe therein they uſed Books, and taught the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Law</hi>; the other was called the <hi>Miſna,</hi> or <hi>Beth Talmud,</hi> or <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> by reaſon of the Traditions that therein were inſtilled. Both theſe Schools flouriſhed till they were laid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate by <hi>Titus</hi>; whoſe deſolation occaſioned (in great part) the writing of the <hi>Sepher Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naioth</hi> by <hi>R. Juda,</hi> who is ſaid to have lived under the three <hi>Antonines; Pius, Marcus,</hi> and <hi>Commodus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what in this affair is not the leaſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, there is no expreſs notice taken of the <hi>Talmud,</hi> by thoſe Fathers who lived in the four firſt Ages of Chriſtianity; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ſpoke many things of the Jewiſh <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</hi> And <hi>Tertullian ex profeſſo</hi> writing
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:59218:132"/>
againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> though he ſpeaks diſtinctly of the Primordial Law given to <hi>Adam,</hi> and of the Law of the two Tables delivered to <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet he makes not the leaſt mention of the <hi>Miſna,</hi> or <hi>Oral Law.</hi> S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> (of the fifth Age) doth expreſly name this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Second Law,</hi> as containing certain Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which they wrote not, but got by heart, and transfuſed them from one to another by word of mouth. But the great darkneſs that befel the <hi>Jews</hi> Records at the beginning of Chriſtianity, might be one reaſon why the knowledge of the <hi>Talmud</hi> came ſo late to the Chriſtian world. And indeed, for almoſt two Ages after the <hi>Talmud</hi> was finiſhed, but little light or certainty is to be met with in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And as to our part of the world, it was not much acquainted with the Doctrines and Records of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> till they were expell'd <hi>Babylon.</hi> At which time a great part of them came into <hi>Europe,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſettled in <hi>Spain</hi>; where applying themſelves unto Studie, the <hi>Rabbins</hi> began to multiply, and grow <hi>Learned</hi>; and to illuſtrate the <hi>Talmud</hi> with Commentaries, Expoſitions, and Homilies: As is to be ſeen in the Writings of <hi>Zacuth, Abarbinel, Gautz, Ben Nachman,</hi> &amp;c. (all Spaniſh <hi>Jews</hi>) but eſpecially <hi>R. Moſes Ben Maimon</hi> (born at <hi>Corduba,</hi> and a Student in <hi>Egypt,</hi> whence he was called <hi>Moſes Egyptius</hi>) who in the 23d year of his Age began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59218:133"/>
upon the <hi>Miſnaioth,</hi> or the Text of the <hi>Talmud</hi>; which he finiſhed at thirty. He lived ſeventy years, and during his whole life was ſo ſtudious in writing upon, and inſtructing Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that to this day it is ſaid of him: <hi>From</hi> Moſes (the Prophet) <hi>to</hi> Moſes (the <hi>Egyptian) there was never ſuch another</hi> Moſes.</p>
            <p>The firſt among Chriſtians who took more ſolemn Cognizance of the <hi>Talmud,</hi> was <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> the Emperour, who about the 551 year of Chriſt gave Toleration to the <hi>Jews</hi> to read the Sacred Bible in their Synagogues in the Greek Tongue; but utterly prohibited them the Reading of the <hi>Miſna,</hi> as being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adjoyned <hi>to the Sacred Books, nor deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from above to the Prophets; but a meer invention of Earthly Men, who had nothing of Heaven in them.</hi> As is to be ſeen <hi>Novella</hi> 146. where the Notes upon that Conſtitution ſay, that the <hi>Miſna Torah</hi> was Compoſed out of the <hi>Caballiſticks</hi> and <hi>Anagogicks</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or ſome allegorical interpretations, pretended to be derived from <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſetled in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> began to take ſevere cognizance of the <hi>Talmud.</hi> For Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> IV. commanded all the Copies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that could be found in <hi>France</hi> to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, becauſe it contained <hi>manifeſt Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies againſt God, Chriſt,</hi> and the Virgin <hi>Mary, inextricable abuſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> erronious</hi> and <hi>unheard-of
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:59218:133"/>
Fooleries.</hi> And in <hi>Italy</hi> the <hi>Talmud</hi> fell under the ſame Condemnation: for Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the third by ſolemn Bull ſentenc'd it to the Flames, as containing many things offending the <hi>Divine Law,</hi> and the <hi>Orthodox Faith.</hi> Upon which the Inquiſition ſeiſed upon all the <hi>Gemara's</hi> that could be met with in the Regions of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi> and made them an <hi>Holocauſt</hi> to the <hi>Holy Chair,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
