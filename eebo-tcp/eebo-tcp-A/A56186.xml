            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Part of the Famous Speech OF WILLIAM PRYNN <abbr>Esq</abbr> 
               <hi>Decemb.</hi> 48. Touching K. <hi>Charles</hi> I.</head>
            <p>THe next thing proposed by them for a speedy Peace and Settlement, is the bringing of the King to speedy Justice for all his Treasons and Blood-shed in the late Wars, and to Depose and Execute him as the greatest capital Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor in the Kingdom:</p>
            <p>This certainly is a very dangerous and unlikely way to Peace and Settlement. First of all, <hi>The smiting of the Shepherd, is the way to scatter, not unite the Sheep.</hi> The slaying of the King or General in the Field, <hi>Scatters and Dissolves the Army, not secures them:</hi> To cut off a King'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, is the next way to destroy, not cure a diseas'd Body: Such kind of State Policy may destroy, or disturb, but never Settle us in perfect Peace: The Prince his next Heir, the Queen, the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> all his Children, and Allies both at Home and Abroad, will certainly meditate Revenge, and all Kings in Christendom will assist them, even for their own Interest and Safety, least it should become a President for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And will this then secure, or be a likely way to Peace or Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The greatest part of the Members in both Houses, the Lords, Gentlemen, and all sorts of People throughout the Kingdom, the whole Kingdoms of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> (who have as great an Interest in the Kings Person, being their Lawful King, as we have, and are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by Allegiance and Covenant to protect his Person and Crown from violence) will unanimously, as one man oppose and protest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, and by force of Arms, endeavour to bring those to Execution who shall presume to advise, or attempt to depose or destroy the King in any kind, contrary to their Allegiance and solemn Covenant: Yea, all Protestant Realms, Churches, States in Foreign parts, will abhor both the fact, and adjudge it contrary to their Principles and Religion, and that which may irritate Popish Kings, and Princes to take up Arms
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64998:2"/>
to ruine them, lest they should fall into the like practises. And can this then be a safe or speedy way to Peace and Settlement, especially when we know not what Government shall succeed upon it, and can expect nothing but bloody consequences from such a bloody advice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> I never read of any Peace or Settlement in any Kingdom, where <hi>King-killing</hi> was practised or approved. When the <hi>Roman Armies</hi> began once to Kill their Emperors, and cut off their Heads, <hi>They were scarce ever free from Civil-wars. One Army set up one Emperor, another Army another, the Senate a third, who always</hi> Warred <hi>till they had cut off one anothers Heads. Most of those Emperors had very short reigns, few of them above a year or two, and some of them scarce two Months, but most of them untimely Deaths.</hi> In <hi>Sclavonia</hi> and <hi>Norway</hi> where they had a Law, <hi>that he that slew a Tyrant King, should succeed him in the Throne:</hi> They had almost every <hi>year a new King, perpetual wars and discords, and not one of all their Kings for above one hundred years together, ever came to a natural Death,</hi> but was murthered as a Tyrant, and succeeded by a worse and greater Tyrant, as <hi>Saxogramaticus and Nubrigensis</hi> testify.</p>
            <p>And in the sacred Story it self, it is very observable, <hi>That after ten Tribes revolted from</hi> Rehoboam, <hi>though by Gods Justice and approbation for</hi> Solomons <hi>sins; they had never any Peace or Settlement, but perpetual Wars with one Kingdom or another, or between themselves: Their Kings, or most of them were all Tyrants and Idolators, and by the just Hand of God, for the most part tumultuously slain and murthered one of and by another, who succeeded them: He that murthered his Predecessor, being usually slain by his Successor, or his Predecessors Sons, Servants, or by the People of the Land, in a tumultuous way:</hi> In the 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 15. We <hi>read in that one Chapter, of no less then four of those Kings slain, one by another:</hi> and as for the <hi>People under these Kings, they had never any rest, peace, settlement, or freedom, but lived under the greatest misery and oppression that ever any</hi> Subjects un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven did, as the sacred History records. This King-killing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly can be then no probable way at all to Peace, Safety, Settlement, or Freedom, but the Policy to deprive us eternally of all these, and of God, and Religion to boot; as it did the ten <hi>Tribes</hi> heretofore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> This way to Peace and Settlement, is directly contrary to all the former Ingagements, Oathes, and several Petitions, Declarations, Remonstrances, Protestations, and Professions of both Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: To the King, kingdom, People, wherein we have alwayes protested and held forth unto them both before and since the Wars. <hi>That we will preserve and protect the Kings Person from danger, support his royal Estate with Honour and Plenty at Home, with Power and reputation Abroad, and by our Loyal Affections, Actions and Advice, lay a sure and lasting foundation of the Greatness and Prosperity of his Majesty, and his royal Posterity in future times. That we are still resolved to keep our selves
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64998:2"/>
within the bounds of Faithfulness and Allegiance to his sacred Person and Crown. That we will with our Lives, Fortunes, Estates, and with the last drop of our Blood endeavour to support His Majesty, and his just Soveraignty and Power over Us; and to prevent all dangers to his Majesties Person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That we took up Arms as well for a Defence of His Majesty to Protect his Person, as the Kingdom and Parliament; without any intent to hurt or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure His Majesties Person or Power: Professing in the presence of Almighty God, That we would receive him with all Honour, yeild Him all due Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Subjection, and Faithfully endeavour to secure His Person and Estate from all danger, and to the uttermost of our Power to procure and establish to Him and His People, all the Blessings of a Glorious and Happy raign;</hi> which both Houses several times profest and remonstrated to the World. TO MURDER and DEPOSE THE KING, was <hi>such a scandal, as any that profess'd the name of a Christian, could not have so little Charity as to raise it; especially when they must needs know, the Protestation taken by every Member of both Houses, whereby they Promise in the presence of Almighty God, to defend His Majesties Person; and all their Addresses and Petitions to Him expressing the contrary: That they never suffered it to enter into their Thoughts to Depose the</hi> King, <hi>abhorring the very Thought of it, much more the Intent.</hi> That they never suffered the word DEPOSING the King, <hi>To go out of their Mouthes, nor the thing to enter into their Thoughts. That they rest assured, both God and Man will abominate that Monstrous and most Injurious Charge laid upon the Representative Body of this whole Kingdom by the Malignant Party, against the</hi> King, as Designing <hi>not only the ruine of his Majesties Person, but of Monarchy it self: The Authors of which malicious horrid scandal, they profess to make the Instances of their exemplary Justi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, so soon as they shall be discovered.</hi> Now for Us after all these multiplyed reiterated Protestations, Promises, Engagements, Declarations, Remonstran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to all the World, from the beginning of the Differences and Wars till now, to think or talk of Deposing and Destroying the King, and altering the Government, as the only safe and speedy way to Peace and Settlement, as the <hi>Army-Remonstrants</hi> prescribe; would be such a most detestable breach of publick Faith; such a most Perfidious, Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, Unrighteous wicked Act, as not only Gods, Angels, and good Men; but the very worst of Turks and Devils would abhor: And therefore its a Miracle to me, that these <hi>precions SAINTS</hi> should thus impudently, before all the World propose to the House, and force you to pursue it, to stain your Reputation, and make you execrable to God and Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thly.</hi> The very Oath of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> which every one of us hath taken, upon our first admission to be Members, engageth us in posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive terms, <hi>Not to offer any hurt or violence to His Majesties Royal Person,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64998:3"/>
State or Government; to bear Faith and true Allegiance to His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors; and Him and Them to defend to the uttermost of Our power, against all Conspiracies and Attempts whatsoever, which shall be made against His or Their Persons, Crown, or Dignity: And from our hearts to abhor, detest, and abjure as Impious and Heretical,</hi> this Heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish and Turkish Doctrine: <hi>That Princes Excommunicated, or deprived by the People,</hi> (as it seems <hi>the King is now</hi> for extirpating Episcopacy, Popery, Mass, and Prelacy out of his Dominions by his present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions, without any possibility or hopes of replanting) may <hi>be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed or Murthered by their Subjects, or any other whatsoever.</hi> Which Hellish contrivance and practice, as our whole <hi>State and Parliament,</hi> in the State of 3 <hi>Jac. cap.</hi> 1, 4, 5. 35 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. and other Acts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve, is the only way to unsettle, ruine and subvert, not to settle and establish the Peace and Government of our Realm. And both Houses since this Parliament, have by a <hi>solemn Protestation,</hi> first, and by a <hi>solemn League and Covenant</hi> since, with <hi>Hands lifted up to the most high God,</hi> engaged both themselves and the three Kingdoms of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> by a most sacred and serious Vow and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation (purposely made and prescribed by them, <hi>For the Honour and Happiness of the King and His Posterity, and the true publick Liberty, Safety and Peace of the three Kingdoms,</hi> as the Title and Preface declare) <hi>Sincerely, Really, and Constantly to endeavour with their Estates and Lives,</hi> TO PRESERVE AND DEFEND THE KINGS MAJESTIES PERSON AND AUTHORITY, <hi>in the preservation and defence of the true Religion and Liberties of the Kingdom,</hi> (which he hath now fully and actually performed by his Concessions in this Treaty) <hi>That the World may bear witness with our Consciences</hi> OF OUR LOYALTY; and that WE HAVE NO THOUGHTS OR INTENTIONS TO DIMINISH HIS MAJESTIES JUST POWER AND GREAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS. <hi>And shall also with all Faithfulness endeavour the discovery of all such as shall be Incendiaries, or evil Instruments, by</hi> DIVIDING THE KING FROM HIS PEOPLE; That <hi>they may be brought to speedy Tryal, and receive condign Punishment. And shall not suffer themselves directly, or indirectly, by whatsoever combination or terror, to be withdrawn or make defection from this Covenant; but shall all the days of their Lives really and constantly continue therein against all Opposition, and promote the same against all lets impediments whatsoever. And</hi> this Covenant <hi>we all made in the presence of Almighty God, the searcher of all Hearts;</hi> WITH A REAL INTENTION TO PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORM THE SAME, <hi>as we shall answer at that great day, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:64998:3"/>
Now how we who are <hi>Members of this House,</hi> or any who are Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of our Three Kingdoms, or Officers and Souldiers in the Army, who have taken this <hi>Oath of Allegiance, Protestation, League or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> or any of them, (as some of them have done, all or two of them at least, sundry times over) can, without the highest Perjury to God, Treachery to the King, Perfidiousness to the Kingdom, Infamy to the World, Scandal to the Protestant Religion, and Eternal dishonour to the Parliament and Themselves, Athiestically break through or elude all those most <hi>Sacred aod Religious tyes upon our Souls, by a speedy publick Dethroning and Decolling of the King, and Dis-inheriting His Posterity;</hi> (as the Army Remonstants advise) and that in the open view of the World, and that <hi>All-seeing God</hi> to whom we have thus Appealed and Sworn, by any <hi>Equivocations</hi> or <hi>Distinctions,</hi> (of which the <hi>Armies Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance</hi> is full) or Professions of our damnable Hypocrisie in the breaking of them, transcends my understanding. And for those who Style themselves SAINTS, and charge this as one of the <hi>Highest Crimes against the King,</hi> His <hi>frequent breach of Oaths and Promises,</hi> to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend him and <hi>Traytors</hi> in this very sin, is such a Monster of Impiety, as I concelve could never have entred into the hearts of <hi>Infidels,</hi> or the worst of Men or Devils. And to act this under a pretext to Preserve and Settle the Peace of the Kingdom, is such a Solecism, as militates point-blank against the very words and scope both of this Oath, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, League, and Covenant, <hi>which crosseth not the Oaths of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy and Allegiance, but more strongly engageth Men to preserve and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Kings Person and Autohority, in the Preservation and Defence of the true Religion and Liberties of the Kingdom;</hi> as the <hi>Assembly</hi> of Divines, and both Houses affirm in their <hi>Exbortation to take the Covenant,</hi> which prescribes this as the only means of securing and preserving Peace in all the Three Kingdoms; to preserve the <hi>Person and Honour of the King,</hi> His Crown and Dignity, from any such Violence and Invasion as is now suggested by the Army, which all three of them ingage us, and all Three Kingdoms, with our Lives and Fortunes really and constantly to oppose, against all Lets and Impediments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to bring those to condign punishment as Incendiaries and evil Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments who suggest it. So as if the Army will proceed in this Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal destructive way, of Treason and Ruine, We, and all Three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms are solemnly engaged with our Estates and Lives unanimously to oppose and bring them to Justice. And is this then the way to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Peace and Settlement, to raise another new War to murder one another in this new Quarrel, wherein the Army and their adherents, must be the sole Malignants and Enemies we must Fight with, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> No verily, but the high-way to the Kingdoms and Armies ruine, whose Commissions we are obliged to revoke; whose Contributions we must
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64998:4"/>
in Conscience withdraw; and whose Power we must with our own lives resist, unless we will be Perjured, and guilty of breach of <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> in the highest degree, if they persist in these <hi>Anti-Covenant</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The King having granting us whatever we have, or can demand for the safety and preservation of our Religion, Laws and Liberties; and both Houses engaged themselves by Vote in answer to the Kings Propositions, <hi>to restore him to a condition of Freedom, Honour, and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, according to the Laws of the Realm,</hi> (which was the Armies own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals in his behalf in <hi>August</hi> 1647.) We can neither in Honesty, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Justice nor Conscience (were He ten thousand times worse than the Army would render Him) Depose and bring Him to Execution. It being against all the rules of Justice, and Honour between two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Enemies, who had no relations one to another; much more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween King and Subjects in a Civil War, a thing without President in any Ages. To this the <hi>Army Remonstrance</hi> answers, That <hi>this would be thought an unreasonable and unbeseeming demand in a Personal Treaty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Persons standing both free, and in equal ballance of Power; but not when one Party is wholly subdued, captivated, imprisoned, and in the others Power.</hi> But this certainly is a difference spun with an <hi>Athiestical</hi> thred; For to Treat with any King in our Power, or out of it, on Articles of Peace, upon these terms; That if He consent to them, We will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store Him to the Throne with Honour, Freedom, Safety; and when He hath yielded us our Demands, then to Depose and cut of His Head; is the highest breach of Faith, Truth, Honour, and Justice, that can be imagined: and those who dare justifie such Perfidious and Unchristian dealing, deserve rather the Style of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Athiests,</hi> than <hi>Pious Saints.</hi>

            <p n="8">8. There is no president in Scripture, that the General Assembly, or Sanhedrin of the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Israelites,</hi> did ever Judically Imprison, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, or Execute any one of the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> or <hi>Israel,</hi> tho' many of them were the grossest Idolaters, and wickedst Princes under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; who shed much innocent blood, and oppressed the People sundry ways. We know that <hi>David</hi> himself committed <hi>Adultery</hi> with <hi>Uriah</hi> his Wife, a faithful Servant and Souldier, while he was with his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Joab</hi> in the Field: And then afterwards caused him to be Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously slain. Yet neither the Assembly the Elders, nor <hi>Joab</hi> and the <hi>Army</hi> under him, did impeach or crave Justice against him for these sins, tho' he lived impenitently in them. And when he numbered the People afterwards, for which sin seventy thousand of his Subjects lost their lives; yet was he not <hi>Arraigned</hi> nor <hi>Deposed</hi> for it: and God who is Sovereignly just, tho' <hi>David</hi> was the principal Malefactor in this case, if not the sole; and thereupon, <hi>when he saw the Angel that

smote the People,</hi> cried out, <hi>Lo, I have sinned and done wickedly; but these Sheep, what have they done? Let thy hand be against me and my Fathers House:</hi> Yet God spared him and his Houshold, tho' the Principals, and punished the People only with death, for this sin of his. After him <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> his Son, a Man Eminent for Wisdom and Piety at first, <hi>Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd</hi> to most gross <hi>Idolatry</hi> of all sorts, to please his <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Wives, and became a great oppressor of his People, making their burdens very heavy, yet the Subjects or Souldiers did neither Impeach nor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him for it: and tho' he were the principal Offendor, yet God spared him for <hi>Davids</hi> sake, in not taking the ten Tribes from him for these sins, during his life; though he rent them from his Son <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> who was at most but accessary, for his Fathers sins, not his. True it is, some of the <hi>Idolatrous Kings</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> by the just avenging Hand of God, were slain by private Conspiracies, and popular Tumults, in an Illegal way: but not Deposed nor Arraigned by their Sanhedrins, or General Congregations; and those who slew them, <hi>were sometimes</hi> slain by others <hi>who aspired to the Crown, or by the People of the Land, or by their Children who Succeded them;</hi> and came to untimely Tragical ends.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Tho there be some presidents of <hi>Popisb</hi> States and Parliaments Deposing their Popish Kings and Emperours at home, and in Foreign parts, in an extraordinary way, by power of an armed Party: Yet there is no president of any one <hi>Protestant</hi> Kingdom or State, that did ever yet Judically Depose or bring to Execution, any of their Kings and Princes, though never so bad, whether <hi>Protestants</hi> or <hi>Papists;</hi> and the <hi>Protestants</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> though some of their Kings, when they had invested them in their Thrones, became <hi>Apostates</hi> to <hi>Popery,</hi> and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors of Their People; albeit they resisted them by force of arms in the Field to preserve their lives; did never once attempt to pull Them from Their Thrones, or bring Their Persons unto Justice: And I hope our <hi>Protestant Parliament</hi> will never make the first president in this kind, nor stain Their Honour or Religion with the blood of a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> King, against so many <hi>Oaths, Protestations, Covenants, Declarations,</hi> and <hi>Remonstrances</hi> made and published by Them to the contrary.</p>
            <p n="10">10. For the presidents of <hi>Eeward</hi> II. and <hi>Richard</hi> II. in times of <hi>Popery,</hi> they were rather forcible resignations by Power of an <hi>Army,</hi> then judical deprivations, neither of them being ever legally arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and brought to Tryal in <hi>Parliament.</hi> And <hi>Mortimer</hi> who had the chief hand in Deposing King <hi>Edward</hi> II. in the <hi>Parliament</hi> of 1 <hi>E.</hi> 3. was in the <hi>Parliament</hi> of 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3. Impeached, Condemned, and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a <hi>Traytor,</hi> and guilty of <hi>High Treason,</hi> for Murdering <hi>Edw.</hi> II. after he was Deposed, at <hi>Berkley-Castle,</hi> and Sir <hi>Simon Bereford,</hi> (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Thomas Gurney</hi> and <hi>Will.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64998:5"/>
to the apprehenders of the other two. And as for <hi>Richard</hi> II. though he was Deposed after <hi>Henry</hi> IV. was Crowned by pretence in <hi>Parliament:</hi> yet this Deposition was after his resignation only, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it: and without any Formal <hi>tryal</hi> or <hi>arraignment,</hi> or any Capital <hi>Judgment</hi> of Death against him; for which I find no president in any <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England, Scotland, France,</hi> nor yet in <hi>Denmark</hi> it self, though an Elective Kingdom; who, though They justly Deposed <hi>Christiern</hi> II. for his most abominable <hi>Tyranies</hi> and <hi>Cruelties;</hi> yet they never adjudged or put him to Death, but only restrained him as a Prisoner. I shall only add this, That though the Elective Kindoms of <hi>Hungary, Bohemia, Poland, Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> have in their <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi> and <hi>Diets</hi> Deposed sundry of their Kings for their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses and Tyrany; yet they never judically <hi>condemned any one of them to death,</hi> though <hi>Papists.</hi> And for a <hi>Protestant Parliament</hi> (to please an army only, acted by <hi>Traytors</hi> in this particular; to render both <hi>Parliament, army,</hi> and our Religion too, for ever execrable throughout the World, and set all Mens Pens and Hands against them to their ruine, to begin such a bloody president as this, upon a most false pretext, of settling Peace; contrary to the express Command of God himself, who Commands Christians, <hi>To Pray for Kings, and all in authority, that they may live a quiet and peaceable life under them in all God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness and Honesty,</hi> (not to Depose or cut off their Heads) as the only way to Peace and Settlement; will not only be Scandalous but Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous.</p>
