            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

there were many, who thought it worth their labour to describe them.

               <hi>That the Graecians admired things of strangers more then of their owne, seeing that some Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians of note had most accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately described the Pyramids of Aegypt, whereas the Treasurie of Minyas, and walls of Tiryns</hi> (places in Boeotia) <hi>no lesse to be admired then these, had been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by them.

a large catalogue of Authors, that had purposely treated of this Argument: <note n="i" place="margin">Qui de iis scripserint, sunt Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Euheme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Duris Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius, Arista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras, Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, Artemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Polyhistor, Butorides, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisthenes, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteles, Apion Plin. nat. hist. l. 36. c. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Those which have writ of them, are, Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Euhemerus, Duris Samius, Aristagoras, Dionysius, Artemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus, Alexander Polyhistor, Butorides, Antisthenes, Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius, Demoteles, Apion.</hi> Where we are beholding to him for preserving the names of so many Writers, though their workes (unlesse those of <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi>) by the injury, and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of times, have long since perished.

contrary. For there they live under a heavy sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and persecution, whereas here they are the persecutors, and afflictors: there they groane under their taskemasters the Aegyptians, here they make all Aegypt to groane under them: lastly wheras there they are imployed in the lowest of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, <note n="g" place="margin">Exod. 1.14.</note> 
               <hi>in Morter, and in Brick, and in all manner of service in the field:</hi> here, after the destruction of many Citties, and men, and infinite outrages committed upon the Aegyptians, they make one of themselves a King, and for six descents keepe themselves in possession of the royall Throne, of which after a long, and bloody war they are depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Their building likewise of a Cittie in <hi>Iudaea</hi> and naming it <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> according to <hi>Manethos,</hi> is a strong argument against <hi>Iosephus,</hi> that these Sheepheards could not have beene the Israelites. For before the entrance of the Israelites into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> we finde that <hi>Ierusalem was a fort of the Iebusites upon mount Sion,</hi> unconquered by <hi>Ioshu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a.</hi>

               <hi>As for the Iebusites the inhabitants of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, the children of Israel could not drive them out.</hi> But they were long after subdued by David. <hi>And</hi>

Besides all this, the History, and Chronology of those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times, if we compare Sacred, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Authors, will in no sort admit that these Sheepheards must have beene the Israelites.

               <hi>Herodotus, next to</hi> Psammitichus <hi>his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father was the most fortunate of all the former Kings, for twenty five yeares of his reigne,</hi> Which might occasion <hi>Zedekiah</hi> to fly to him for suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour: But the Aegyptians rebelling against him, he was overthrowne in battaile, taken priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and afterward strangled by his owne ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Amasis,</hi> whom they had made their King.

               <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus,</hi> neither did divine vengeance long for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to pursue the traitour.

               </gap> of <hi>Africanus, Amenophis</hi> is the last of the XVIII dynasty, and <hi>Apries</hi> or <hi>Vaphres,</hi> the VIII of the XXVI dynasty, we must necessarily place them in one of the intermediate dynasties. But seeing all the intermediate dynasties have their peculiar Kings, unlesse it be the XX, we have no reason to exclude them, and to bring these in their places as usurpers: But rather, with great probability (for I must say here with <note n="r" place="margin">Liv. lib. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Livy, Quis rem tam veterem pro certo affirmet?</hi>) we may assigne to them the XX dynasty. In which we finde not the name of any one King, but yet the space left vacant of CLXXVIII yeares, according to <hi>Eusebius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here therefore we shall place.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Cheops,</hi> or <hi>Chemmis,</hi> the Founder of the first <hi>Pyramid,</hi> who began his reigne in the MMM CCCC XLVIII yeare of the Julian Period, that is CCCCLXXXX years before the first Olympiad, and DCLXXVIII before the first destruction of the Temple, and MCCLXVI<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before the beginning of the yeares of our Lord. He reigned L yeares, saith <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and built this <hi>Pyramid,</hi> as <hi>Diodorus</hi> observes, a thousand yeares before his time, or the CLXXX Olympiad, whereas he might have said a thousand two hundred and ten.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Cephren</hi> or <hi>Chabryis</hi> the builder of the second, who reigned fifty <note n="s" place="margin">Herod. lib. 2. Diodor. lib. 1.</note> six yeares.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Mycerinus</hi> the erector of the third, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven yeares.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:55075:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>Fourthly, <hi>Asychis</hi> the Author of the fourth.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, <hi>Anysis</hi> the blind.</p>
            <p>How long these two reigned is no where expressed.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, <hi>Sabachus</hi> the Aethiopian. He conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and reigned <note n="t" place="margin">He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The summe is CLXIII years, this being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted out of CLXXVIII yeares (the whole time allowed by <hi>Eusebius</hi> to this dynasty) the remainder is XV yeares; which space we may without any inconvenience divide between <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sychis,</hi> and <hi>Anysis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any shall question why the names of these Kings are omitted by <hi>Manethos,</hi> an <hi>Aegyptian Priest,</hi> in the XX dynasty, I can give no other reason, then what we read in <hi>Herodotus.</hi>

               <hi>These Kings</hi> (speaking of <hi>Cheops</hi> and <hi>Cephren) the Aegyptians out of hatred will not so much as name, but they call them the</hi> Pyramids <hi>of</hi> Philition <hi>a Sheepheard, who in those times, at that place, fed his cattell.</hi> The which hatred, occasioned by their oppressions, as <note n="b" place="margin">Diodor lib. 1.</note>

                  </gap>hus,</hi> an Aethiopian, and an Usurper.</p>
            <p>Following this computation of <hi>Eusebius</hi> of CLXXVIII yeares for the XX dynasty, and not that of <hi>Africanus,</hi> who assignes onely an CXXV of whom <note n="c" place="margin">Scalig in Euseb. Chron.</note> 
               <hi>Ioseph Scaliger</hi> hath this censure, <hi>in istis dynastiis, aliquid turbasse videtur Africanus, ut consuleret rationibus suis</hi>; it will follow by way of consequence, as the <hi>most Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend, and learned Primate of Ireland</hi> in his <hi>Chronologiâ Sacrâ</hi> hath singularly well observed.</p>
            <p>First, that the XVIII dynasty ends with the migration of the Israelites out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55075:28"/>
with the death of <hi>Amenophis:</hi> which is cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly signified by <hi>Manethos,</hi> and the times of <hi>Belus,</hi> and <hi>Danaus</hi> noted by the Greek Chronographers do evidently confirme it. I mean the Aegyptian <hi>Belus,</hi> or <hi>Amenophis,</hi> the Father of <hi>Aegyptus,</hi> or <hi>Sethosis</hi> and <hi>Danaus,</hi> not the <hi>Babylonian Belus</hi> the father of <hi>Ninus,</hi> whom <hi>Mythologists</hi> confound with this; feigning him to have transported co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies out of Aegypt to Babylon. The time allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <note n="d" place="margin">Thallus apud Euseb.</note> 
               <hi>Thallus,</hi> an ancient Chronographer, to <hi>Belus</hi> of CCCXX yeares, before the Trojan war, doth exactly agree with this Aegyptian <hi>Belus,</hi> or <hi>Amenophis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that the XX dynasty will receive those six Kings, which out of <hi>Herodotus</hi> we have placed there: the number of whose years exceed the time limited by <hi>Africanus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, that the XXII dynasty will fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the latter time of King <hi>Solomon,</hi> whereby <hi>Sesonchis</hi> the first King of it, may be the same with <hi>Sesac,</hi> or <hi>Shishac,</hi> who in the <note n="e" place="margin">1 King. 14.25, 26.</note> fifth yeare of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Solomon,</hi> invaded <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea</hi> Which was the onely reason that moved <note n="f" place="margin">Scalig in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seb. Chron.</note> 
               <hi>Scaliger</hi> to suspect, that something had beene altered by <hi>Africanus</hi> in these dynasties.</p>
            <p>By the same series, and deduction of times, we may conclude, that the <hi>Labyrinth</hi> adjoyning to the <hi>Pyramid</hi> of <hi>Osymanduas</hi> raised by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon expense of the XII Kings, who <note n="g" place="margin">Herodot. lib. 2.</note> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Sethon</hi> to have beene MMCCC XXIV yeares since, or DCLXXX before Christ. For <hi>Sethon</hi> living in the time of <hi>Senna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charib,</hi> and these immediately following <hi>Sethon</hi> in the government of the Kingdome, they must
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55075:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have reigned, either in the same age the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture assignes to <hi>Sennacharib,</hi> or not long after.</p>
            <p>Those other <hi>Pyramids,</hi> the one of <hi>Osymanduas</hi> in <note n="h" place="margin">Diodor. lib. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Diodorus,</hi> or <hi>Ismandes,</hi> in <note n="i" place="margin">Strabo lib. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Strabo</hi>; and those two of <hi>Moeris,</hi> or <hi>Myris,</hi> in <note n="k" place="margin">Herodot. lib. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and <note n="l" place="margin">Diodor. lib. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Diodorus,</hi> it is evident they preceded <hi>Sesostris</hi> the great, and must therefore have been above three thousand yeares since, but by how many Kings, or how many ages, is hard to be defined.</p>

Upon this advantageous rise, and upon this solid foundation the <hi>Pyramid</hi> is erected: the heigth of the situation adding to the beauty of the work, and the solidity of the rocke giving the superstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture a permament, and stable support.

That of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Siculus</hi> in my judgement comes neerest to the truth, and may serve in some kinde to confirm those proportions, which in another discourse I have assigned to the Graecian measures. For measuring the North side of it, near the <hi>basis,</hi> by an exquisite <hi>radius</hi> of ten feet in length, taking two severall stations, as Mathematicians use to doe, when any obstacle hinders their approach, I found it to be six hundred ninety three feet, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the English Standard: which quantity is somewhat lesse then that of <hi>Diodorus.</hi> The rest of the sides were examined by a line, for want of an even level, and a convenient distance to place my instruments, both which the <hi>area</hi> on the former side afforded.</p>

The length of this obscure, and broken space, conteineth eighty nine feet, the breadth and height is various, and not worth considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

The pavement of this rises with a gentle acclivity, consisting of smooth, and polished marble, and where not smeared with dust, and filth, appearing of a white, and alabaster colour: the sides, and roofe, as Titus Livius Burretinus, a Venetian, an ingenious young man, who accompanied me thither, obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, was of impolished stone, not so hard, and compact as that on the pavement, but more soft, and tender: the breadth almost five feet, and about the same quantity the height, if he have not mistaken. He likewise discovered some irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the breadth, it opening a little wider in some places, then in others; but this inequality could not be discerned by the eye, but only by measuring it with a carefull hand. By my obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with a line, this Gallery conteined in length an hundred and ten feet. At the end of this begins the second Gallery, a very stately peece of work, and not inferiour, either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the curiosity of Art, or richnesse of mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, to the most sumptuous, and magnificent buildings. It is divided from the former by a wall, through which stooping, we passed in a square hole, much about the same bignesse, as that by

This nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row passage lieth levell, not rising with an acclivity as doth the pavement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, &amp; roof above, of both these Galleries. At the end of it, on the right hand, is the well mentioned by Pliny: the which is circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and not square, as the <hi>Arabian</hi> writers describe: the diameter of it exceeds three feet, the sides are lined with white marble, and the descent into it is by fastning the hands, and feet, in litle open spaces, cut in the sides within, opposite, and answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to one another, in a perpendicular. In the same manner are almost all the wells, and passages into the cesterns at Alexandria contrived, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out staires or windings but only with inlets, and square holes, on each side within: by which, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the feet and hands, one may with ease de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend. Many of these cesternes, are with open, and double Arches, the lowermost Arch being supported by a row of speckled, and Thebaick marble pillars, upon the top of which stands a second row, bearing the upper and higher Arch: the walls within are covered with a sort of plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster for the colour white; but of so durable a substance, that neither by time, nor by the water

                  <note place="margin">Plin. l. 36, cap. 12.</note> as <hi>Herodotus</hi> cals such kinds (being by <hi>Plini's</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation CII feet in compasse about the head, in height LXII, in length CXLIII: and by my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation made of one entire stone) which stands not far distant without the Pyramid, South East of it, or into any other private retirement, I cannot determine; &amp; it may be too this served for no such purpose, but rather as a <hi>theca,</hi> or <hi>nichio,</hi> as the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians speak, wherein some idol might be placed; or else for a peece of ornament (for it is made of polished stone) in the architecture of those times, which ours may no more understand, then they doe the reason of the rest of those strange propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that appear in the passages, and inner rooms of this Pyramid. Returning back the same way we came, as soon as we are out of this narrow, and square passage, we climbe over it, and going straight on, in the trace of the second Gallery, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a shelving pavement (like that of the first) rising with an angle of twenty six degrees, we at length come to another partition. The length of the Gallery, from the well below to this partition above, is an hundred fifty and foure feet: but if we measure the pavement of the floore, it is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what lesse, by reason of a litle vacuity (some fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen feet in length) as we described before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the well, and the square hole we climbed over. And here to reassume some part of that, which hath been spoken, if we consider the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row entrance at the mouth of the Pyramid, by which we descend; and the length of the first.

and second Galleries, by which we ascend, all of them lying as it were in the same continued line, and leading to the midle of the Pyramid, we may easily apprehend a reason of that strange Echo within, of foure, or five voices, mentioned by <hi>Plutarch in his fourth book De placitis Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorum:</hi>

For the sound being shut in, and carried in those close, and smooth passages, like as in so many pipes, or trunks, finding no issue out reflects upon it selfe, and causes a confused noise, and circulation of the aire, which by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees vanishes, as the motion of it ceases. This Gallery or <hi>Corridore</hi> (or whatsoever else <hi>I</hi> may call it) is built of white, and polished marble, the which is very evenly cut in spacious squares, or tables. Of such materials as is the pavement, such is the roofe, and such are the side walls, that flank it: the coagmentation, or knitting of the joints, is so close, that they are scarce discernable by a curious eye, &amp; that which adds a grace to the whole structure, though it makes the passage the more slippery, &amp; difficult, is the acclivity, &amp; rising of the ascent. The height of this Gallery is 26 feet, the breadth is 6 feet, and 870 parts of the foot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into a 1000. of which three feet, and 435 of 1000 parts of a foot, are to be allowed for the way, in the midst: which is set, and bounded on both sides with two banks (like benches) of sleek and polished stone; each of these hath one foot, 717 of 1000 parts of a foot in breadth, and as much in depth. Upon the top of these benches near the Angle, where they close, and join with
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55075:57"/>
the wall, are litle spaces, cut in right angled pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell figures, set on each side opposite to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: intended no question, for some other end then ornament. In the casting, and ranging of the marbles in both the side walls, there is one peece of Architecture, in my judgement, very gracefull, and that is that all the courses, or ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which are but seven (so great are those stones) do set, and flag over one another, about three inches: the bottome of the uppermost course oversetting the higher part of the second, and the lower part of this overflagging the top of the third, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This square passage is of the same widenesse, and dimensions, as the rest, &amp; is in length near nine feet, (being all of Thebaick marble, most exquisitely cut) which lands us at the North end, of a very sumptuous, and well proportioned room. The distance from the end of the second Gallery to this entry, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon the same levell, is twenty foure feet. This rich, and spacious chamber, in which art may seem to have contended with nature, the curious work being not inferiour to the rich ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, stands as it were in the heart, and centar of the Pyramid, equidistant from all the sides and almost in the midst between the <hi>Basis,</hi> and the top. The floor, the sides, the roof of it, are all made of vast, and exquisite tables of Thebaick marble, which if they were not vailed, and obscured by the steame of tapers, would appeare glistering, and shining. From the top of it descending to the bottome, there are but six ranges of stone, all which being respectively sized to an equall height, very gracefully in one, and the same alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,

The stones which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this place, are of a strange, and stupendious length, like so many huge beames lying flat, and traversing the room, and withall supporting that infinite masse, and waight of the Pyramid above. Of these there are nine, which cover the roofe; two of them are lesse by halfe in breadth then the rest; the one at the East end, the other at the West. The length of this <note n="b" place="margin">These pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of the chamber, and those which follow, of the length and breadth of the hollow part of the tomb, were taken by me with as much exactnesse as it was possible to do: which I did so much the more diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as judging this to be the fittest place for the fixing of measures for posterity.

And thus have I finished my description of all the inner parts of this Pyramid: where I could neither borrow light to conduct me, from the Ancients: nor receive any manuduction from the uncertaine informations of modern travailers, in those dark, and hidden paths. We are now come abroad into the light, and Sunne, where <hi>I</hi> found my Janizary, and an English Captain, a litle im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to have waited above <note n="*" place="margin">That I and my company, should have continued so many houres in the Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid, and live (whereas we found no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience) was much wondred at by Doctor Harvey, his Majesties learned Physician. For said he, seeing we never breath the same aire twice, but still new aire is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a new respiration (the <hi>Succus alibilis</hi> of it being spent in every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration) it could not be but by long breathing we should have spent the aliment of that small stock of aire within, and have been stifled: unlesse there were some secret tunnels conveying it to the top of the Pyramid, whereby it might passe out, and make way for fresh aire to come in, at the entrance below. To which I returned him this answer. That it might be doubted whither the same numericall aire could not be breathed more then once; and whither the <hi>Succus,</hi> and aliment of it, could be spent in one single respiration: seeing those <hi>Vrinato<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and <hi>Persicus,</hi> continuing above halfe an houre under water, must needs often breath in, and out, the same aire. He gave me an ingenious answer, that they did it by help of spunges filled with oile, which still cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and fed this aire: the which oile being once evaporated, they were able to live no longer, but must ascend up, or dye. An experiment most certain, and true. Wherefore I gave him this second answer, that the fuligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous aire we breathed out in the Pyramid, might passe thorough those Galleries we came up, and so thorough the streight neck, or entrance, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into the Pyramid, and by the same fresh aire, might enter in, and come up to us. Which I illustrated with this similitude: as at the streights of Gibraltor, the sea is reported by some to enter in on Europe side, and to passe out on Africa side; so in this streight passage, being not much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three feet broad, on the one side aire might passe out, and at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side fresh aire might enter in. And this might no more mixe with the former aire, then the Rhodanus, as <hi>Mela,</hi> and some others report, passing through the lake of Geneva, or <hi>tacus Lemanus,</hi> doth mixe, and incorporate with the water of the lake. For as for any <hi>tubuli,</hi> to let out the fuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous aire at the top of the Pyramid, none could bee discovered
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55075:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
within, or without. He replyed, they might be so small, as that they could not easily be discerned, and yet might be sufficient to make way for the aire, being a thin, and subtile body. To which I answered, that the lesse they were, the sooner they would be obstructed with those tempests of sands, to which these deserts are frequently exposed: and therefore the narrow entrance into the Pyramid is often so choaked up with driffes of sand (which I may term the rain of the deserts) that there is no entrance into it. Wherefore we hire Moores to remove them, and open the passage, before we can enter into the Pyramid: with which he rested satisfied. But I could not so easily be satisfied with that received opinion, that at the streights of Gibraltor, the sea enters in at the one side, and at the same time passes out at the other. For besides that, in twice passing those streights, I could observe no such thing, but only an in-let, without any out-let of of the sea: I inquired of a Captain of a ship, being Captain of one of the six that I was then in company with, and an understanding man, who had often passed that way with the Pirates of Algier, whither ever he observed any out-let of the sea on Africa side, he answered no. Being asked, why then the Pirates went out into the Atlantick sea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes on Africa side, if it were not as the opinion is, to make use of the current. He answered, it was rather to secure themselves from being sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised by the Christians, who had neer the mouth of the streights the port of Gibraltor, on the other side to harbour in. Wherefore, when I consider with my selfe the great draught of waters that enter at this streight, and the swift current of waters, which passe out of the <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Euxinus</hi> by the <hi>Bosphorus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore I imagine it to be no absurdity in Philosophy, to say that the earth is tubulous, and that there is a large passage under ground from one sea to another. Which being granted, we may easily thence apprehend the reason why the Mediterranean sea rises no higher; notwithstanding the fall into it of so many waters: and also know the reason why the Caspian sea, though it hath not in appearance any commerce with other seas, continues salt (<hi>For so it is whatsoever Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The entrance into them is by square openings, hewen out of the rocke, much of the same bignes, with those I described in the first Pyramid. Whither these were symbolicall (as the Theology of the Aegyptians consisted much in mysterious figures) and the depressure, and lownes of these, were to teach the Priests humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: and the squarenes, and eevenes of them, an uniforme, and regular deportment in their actions, I leave to such as have written of their hieroglyphickes to determine. The hollow space within, of them all, is somewhat like to a square, and well proportioned chamber, covered, and arched above with the naturall rocke: in most of which (as I remember) there was a passage ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into some other compartiment, which the rubbage, and darknes, hindered me from view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. On the North side without, I observed a line, and only one, ingraven with sacred and Aegyptian characters, such as are mentioned by <note n="a" place="margin">Herodot. lib. 2.</note>

            <p>FRom this Pyramid we went unto the third, standing distant from the second about a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, upon an advantageous height, and rising of the rocke, whereby at a good distance it seemes equall to the former; though the whole pile is much lesse, and lower. The time was so far spent with my other observations, that I could not take so exact a view, as I desired, and the worke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served; yet I tooke so much of both, as to be able to confute the errors of others. But before I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this, I shall relate what the Ancients, and some one or two of our best writers, which have travelled thither, have delivered concerning this. <hi>Herodotus</hi> discoursing of it,<note place="margin">Herodot. lib. 2. <gap reason="foreign">

This worke although it is exceeded by the rest in magnitude, yet for the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55075:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>

            <p>It will be in vaine to repeate the traditions, and descriptions of severall others: all which by a kinde of confederacie, agree in the same tale for the substance, only differing in some circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: So that I shrewdly suspect, that <hi>Diodorus</hi> hath borrowed most of his relation from <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus:</hi> and <hi>Strabo,</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> from <hi>Diodorus,</hi> or

And therefore I have a strong jealousie, that they never came neere this third Pyramid; but that they did, as I have observed all travailers in my time in Aegypt to doe, fill themselves so full, and as it were so surfeit with the sight of the greater, and fairer Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid, that they had no appetite to be spectators of the rest: where they should only see the same miracle (for the Pyramids are all of the same figure) the farther they went, decreasing, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented as it were in a lesse Volumne: Or if they did view this, it was <hi>quasi per transennam,</hi> very perfunctorily, and sleightly; and that through a false, and coloured glasse. For they have mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken both in the quality of the stone, and colour of the Pyramid. I begin with <hi>Herodotus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Herodot lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. <hi>I</hi> know not how to palliate, or excuse his other errour, where he makes this Pyramid to be built as far as to the midle of it, with Aethiopicke marble. If this sort of marble be <hi>ferrei coloris,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plin. l 36. c, 7. Diodor. l. 1. Strab. l. 7. Geog.</note> as it is described by <hi>Pliny,</hi> and granted by <hi>Diodorus,</hi> and <hi>Strabo,</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:55075:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
both of them expressing the colour to be blacke, and the latter bringing it from the remotest mountaines of Aethiopia, where the marble hath the same tincture and colour, with the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, then can this relation of <hi>Herodotus</hi> no way be admitted. For the whole Pyramid seemes to be of cleere, and white stone, somewhat choicer, and brighter, then that in either of the two other Pyramids. And therefore <hi>I</hi> wonder that <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus, Strabo,</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> and amongst latter Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, <hi>Bellonius, Gillius,</hi> and severall others, should have all followed <hi>Herodotus</hi>: when with a litle paines, and circumspection, they might have reformed his, and their owne errour. It may perhaps be alleaged in their defence, that they meane the buildings within are erected with blacke, and Aethiopicke marble: and yet if this be granted, since there is no entrance leading into this, no more then is into the second Pyramid, what may be within depends upon the incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of tradition, or conjecture, both which are very fallible, Though it cannot be denied, but that close by this, on the East side of it, there are the ruines of a pile of building, with a sad, and dusky colour, much like that we described in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to the second Pyramid, which might be the ground, and occasion of this errour. <hi>I</hi> cannot excuse the Ancients, but <hi>Bellonius,</hi> or <hi>Gillius</hi> (For it is no matter which of them ownes the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when both of them have erred) are farre more inexcusable, Because it might have been expected from them,<note place="margin">T. Liv. lib. 1.</note> what <hi>Livy</hi> supposes, <hi>Novi semper scriptores, aut inrebus certius aliquid alla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turos se, aut scribendi arte rudem vetustatem supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raturos

credunt.</hi> Whereas these on the contrary, have depraved, what hath been, in this particular, with truth delivered by the Ancients. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and <hi>Diodorus,</hi> equal the side of the <hi>basis</hi> to three hundred feet, and <hi>Pliny</hi> extends it to three hundred sixty three, these make it only a third part greater then the Pyramid at Rome of <hi>C. Caestius,</hi> neere the <hi>mons testaceus.</hi> So that either they have much enlarged that at Rome, or shruncke, and contracted this. For the Pyramid at Rome, exactly measured on that side, which stands within the City, is completely seventy eight feet English in breadth: to which if we adde a third part of it, the result will be an hundred and foure: which should be equal to this Aegyptian Pyramid, in the notion, and acception of <hi>Bellonius.</hi> An unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable oversight, no lesse then two hundred feet, in a very litle more then three hundred. For so much, besides the authority of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and <hi>Diodorus,</hi> before cited, <hi>I</hi> take the side of this Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid to be, and the altitude to have much the same proportion.</p>

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55075:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
upon by <hi>Herodotus, Diodorus,</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> which is worth the discussion, as a point of some concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in architecture: and that is, in what manner these Pyramids were built, and with what art and contrivance the stones, especially those vast ones in the first, were conveied up. <note n="f" place="margin">

                  <hi>Herodotus</hi> who first raised the doubt, gives this solution. <hi>They car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up the rest of the stones with litle engines made of wood, raising them from the ground upon the first row: when the stone was lodged upon this row, it was put into another engine, standing upon the first step, from thence it was conveied to the second row by another. For so many rowes, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of steps, as there were, so many engines were there: or els they removed the engine which was one, and easy to be carried, to every particular row, as often as they moved a stone. We will relate that which is spoken of either part. Therefore those in the Pyramid were first made, which were the highest, then by degrees the rest, last of all those which are neerest to the ground, and are the lowest.</hi> The first part of this solution of <hi>Herodotus</hi> is full of difficulty. How in the erecting, and placing of so many <hi>machinae,</hi> charged with such massy stones, and those continually passing over the lower degrees, could it be avoided, but that they must either unsetle them, or indanger the breaking of some portions of them; which mutilations would have been like scars in the face of so mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent a building? His second answer is the sounder; but I conceive the text to be imperfect. <note n="g" place="margin">
