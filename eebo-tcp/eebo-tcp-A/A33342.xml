         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Introduction
Addressed to the
READER.</head>
            <p>WHEN the great and wise Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of the Universe thought it
in Eternal Wisdom convenient
to build the Mansion, all Creatures now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited,
he left nothing undone that might
contribute to the Glory and Magnificence of
so great a work; and lest Mankind, the
top of the Creation, should grow supine, and
neglect the filling or peopling every part of so
admirable a Frame, he even compelled them
to do it by confounding their Language at
<hi>Babel,</hi> and thereby obliging them as they
multiplied, to scatter over the Face of the


<pb facs="tcp:43371:4"/>
Earth, that none of his wonderous works
might remain obscure or unobserved to those
for whose use and pleasure they were made;
by which means the people in sundry Tribes,
wandering from place to place, incroaching
by degrees, as men began to multiply, planted
themselves in the most advantagious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
every one striving for the best: howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
through Wars, Pestilence, Inundations,
and other strange Revolutions and Accidents,
it is past all peradventure, that the bad as
well as the good found possessors, as at this
day. Though, Reader, I shall not trouble
you in this place, with entring upon the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Peopling of Kingdoms and Countries,

               </gap>s to particulars; but let you know that my
care has been to present you with Geographical
and Historical Description of the World, as it
formerly stood, and at present stands: and
though upon first thought it may seem strange,
that in so small a Volume so large a one can
be contained, yet upon perusal you will find
that nothing material is omitted, that can
be required to render satisfaction upon this
occasion: insomuch, that by well considering
this Work, a mean Capacity may suddenly know
how the Worlds mighty Fabrick is disposed,
and soon become acquainted with every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
under Heaven, enough to render him


<pb facs="tcp:43371:4"/>
capable not only of contemplating the
Goodness of the Almighty, in his VVorks and
Creatures, but readily Discoursing, even with
the most knowing Travellers, and without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding
the danger of treacherous Seas, Winds,
Robbers, and a VVorld of Inconveniencies
that attend an expensive search into these
Affairs; securely Travel in Imagination from
Pole to Pole. For to be brief, there is no
Kingdom, Province, or Estate, that is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly
left out of this History or Treatise;
and as to what is most material, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
is considerably large; wherefore recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending

World, yet nothing inferiour in Goodness to
the rest, in the Generosity of People, Riches,
Worth and Vertue, and exceeding them, if we
consider the Flourishing of the True Religion; and
is said to take its Name from <hi>Europa</hi> the Daughter of
<hi>Agenor</hi> King of <hi>Phoenicia;</hi> containing many Flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Kingdoms and Provinces; as will appear in the
sequel. And is accounted in length 2800 miles;
In breadth 1200; bounded on the West, with the
main Ocean; on the East, with the <hi>Aegean</hi> Sea,
<hi>Pontus Euxinus,</hi> the Fenns of <hi>Maeotis,</hi> and the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Tanais;</hi> from which a right Line conjecturally
drawn from the Bay of <hi>Granvicus,</hi> it is dis-joined

divided into Continent, and Islands, the
Continent Intire, and the Islands dispersed, In the
<hi>Greek, Ionian, Aegean, Adriatick, Mediterranean,

Belgium, Denmark, Swedeland, Hungary, Sclavonia,
Russia, Poland, Dacia,</hi> and <hi>Greece;</hi> with the disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

which is now rather Scholastical, than National,
there are other diversities of Language, besides the
<hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> supposed to be corruptly deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the Latin; and has been Famous by twice

more abounding in plenty of what ever may conduce,
to the Commodity and suport of Humane Life; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
with almost all the sundry sorts of Fruits
that <hi>Europe</hi> produces, as also store of River and Sea-Fish;
a great number of Cattle, plenty of Wine,

The present Inhabitants though somewhat fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick,
are generaly of a free and curteous Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,

Complement; the Women are likewise wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
familiar even with Strangers especially in Speech,
taking it for a great peice of breeding, not to be
too Austere or Reserved.</p>
               <p>Their Apparel for the most part is rather Gay
than Costly, made of light Stuffs and slight Silks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
though the Country people are distinguished from
others; by the Men's wearing a large pair of Breeches
and a Coat to their Knees; and the Womens attire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Heads, or rather wraping them in Linnen,
and these are in a manner Drudges, or Slaves, to the
Gentry, especially such as are their Land-lords, they
being all of them Tenants at Will, and have their
Rent raised as the Land improves, or as the Lord

frequently worsted; in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the

Fortunate Battle of <hi>Azin-court,</hi> Conquored and
brought under subjection by <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, who
with 15000. men, only overthrew an Army of
above 100000. in which the flower of their Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

The things worthy of Note in this Illustruous
Kingdom, are the Cathedral Church of the Blessed
Virgin in <hi>Paris,</hi> Vulgarly called <hi>Notrodam;</hi> suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by 120. Pillars, whereof 12. are very great,
but the remainder indifferently large, and in the
midst of the Church is a Chancel, accounted 71 paces
in length, and 60 in bredth; and in the Circuit or
Circumference, it hath 45 Chappels, and is closed with
Iron Gates, and two double doors in the front, adorn'd
with the Statues of 28 Kings; and on the sides are
four Towers of Bell-fries of 44 Cubits in height,
and a Bell so large called St. <hi>Mary,</hi> that 24 Men
are required to Ring it out. The Seven Wonders
of <hi>Dauphin,</hi> viz. The burnig Fountain, the Inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessable

mostly of rough Stone, Plastered and rough cast over
flat roofed; and commonly 4, 5, and 6 Stories.

abounding with Corn, Fruits, and Cattle; and the

a separate Kingdom, wherefore I intend to speak of
it in its due place, as more proper in a work of this

               <p>The Principal Rivers appropiated to <hi>Spain,</hi> are

or <hi>Anas,</hi> which for a good space Ingulfs it self,

to boast, that they have one of the fairest Bridges,
in the World, on which Ten thousand Cattle feed,
and over which an Army with extended Wings may
March; the other Rivers of note are <hi>Gualdahquiver,</hi>
and the <hi>Ebro,</hi> called by <hi>Strabo, Baetis,</hi> and <hi>Iberus.</hi>
As fot the Mountains they are distinguished into six

As for the People of <hi>Spain,</hi> they are swarthy of
Complexion, black-Hair, and of a good Proportion,
stately in their Actions, and grave of Deportment,
very serious in their Carriage, and Offices, much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to Religion, and very Observant and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to their Prince, not prone to alter their Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
but patient in Adversity, in War they are
very Deliberate and Cautious, not much regarding
Arts, but adict themselves much to Women, and are
generally very much conceited of themselves; As
for the Women they carry themselves very sober and
discreet, and are tolerably handsome: Those that
are marryed are in great Subjection to their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
and extream loving; though the men are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
Jealous. In matters of Religion, they are
<hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> only there are some Churches of
<hi>Toledo,</hi> where the <hi>Mus-Arabick</hi> Office is used. As
for the Language, it is not all the same, for in some
parts, it has a mixture of <hi>French,</hi> in others much
of the <hi>Moorish,</hi> and in some again the <hi>Gothish Arabick,</hi>
but generally and vulgarly, the Old <hi>Spanish</hi> is used,
which has much Affinity with the Latin; and as for
the Civil and Imperial Laws used amongst them,
they are intermixed with many Customs of the
<hi>Goths,</hi> and the King governs his Provinces by Vice-Roys,
or Ministers of State; and though this Couu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
is not very fruitful in Corn and Cattle, yet it
generally abounds in Wines, Oyls, Sugars, Rice,
Silk, Liquoras, Honey, Wax, Saffron, Anniseeds,
Rosin, Almonds, Oranges, Lemmons, Cakes, Soap,
Anchovies, Soda, Barrilla, Shumack, Wool, Lamb-Skins,
Tobacco, besides the great Treasures of Gold
and Silver that comes from <hi>America,</hi> from whence it
is conjectured since the first discovery, that above
Fifteen hundred thirty six Millions of Gold has been
brought into <hi>Spain.</hi>

As for the Buildings, they are every where more
solid and durable, than stately and magnificent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
at <hi>Sevil;</hi> in Relation to which, the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
usually say, he that has not been at <hi>Sevil,</hi> has seen
no stately Building. As for Apparrel, they affect
rather Gravity than Gaudiness; and their Diet is as
sparing, consisting for the most part of Herbs, made
into Pottage, with minced Meats and Salads; though
there is scarcely a Mechanick in any noted Town, but
when he goes abroad, has his Cloak on, and his Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
by his side, and walks in as much State as the
greatest <hi>Don</hi> in the Kingdom.</p>

                  <p>THE Dukedom of <hi>Mantoua</hi> is a very fair
Country, very plentiful in Corn, Wine, Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and rich Pastures, and Fruits of sundry
Kinds: As for the chief City that gives it the Name,
it is Seated in a Lake of 20 Miles compass, by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
very strong and fencible, there being no Land
access to it but by Cause-ways, and in it stands the
Dukes Pallace, very fair and stately, though he has
another Pallace for Pleasure and Delight exceeding
this, at <hi>Marmirolla,</hi> five Miles from this City; As
for <hi>Mantoua</hi> it is in a manner round, save that the
Lake on the North-East sides, enters it like a half
Moon: The Buildings are partly of Brick, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Free Stone, and the Streets large and clean:
In the midst is a large Market-place, where all
manner of Strangers are admitted to vend their
Ware, though the greatest Traffick is in the hands
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who grow Rich by the Impoverish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Citizens, and is in compass 4 Miles,
having 8 Gates, and strengthened by a good Wall.
This City is of antient standing, and contains about
50000 People, and has often been brought into Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
by the <hi>Germans,</hi> especially in the Year 1619<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and 1630. As for the Dukes Revenue, it is count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43371:21"/>
400000 Crowns <hi>per Annum,</hi> though many will
not credit it, seeing some few Years since, he made
over part of his Dutchy to the <hi>French</hi> King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for a
considerable Sum of Money; and here it is held
unlawful to wear a Sword, or any other Weapon
without Lisence; and in this City the Famous <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>
had his Birth, as by his <hi>Ecclogus</hi> appears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and to this Dukedom partly appertains the Dukedom
of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> in the South-East of <hi>Piemont,</hi> and other
Territories.</p>

                  <p>THE Dukedom of <hi>Vrbin</hi> may be said to lie
within the Territories of the Church,
bounded on the North with the <hi>Adriatick,</hi>
on the South with the Apennine Hills, on the West
with <hi>Romagna,</hi> or <hi>Roma-di-ola,</hi> and on the East with

Two hundred Castles, and Seven Principal
Towns, the chief is <hi>Vrbin</hi> seated at the bottom of

The next to it <hi>Pisauro,</hi> containing an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

                  <head>The Estate or Common Wealth of Genoa
Described.</head>
                  <p>THE Estate of <hi>Genoa,</hi> formerly contained a
large part of <hi>Italy,</hi> and were accounted
the most expert in Navigation of all Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,
but of late, through the many Wars they
have maintained against the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and other
neighbouring Princes, their own Intestine Broils,
and their neglect of Navigation and Traffick, they
are greatly reduced, holding little more than <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guria</hi>
and <hi>Corsica:</hi> The first of these has on the East
the River <hi>Varus,</hi> on the West parted from <hi>Tuscany</hi>
by the <hi>Magura,</hi> on the North the <hi>Apennine</hi> Hills, and
on the South the <hi>Ligurian</hi> or <hi>Tyrrenian</hi> Seas.</p>
                  <p>As for the City of <hi>Genoa,</hi> it is seated on the sides
of small rising Hills, tho' behind it are those of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
height, lying open on the South side to the Sea,
where it has a goodly Haven, in the form of a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
or half Moon, upon the Horn whereof, towards
the East, is the Sea Bank <hi>Lamola,</hi> about 600 paces
in length, keeping off the Waves that beat upon
the City on the East side; and in the middle of this
Bank is a Fort built to defend the Navy that may
Anchor there, so that the circuit of this City is
accounted Eight miles, and though the Streets are
narrow, yet the Palaces of the <hi>Dey,</hi> and Houses of
the Senators, are very stately; nor are their Walls
less strengthned with Bull-warks, and other Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications.
The Houses in the High-streets are Four
Stories, and many Five, the Windows being Glazed,
which is not usual in <hi>Italy,</hi> many of them built of
Marble, but all of Freestone: The Streets paved
with Flint, and the Suburbs full of Gardens and
Houses of the Nobility and Gentry. As for the
People, they are Masters of other Cities, as <hi>Noli,


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43371:22"/>
Sarazena,</hi> and <hi>Savon,</hi> being noble minded and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
in all their Actions, formerly much inclined
to War and search of Adventures; insomuch that
they assisted, with a great Fleet in the Holy War,
and taking of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by the Christian Army, and
aided <hi>Phillip</hi> the French King with 10000 Men, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Edward</hi> the Third of <hi>England,</hi> where in one
Battle they were most of them slain. They Aided
likewise the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in 1588 to Invade <hi>England,</hi>
with several great Carracts and Galleys; which were
either lost upon the Coast, or cast away in their
Flight homeward, which loss they have never since
fully recovered; yet they lately made a stout De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
against the Naval Power of <hi>France,</hi> which
could effect no more, than beating down some part
of their City, by Bombing it at a distance, as being
well assured they had no Fleet capable of Engaging.</p>
                  <p>The Country abounds in all the Plenties of <hi>Italy,</hi>
and here only the Women have the greatest Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
without the Jelosie or Suspition of their
Husbands of any <hi>Italians;</hi> and as a further Honour
to this place, it gave Birth to <hi>Christopher Columbus,</hi>
the first Discoverer of the New World or Country
of <hi>America.</hi>

seems to stand in a Wood, and the Plain wherein it
is seated, is invironed with Mountains or large Hills,

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43371:23"/>
they are narrow and paved with broad Freestone,
and in it are many Palaces, and Merchants Houses,
curious built of Free-stone, according to other
Building in <hi>Italy,</hi> and was formerly a place of great
Trade for Silks, Stuffs, Carpets, Cloth of Gold, and
the like; there being a great concourse of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
call'd <hi>Luccois</hi> Merchants, that were wont
to meet there at several Fairs or Marts, held for
that purpose, but of late the Trade is declined:
however the Inhabitants inrich themselves by their
Manufacture, which they send to other places of
greater Trade. And here there is a strict Law,
that no Person shall wear any Weapon, no not a
Knife, unless it be blunted; the People being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
very courteous to Strangers. And thus much
for what may be properly call'd <hi>Italy,</hi> which taken
in general, is one of the most fruitful and pleasant
Countrys of the World, of which <hi>Europe</hi> being
call'd the Head, this is accounted the Face. But for

Chancellor of <hi>Italy,</hi> and held to be the second chief
Elector of the Empire; and has in his Jurisdiction,

the rest in this Tract of Land, by reason of its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
Scituation, very Fruitful, containing the
Regiments or Territories of <hi>Gulick, Cleve,</hi> and <hi>Berge:</hi>
As for the Dutchy of <hi>Gulick,</hi> it contains the City of
<hi>Akan</hi> in chief, and some other Towns of note, with
sundry pleasant Villages, and claims the honour of
the Emperors Presence, soon after his Election, as
taking here a Silver Crown, and performing some
other customary Ceremonies.</p>
                  <p>As for the chief Cities of the Dutchy of <hi>Cleve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
they are <hi>Cleve, Wesel, Emmerick, Calkar,</hi> and
others, with their Villages and Dependancies; and
those of the Dutchy of <hi>Berge,</hi> or <hi>Mont,</hi> are <hi>Mursburg,
Dusledorp, Hattingen,</hi> very commodiously scituate, and
the whole Country watered with pleasant Streams,
so that the Soyl yields naturally an extraordinary
increase to the Husbandmen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>VETERAVIA</hi> is another Country of this Tract,

Famous for the Princes of that House, who in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> so long opposed the Power
of <hi>Spain;</hi> and from which House, the Illustrious
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> is descended; this Country yields
abundance of Corn, and many Vines, yet produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
no great store of Wine; and in them, besides
the Towns I have mentioned, are found the Towns
of <hi>Dellinbourg, Windeck, Hebron,</hi> and <hi>Catzenelbogen,</hi>
which latter has been accounted an Earldom.</p>
                  <p>As for the Nobility of <hi>Germany,</hi> the Title descends

               <p>The Commodities of these Countries, in general
are Copper, Brass, Lead, Ox-hides, Tallow, Furs,
Goat-skins, Elks-skins, the Skins of Deer; Honey,
Allom, Corn; and in many places there are Silver
Mines, but of no consider able advantage. The
men are Active, Naturally strong, indifferent good

The Inhabitants of this Country are Thick, not
tall, but rather square, habiting themselves in Furrs,
course Cloth, and Feeding to excess, given
greatly to Drinking, though it be strictly forbid,
and are generally False and Perfidious, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
their Words, but studying to Over-reach,
or Cozen all they can, insomuch that being in
other Countries, they strive to dissemble their
own, the better to be Credited: The Women
are tolerably handsome, well Limbed and Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
and have a strange Custom amongst them,
not to think their Husbands either Love or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

having in his Hands the Power of Life and Death,

               <p>The Buildings in this Kingdom, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
that compose it, are for the most part of
Timber and Loam; the Land full of Forrests, with
many Rivers, yielding notwithstanding abundance
of Corn, but is defective in Wine; Honey and
Wax, are likewise found in great store, with Fruits
of divers Kinds, and a great Number of Cattle and
wild Beasts; there are also Salt-pits, and in some
places Mines of Brimstone, Copper and Iron. The
<hi>Polanders</hi> are generally Tall, well Proportioned,
Courteous, and Pleasant of Behaviour; their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are rich, and of divers Colours, being much
conceited of their own worth, and loving to be
Praised, or rather Flattered: As for <hi>Lithuania,</hi> one
of the Provinces of this Kingdom, though it is a
very large one, yet it is so full of Fenns, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered
by the over-flowing of Rivers, that it is not
currantly passable, but when the Frosts are great,
at what time they have no hindrance, neither by


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:43371:43"/>
Rivers nor Fenns, and their greatest Wealth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in Cattle, Honey, Wax and Furrs: As for the
Language generally spoken, it is the <hi>Sclavonian;</hi>
and in the North Extremities, where Villages and
Towns are very scarce, the People dwell in Hutts
of Straw and Loam, with Holes at the top of them
to let in the Light, and give vent to the Smoak,
living in miserable Poverty, as do (for the major
part) the Peasants or inferiour People, being in
a manner Slaves to the great ones, whose Tenants
they are, though the Richer Sort are very Profuse
and Expensive, rather Prodigal than Liberal, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
of Injuries, Delicious in Diet, and costly in
Attire, often shaving their Heads, except one Lock,
which they preserve with great care, being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
good Soldiers, and much Glory if they
can kill a Turk in Battle, and bring off his
Head, in Token of which, they wear Feathers in
their Caps.</p>
               <p>Theft in these Parts is very rare, especially to
be committed by a Native <hi>Polander,</hi> and all Crimes
are severely punished: As for the Religion they
Profess, in Relation to the Government, it is that
of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, though the Reformed way
of Worship is allowed and tolerated; and the
King is of late Elective; the Women are tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
Fair and well Proportioned, very Witty and
Ingenious, great admirers, and observers, of their
Husbands, and very neat in their Houses. A Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant

when the Gospel is Read in the Churches, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

occasions the longest Summers Day in the most Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern

likening it to a Monstrous Beast, with a Head like

Serpent; though some to justifie this Fiction,
will have it to be infested at the bottom by Serpents,
grazed in the middle by Goats, and containing
nearer to the top, dens of Lions, altogether framing
the Monster, said to be destroyed by <hi>Bellerophon;</hi>
which indeed tended to nothing more than that he

                  <p>As for the Country of <hi>Palestine</hi> in general, or the
promised Land, it is taken by some to be the place
where the Terrestrial Paradise stood, and is indeed
Fruitful, even to a miracle; for in most places there
is an Eternal Spring, and in Summer the Flowers
alwaies smiling, and the Vernant Trees seldom cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their ripe and mellowed Fruit before Blossoms
and green Fruit take place, and are naturally of
extraordinary growth; insomuch, that we read,
when <hi>Caleb, Josuah,</hi> and others, went up to spie
the Land, they brought a cluster of Grapes, as an
earnest of the rest, so large, that they were obliged
to carry it upon a Staff, between two of them.

are found in it, all of loose Sands, taking eight daies
in passing over them, which at certain times are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
so violently by the Wind, that Travellers are
overwhelmed under heaps and mountains of Dust, and
buryed Alive: as also are the Shepherds, who build
little Cots on the borders of these Desarts, though
very poor and despicable: as <hi>Lucan</hi> has it in his

nothing pleasant, being mostly inhabited by Thieves
and Rovers, who having committed Robberies and
Outrages, in more populous and wealthy Countries
make this their retreat, as knowing few will
give themselves the trouble of looking for them
in so waste and desolate a Country; yet there are


<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43371:68"/>
some few Cities and Towns found in it, but those
mostly on the Borders, <hi>viz. Sabe</hi> or <hi>Saba,</hi> the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation

South with a long ridge of Mountains, dividing
it from <hi>Arabia Felix,</hi> and is called <hi>Petraea,</hi> from
its rockyness, and the abundance of large Stones
that are found every where in it; and is indeed
barren in a manner, as the former, but more firm
and solid, which gives it the preheminence in
Fruitfulness; and is full of woody Mountains,
wherein the wild <hi>Arabs</hi> lurk and fortifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
being reduced under Captains of Tribes, as
also untravell'd Desarts, unless by such as carry
their Provision with them for fear of starving,
and for that they are many times set upon and
murthered by the Thieves and Rovers; so that
the general passage to <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> is by
Caravans, to defend which there seldom go less

get their Living by Tillage, but wander for the
most part, from one place to another, without
any setled Habitation; nor have they the use of
Laws, neither can they long endure the Air or
Soil in one place: Their Food is chiefly upon
Venison, and store of Milk, Herbs, Fruits, and
Wild Foul; but as for Corn and Wine they have
none: their Wives are hired only for a time,

though for a shew of Marriage they present their
Husbands with a Spear and a Tent, as their Dowry,
though they part when they please; and both
Sexes are extreamly given to Lust, the Women as
rambling as the Men, leaving their Children to
the help of Providence, where they fall without
any further care of them.</p>
                  <p>As for the Rivers in this thirsty Land, there
are but few, and the chief are <hi>Trajanus Amnis,

the defect of the foregoing, is bounded on the

store of Cattle: The greatest business of these
people when exempted from War, being to feed
Sheep upon the Mountains, and other Cattle on
the lower ground, driving them from place to
place where the Pastures are best, and where they
find the most commodious Springs, carrying with
them their Families, Tents, and Provision, and
usually go Armed, not so much for fear of Rovers,
as Wild Beasts that possess the Caves of those
Mountains: The People being large of Body,
comely of Personage, much used to the Bow and
Spear; patient of all kind of Labour: The Women
are very homely, but of a manly aspect, and when
occasion requires, addict themselves in Disguises

naturally, much plenty, and the Vines of
their own accord, twist themselves about Trees;
creeping up into the spreading Branches, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording
much Wine; but that which in Antient
times rendred it most memorable, was the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Gold found in the Sands of the Rivers issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the Mount <hi>Caucasus;</hi> for which <hi>Jason</hi>
made his Expedition; and thereby gave the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

likewise found divers Veins of Silver in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,

being exhausted, the People deficient in Coin, are
obliged to Barter Goods for such things as their
necessities require; however they are much given

their guests upon any slight Entertainment, as not
thinking they can be otherways sufficiently welcom;

                  <p>The Country is Mountainous, Woody, and
a great part of it covered with Snow three

The Southern boundards are partly <hi>Cochin-China,</hi>
a Province of the <hi>East India,</hi> and partly the Ocean;
on the East with the <hi>Oriental Ocean,</hi> and on the

This Kingdom, according to the account of the
Natives, contains 15 Provinces, <hi>viz. Canton, Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queit,
Olam, Sisuam, Tolenchia, Cansay, Miuchian,
Ochian, Hionam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Paguia, Tuitan, Quinchen, Chag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,

591 Cities, 1593 Walled Towns, 4200 Unwalled
Towns, and 1154 Castles; the whole Countrey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
accounted 3000 Leagues in Circumference,
reaching from 130 to 160 Degrees of Longitude,
and from the Tropick of <hi>Cancer</hi> to the 53 Degree of
Latitude, lying under all the Climes from the Third
to the Ninth, so that the Air is very Temperate
and Healthful, by which the Natives are for the
most part exempted from Sickness, and live to an
extream Age: As for the Riches and Fertility, it is
very much, even to admiration, the people being
very Industrious, and the Soil as suitable; so that
in many places they have two, and in most parts
three Harvests in a Year, nor do they spare to
Plant and Sow, the best of all kinds they can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass.</p>
                  <p>The chief Commodities coming from hence are
Pearls, Bezora Stones, Wooll, Cotton, Olives,
Wine, Flax, Metals, Fruit, <hi>China</hi> Ware of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
kinds, Stuffs, Carpets, Embroideries, Musk,
Amber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The People are of a Swarthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
especially those living towards the Southern
parts, short Nosed, black Eyed, with thin Beards,
wearing long Garments, with loose Sleeves, and
Hair at its full growth; they are much given to often
eating, but then they do it very sparingly, not
touching their Victuals with their hands, but take
it with a Fork made of Ebbony or Ivory, from
whom the <hi>Europeans</hi> learned the Fashion. The
Men are very Jealous of their Wives, insomuch that
they will not suffer them to go abroad, nor sit at
the Table with them if any Stranger be there, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
some very near Kinsman; however they permit


<pb n="147" facs="tcp:43371:78"/>
them to go as Gay as they please about the House,
and one Trick has been brought into a Custom, to
prevent their desiring to ramble, the which is by
the hard binding up their Feet when Children, to
render them small, that being accounted the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Ornament or Beauty, so that being Cripled by
that means, they cannot go without pain. As for
their dead, they bury them in Fields fifteen days
after their decease: They that are buried within
the Walls of Cities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being by them accounted
most miserable. Knowledge they have of the Deity,
and some marks and foot-steps of Christianity is
remaining amongst them, but so obscured, that they
live for the most part after the manner of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Gentiles, offering Sacrifices to the Devil, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

Building, and indeed in all their Actions, they
are very neat, and the Countrey so populous,

lessened the number; that some of their Kings have
brought a Million of People into the Field, and has
seldom less, than 1000 Ships of War, though of no
great Service, in a readiness, and 10000 lesser Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
on several Rivers, for carrying of Goods and
Merchandise from place to place; yet so jealous are
they of Strangers prying into their Affairs, that in
some Cities 'tis Death for any but a Native to lodge
a Night within the Walls, nor is he permitted in
the day time to enter, without giving his name to
a <hi>Publique Notary,</hi> which when he returns, he must
see crossed out, or where ever he is found, he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers

The Towns and Cities are too Numerous to be
particularly recited, but the principal are <hi>Quinsay,</hi>
100 Miles in Circuit, with a Lake of 30 Miles
compass within the Walls, in the middle of which
is an Island, where the Emperor (as he stiles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self)
has a Magnificent Pallace, and is thought to
contain Two millions of People. <hi>Pequin</hi> or <hi>Pekin,</hi>
not much inferiour to the former in bigness, but
nothing in Trade, and all the Countrey is so free
from Hills or Mountains, that the <hi>Chinese</hi> ride in
Charriots made of Reeds, or Canes, which by the
help of Sails is driven by the Wind, as if drawn by
Horses, or floating upon the Water. As for the
Rivers, they are but few, and those proceed from
great Lakes, as wanting hills to give them Springs;
the principal are <hi>Aspthara, Senus, Ambactu,</hi> and
<hi>Cotiaris,</hi> all Navigable; and have over them a great
Number of Bridges, the Arches of some of them
rising so high, that a Ship under Sail may pass with
as much ease as a Boat: And as for the Customs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising
by Trade, they are so great, that no Prince

               <p>As for the People, they are of a Swarthy or
Tawny Complexion, very much inured to Labour,
tho the Countrey yields great Encrease of its own
accord; very servile and obedient to their Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,

addicting themselves to <hi>Necromancy</hi> and <hi>Sorcery,</hi>
and are said first to Teach the use of Letters to the

obscure Learning, by representing the meaning of
what they intended to express in <hi>Hieroglyphicks,</hi>
shadowing it under divers forms of Birds and Beast,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and here are to be found the Ruins of mighty


<pb n="159" facs="tcp:43371:84"/>
Structures, as the Pyramids and Tower of <hi>Pharo's</hi>
built of Marble, exceeding high, nightly hung
with Lights, as a Sea-mark to <hi>Sailors,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rare Matters to demonstrate the Magnificence of
a Plenteous Kingdom.</p>
               <p>As for the Cities of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they are generally built
upon Hills or high rising Ground, to stand dry du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the over-flowing of <hi>Nilus,</hi> from whose Waters
the Countrey receives its Fertility; so that whilst
it carries its Stream over the Land, they Commerce
with each other by little Boats, which beginning
on the 15th of <hi>June,</hi> lasts 40 days, standing 15 Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
in many places, and in 40 more gathers its Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
within the Banks, by which means the Earth is
so well tempered (for in this Kingdom there falls no
Rain) that the Encrease is sixty and eighty fold,
their Harvest being commonly in our <hi>March</hi> and
<hi>April;</hi> and if the River flows too scanty or too
immoderate, then it betokens scarcity or some
misfortune to the Prince, Governour, or State,
and whilst its Waters are abroad, which at the first
issuing create a <hi>Plague</hi> for the space of a day: The
Cattle feed on the Hills; and when the Famine was
here in the Reign of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> this River refused to
pass its bounds, or give any Assistance to the Thirsty
Land.</p>
               <p>This Countrey was formerly divided into two

the two extream Branches of the River <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
in form of the greek Letter, from whence it

<hi>Cleopatra: Gleba Rubra,</hi> by the <hi>Greeks</hi> called <hi>Hiera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolus,</hi>
and sometimes <hi>Erithia Bolus,</hi> of which there goes
a Story, That King <hi>Amenophis</hi> the Fifth being Blind,
was informed by one of his <hi>Magi,</hi> that if he could
procure the Water or Urine of a Woman that had
been Married a Twelve-month and upward, who
had known no Man but her Husband, it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
him to Sight, when having tried in vain a
great number, at last one was found, whose Urine
effected it, upon which he took her as a mark of
Honour, to be his Queen, and caused the rest to
be brought into this Town, and to be burnt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with it.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> they are a great many of
them <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and some maintain their first I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous
Custom, in Worshipping an Ox, Onions,
Leeks, and other Foolish Matters, and when they
have a great Increase, they Offer to the God <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
as they term the River, in which Feast the
poorer sort spend almost all they have Laboured
for through the course of the Year; and indeed,
this Country in Fruitfulness, occasioned by that
River, affords them no small Store, alluding to

And one thing extraordinary in this Kingdom, we
think not fit to pass by, which if true (as indeed it
is confirmed by People of known Credit) may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
create a wonder in all, coming to pass by a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
means, and not the work of Art and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>viz.</hi> about five Miles from <hi>Cair,</hi> there is said
to be a place which every <hi>Good Friday</hi> shews the
appearance of the Heads, Legs, Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Men
and Children, as if rising out of the Ground, to a
very great Number; however if any Person ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
them, they shrink in again: A strange fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner,
or earnest, if true, of the Resurrection of
the whole Body, presented Yearly by the rising of
the Members; and to confirm the Truth hereof,
<hi>Stephen Dupleis</hi> (held to be a sober discerning Man)
affirms to be an Eye Witness of the Wonder, and
that he had touched diverse of the rising Members,
and as he was once about to do it to the Head of a
Child, a <hi>Carian</hi> forbad it, telling him he knew not
what he did. Another Wonder is the <hi>Crocodile,</hi>
which coming from a small Egg, not exceeding the
bigness of a <hi>Turkies,</hi> grows to be 30 Feet in length
and proportionable in thickness, living at Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in the Water, or on the Land, destroying
not only Fish, but Men and Beasts; and with these
the <hi>Nilus</hi> abounds, as also with a Fish called the
River Horse; and thus much for <hi>Egypt.</hi>

which the Country takes its name, Scituate near
the Sea in the form of a Triangle with a Haven, but
neither great nor secure from the fury of the North
Winds; though the City is strong and beautiful,
having not only in it spacious Inns, but Baths, and
Mosques, very commodious and sumptuous; and
here every Trade takes a Street to themselves;
the Streets standing even one above another, upon
the rising of the Hill; which renders it a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
prospect, to such as sail by it, and the Harbour
or Mole defended with strong Castles, and other
works, which render the Approach inaccessible and
was formerly a place to which Merchants traded;
but now only a nest of Pirates, studying and striv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all they can, to endamage and molest, such as
sail those Straits or Seas; and though they have
been often curbed by the <hi>English, French,</hi> and
<hi>Dutch, &amp;c.</hi> and brought to terms of Peace; yet
like thorow paced Thieves, they never kept it
longer than they found an opportunity, to break it
to their advantage; and were in the year 1688; so
resolute when the <hi>French</hi> Fleet lay before it, and
had with their Bombs fired the Town about their
Ears, not only to reject the offer made, but in
contempt to that puissant Monarch, to shoot his

the Upland Country, it has many pleasant Towns

of sundry kinds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FEZ</hi> and <hi>MOROCCO,</hi> are now joyned under

and contain the whole Country of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
so called, which took its name from the <hi>Mauri,</hi> a
people that Antiently Inhabited it; and the first
of these has <hi>Fez</hi> for its chief City, giving name to
the Kingdom; and here was scituate the City of
<hi>Tangier,</hi> lately demolished by the <hi>English,</hi> as not
worth the keeping; nor is the Country wanting in
large Forrests, Green Fields, Vineyards, flourishing
Gardens, abounding with Fruits, and producing
an infinite number of Cattle, a breed of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Horses, and the Mountains many wild
Beasts, watered with the Rivers <hi>Buringrug</hi> and
<hi>Inavis</hi> for the space of 100 Miles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>MOROCCO</hi> is Scituate in a warm breathing Air,
which renders the Country very fertile; so that
it abounds with Figs, Dates, Grapes, Apples, Olives,
Honey, Sugar, and Cattle; the whole Country

Hea, Duccala, Hascorasus</hi> and <hi>Tedles,</hi> all hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the King of <hi>Morocco,</hi> and paying him
Tribute, his Power being Absolute and Tyrannical;
insomuch that he causes whom he pleases to be put
to Death, that is, cast to the Lyons, or other wild
Beasts, to make him sport; nor can any of his
Subjects, account what he has his own; as for the
Profession of Religion these people make, it is <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometism,</hi>
though there are a great many <hi>Jews,</hi>
and some <hi>Christians,</hi> living amongst them; as for
Rivers there are not many in this Country, the
Land being watered mostly by Brooks, and little


<pb n="166" facs="tcp:43371:88"/>
Springs; nor do they know in most parts what
Winter means as never having seen Ice or
Snow, but what hangs on the Top of the <hi>Atlas</hi>
a huge Mountain, held to Transcend the Clouds;
the top of it Crowned with Pines, and so steep
and rugged, that it cannot but with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty

Palm Trees, and Forrests of Wild Beasts, not more
Salvage than the People, who live for the most part
by Rapine and Murther, inhospitable to Strangers,
neglecting Tillage, and giving themselves up chiefly
to the feeding of Cattle upon the Mountains, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
like the <hi>Tartars</hi> their Families and Tents, with
other Provisions from place to place, by reason of
the scarceness of Water; for where this day a

yet near the River <hi>Dara,</hi> and in some other

places by the favour of Springs are so well knit and
fastened, that they appear Green and Flourishing,

of the over-flowing of the River <hi>Niger,</hi> insomuch

               <p>The People of this Tract were so simple, that
at the first coming of the <hi>Portugals</hi> hither to trade,
they took their Ships to be great Birds, with
white Wings, and the Roaring of their Guns to be
the Voice of the Devil; nor could they conceit
their Bag-pipes to be any thing but Living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and when they were permitted to convince
themselves of the contrary, they would not yet be
beaten out of it, but that they were Immediately
the Work of God's own Hands; yet are they ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Reverent or Respectful to their King, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds

Attendance, he was furnished with three Ships,

he would engage to return; when towards the end
of the third day they espied Fire, which they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward

Trading with the <hi>English,</hi> for Furrs, Skins, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
Corn, which they fet with a Stick, as we do
our Beans, which is the work and business of their
Wives, as soon as they have bought them of their
Parents, and Built them a House, which for the
most part is of Poles, pleated on the Sides and Tops
Hurdle-wise; and if Female Children be Born, they
as soon as they are able, go into the Field to work
with their Mother, but the Male goes along with
his Father to shoot in the Woods; and so Lazy are
the Men, that if they kill any considerable Game,
they leave it at a certain remarkable Tree, and
when they come home send their Wife to fetch it,

Mountains and Hills are Woody, or otherways
Barren, by reason of their Minerals, yet the Plains

Thunder, and Fair Weather by turns, as in other

Countries, and to supply the want of Cattle, they have
in the Woods and Mountains, a Beast like a Goat
called <hi>Vicagues,</hi> and a kind of Sheep as big as young
Bullocks; bearing large Fleeces, which they use as
Horses, to carry their burthens; but if at any time
they find themselves over-laden, neither force nor
fair means can oblige them to move forward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are alleviated, living upon slender diet,
and will sometimes Journy three days without Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and amongst Plants, the Fig-Tree in this
Country has a strange effect, <hi>viz.</hi> the North
part looking towards the Mountains, bringeth forth
Fruit in the Summer only, and the South part looking
towards the Sea in the Winter; and in this Province
grow Coco's in great plenty, whose Leaves dryed
in little Pellets, satisfie Hunger and Thirst, and
are a great part of the diet the <hi>Spaniards</hi> afford
their poor Slaves in the Mines, so that it is said
100000 Baskets full of them have been devoured
in a year at the Mines of <hi>Petosia;</hi> and a plant
they have, by which they try sick Persons, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they will live or dye, for if the Patient look
chearful when it is fast grasped in his hand, then
is it a sign of Recovery, but if sad, the contrary;
and have Beasts called a <hi>Huanacu's,</hi> the Males of
which stand Centinals upon the Mountains, whilest
the Females descend and feed in the Valleys; and
if they perceive any man approaching them, they
give warning, by making a terrible noise; and
hastily running to their assistance, interpose their
Bodies till they make their retreat; and many
other things are found worthy of note; and the
whole Province is divided properly into three juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical

whereby they might acquaint themselves with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts of the World, but that they labour to
keep them so still, that they through Ignorance
may the better brook their Yoak; however they
are couragious and industrious, fearless of Death,
animated to contemn Life in hopes in the other
World to live in Luxury and Riot, and injoy deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
Women; so that when any of their Chiefs or
petty Princes die, some of his Servants willingly
submit to be Buried with him, that they may wait
upon him afterward; some of them dwelling in
the most Mountainous parts, go half naked; but
the rest have long Mantles reaching to their heels,
though in dressing their Heads they differ, each
having a peculiar Fashion: And to guess at the
Riches of this Country by some part of it, 'tis
affirmed, that the Mines of <hi>Petozi,</hi> discovered in
the year 1545. afforded for the Kings Fifth's pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to his Exchequer 111 Millions of Pezoes of
Silver, every one valued at <hi>6 s. 6 d.</hi> of our money,
and yet a third part of the whole was discharged
of that payment; and in some parts as much Gold
is digged as Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for the Rivers of most
note, they are St. <hi>Jago, Tombez, Guagaquil,</hi> and
others of lesser note. The Towns are principally
<hi>Carangues, Peru, Cusco, Andreo, Truxilo, Archidona,
Baeza, Lima, Collao, Potozi, Plata, Chiquita,</hi> with
others; but to draw to a conclusion of this rich
Province, we need only say for a further Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
that when <hi>Atabalaba</hi> was overcome by
<hi>Pizarro</hi> and his <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he gave (besides what
infinite Sums the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had plundered before)
for his Ransom, a large Room full of Gold piled up
to the Ceiling; yet this prevailed not with those
Unchristian like Christians, for falling out about
the sharing, and willing to conceal it from the

their Oaths and promises, Strangled that poor

perfidy, God was not slow in punishing them all
that were concerned in it, dying a miserable and
untimely death: And in this Kings Pallace at <hi>Cusco,</hi>
all his Utensils were of Gold and Silver, even to
his Kitchen Furniture, and in his Ward-robe were
found Statues of Giants, the Figures of Beasts,
Fish, Birds, Plants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in their proper shape

               <p>The People in this Tract nearest the Line, are of
a reasonable Understanding, wearing Apparel,
but further off they are Barbarous, both Men and
Women going stark naked, gladly eating Humane
Flesh, insomuch that when they can privately catch
any of the Christians, they Roast them, and invite
all their Friends, feasting on the Flesh, with great
Merriment; and here the Women are wonderful
quick, and easie at Child-bearing, never lying by it,
but in two or three days seem as well as ever: Beasts
are found in this Tract of strange forms; one with
the head of an Ape, the Body of a Man, and the
feet and paws of a Lyon; a Plant they have called
<hi>Copiba,</hi> the back of which being slit, affords a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Balm, which is so well known by the Beasts of
the Forrests, that when they have taken in any
Poison, or are bit by Serpents or other Venemous

to their own discretion, and every one may sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

have for Offenders, is only in case of Adultery and
Murther, for which when proved, the Criminal
makes an Expiation with his Life; the poorer sort
are allowed but one Wise, and the rich two or
three; not owning any God, but either not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding

Samana,</hi> St. <hi>Salvador, Le Triangulo,</hi> St. <hi>Vincent,
Dominica, Anguila,</hi> and some others, scarcely taken
notice of by Historians, as for the most part not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited,
yet visited frequently by the Neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Islanders, upon the account of the wild Cattle
and Fruits found in them; and for the conveniency
of the Fishing Trade. And upon these Coasts of
<hi>America,</hi> are lately setled two Colonies of <hi>English,</hi>
in <hi>Pensylvania</hi> and <hi>Carolina,</hi> very prosperous and
thriving: But not having more room for a further
Description, we must, after having thus far proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
put a period to this our History of the Universe.</p>
