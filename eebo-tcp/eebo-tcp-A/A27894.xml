            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Few words in true love written to the old long ſitting PARLIAMENT, who Are yet left alive, and do ſit there now in the Parliament Houſe at VVESTMINSTER.</head>
            <p>WHo would have thought ſuch a thing that ever the lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſitting Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> who appeared once bold with open face, for God and his poor ſuffering peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to remove oppreſſion and injuſtice, ſhould have had ſo much of Gods countenance towards them, as to have full freedome to ſit again to do the work for God and his people that was ſo long neglected, that the Lord was wearied with their long ſitting to ſo little purpoſe, &amp; ſo they were thruſt out as a ſtink in his noſtrils, and a burthen to the nation. Oh friends you may well remember what a cry was heard at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> about the time of your firſt ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, for Juſtice, Juſtice, and how farr the ſence of this reached your hearts, and how far in the ſence of it you were vigorouſly carried on to proſecute it by the ſame arm of power, that reached your hearts and gave you a ſence of it, to make you willing to ſet your ſhoulder to the work of God and his people, to which end you were called thither, and therein the preſence of God was with you,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59329:2"/>
as you may remember after a ſhort time, eauſing your enemies to fly before you when none perſued them, who were in enmity through oppreſſion and injuſtice againſt the God of juſtice, and his people that cried to him and you for it, and herein as in truth of heart you appeared united with joynt conſent to throw down and root out oppreſſion and oppreſſors, ſurely it cannot be forgotten by you; how often Gods powerful preſence appeared for your protection and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and was a terrour to the adverſaries of Juſtice and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and then it was in your hearts to act ſingly for the Lord and the good of the Nation being touched with the ſence of Gods dreadful preſence and his fear which moving in your hearts put you upon a deſire then to deny ſelf, doubtleſs in the whole work, and to that end that the integrity of your hearts might appear to all that feared the Lord, that their hands and hearts might joyn with you and be ſtrengthned againſt the common adverſary of Juſtice, a ſelf denying Ordinance was put forth by you, that it might be manifeſt your hearts were upright and not ſelf ſeeking, which I did then believe was real in your hearts, when you were low in the time of your ſtraits, and I remember it did refreſh me to hear it, and it reached the hearts I ſuppoſe of thouſands to be knit to you, and joyn with you as on man, againſt the known enemies of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: But alas friends: when your ſtraits were over and the temptation appeared to draw you from the ſimplicity of truth and righteouſneſs, to rule in your own particulars, to deny ſelf, as you had in the time of your ſtraits ſet forth, then you left looking to that which preſerved your hearts ſingle to deny ſelf, (Gods preſence) and looked to the temptation, &amp; joyned to ſelf &amp; went out from the preſence of God, which formerly had moved in your hearts to deny ſelf, &amp; ſo there you loſt his preſence, even then when I heard that you had given gifts to one another, of that which was the Kings, which was the peoples right, which in your Ordinance you had denied; I was ſadded at my heart, &amp; I know it was an ill ſavour over al the Nation &amp; farther too, &amp; here receiving gifts one of another, which you had no right to give not receive, your eye came to be blinded that ſhould have ſeen the thing that was juſt to proceed to do it, and your hearts hardned from Gods fear, and ſo the ſence of oppreſſion and in juſtice began to be loſt, and then how could you proceed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it from off the nation when you your ſelves were gone into it? joyned in doing the thing that was unjuſt, in one body that did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly oppreſs before you, ſo here was no way for you to do good for the Nation, in removing of oppreſſion except you had returned to Gods preſence, that which gave you a ſence of the oppreſſion in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59329:2"/>
others, adverſaries to the good Old Cauſe, to give you a ſence of your own turning aſide, from that which was juſt in your own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, that ſo being ſenſible of your own evil in giving and taking that which was not your right, but the poor Nations right, to have had eaſe from oppreſſion by: I ſay had you not ſhut your eye, and cloſed your ears, that ſhould have ſeen and heard the cry of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in your own particulars, the weight of it might have been felt through the preſence of God, to have moved it in your own particulars, and then the ſame that gave you a ſence of the weight of the thing that is unjuſt in your ſelves, to remove it might have carryed you on, with your eye open and your ear open, to ſee and here the cry of injuſtice through the Nation, having the freſh ſence of it upon your owne hearts, where the cry was heard in your own particulars to have removed it from off the Nation where ever, you had heard of it or ſeen it in the Nation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I charge and warn you in the dread of God, from a deep ſence of the evil you are fallen into, and brought upon the Nation, by your turning aſide and doing the thing that was juſt and right in the ſight of God (to deny ſelf) there, I ſay I charge you in Gods dread begin to root out the thing that is unjuſt in your own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, which you have given and taken, which was and is the Nations right, and come to be lead by that righteous Principle which once moved in you to deny ſelf, wherein the preſence of God was, that it may rule in you to give up to the Nation that which you have received, which is their right, and prove the Lord with this, if in the ſimplicity of your hearts you ſhall be made willing toſu bject your ſelves to his will, to deny your ſelves, wherein ſelf ſtood up and bore rule in you to take that to your ſelves which was not yours, but ſhould have ſtood in the counſel of God cleer of it: I ſay if you give up this, prove if you ever find ſtraitneſs in Gods preſence to be with you, when you are not ſtraitned in your own bowels, from doing the thing that is right in his ſight, firſt in your own particulars, and then as the Lord ſhall diſcover what is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and oppreſſive th ough the Nation, then to root out and throw down, that likewiſe by the ſame preſence of Gods arm and power that hath rooted up and thrown down the unjuſt thing in your own particulars; here was the breach and the loſs to you of the preſence of God, and as in truth of heart, you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin here you will feel the healing of the breach, and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to bleſs guide and preſerve you as in the uprightneſſe of your hearts you are willing to goe on to eaſe the Nation of oppreſſion and injuſtice, which the cry of it is greater and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59329:3"/>
much lowder in the ears of the Lord, then it was when you were firſt called to fit, to conſider how to caſe the people of this Nation from under the burthen of it.</p>
            <p>And now bear with me a little and I ſhall plainly tell you how the ſenſe of your evill doings came to be now at your firſt fitting freſh upon any heart, and that it was plainly good in the ſight of God, I ſhould thus lay it before you.</p>
            <p>When the Warrs began in this Nation, through the unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs of the Rulers of it to be ſubject to equity and Juſtice, then I deſired (my trade failing) to be imployed in ſome ſervice for the Common-wealth, towards maintaining my ſelf and family, ſo for a ſeaſon I was imployed at the fortifications about the City, my allowance as an Overſeer of that work was three ſhillings a day, which I was glad of and well content with; for ſometime but being in company with others, that would delight themſelves to goe and drink ſometimes, with the Workmen, more then was meet, which was other Overſeers, which were corrupt, one of the Workmen told me as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that when they ſpent moneys ſo, the Overſeers he knew did not ſpend it upon their own charge, but upon the Common wealths, I ſaid how, ſaid he, do not you know, they can ſometimes ſet down a man more then they imploy, or at leſt if that cannot ſo well bee, to ſet down for ſome two pence a day or ſo, more then I gave, ſo here by ſubtilty I was betrayed, and my minde led out to deſire more then my allowance which in that ſervice wherein I was unfaithfull, as I remember it came to about ſix pound that I took more then my allowance in the deceit of my heart. Now all the while I was acting unrighteouſly, I had no peace with God, for his preſence I went from, which ſhould have preſerved me out of the thing that was evill in his ſight, and ſometimes I had trouble in the thoughts of the evil I had proceeded in, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unfaithfull to my truſt, but I got over the trouble and went on in the deceit of my heart to do evill, ſo that my eye was blinded that I did not ſee the evill to be ſo great, and my heart hardned through cuſtome of finning, that I went on without much remorſe, ſo that work ſeaſing, being finiſhed, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obtained to be imployed at the Cuſtome houſe, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe aboard on ſhips, which I was by oath bound to do ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in faithfulneſs: now when I was firſt paſſed on that ſervice I had ſome dread of God upon me, and did proceed in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, to diſcharge my truſt, and as I ſtood in his dread I
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59329:3"/>
was preſerved from joyning with thoſe that were imployed with me that were unfaithful, knowing then that I reaped nothing but ſadneſs of heart in my former unfaithfullneſſe in the other imployment, ſo then as I ſtood in the Counſel and dread of God, I ſtood firm as an Iron Pillar in the power of God, which did preſerve me out of temptations, that I could ſlight the bottles of Wine was brought, and what was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe offered to enſnare my heart being ſingle, but by degrees being amongſt the wicked, and going out from the integrity which ſhould have preſerved me, turning from the ſimplicity and looking to the ſubtilty of the Serpentine wiſdome in others, which would uſe arguments to perſwade me, to do that for them wherein I ſhould be falſe to my truſt, ſaying what vvas my oath, vvas it not to be faithfull to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Wealth in the du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y of Exciſe; and vvas not I one of the Common Wealth, that deſerved to have more allovved me then I had, and if I did take ſomething and let others have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in taking ſome monyes of them to let them have it, what wrong did I to the Common-Wealth, ſeeing we were Members our ſelves of it, and had a right to it more then thoſe that look more for leſs ſervice, to inrich themſelves as the Cuſtome and Exciſe, Commiſſioners for ſetting ſome of them a few houres in a day had each of them many hundreds a yeer, not doing ſuch ſervice as I did.</p>
            <p>And their Maſters, meaning you, could give ſo much to one, and ſo much to another, which I appeal to your conſciences, if it were not truth, ſo if I did not take it and let others have a part, others with you, ſuch as you would diſpoſe of what you pleaſed, to your own ſelf-ends, and where then was the benefit of my truſty ſervice to the Common-Wealths good. So that through your ſubt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l wiſdom of the fleſh, which is Earthly, my heart turned from its integrity, and joyned with the enemy of it, which did betray meer ſelf joyning with the temptation, to gain ſomething to it, I loſt the wiſdom which ſhould have lead me to deny ſelf, wherein the true gain which is durable riches, (Peace with God loſt.) Thus through your evil example, the evil partie in the heart of fleſh, going on in deceit, being through your evil doing encouraged, led me aſtray from God, for I thought then, according to my vain imagination, that if you could do ſuch great things againſt your Truſt and be guiltleſs, that I might do ſmaller matters with freedom: and ſo went on in unfaithfulneſs to my Truſt, (and an unfruitful work of darkneſs) for which I taſted Gods ſore diſpleaſure, for in his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

But before I knew this, I went on long in impenitency, under plagues and judgements, that I became even a ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Another time it was in my heart, that it was ſuitable to my unfaithfulneſs, to get the Pillory ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Exchange, and there ſtand voluntarily with the Money that I had taken unjuſty, that I might there have ſtood an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to be a warning to others never to do the like wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, another time it appeared good to me to have paſſed to the Cuſtome Houſe at the 12th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> houre, when many people would be there, and then declare to them there the evill of my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and there to return the Money I had badly received, that they all there might take Example my me. But after a long ſeaſon, I was wearied with my wickedneſs, and through judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments was broken off from receiving moneys any longer, when any one offered it unto me, for the ſpace of about a yeer before I left that Imployment. About the ſame time there came to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> ſome young Men out of the North, which were called Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, one of my acquaintance askt me if I had heard them. I ſaid I had heared them once, yea but ſaid he, hear them five or ſix times, and then judge whether it be not truth that they

declare. I ſaid to him it is like I ſhould, or to that effect. So I paſſed to one meeting or two, but I had not received any thing that reached my h art, but going to another meeting, at the Place called the Bull and Mouth in <hi>Martius</hi> London. There were three of the Servants of the Lord, Miniſters of the Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Goſpell, <hi>George Fox, Francis Howgill,</hi> and <hi>Edward Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowghs;</hi> and one of them was ſpeaking of the Croſſe of Chriſt, which whoſoever will be Chriſts Diſciple muſt deny himſelf, and take up daily; Said one of them, that vvhich croſſeth the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall minde is the Croſſe of Chriſt, the Carnall minde ſaid he, is Enmity againſt God, as any one comes to ſtand in the Croſſe, which croſſeth the Carnall minde, which is the Povver of God, the partition Wall of Enmity comes to be broken down: and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiliation witneſſed, the Enmity being ſlain by the power of God, which is (ſaid he that ſpake) that which croſſeth the carnall minde which the Light. Now I hearing theſe wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ds ſpoken, the Witneſſe of God in my heart anſwered, that this was true, for thought I in my ſelf, the light which diſcovers ſin and checks, for it, checks for that which the Carnall minde would run into, now as the reproof of Wiſdome there is hearkned to, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, vvhich is the Light, which vvord is a light to the feet of the ſoull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is taken heed to, to guide out of the paths of Death, and Condemnation, which the Carnall minde, would go out from God which is light into, to do the deeds of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I knew as the light which is the Croſſe to the carnal minde, is taken heed to and ſtood in, the Death muſt needs come upon the carnall minde, and the ſin ceaſe to be committed, and ſo the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition wall of Enmity would be broken down by the Croſſe to the carnall minde, ſo then, an entrance into Gods Kingdom was miniſtred to me, and plainly diſcovered before me, and my eye vvas opened, to ſee the working of the Miſtery of Iniquity in me. My heart being in Meaſure turned to the Lord, deſires vvere raiſed up in me, to vvait upon the Lord, in the light, vvhich I knew then had often convinced me of ſin: that I might feel the power, God breaking down the Partition wall of Enmity in my ovvn particular, vvhich through ſin and tranſgreſſion I ſaw, was ſtanding in me. So the firſt great ſin mine Enlightened Eye fixed upon, was unfaithfulneſs to my Truſt; And my trouble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan afreſh, in remembrance of that, and Gods Witneſſe aroſe in me to teſtifie aginſt me, that the partition Wall of Enmity was not broken down in me in the ſin of unfaithfulneſs to my Truſt, and that I vvas not cleer in his ſight, in that particular: Though

the Judgements and Terrour of the Lord had rooted out, and driven me from the Practiſe of ſuch vvickedneſs, yet ſomewhat did ſtill remain to be removed, in that particular, and it vvas made plain to me, vvaiting in the light, that it vvould be good in the ſight of God. To deny my ſelf, and to give up to the death of the Croſſe, the ground of the Partition vvall of Enmity, vvhich vvas Covetouſneſs in me, and to give in freely vvhat I had unjuſtly received, to the Commiſſioners of the Exciſe in Broadſtreet, under vvhom I had been imployed at the Cuſtome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe: that it might be given out by them, with the reſt of monies that vvas there received for the ſervice of the Common-Wealth, vvhoſe it vvas and not mine, ſo having much trouble upon me, being loath to part vvith ſo much; vvhich truly then, vvas neere if not full half I had in the Outvvard; having a vvife, and five children, to provide for, and not freedome to keep my Imployment any longer, being convinced it vvas oppreſſion, the Exciſe then an no neceſſity of it; And that I ought not be a ſervant to any in oppreſſion. So the tryall of my faithfulneſſe to ſtand in the Croſſe to my carnall minde, and deny ſelf in this thing, vvas great and much trouble I vvas under for ſome time, through my unvvillingneſs, to give up ſelf, to be ſlain on the Croſſe to my carnall minde, and then a ſervant of the Lord, <hi>George Fox</hi> coming to my houſe, I told him in part how it was with me, and he ſaid to me, he that confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſin ſhall finde mercy, and I ſaw his heart was lifted up to the Lord in prayer for me, which was heard, and my groaning was not hid from him, ſo the Lord reached down hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> right arm of Power, and touched my heart with his grace, and long ſuffering, and made me willing to ſubmit to his will, deny my ſelf, and give up to the Commiſſioners for Exciſe the ſum of money I received unjuſtly, vvhich vvas made plain to me, waiting in the light, to be neer one hundred and fifty pound, but it lay on my heart to reſtore more rather then leſſe, and ſo I was made free by the power of the Lord, and did give back, at the Exciſe Office <hi>London,</hi> one hundred and ſixty pound. So then I felt the Truth of the words <hi>George Fox</hi> ſpake to me, he that confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſin ſhall finde mercy. For much eaſe, peace, and ref eſhment I received into my ſoul from the Lord, in my obedience to the power of his Grace, in the croſs to my will in that thing: Giving praiſes to his pure holy Name for evermore. Now knowing the terrours of the Lord for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs to my Truſt, which let that of God in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences

For I being turned to it, it wrought in me an awe and dread of God leaſt at any time I ſhould offend with my tongue or do any evill action, and ſo thereby came under Gods diſpleaſure, ſo reading ſome books of thoſe peoples putting forth, who are called Quakers, I could not find any thing in them contrary to truth; ſo ſpeaking with one that had heard thoſe people, he asked me what I thought of them, for his part he ſaid, he did beleive that what they declared would ſtand, when all elſe would fall, and he asked me if I believed that thee and thou to one perticular Perſon was truth I ſaid yea; ſaid he then, if I did not come into obedience to what I was convinced of to be Truth, <hi>I</hi> muſt come under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, I ſaid it was truth: So then knowing a ſtay to my minde, the Light it became a bridle to my tongue, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me in the word, Thou, in heart and tongue ſingle to the Lord, and redeemed me out of the Worlds words into Truths Word, which is &amp; was from the beginning, Thou to one perticular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
