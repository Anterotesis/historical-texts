            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Coffee-house is free to all Comers, so they have Humane shape, where a Liquor made of an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabian</hi> Berry called <hi>Coffee</hi> is drunk. Six or seven years ago was it first brought into <hi>England,</hi> when the Palats of the English were as Fanatical, as their Brains. Like Apes, the English imitate all other people in their ridiculous Fashions. As Slaves they submit to the Customes even of <hi>Turky</hi> and <hi>India.</hi> Doth the French-man wear Feathers in his Hat, and Pantaloons to hide his strad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? Believe it, the English-man will be <hi>a la mode de France.</hi> With the Barbarous <hi>Indian</hi> he smoaks Tobacco. With the <hi>Turk</hi> he drinks Coffee.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:45679:3"/>
               <l>The English-man, might he himself misplace,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Herb.</hi> with some little alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</note>
               </l>
               <l>Sure to be crosse, would shift both feet and face.</l>
            </q>
            <p n="2">2. These capricious Islanders, of the Hop, Malt, Cock, China, Rash-berry, and other ingredients, make and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as many and as various sorts of Drink, as they amongst them have Sects and Opinions. They drink as much Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, as its native Countrey produceth. 'Tis said, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure down a greater quantity of Wine, (called Canary.) than the <hi>Canaries</hi> afford. All Countries send in hither their several sorts of Wine and other Liquors. This variety of drink satisfies not the voraginous Palat of the English. Even the Deserts of <hi>Arabia</hi> are ransackt for a Berry, which made into a drink, is as thick as puddle-water, and so ugly in colour and tast, that Poets hereafter will undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly choose it, as the best resemblance to describe the <hi>Sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi> Lake by. Oh Heavens, how do the English Palats differ from those of more sober Nations? These preserve Snow to temper their Liquor with, those gulch down Coffee even boyling in the Dish, more eagerly, than an almost <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>arved Dog doth lick up Pottage, just then taken from the fierce fire. In time (sure) the English-man will swallow down burning Coals.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Coffee is a Dryer, and therefore with successe is drunk by those Gentlemen, who are infected with the French-pox, which is now become the Characteristal dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the plumed Nobless and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoon. Alas, Vertue is a pedantical and vulgar quality.</p>
            <p n="4">4. 'Tis extolled for drying up the Crudities of the Stomack, and for expelling Fumes out of the Head. Excellent Berry! which can cleanse the English-man's
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45679:3"/>
Stomak of Flegm, and expel Giddinesse out of his Head. Yet it is certain, that for the small space of an hour or thereabouts it hath expelled out of an English head and Stomack these infirmities. But after such a little interval, they return again. And the house being thus swept and cleansed, seven Devils enter it. For Physicians say, that Coffee causeth the <hi>Meagrim</hi> and other Giddinesses in the Head, &amp;c. Of this dayly experiment may be made: For if you set Short-hand-writers to take down the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the Company, who prattle over Coffee, it will be evident on reading the Notes, that the talk is extravagant and exactly like that of the Academians of Bedlam, and such, as any others, would be asham'd of, but themselves.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Coffee makes no man drunk. But for this, it is no more to be commended, than a Neates-tongue, a dish of Anchovaes, or a salt Bit, which never yet intoxicated any man. For Coffee being mixt with the more drying smoak of Tobacco makes too many run to the Tavern or Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house to quench their thirst, which they cannot satisfy, till out of their gorged stomacks, they send up rich Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to <hi>Liber Pater.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. This forein Liquor in truth qualifies the Vapours of Wine, which makes your Good Fellows resort thither to heat their Stomacks made cold and infirm by their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving powred thereinto too too much Wine, and thus they inable their weak Stomacks to receive a new <hi>Load.</hi> But hereby in part may be made a Judgment of the good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of this place. O Heavens! how well will the Barrels of Herings (imposed on these houses) agree with Coffee.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Coffee being dry, in proportion, dryes up the Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45679:4"/>
moisture. By constant use thereof, a man becomes,</p>
            <q>—ad unum Mollis opus—</q>
            <p>The other Sex hath just cause to curse the day, in which it was brought into <hi>England;</hi> Had Women any sense or spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, they would remonstrate to his Majestie, that Men in former times were more able, than now, They had stronger Backs, and were more Benevolent, so that <hi>Hercules</hi> in one night got fifty Women with Child, and a Prince of <hi>Spain</hi> was forc'd to make an Edict, that the Men should not repeat the act of Coition above nine times in a night, for before that Edict, belike Men did exceed that proportion; That in this Age, Men drink so many Spirits and Essences, so much Strong-water, so many several sorts of Wine, such abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Tobacco, and (now at last) pernicious Coffee, that they are grown as impotent as Age, as dry and as unfruitful, as the Deserts of <hi>Africk.</hi> Having remonstrated this, they then would (were they wise) petition his Majesty to forbid Men the drinking of effeminating Coffee, and to command them instead thereof to drink delicious Chocolate.</p>
            <p n="8">8. 'Tis the Interest also of Women to have this drink damn'd, lest the Men bereave them of one of their most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and appropriated Qualities, that is Garrulity and Talkativeness. In this Age Men tattle more than Women, and particularly at the Coffee-house, when the number hath been but six, five of them have talkt at one time. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany here have out-talk'd an equal number of Gossipping Women, and made a greater noise than a Bake-house. Men are here born down by clamour, which resembles at times the noise of the Cataracts of <hi>Nilus,</hi> but alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles a School, fill'd with Children, every one conning his Lesson aloud.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:45679:4"/>9. Here Men carried by instinct sipp muddy water, and like Frogs confusedly murmur Insignificant Notes, which tickle their own ears, and to their inharmonious sense, make Musick of jarring strings. <hi>Hic fluvius Verborum, vix gutta Mentis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. In this confused way of gabbling the Coffee-drinkers fondly imagine, that they make a better Consort, than four and twenty Violins. They run from point to point, from one subject to another, as insensibly and as swifty, as <hi>Polewheel</hi> runs division on the Base Viol.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The day sufficeth not some Persons to drink 3. or 4 dishes of Coffee in. They borrow of the night, though they are sure, that this drink taken so late, will not let them close their Eyes all night. These men are either afraid to be alone with themselves, or they to excess love Company, so that they never set apart any time to converse with themselves. This ill-tasted Liquor (by what charms I know not) makes Men to neglect and forsake themselves; for</p>
            <q>
               <l>Who cannot rest, till he good Fellows find,<note place="margin">Herb.</note>
               </l>
               <l>He breaks up house, turns out of dores his mind.</l>
            </q>
            <p n="12">12. At this place a man is cheated of what is, by far more valuable than Mony, that is, Time. A constant Companion of this House going in all haste for a Midwife, or to save the life of a Friend then dying, must call in, and drink at least his two dishes of Coffee and his two Pipes of Tobacco. And which is yet more wonderful, many persons prefer Coffee, (and the Company, which love it) before the gain of money, for many men neglect their Callings and Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to tattle away their time over two or three dishes of Coffee.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Here is no respect of persons. Boldy therefore let any person, who comes to drink Coffee sit down in the very
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45679:5"/>
               <hi>Chair,</hi> for here a Seat is to be given to no man. That great privilege of <hi>equality</hi> is only peculiar to the <hi>Golden Age,</hi> and <hi>to a Coffee-house.</hi> However even here, a small portion of Wit, gilded over with an Estate, hath an influence. Mony! <hi>Thou art the Man, and Man but Dross to thee.</hi> Or with <hi>Iuve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> I may say,</p>
            <q>—O nummi vobis hunc praestat honorem Vos estis fratres—</q>
            <p>So also is it here in respect of Titles; Children do not more for a time value their Babies, than Titles are for a while here gazed on. Even a — as such, gains as good an opinion as the place is capable of. Light-things weigh much in those Scales, which are here used, <hi>Heavy,</hi> little or nothing. Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Vertue are every where used, as fanatical —</p>
            <p n="14">14. Such is the humour of the Coffee-meetings, that that person shall gain more love and respect, who gives to the Company a Suger-plum, than he who bestows gifts more befitting men to receive, and he who hath attained the Art of making an agreeable <note n="*" place="margin">by words.</note> addresse to the Company, and knows, how by empty Complements to flatter them into a good opinion of themselves, or to tattle to them little pleasing things, shall assuredly thereby insinuate himself into their good opinion more than if he discoursed to them of the most Profitable Subjects with the deepest Judgment.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Very critical and very discerning is the Assembly here. The Company within a very short while will look thorow and thorow the Prudentest and most cryed-up Person. A Weak part will quickly be found in him, and not only Real but Imaginary Faults will be laid to his charge. A Man of Reputation is so tender a Creature, that he should in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner alwayes keep within dores, and never come into the Air, unless chosen, and cleer. But by all means let him beware of the Coffee-house, for here there is alwayes a thick smoak, which will sully a fair colour. In plain terms, an assiduous
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45679:5"/>
frequenting the Coffee-house, and exposing reason, parts and estimation, by conversation, to the open view of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, renders them hereby first familiar, then contemptible. Here a man too late will be taught, that the most excellent Jewels, to wit, the Noblest Speculations, the D<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vinest Truths, the most Exquisite Fancies, the most Meritorious Actions, and the most Complacential Humours prodigally thrown away amongst a mixt number of persons, become as common, as Gold was once in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that is, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as Stones.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Such is the mixture of Persons here, that me thinks I cannot better express it, than by saying, That at these Waters meet all sorts of Creatures. Hence follows the Production of diverse monstrous Opinions and Absurdities. Here is a congress of old <hi>Rome</hi> and of new, of <hi>Turky, Geneva,</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam.</hi> A Coffee-house, like Logick, the Lawyer, and the Switzer, will maintain any Cause.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Infinite are the Contests, irreconcileable the Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces here. The Society hath been divided about the manner of the creeping of a Louse. Were there not here, a constant contention amongst the Elements of this Body, it could not subsist. <hi>For should all agree, and be of one Iudgment, they would as it were become but one Person, the House would be solitary, and at last one or two Persons would be the whole Company.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="18">18. However, though it resemble <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> being divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into innumerable different Opinions, yet is it free from effects of Sedit on or War. For there are no bloody Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges here made, much less Duels fought, or Blows given. Will you know the reason? The Company in this are more Couragious than wise, that they contend about triffles only, but they are more Wise than couragious, in that they fight not for the Victory: so that in a true sense the Lion and the Lamb ly down together here.</p>
            <p n="19">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:45679:6"/>19. Such being the differences of Opinion, and such the Tameness of the Company, how can any one in reason, think, that a Coffee-house is dangerous to the Government, that seeds of Sedition are here sown, &amp; Principles of Liberty insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated? A Coffee-house hath alwayes been as great a Friend to Monarchy, as an Enemy to Liberty. The Principles of a Popular Government at the <hi>Rota</hi> were weakne'd, and rendred contemptible. Men of such Contrary Judgments as here meet, cannot justly be feared to Agree in a Conspiracy. And in truth they talk too much, to be lookt on as dangerous, and active Persons.</p>
            <p n="20">20. Rather say the Fanaticks, that this is not a place in which a great and generous Truth can be maintain'd, that a Person full of such a Truth, not being able to contein it, is forc'd to whisper it in the ear of some Ingenuosus, if he can find such a one. This is certain, that who ever intends here to discourse of Worthy Subjects judiciously, ought carefully not only to chuse his Time, but to pack the Company, that so he may be heard but with patience.</p>
            <p n="21">21. On the other side, who ever is troubled with imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Fancies and ridiculous Notions, is here quietly heard and sometimes heraunged. The Relater hereof hath heard a young Gentleman affirm, that he used to go to the Coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house purposely to vent his strange and wild Conceits, and to rid himself of such bad Guests. An opinion, how foolish or fond soever, here receives entertainment. To this Coast, as to the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> you carry not rich Merchandises to Trade with, but only Beads, Looking-glasses, Knives, and such like, nor shall the Merchant make returns of any other Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, than such as are fit for the Pedlars box.</p>
            <p n="22">22. Though the Coffee-house may be condemned for ill choice of subjects, on which they discourse, yet are the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany by many persons commended for this, that every one of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45679:6"/>
them abounds in his own sense, and submits to the reason of no other Mortal, following herein that great Example of the Men who inhabit the Lunary World, who put the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur in a Cage, for discoursing like a Parrat in the words of <hi>Aristotle.</hi> Every one over Coffee discourseth those things, which his own reason or fancy inspire him with, and he, who cants in the terms of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or argues by Book, is lookt on to want terms and reason of his own, <hi>&amp; jurare in verba Magistri.</hi>

            <p n="23">23. Yet here being neither Moderators, nor Rules, (were there no other reason) a Man shall as soon fill a Quart Pot with Discourse, as Profit by it. He may as rationally expect to carry a Ship from the River of <hi>Thames</hi> to the <hi>East-Indies</hi> without a Pilot or Rules of Navigation, as to manage a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course successefully, or in this School to bring it to a good Issue.</p>
            <p n="24">24. A School it is without a Master. Education is here taught without Discipline. Learning (if it be possible) is here insinuated without Method. Good Manners and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Humors are here infused into Men by the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Deformity of their contrarie's, as the <hi>Spartars</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused into their Children hatred of Drunkenness by setting before them their drunken Helots.</p>
            <p n="25">25. The Company, (that their intertainment man appear in its native colours) at times divert themselves with the controverting such points as these.</p>

            <p n="26">26. A facetious or merry Story is preferred by the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men here before a Banquet of Philosophy. The Auditors

lissen to him, who tells a Tale gracefully, with as great an attention, as <hi>Orpheus</hi> his Beasts did to his Charming Musick. And good reason such a person should be attentively heard.</p>
            <q>—nam quae comoedia? Mimus Quis melior?</q>
            <p>One relates he took thirty and three thousand Pipes of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco in one night. He tickles the Auditors. They laugh heartily. Another informs the Company, that the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having swallow'd a vast quantity of Ale, he slinkt home, and crept into Bed, and that in the midst of the night he was wak'd by an Alarum made in his Guts by reason of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection therein. Hereupon he riseth to expel the Rebel, but his weighty A— being too ponderous for an earthen Chamber-pot to bear, the Pot broke, and his A— unluckily fell on the bedighted ground. At this Story the Company laugh <hi>majore cachinno.</hi>

Yet all the Elements here being confusedly mixt, this House ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to him as a meer Chaos, so that (in contemplating it) he cannot prefer even Light before Darkness, not being here separated or distinguishable one from another, amidst confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion it self.</p>
