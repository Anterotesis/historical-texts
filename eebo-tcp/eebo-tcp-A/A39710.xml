         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
Epistle Dedicatory,
To all his
NOBLE FRIENDS.</head>
            <p>THere is none Prints
more, nor publishes less
than I; for I Print one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for my self and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Friends (and had
I not thought these more passible than
the rest, I had never made them so
publick as I do.)</p>
            <p>I write chiefly to avoid Idleness,
and print to avoid the Imputation:
and as others do it to live after they
are dead; I do it onely not to be
thought dead whilst I am a live: (for
as the concealing what one does, little
differs from <hi>Idleness,</hi> so the being <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:54695:3"/>
little differs from being <hi>dead.</hi>)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epigram</hi> in general, is a quick
and short kinde of Writing, rather a
<hi>slight,</hi> than any great force of the
<hi>Spirit;</hi> and therefore the more fit for
me, who <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> not to take pains in any
thing, and rather affect a <hi>little neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,</hi>
than <hi>too great curiosity</hi>
(which I desire may serve for excuse
of my negligence in some of these.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epigrams</hi> at their first institution
served onely for Inscriptions of
<hi>Ports,</hi> and <hi>Entries</hi> of <hi>Temples,</hi> and
<hi>publick places,</hi> and consisted onely
in a <hi>Distick,</hi> or <hi>line or two;</hi> till at
length, by degrees, they became so much
enlarg'd, both for <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>quain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,</hi>
as there was nothing that was
not matter of <hi>Epigram,</hi> and no
length it woud not admit of, so it
kept but close unto the matter, with
that l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se and quickness which was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
and essential to it; and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oided long discourses, which
is <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> improper for it, as a long Robe
for one who is to run a Race.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54695:3"/>
For these here, they are chiefly in
praise of worthy persons, of which none
had ever a more plentiful subject than
I, having been always conversant with
the best and worthiest in all places
where I came; and amongst the rest
with Ladies, in whose conversation,
as in an <hi>Academy</hi> of <hi>Vertue,</hi> I
learnt nothing but <hi>Goodness,</hi> saw
nothing but <hi>nobleness;</hi> and one might
as well be drunk in a Christial Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
as have any evil thoughts whilst
they were in their Company. Which
I shall gladly always remember, as
the happiest and innocentest part of
all my life; and that they are mixt
with the dispraise of others, 'tis one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as <hi>sawce</hi> unto the rest, which shud
always have somewhat of sharp
piquant in it.</p>
            <p>I was long deliberating before I
publisht them, whether I shud range
them in order, or let them pass pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misculously,
till at last (to save the
<hi>Heralds</hi> labour) I resolv'd on this
latter way, onely I have separated
<pb facs="tcp:54695:4"/>
the more <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Theatical</hi> ones,
and the more <hi>Grave</hi> and <hi>Pious</hi> ones
from the rest, as being particularly
subjects of themselves.</p>
            <p>Of which <hi>Pious</hi> ones, this I will
onely say, that <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Devtion,</hi>
Consisting chiefly in moving the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
Verse</hi> seems the fittest lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
for it, and of all <hi>Verse,</hi> that of
<hi>Epigrams:</hi> it being a short <hi>Jaculatory,</hi>
kinde of writing, and therefore the
aptest to penetrate the brest, it is that
which strews the way of <hi>Vertue</hi> and
<hi>Piety</hi> with <hi>Roses</hi> insteed of <hi>Thorns:</hi>
and one reason why no more are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
with it, is because it is no
more delightfully perswaded; and
then it was when <hi>Verse</hi> was wholly
imployed in <hi>Devotion,</hi> that <hi>Poetry</hi>
was called the <hi>Language of the Gods,</hi>
your <hi>Poets, Prophets,</hi> and such as
<hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were <hi>Poets:</hi> nor
will it ever be well with the World,
till things return to their first insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
and <hi>Poets</hi> take as much pains
to render <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi> delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb facs="tcp:54695:4"/>
as now they do <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Impiety.</hi>
Whatsoever they are, they are yours,
for I have made them for you, and to
dedicate them to any one in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
were to do injury to the rest, take
them amongst you then, for 'tis but
just, that I should Dedicate all I have
to you, to whom I have dedicated
my self.</p>
