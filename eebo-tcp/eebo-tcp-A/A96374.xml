            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MY Service to you, wiſhing all happineſſe; On the
18 of May inſtant, the Hollanders Fleet conſiſting of
42 ſayl of ſtout ſhips, all men of war) came by the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and lay by the Lee of the South-fore-land, and from
thence ſent two of their Fleet into the Downs to Major
Bourn, who was then Admiral (Gen. Blague being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent)
the Captains of thoſe ſhips comming aboard our
Admirals ſhip, deſired leave of him to anchor their ſhips
in the Downs; the Admiral asked them why they came
into our ſeas with their Flags up, ſo near our Navy; they
anſwered they had orders not to ſtrike their flags to any
they ſhould meet with; whereupon, the Major anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, that within two days time they ſhould know
whether there was room enough for them to anchor in or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118197:3"/>
not; yet notwithſtanding this, the Hollanders anchored
in Dover Road, and rode there till the 19th. About two
of the clock in the afternoon, Major Bourn came out of the
Downs into Dover Road with 10 ſail, and Col. Blague
from the reſt with 13 ſail more; the Dutch Fleet ſeeing this
weighe anchor, and ſtood up to the coaſt of France with
their Flaggs up, near upon two hours, and then bore up to
Gen. Blague, each ſhip having a man at the top maſt head,
as if they intended to have ſtruck their Flags, when they
came within ſhot of our Admirall, he made one ſhot at
them for to ſtrike but they refuſed ſtill coming towards
him, whereupon he made two ſhot more at them, and then
the Hollanders gave him one ſhot, ſtill making nearer to
h<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m, and comming up to him, ſaluted our Admirall with a
whole volley of ſmall ſhot and a broad ſide of gunſhot, and
Col. Blague returned him the like, and bearing up after him
they two charged three or four broadſides at each other,
1, of the Hollanders gave our Admirall each of them a
broad ſide, before any of our ſhips came up to ſecond him;
then the Generall of Foulſton came up between the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers
and our Admirall, and gave them a breathing time;
and in an hours time the ſhip called the Triumph came up
to them, and fell up into the whole Fleet. About ſixe of the
clock at night the Dutch Admirall bore away, and Gen.
Blague after him; but Van Trump went better then our
Admirall, inſomuch that he could not come up with them
but followed them within ſhot till nine of the clock, in
which time, the Hollanders had ſo ſhattered our Generals
ſails and rigging, that they had neither ſheets, tacks, nor
brace, and his fore-ſail was all torn in pieces; by means
whereof Van Trump ſailed away, and all his Fleet after
him; onely one of our Frigots boarded one of them, who
had 150 in her; whereof 50 were ſlain, and the reſt woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118197:3"/>
and taken: we alſo ſhot another Dutch ſhip main Maſt
over board, and took her, ſhe having 37 guns in her, but
finding ſixe foot of water in her hold, we onely took out
the Captain, and two more and left her not able to ſwim,
but ſunk ſhortly afterwards.</p>
            <p>In this fight we had but 18 ſail engaged, becauſe ſome
could not get up time enough; alſo one of our fleet had
but two guns, the Grey-hound was of no great foree, and
two more were but Catches would do no good. Our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall
received 200 ſhot, ſome of which did execution, and
many of their own ſhot; we loſt 8 men in the Admiral, five
ſlain out right, three dead ſince; and had twenty wounded;
In the Reuben there was three men ſlain; in the Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
two; in the Victory two, and in the Fairfax one, the
Garland Entrance, and the Worceſter frigot loſt not one
man, but the Dutch loſt four times our number in the
two ſhips that were taken; beſides what they loſt in that
which was ſunk. The Generall ſaith ſome men did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
at all, and therefore deſerve to be looked upon as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving
men.</p>
            <p>Our ſhips are all now (God be praiſed) ſafe in the
Downs, and have brought in two Hollanders, one of them
thought to be an Adviſer. I was aboard our fleet in the
Downs and there came ſix Hollanders that were Marchant
men, within a league of our fleet, whereupon a Frigot of
ours came up to the Admiral, and asked leave to fetch
them in; but the Admirall anſwered that they were men
about honeſt occaſions, and he had no order from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of State to meddle with them, and ſo let them paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their occaſions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:118197:4"/>
While I was aboard the Admiral, there came a
Dutchman of War, ſuppoſing it to be Van Trump,
but the Speaker Frigot quickly fetcht him up, and
brought him in to our Fleet.</p>
            <p>There are 36 of the Hollanders ſhips that enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with our Fleet in the aforeſaid fight, that ride
about Deep, every one of them being about<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1000.
or 1500. Tun, moſt of them pittifully torn and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
and many of them without either Maſt, Sails,
or Flags; having loſt the company of their Admiral.</p>

            <p>I Cannot but intimate unto you ſome Particulars
of a bloudy beginning of an unhappy Breach
between the Engliſh and the Dutch Fleet, though
perhaps you may have it more fully then we, yet
I ſhall impart what I have ſeen. Tueſday, Martin
Vantrump came before this Town, and rode in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118197:4"/>
Road at anchor with his Fleet, being 41 ſail of good
ſhips of War, not a ſmall ſhip amongſt them till
Wedneſday at noon, with his Flag on the main top,
at which time ſome ſhot was ſent from the Caſtle
and Fort, to cauſe him to ſtrike (as is the cuſtome)
but he would not. At which time General Blake
with his Fleet appeared, being in all 25 good ſhips,
of which, 7 of the old Navy ſhips, and the reſt were
Frigots, and other ſhips of good defence. On ſight
of them, the Dutch tack'd about, and ſtood in with
the Engliſh Fleet, and Trump himſelf very boldly
ſtood up with Gen. Blake with his Flag aloft, and
comming near, the Admiral ſhot at a diſtance from
him (as is the cuſtome) to make him ſtrike, and ſo
at ſecond and third time ſhot at him and hit him. To
whom Trump anſwered with one Gun without
ſhot; then our Admiral ſhot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. or 4. upon which,
Trump came up and gave him a whole broad ſide,
and in ſtead of pulling down his Flag, put up a red
Flag under the former, and having received the like
ſalute from the Engliſh General, the Fleets on both
ſides did deſperately engage, ſo that there was the
hotteſt diſpute for the time, that hath been this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years, between two ſuch Fleets, and was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by knowing men that it would not end ſo long
as a ſhip on both ſides could ſwim on the water. But
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118197:5"/>
it pleaſed God better to diſpoſe thereof; for it began at 4
of the clock in the afternoon, and ended at paſt 9 at night, it
being dark that they could not know one another. The
Flemming ſtood off towards the French Coaſt, and our
ſhips anchored about the place, and in the morning the Dutch
were gone. Our ſhips came up this morning with their
whole Fleet, having not loſt one, and have taken one from
the Dutch, and have ſunk another; It was thought their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
could not but ſink: Juſt now is come a collier from
France that met them laſt night; He ſaith, That they have
never an Admiral amongſt thew, nor any Flag or Enſign out
amongſt them all.</p>
