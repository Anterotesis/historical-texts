            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Authour had prepared his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Traveller to wait upon you in this Summers Recreations; but ſome of the chief Workmen in the Preſſe being ſick, he could not ſet forth till now; yet any time he will be ſeaſonable, being filled for Summer-dayes and Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nights, This advantage you have by the ſtay, that the Work comes forth moſt correct from the Preſſe, and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete in divers parts from the Authour. And if it be lawful for us (who do kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And though the Book aymes at your Recreations, yet there are many <hi>Jocoſeria</hi> ſprinkled here and there, which will pleaſe more ſevere judgements, ſo that the Book will prove to you <hi>omnium horarum libellus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I leave you to hear <hi>Democritus</hi> himſelf, who doth speak ſufficiently both to the merry and to the ſerious Reader.</p>

Perhaps the concealing his Name, will make you gueſſe what you think he would be aſhamed to tell you, that this was ſet out by ſome
<pb facs="tcp:106915:6"/>
poor Scholar to patch ſome poor living. And this concerns not the Reader to know, unleſſe he have a minde to be generous, and to give more to the Authour then he need give for the Book. You may well think that if the Authour made this honeſt ſhift for his own profit, to gain that he muſt write what may be to the pleaſure and ſatisfaction of the Reader.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Democritus</hi> knows not how to fit you better for your Times of pleaſure, your <hi>Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys or Recreations,</hi> then with a <hi>Companion;</hi> nor to qualifie his companion fitter then with <hi>wit</hi> and <hi>mirth;</hi> nor to furniſh you with more matter of wit and mirth then by ſuch <hi>ſhort Stories</hi> and <hi>choice ſpeeches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe come in when men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be pleaſed, and when
<pb facs="tcp:106915:6"/>
pleaſure is ſeaſonable. In a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney a Fellow-Traveller will crop the way and make ſhort miles. I have heard of one ſtory that hath reached from <hi>Oxford</hi> to <hi>Exceter;</hi> though the ſtory was long, yet it made the way the ſhorter; and hence how farre three hundred ſtories well managed may reach, you may <hi>gather.</hi> A merry compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion on your way (to fill up the Title) <hi>pro Vehiculo eſt:</hi> He is in ſtead of a Coach if you want one, and he is as good as your Coach if you have one. And then reckon, what a gain hath Father <hi>Sparges</hi> (who will not be at char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of a Scholar or merry Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion) in buying of this Book.</p>
            <p>But to entertain ſo many gueſts as <hi>Democritus</hi> hath invited, he conſidered he muſt be at more coſt then his Dinner; He muſt have a Feaſt, that in the variety
<pb facs="tcp:106915:7"/>
there may be a diſh to pleaſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very pallat, and grand-Diſhes and grand-Sallets to pleaſe the moſt. And here if you ſort your ſelves to your own Tables with your own company, He is much miſtaken if the chear do not like you. He knows wit and mirth muſt pleaſe. No man diſlikes wit but he that wants it, and none will confeſſe that. In a jeſt they that underſtand not where the wit lyes yet laugh for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, or will give their humme or grave nodd unto it. And for mirth, he muſt be a man of a ſtrange temper, as unwelcome to himſelf as to others, whom pleaſantneſſe doth diſpleaſe. There will need no proof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Honey be ſweet, it will be enough to taſte it.</p>
            <p>And care is taken that the wit and mirth be ſo innocent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive
<pb facs="tcp:106915:7"/>
as not to diſpleaſe the beſt gueſts. Some there are of corrupted ſtomacks, who do moſt relliſh broad and obſcene Jeſts, thinking that ſavoury which is rotten; but here all froth is ſcummed off, and all things that ſmell are caſt aſide and left in their own ſinks, not to be brought in before you: Others love bitter ſawc'd and ſawcy Jears; but the Sawces here, though ſomewhere ſharp and tart, yet are not harſh and ſowre, gratefull not grating to leave an heart-burning (as they call it) behinde them. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers there are who finde a ſweetneſſe in rank and rammiſh, rude and ruſtick Jeſts; Such <hi>Herculean</hi> ſtomacks which can digeſt Bull-Beefe are not for theſe Tables, which are ſpread for men of a more cleanly diet.
<pb facs="tcp:106915:8"/>
And others are of ſuch high and curious Pallats, that all their wit and ſport is with pride and ſcorn. But here is no mocking of Nations or Profeſſions; here is no ſcoffing at perſons who are to be pittied, no abuſing of him who is already abuſed by a baſe woman; no laughing at him whom Nature hath bowed and humbled, or at any ſuch men whom thou maiſt be like with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any fault of thine. There will be Wit and Mirth enough though theſe be pared of, and though there be no more then what the Title promiſeth, <hi>Clean and Innocent. Democritus</hi> could not obtain of himſelf to write you any other; and his Gueſts will at laſt be better pleaſed when there is ſet before them nothing but what is wholſome as well as toothſome.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:106915:8"/>
This care being taken, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus</hi> needs not be aſhamed of his Name or a Dedication; and he thanks God and man he wants not ſome Perſons of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to whom he might preſent this. He now commends his <hi>Fellow-Traveller</hi> where he will be ſure to be welcome, to all thoſe good houſes where him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath had free and kinde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment in his Pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: for he ſpeaks it in a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full acknowledgement of thoſe Right hands of Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that he hath had the good hap not common to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers; he hath found <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Hoſpitia, &amp; multas Amiciti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as:</hi> And more eſpecially theſe three parts are due to three Noble Hoſts and Land-lords, where he hath ſit a Tenant
<pb facs="tcp:106915:9"/>
Rent-free, and whoſe Houſes have been his Home and Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, with a great deal of love and reſpect, which God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. And among theſe there is one Honoured Friend who may lay claim to a part, and a Name in this Book as well as <hi>Democritus;</hi> becauſe from his hands was received a rare Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, out of whom others have borrowed a few, but you have many of the beſt of our modern Motti's.</p>
            <p>Some may be fit to know more of <hi>Democritus</hi> his minde in another place, but this is as much as he thought fit to tell all <hi>England</hi> concerning himſelf or his Subject. And now much good may it do you, fall to heartily and be merry. But let <hi>Democritus</hi> bargain with you as
<pb facs="tcp:106915:9"/>
well as with his Stationer, or if you pleaſe beg of you to grant a few eaſie Requeſts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe who can diſcover <hi>Democritus</hi> through his diſguiſe, or have the wit to know the way to him by the Title-Page, they are to ſend to <hi>Democritus,</hi> (if they pleaſe, and if they can) the notice of ſome Book of this kinde which they think he hath not ſeen; or at leaſt two or three ſtories in ſtead of that; and let them not be vulgar; for his pallat is grown ſo dainty by taſting ſo much Sweat-meats, that no mean ones will ſerve his turn.</p>

            <p>Theſe are <hi>Democritus</hi> his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes;</hi> and a world of benefit is built upon ſuch little things. And in magnifying theſe <hi>Democritus</hi> doth not hyperbolize but ſpeak meaſured Truth; and but for ſwelling the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle,

only eſcaped to land; Now ever ſince the Bat fearing creditors, keeps cloſe all day, and walks only ſome few ſhort turns at night; And the Bramble is catching at every paſſenger to get ſome more cloth; and the Cormorant follows the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhores fiſhing for his living and watching what the Sea will caſt up.</q> The Morall of this Fable you muſt not look for out of your boyes books, for they that affixed thoſe Morals have ſeldome reached the wit of <hi>Eſop.

The third and worſt ſort of men who are figured by the Bramble, are thoſe that live by ſnatching, as Theeves, Robbers, Pirates, mercenary Souldiers, quarrelſome Sollicitors, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, and all ſeditious perſons, who ſit upon other mens skirts, and are ready to rent and tear all they meet.

thoſe moiſt vapours occaſioned by the South-winde in cloſe places, as Churches, Cloyſters, &amp;c. where Marble is, cannot pierce the Marble as other poroſe bodies, and ſo making ſtay upon the ſtone are by its cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe condenſed into drops.
