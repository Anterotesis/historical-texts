            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But why must these be call'd <hi>Catholick Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?</hi> Are they written by some <hi>Catholick Bishop,</hi> to give an Account of his Faith, according to the Custom of the Antient Church? Is it, that the Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them is undoubtedly <hi>Catholick?</hi> So far from it, that I shall make it appear, that no one Church of the <hi>Christian World</hi> ever own'd it. But, suppose, it had been the Doctrine of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> how could this make them <hi>Catholick Letters,</hi> unless so great a <hi>Logician</hi> had first proved, that a Part may assume the <hi>Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the whole? But then, why not, <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Letters</hi> according to the new Style? There was a Reason for this. <hi>J. S.</hi> hath not forgotten, how hardly he had lately escaped Censure at <hi>Rome,</hi> for the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples contained in them; and therefore though he hopes they may pass for <hi>Catholick</hi> here, yet he durst not joyn <hi>Roman</hi> to <hi>Catholick</hi> in the Title of his Letters.</p>
            <p>But how comes <hi>J. S.</hi> to be concerned in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie with Mr. <hi>G.</hi>? The Account he gives of it in the beginning of his <hi>First Letter</hi> is very pleasant. He saith, <hi>He accepted a Commission from Mr.</hi> G. <hi>to hold his Cards, while he is not in Circumstances to play out his Game himself.</hi> I will not examine Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s. <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,</hi> nor <hi>the Game he plays at</hi>; but methinks, this is no very decent way of expressing the undertaking a Debate about <hi>Matters of Faith and Salvation.</hi> But in Truth, he makes the business of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> as he handles it, to be a Matter of <hi>Sport</hi> and <hi>Diversion</hi>; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all his <hi>Grimaces</hi> and <hi>Tragical Expressions</hi> about it. It is hard to be severe upon a Metaphor; but, suppose it be allowed; yet I wonder, of all Men,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66277:6"/>
he should pitch upon <hi>J. S. to hold his Cards for him,</hi> who had plaid his own so ill, and so much to the dissatisfaction of the leading Men of his own Church. Yet he now appears as brisk and confident, as if he were some <hi>New Gamester</hi>; although he produces his <hi>old sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied Cards,</hi> (a little wiped) over again; and seems to have forgotten the Answer to his <hi>Sure Footing,</hi> and the Accompt he still owes to the World for it. I know not, how far it agrees with the Laws of <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Chivalry,</hi> for one, who hath not defended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, to appear a Champion for another, especially in the same Cause; but there is no great Reason to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend he should do much for another, who hath done next to nothing for himself.</p>
            <p>The main Subject of the Debate is, about the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Grounds</hi> of the <hi>Certainty of Faith</hi>; and the Method I think most natural and effectual to proceed in, is,</p>
            <p n="1">I. To shew how unfit <hi>J. S.</hi> of all Men, is to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this Cause.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To settle the true State of the Controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us.</p>
            <p n="3">III. To examine the Reasons he produces against our Grounds of Certainty.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. To lay open the weakness of his Arguments, on behalf of the Infallibility of <hi>Oral</hi> and <hi>Practical</hi> Tradition.</p>
            <p n="1">I. As to <hi>J. S.</hi> his appearing in this Cause again, we are to consider, that in his <hi>Catholick Letters,</hi> he frequently owns <hi>Faith vindicated, Reason against Raille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Errour nonplust</hi>; and even <hi>Sure Footing</hi> it self. But I shall now shew, that he disowned the main Principles in those Books, when he was in great danger
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66277:7"/>
of being Censured at <hi>Rome</hi> for them; and therefore is not to be allow'd to produce them again. The Account of this Matter will give great Light into the <hi>state</hi> of the present <hi>Controversie,</hi> and is therefore neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be premised to it.</p>
            <p>Out of those Books of <hi>J. S.</hi> a considerable Person in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> selected three <hi>Propositions</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Grounds</hi> of his <hi>Infallible Certainty,</hi> which were these;</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">Faith vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, <hi>pag.</hi> 13.</note>I. <hi>That he who is obliged to profess Faith propositions true, must see the Connexion between their Terms, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, that they cannot be unconnected, or false.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">Faith vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, <hi>pag.</hi> 41.</note>II. <hi>If the two Terms be not seen to be connected, these Propositions may, nay ought to be denyed by the Respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, whose Office and Right it is to grant nothing but what is evident, lest he ensnare himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">Errour Nonplust, <hi>pag.</hi> 135.</note>III. <hi>'Tis requisite and necessary, that the Assent of Faith in divers particular Believers be formally Infallible, or that those Persons be infallibly certain by evident Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that the Authority or Rule of Faith they rely on, cannot herein deceive them. Else great Wits, and acute Reflecters, whose piercing Vnderstandings require convictive Grounds for their Faith, would remain for ever unsatisfied: nor would the wisest Christians sincerely and heartily as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to, nor with honesty profess the Truth of their Faith, nor could any prove it true, or establish rational doubters in it, or convert Men of exact knowledge to it, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Hereticks, calling the Truth of it in question. Nor could Governors and leading Persons with any Conscience or Credit propose and preach the Truth of Faith to the Generality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:66277:7"/>These Propositions were tender'd to two Doctors of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> who declared,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Haeres. Blakloan.</hi> p. 37, 38.</note> 
               <hi>The First could not be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Catholick Sense</hi>; and therefore very unfit for <hi>Catholick Letters. For if</hi> (say they) <hi>a Person sees the Connexion between the Terms, it would be Science, and not Faith; it is enough to see them not to be contradictory, or that the Connexion is not repugnant to Reason. Divine Faith is above, not contrary to Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Second, they agreed, <hi>That neither could that be explained in a Catholick Sense, because it is destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of Faith, and a Proposition ought not, cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, although the Respondent hath not Evidence of the Terms of which it consists; when he otherwise knows the Church (which Faith</hi> [not Demonstration] <hi>teaches to be Infallible in Matters of Faith) to propose as a Truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the Third, they say, <hi>That it cannot be explained in a Catholick Sense: Because it is sufficient that the Church be believed by Faith to be Infallible, and it is not requisite that the Infallibility of the Church be proved by evident Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See here the main Design of his <hi>Catholick Letters</hi> declared to be no <hi>Catholick Doctrine</hi>; which is to prove that there must be Infallible Certainty by Conclusive Evidence of the Churches Infallibility. And if this be not <hi>Catholick Doctrine,</hi> I am infallibly certain his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are far from being <hi>Catholick</hi> in their Sense.</p>
            <p>One of these Doctors writes to the A. B. of <hi>D.</hi> That <hi>the Natural Sense of the Propositions could not be Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; and that all Bishops were bound to suppress this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, lest it did mischief to the Flock of Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 39.</note> 
               <hi>And that the A. B. of</hi> Paris <hi>would revoke his Licence, if the Author did not retract them, as he hoped he would.</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:66277:8"/>
What? Retract the Substance of his <hi>Catholick Letters!</hi> Is this possible? And yet again publish the same Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as <hi>Catholick</hi>! This is indeed very <hi>surprising.</hi> But so it was. For the A. B. of <hi>D.</hi> averrs, <hi>That</hi> J. S. <hi>confessed the Propositions to be Heretical,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 39.</note> 
               <hi>yea very Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi>; but he said, <hi>they were not taken in his sense</hi>; which the other said, <hi>was a ridiculous Plea.</hi> He granted, that <hi>J. S.</hi> might <hi>contradict himself,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 40.</note> but there was no colour for saying <hi>the Propositions were not taken in their true sense.</hi>

            <p>This Doctrine of <hi>J. S.</hi> was complained of at <hi>Rome,</hi> and a <hi>Congregation of Cardinals</hi> was appointed to Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it,<note place="margin">

And therein they took notice, that in his <hi>Vindication</hi> sent to them, <hi>he detested that Doctrine as Heretical,</hi> viz. <hi>that the Evidence of the Connexion of Predicate and Subject, and the Evidence of the Rule of Faith by which the Believer may be infallibly certain he cannot be deceived, is necessary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Faith.</hi> I desire the Reader to mark this <hi>Declaration</hi> which <hi>J.

            <p>But it is worth our while to shew with what a <hi>double Face I. S.</hi> appeared in his <hi>Vindication</hi> and <hi>Complaint,</hi> sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and in his <hi>Books</hi> which he published here.

            <p>Let now any indifferent Person compare those As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions together: If <hi>Moral Certainty be Vncertainty, and destroy the Essence of Faith,</hi> how can it <hi>be absolutely suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to Faith?</hi> But besides <hi>the Contradiction</hi>; he hath by this one Assertion overthrown the whole Design of his <hi>Catholick Letters.</hi> For, if <hi>true Faith</hi> may be had without <hi>Infallible Certainty,</hi> what need any such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending about it? For the Ground of the Dispute is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout such <hi>Faith</hi> as is <hi>necessary to Salvation</hi>; and if <hi>true Faith,</hi> as <hi>J. S.</hi> grants, which is necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, may be had without their pretended Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; there is no Colour left for pressing Persons of our Communion to forsake our Church, because we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have <hi>Infallible Certainty</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> when themselves grant that we may be saved without it. And what <hi>Sincerity</hi> is to be expected from such a Man, who makes such out-cries upon us, for want of <hi>Infallible Certainty</hi> for Faith, when himself Confesses, that <hi>Moral Certainty is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to Faith?</hi> what ever becomes of <hi>Moral Certainty,</hi> I love <hi>Moral Honesty</hi>; and I cannot see how it is consistent with it, to make such mighty pretences to the Necessity of <hi>Infallible Certainty</hi> for Faith, even in his <hi>Catholick Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> (which seems to be the chief Design of them,) when
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66277:12"/>
himself had declared to the Cardinals at <hi>Rome,</hi> that less than that is sufficient for true Faith. But the secret of it is, he knows well enough, there is no such Necessity for <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Certainty</hi>; and when it will bring him off, he can own it; but among us <hi>Hereticks,</hi> they must <hi>bluster</hi> and make a mighty noise about it; because it startles weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicious People; and they find nothing so apt to terrifie and confound them like <hi>Infallibility</hi>; which like a <hi>Flash of Lightning</hi> doth not help them to see better, but strikes them down with Horror and Astonishment.</p>
            <p>And here I might fairly stop and send the Reader to <hi>J. S.</hi> for an effectual Answer to his own <hi>Letters</hi>; or at least to shew; how very unfit he was after such going forward, and backwards in this matter, to undertake this Cause.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

                  <hi>First Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> pag. 4.5, 6.</note> but it is a plain and evident Proof of our <hi>Certainty</hi> upon their own Grounds. For, if <hi>Tradition</hi> be such a Ground of <hi>Absolute Certainty,</hi> as they assert, and we have <hi>a larger and firmer Tradition for Scripture, than they can produce for the Points of Faith in difference between us</hi>; then it is evident we must have, upon their own Principles, a <hi>Ground</hi> of <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> for our <hi>Faith</hi>; which was the main Point of the Conference.</p>
            <p>If he will Answer the Argument, he must either deny <hi>that we have Vniversal Tradition for the Books of Scripture,</hi> or that <hi>Vniversal Tradition</hi> is a <hi>Ground</hi> for the <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> of <hi>Faith?</hi> Either of these ways he had said something to the purpose; but he found this way of Reasoning too hot for him; and therefore, he calls it <hi>Shifting and Tricking off the Proof to Mr.</hi> G. and so falls into a <hi>Tragical Declamation</hi> against <hi>my not proving, and making a Secret of the Ground of our Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>; as if a Man intended to make a <hi>Secret</hi> of a Horse he had lost, when he published his <hi>Marks</hi> in the <hi>Gazett.</hi> Here is the <hi>Ground</hi> of our <hi>Certainty</hi> laid down in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place, where he saith, <hi>I shift off the Proof to Mr.</hi> G. but alas for him! He cannot see any thing like a <hi>Proof,</hi> unless it be serv'd up, with all its due formalities of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, Minor</hi> and <hi>Conclusion.</hi> Must I be forced to tell him, as the Painters did by ill Pictures, <hi>This is a Horse, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66277:15"/>
this a Wolf?</hi> This is an <hi>Argument,</hi> and this an <hi>Answer?</hi> It is a hard Case if a Man cannot understand Reason, unless like <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s Jests against <hi>Cardan,</hi> there be something in the Margin to direct where they are to be found. All Men of Sense understand the force of an <hi>Argument,</hi> though it be not dressed up after the way of the <hi>Schools</hi>; and to tye Men up to those Methods of <hi>Reasoning</hi> in our Age in Books of Controversie, is like <hi>Trammelling</hi> a Horse, when he is to go a Journey; it might do well to teach him to pace, but it would be ridiculous, when he is upon Service.</p>
            <p>Upon this he runs out into a very Eloquent piece of Trifling, making sad Moans and Complaints with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Exaggerations, and great variety of Phrases, <hi>As if I offer'd no kind of Certainty to Mens Souls, but only that I bid those that doubt prove the contrary</hi>; and so brings notable parallels <hi>of</hi> Peters <hi>having twenty pounds in his Purse, because</hi> Paul <hi>cannot prove he hath it not; or his having the more Title to an Estate, because an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary may have the ill luck to be Nonsuited.</hi> I know not how Mr. <hi>G.</hi> will take these things; for they do not seem much to his Advantage. If I were as he, I would never trust him <hi>to play my Cards</hi> more; for what means this insinuation of <hi>Nonsuiting,</hi> &amp;c? But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mistaken, for the force of it doth not depend upon his bare <hi>Nonsuiting</hi>; but upon the <hi>Goodness</hi> of the <hi>Deeds,</hi> and the <hi>Strength</hi> of the <hi>Evidence,</hi> which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self relied upon, and appear much stronger for us than for him.</p>
            <p>It is not <hi>Pauls not proving,</hi> but <hi>Peters producing the twenty pounds,</hi> and laying it before him, which is the <hi>Argument</hi> to prove he hath it. Suppose he did not produce it <hi>in Specie,</hi> but shewed good <hi>Security</hi> for it, such as <hi>Paul</hi> could not deny, had he not reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66277:16"/>
he was owner of it? There being so little colour in the Reasoning Part, I pass over the Declamatory, as fitter for the School at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> than a Writer of Controversies.</p>
            <p>But here comes in, among his Flowers, a very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Point of Divinity. <hi>Truth is therefore Truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is built on Intrinsecal Grounds which prove it to be such; and not on private Mens Abilities, or their saying this or that.</hi> This latter is undoubtedly true, and is universally believed, since the School of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> was broken up: <hi>Wherefore till those Grounds be produced, it cannot be with Reason held Truth.</hi> This is great; and becoming the <hi>Scientifical I. S.</hi> But will he hold to this? Will he own it to the <hi>Cardinals</hi> of the <hi>Inquisition?</hi> I find a certain Gentleman with the very fame Letters, <hi>J.

the Primitive Times? How might the poor Innocent Christians have pleaded for themselves;
<q>That they could see no <hi>Intrinsic Grounds,</hi> which made <hi>Truth to be Truth</hi>; and they understood from a deep <hi>Divine,</hi> that <hi>till those Grounds be produced, it cannot with Reason be held Truth</hi>; and if it cannot with Reason be held, it may surely in our very hard Circumstances, with Reason, be denied, or at least concealed and dissembled. There seems to be more danger in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing the Faith without it; than in not owning it, <hi>being not able to produce Intrinsic Grounds for it.</hi> And these are far above our reach and capacity; and if it cannot with Reason be held Truth without it, it seems very unreasonable to require us to dye for it.</q>

               <note place="margin">Page 6.</note> He tells me, <hi>that I know well enough, that to prove Protestants have no Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Certainty of their Faith is no hard Task even for a weak Man; I know,</hi> he saith, <hi>that any Man may find it confessed to his hands by Protestants</hi>; and in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin he cites, <hi>Dr.</hi> Tillotsons <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> pag. 117, 118. I wonder at Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s.

So that <hi>J.

            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:66277:17"/>I hope now we shall come to the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Question</hi>; for he charges me with perverting it: <hi>The First Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi> (he saith) <hi>at the Conference, was, Whether Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants are absolutely Certain, that they hold now the same Tenets in Faith and all that our Saviour taught to his Apostles.</hi> And my Answer, he saith, was, <hi>They are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By his favour, my Answer was not in those words, <q>but that we are absolutely certain that we now hold all the same Doctrine that was taught by Christ and his Apostles.</q>
And for a certain Reason, I desire my own Words may express my Mind; for I do not find <hi>Oral Tradition Infallible</hi>; and where Words are varied, the Sense may be so too.</p>
            <p>But he observes, <hi>that I trick it off again,</hi> as he calls it, (I suppose it is Gamesters Language,) <hi>from the Point of Absolute Certainty of Faith, to Absolute Certainty of the Rule of Faith,</hi> viz. <hi>the Scripture; but our Saviour and Protestants believe more than that the Book so called, is Scripture. Is Certainty of this</hi> more, <hi>and Certainty of this Book, all one? Here is then an enquiry after one thing, plainly turned off to another.</hi> It seems Mr. <hi>G.</hi> is quite gone for a <hi>Gamester</hi>; for he discerned <hi>no Tricking</hi> in this matter, nor can I. It is very true, we do believe <hi>More,</hi> than that the Book so called is <hi>Scripture</hi>; for we believe <hi>All</hi> the Matters of Faith contained in that Book. And what then? If by his <hi>More,</hi> he means Articles of Faith not contained in Scripture; then I tell him plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we believe <hi>no More.</hi> And therefore when Mr. <hi>G.</hi> put his next Question, as he thought very pertinently, <hi>By what Certain Rule do you hold it</hi>? My Answer was, <hi>By the Divine Revelation contained in the Writings of the New Testament:</hi> Whereby I excluded his <hi>More,</hi> if it be not contained in Scripture. But if by <hi>More,</hi> he means our Assent to the Points of Faith contained in Scripture,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66277:18"/>
I shall give a full Answer to it afterwards. Then he asked, <hi>By what Certain Rule do you know that the New Testament, which we now have, does contain all the Divine Revelations of Christ and his Apostles?</hi> And if he puts such Questions concerning the Rule, What <hi>Tricking</hi> was it in me, to give a direct Answer to them? How did I <hi>turn off the Enquiry from one thing to another,</hi> when I only Answered the Questions he proposed? This is not <hi>playing Mr.</hi> G<hi>'s Cards,</hi> but condemning him for <hi>playing unskilfully</hi>; and desiring to begin a <hi>new Game</hi>; for Mr. <hi>G.</hi> had a <hi>bad hand,</hi> and managed it very ill.</p>
            <p>But what would <hi>J. S.</hi> have done? <hi>The thing to be made manifest by the Conference, was, the Absolute Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Protestant Faith.</hi> And so it was; for <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Faith</hi> is to believe <hi>all that is contained in Scripture, and no more.</hi> Mr. <hi>G. did indeed ask some Questions about your Certainty of your Rule</hi>; and I gave him direct An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers. Where is the <hi>Tricking</hi> in all this? <hi>But I wisely cut off the Course of the Questions before they had question'd away the Certainty of Faith.</hi> So far otherwise, that I let them alone, till they plainly run away from the business of <hi>Certainty</hi> to another Question; and then Mr. T. <hi>cut them off,</hi> by declaring himself satisfied; and asking <hi>How they could prove the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi>?</p>
            <p>But now we are to see how much better the <hi>Cards</hi> might have been plaid. And now, look ye Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the Man of Skill begins the Game. <hi>After the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Scripture from Tradition was admitted, there was no Refusing to admit that Tradition causes Certainty, and makes Faith as certain as Scripture.</hi> See the difference of these two <hi>Gamesters</hi> at <hi>Tradition!</hi> But what if I should yield him, that I will not refuse to give my Assent to any Point of Faith, which comes down to us from the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66277:18"/>
Apostles Times with <hi>as large and as firm a Tradition as the Scripture? Then</hi> (saith he) <hi>it would have proved something difficult to satisfie even a willing Man, that the Faith is certain which is opposed to a Faith come down by Tradition. Something difficult!</hi> Nay very much so, without doubt. But this is fairly to suppose, that you have as <hi>Vniversal a Tradition</hi> for your <hi>Tridentine Faith,</hi> as we have for the <hi>Scripture</hi>; but this I utterly deny; and I hope in another <hi>Treatise</hi> to shew, I have not done it without Reason. Let the Matter of Tradition itself, as a <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> be one of these Points. If there were a <hi>Constant Vniversal Tradition</hi> in the <hi>Christian Church</hi> from the <hi>Apostolical Times,</hi> that there were <hi>Matters of Faith</hi> necessary to Salvation not contained in Scripture, I grant that it would be difficult, to prove it to be a Matter of Faith that Scripture alone is our Rule of Faith. But that is the mighty Advantage of our Cause, that we have both <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Tradition</hi> for us; and that no <hi>Catholick Tradition</hi> can be produced against us, in any one Point of the <hi>Additional Creed</hi> of <hi>Pius</hi> IV. which is the Design I have undertaken, of which I shall sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly publish the <hi>First Part</hi>; and if God gives me Life and Health, I hope to go through the Rest. Well; <hi>but in the mean time, Absolute Certainty of Scripture was not the Point of the Conference.</hi> Can <hi>J. S.</hi> tell better than the Managers? His meaning is, it ought not to have been. <hi>Nor is it the Point of Concern.</hi> This is strange. Not <hi>the Point of Concern</hi> to those that own it to be <hi>the Word of God, and the only Rule of Faith!</hi> It is of <hi>Infinite Concern</hi> to us; if it be not to you, I pity you for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Besides that, it is agreed on all hands, Men are saved by Believing and Practising what Christ taught, not barely by believing Scripture is Scripture.</hi> This is no New Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66277:19"/>
But what follows from it? <hi>Therefore we ought to believe Christ's Doctrine contained in Scripture, and obey his Commands</hi>; and do I give the least Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against this? But, the Question was about our <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> and that I still think is the <hi>Scripture</hi>; and whatever is contained therein, is to be believed on that Account. <hi>But Salvation is the thing that imports us in these Disputes, and 'twere well if nothing else were minded by Disputers.</hi> And so think I too. I desire no more to end our Controversies, than to make <hi>Salvation</hi> our End, and the <hi>Scripture</hi> our <hi>Rule.</hi> But how can <hi>Salvation be the thing that imports us in these Disputes,</hi> if <hi>Men cannot with Reason hold any thing true, unless they can produce the Intrinsecal Grounds which prove it to be so?</hi> Doth Mr. <hi>S.</hi> in earnest think, that none are saved but <hi>Metaphysical Speculators,</hi> that <hi>perch upon the specifick Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Things,</hi> and dig into the <hi>Intrinsecal Grounds of Truth</hi>? If this be his Opinion, <hi>How few can be saved!</hi> But if <hi>Salvation</hi> be the End, the <hi>Means</hi> must be sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Capacity of Mankind; and I do not think, <hi>the Intrinsecal Grounds of Truth</hi> are so.</p>
            <p>But aftey all, he saith, <hi>that I stifle any further talk of the Certainty of Protestent Faith.</hi> How can that be, when I own no <hi>Protestant Faith</hi> but what is contained in Scripture, or may be deduced from it; according to the Sixth Article of our Church. I am not conscious to myself of <hi>any Art in the matter,</hi> which he charges me with; and he saith, <hi>I avoid what cannot be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> What is that? <hi>To make out that Protestants are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely certain that they now hold all the same Doctrine that was taught by Christ and his Apostles.</hi> If all that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be contained in Scripture, and they hold the Scripture by Grounds of <hi>Absolute Certainty,</hi> then Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66277:19"/>
must be certain <hi>that they hold all the same Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that was taught by Christ and his Apostles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards Mr. <hi>S.</hi> starts something that comes nearer to the business; which is, <hi>that Certainty of Faith and Certainty of Scripture, are two things: For those who have as much Certainty of Scripture as we, may have not only an Vncertain but a Wrong Faith; and therefore I am concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to shew, not only that Protestants have Certainty of their Rule, but of the Faith which they pretend to have from that Rule:</hi> That which I am now upon, is to settle the <hi>true State</hi> of the Controversie about the <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Faith.</hi> In the <hi>Conference,</hi> my first Answer was, that, <hi>We are absolutely Certain that we now hold all the same Doctrine, that was taught by Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</hi> And when the Question was asked, <hi>By what Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rule do we hold it</hi>? I answer'd, <hi>By the Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation contained in the Writings of the New Testament.</hi> So that the <hi>Certainty of Scripture</hi> was that which I was obliged to answer to. Now comes <hi>J. S.</hi> and he finds fault with Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s management; because he asked Questions about the <hi>Certainty of the Rule</hi>; whereas he ought to have gone another Way to work. So that now Mr. G. is given up, and a New Controversie is begun upon other <hi>Grounds</hi>; and the Words which I used with Respect to the <hi>Rule,</hi> are applied to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Doctrines.</hi> He saith, <hi>The Certainty of Scripture was not the Point for which the Conference was.</hi> How comes he to know better than Mr. <hi>G.</hi> unless he directed the Point, and Mr. <hi>G.</hi> mistook and lost it in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? <hi>But I am now bound to manifest, that Protestants have Absolute Certainty, not only of the Scripture, as the Rule, but of the Faith they have from that Rule, or else to own that I cannot.</hi> It seems Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s <hi>good Nature</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd him, when he asked Questions about <hi>the Rule
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66277:20"/>
of Faith</hi>; and so the main Point was lost. Yet me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks it was not meer good Nature in Mr. <hi>G.</hi> For, when we are asked, about the Grounds and Certainty of our Faith, how is it possible we should answer more pertinently, than to assign the <hi>Rule</hi> of our <hi>Faith</hi>? And we declare it to be the Scripture, by which we judge what we are to believe, and what not. And therefore if any ask us of <hi>the Matter of our Faith,</hi> we must answer, It is whatever God hath revealed in the <hi>Scripture</hi> which is our <hi>Rule.</hi> If they ask us, <hi>How we come to know these Books to be written by such Persons,</hi> we say, It is <hi>by the Vniversal Tradition of the Christian Churches.</hi> If they ask us, <hi>Why we believe the Doctrine contained in those Books,</hi> then our Answer is, <hi>From the Divine Testimonies, which make us certain that it came from God.</hi> And thus we answer both to that which is called, the <hi>Material</hi> and <hi>Formal Object of Faith</hi>; and if we are <hi>absolutely Certain</hi> of these, we must be so of our <hi>Faith.</hi> If we ask a <hi>Jew</hi> about the <hi>Certainty</hi> of his <hi>Faith,</hi> he saith, he is Certain of it, because all his Faith is contained in the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> and he is well assured they were written by Divine Inspiration. If we ask a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> of his <hi>Faith,</hi> his Answer is, That his <hi>Faith</hi> is contained in the <hi>Alcoran</hi>; and by proving that, he proves the <hi>Certainty of his Faith</hi>; and if that be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, the <hi>Certainty</hi> of it is overthrown. Those who resolve their Faith into a Written Rule, must go thither, when Questions are asked them about the <hi>Certainty</hi> of their <hi>Faith.</hi> For, if I believe every thing in it, and nothing but what is in it, there lies my <hi>Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Certainty</hi> of it depends upon the <hi>Certainty</hi> of my <hi>Rule. But I must shew the Certainty of the Faith of Protestants, as it is pretended to be taken from the Rule.</hi> Not certainly, when the Question is asked about the <hi>entire Object</hi> of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66277:20"/>
our <hi>Faith,</hi> or when we are to shew how <hi>we hold all the same Doctrine that was taught by Christ and his Apostles</hi>; for the word <hi>All</hi> makes it necessary for us to Assign our <hi>Rule</hi> wherein that <hi>All</hi> is contained. If he ask us of the Certainty of any particular Point of our Faith, then we are to make it out, that this is contained in our <hi>Rule</hi>; and our <hi>Certainty</hi> is according to the <hi>Evidence</hi> we are able to produce for it.</p>
            <p>For the Case is not the same, as to <hi>particular Points</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> with that of the <hi>General Grounds</hi> of the <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi> A <hi>Jew</hi> firmly believes all that is contained in the Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> and with the highest Degree of <hi>Certainty</hi>; but whether the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi> can be proved certainly from those <hi>Books,</hi> is a particular <hi>Point</hi>; and he may have <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> of all contained in those Books, though he may not have it, as to such a Particular Point. And when we come to <hi>Particular Points,</hi> their Case is not only different from the <hi>General Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> but such <hi>Points</hi> are very different both among themselves, and as to the <hi>Certainty</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>For, (1) There are some <hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> which were <hi>necessary to be Revealed, because they were necessary to be Believed, in order to our Salvation by Jesus Christ.</hi> For as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> saith, <hi>Salvation is the thing of greatest Importance</hi>; and therefore on Supposition, that it is to be by <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> the Nature of the thing requires, that we have a firm and established Faith in him. And of these <hi>Points of Faith,</hi> the Church hath given a Summary in the <hi>Creeds</hi> which were proposed to those who were to be Baptized; and not only St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> but <hi>Aquinas</hi> saith, <hi>these were taken out of Scripture;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2.2. <hi>a</hi> 9. <hi>ad</hi> 1.</note> and the <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> of them to us, doth depend not upon the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> proposing them; but the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66277:21"/>
               <hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> for them, which is very much confirmed to us by the <hi>Concurrent Testimony</hi> of the Christian Church in all Ages, from the Apostles times, <hi>i. e.</hi> as to the <hi>main Articles</hi>; for that there was a great variety, as to others, is evident to any one who will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the <hi>Ancient Creeds,</hi> as I have lately shewed. And these main Articles are those which <hi>Aquinas</hi> calls the <hi>prima Credibilia</hi>; which are therefore revealed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause necessary to be believed by all that hope for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. There are other <hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> which are <hi>only necessary to be believed, because they are so clearly revealed</hi>; As that <hi>Cajaphas</hi> was <hi>High Priest</hi> when Christ suffer'd; that there were <hi>two Malefactors who suffer'd with him</hi>; that he was buried in <hi>Joseph of Arimathea's Sepulchre</hi>; no Man who believes the <hi>Scripture</hi> can doubt of these things; and yet we do not make these <hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> in themselves necessary, because they have no immediate Reference to <hi>Salvation,</hi> which might have been as effectually carried on, if there had been another High Priest, or Christ had lain in another <hi>Sepulchre.</hi> But in these Points there is an <hi>absolute Certainty</hi> from the unquestionable <hi>Evidence</hi> of their being contained in Scripture.</p>
            <p n="3">III. There are <hi>doctrinal points</hi> not necessary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, about which some may attain to a greater Degree of <hi>Certainty</hi> than others. And the same Measure is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of all; Because Mens Capacities are not equal, if they do use equal Diligence; and all are not obliged to the same Degrees of Diligence that some are. As to the Points <hi>necessary to Salvation,</hi> God is not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by his Grace to make them known to Men of honest and sincere Minds. And this is no peculiar Doctrine of mine, as <hi>J. S.</hi> would insinuate, but it hath been
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66277:21"/>
the constant Doctrine of their most Learned and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>School-Divines</hi>; as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from what they speak of the <hi>Donum Intellectus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               </note> and the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Fidei,</hi> which secure Men from Errour in what concerns their Salvation. If he hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such an Inveterate Spleen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this Doctrine, let him at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taque the greatest Divines of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who have in terms asserted the same, which I have done. And I would fain see <hi>J. S.</hi> demonstrating against <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas,</hi> and all his followers, <hi>That there is no such Security from Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in Points necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where ever God bestows true Grace.</hi> As to <hi>Points not necessary to Salvation,</hi> I do not affirm, there is any such <hi>Ground</hi> of <hi>Absolute Certainty,</hi> as to <hi>particular Persons,</hi> who are only concerned as to their own <hi>Salvation.</hi> And that was the Reason of my Answer to the fourth Question.
<q>The Universal Testimony of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, concerning the Book of Scripture, and the Doctrine contained therein is a sufficient Ground to make us certain of all Matters necessary to our Salvation.</q>
But of this more afterwards. It is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient here to observe, that even in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> there are <hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which are not <hi>de Fide,</hi> and consequently the <hi>Certainty</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> is not required to them. And then it is most unreasonable to require the <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> in those things which we deny to be <hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi> It is, as if we should ask them what <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:66277:22"/>
they have, as to the <hi>Immaculate Conception</hi> and <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption</hi> of the B. <hi>Virgin,</hi> or the <hi>Popes Infallibility,</hi> they would tell us, these are no <hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> with them, and therefore it is unreasonable to ask after the <hi>Absolute Certainty of Faith,</hi> where there is no <hi>Faith</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. The same we say, in the like Case, It is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry absurd to demand of us the <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> of our <hi>Faith</hi> in such things, wherein we never pretend to a <hi>Certainty</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi>; but of common Sense and Reason proceeding according to the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Scripture.</hi> As, if Men impose false and absurd Doctrines upon us, as <hi>Transubstantiation</hi>; &amp;c. we insist upon the <hi>Common Right</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> not to be required to believe <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions</hi>; and the <hi>Right of Christians,</hi> not to believe, what hath neither <hi>Scripture,</hi> nor <hi>Reason,</hi> nor <hi>Tradition</hi> for it. And these are the <hi>Grounds</hi> on which we reject the <hi>Additional Creed</hi> of <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth. We make them no <hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> at all; and if others do make them so, we desire to be excused, because it is as certain to us they are not so, as we can be of <hi>Negatives:</hi> And farther than this we go not in such <hi>Points</hi>; and if this be what he means by <hi>Protestant Faith,</hi> he hath my Answer.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The <hi>General Reason</hi> of the <hi>Certainty</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> in Particular Persons is not from <hi>Conclusive Evidence</hi> as to the <hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> but from some higher Cause. And this Mr. <hi>S.</hi> ought to know hath been the constant <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of the <hi>Schools</hi> ever since <hi>Divinity</hi> hath been brought into them.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:66277:23"/>
               <hi>Rome,</hi> and how very different they are from those of the <hi>Catholick Letters.</hi> To summ up briefly therefore the <hi>State</hi> of this <hi>Controversie</hi> about the <hi>Certainty</hi> of our <hi>Faith</hi>;</p>
            <p n="1">I. I assert, That we are <hi>Absolutely Certain</hi> of the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Object</hi> of our <hi>Faith,</hi> viz. that <hi>whatever God reveals, is True, and to be professed by us, though we do not see the Intrinsick Grounds of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. We are <hi>Absolutely Certain</hi> of the <hi>Infallible Rule of our Faith</hi>; and that <hi>All</hi> the necessary Points of Faith, in order to the Salvation of Mankind, are therein contained-</p>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>General Certainty</hi> of <hi>Divine Faith</hi> in true Believers, according to their own Divines, doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon <hi>Conclusive Evidence,</hi> or <hi>Intrinsick Grounds,</hi> but an inward Perception caused by Divine Grace.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>Particular Points</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> are more or less <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> according to the <hi>Evidence</hi> of their Deduction from <hi>Scripture</hi> as the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. Where any <hi>Propositions</hi> are imposed as <hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> which others deny, those who impose, are bound to prove the <hi>Certainty</hi> of them as such, and not those who reject them.</p>
            <p>And this is our Case as to the Points in Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and those of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>: We do not make the <hi>Negatives</hi> any <hi>Points of our Faith,</hi> any further than as the <hi>Scripture is our Rule,</hi> and we cannot be bound consequently to receive any thing as a <hi>Point of Faith,</hi> but what is contained in it, or deduced from it. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> requiring us to receive them as <hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> is bound to prove the <hi>Certainty</hi> of them as such.</p>
            <p>Having thus endeavoured to set this Controversie about the <hi>Certainty of Faith</hi> in its true Light, I now proceed to consider what Mr. <hi>S.</hi> doth object against it. And I shall conceal nothing that looks like an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:66277:24"/>
His Raillery I despise, and his Impertinencies I shall pass over.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That which looks most like an Argument, is, what he hath set out by way of <hi>Propositions</hi> in his <hi>First Letter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God hath left us some way to know what surely Christ and his Apostles taught.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Therefore this way must be such, that they who take it, shall arrive by it at the End it was intended for</hi>; i. e. <hi>know surely what Christ and his Apostles taught.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Scriptures Letter interpretable by Private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is not that way; for we experience Presbyterians and Socinians (for Example) both take that way, yet differ in such high Fundamentals, as the Trinity and the Godhead of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Therefore Scriptures Letter interpretable by Private Judgments, is not the way left by God to know surely what Christ and his Apostles taught, or surely to arrive at Right Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Therefore they who take only that way, cannot by it arrive surely at right Faith, since 'tis impossible to arrive at the End, without the means or way that leads to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon setting down this, Mr. <hi>S</hi> being sensible he had plaid his <hi>best Cards,</hi> cannot help a little expressing the Satisfaction he had in the <hi>Goodness</hi> of his <hi>Game. I do not</hi> (saith he) <hi>expect any Answer to this Discourse, as short as it is, and as plain, and as nearly as it touches your Copy-hold.</hi> Alas for me, that am fallen into the hands of such a Gamester! But I am resolved to disappoint him, and to give him a <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>full Answer</hi> to this shew of Reasoning. And that shall be, by making it appear,</p>
            <p n="1">I. That it proceeds upon False Suppositions.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That it destroys any Rule of Faith, even his own admired <hi>Oral</hi> and <hi>Practical Tradition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:66277:24"/>I. That it proceeds upon False Suppositions. As.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That no <hi>Certainty</hi> can be attained where there is no <hi>Infallibility.</hi> For if Men may arrive at <hi>Certainty</hi> where there is a general <hi>Possibility</hi> of <hi>Deception,</hi> all this seeming <hi>Demonstration</hi> comes to nothing. And yet this is a thing all Mankind are agreed in, who allow any such thing as <hi>Certainty</hi>; and the contrary Opinion was (which Mr. <hi>S.</hi> little thinks) the very Foundation of <hi>Seepticism</hi>; viz. <hi>That there could be no Certainty, unless Men could find out such an Infallible Mark of Truth, which could not agree to what was False</hi>; as he might have learned in <hi>Cicero</hi>'s <hi>Lucullus,</hi> without sending him to <hi>Pyrrho</hi>'s Scholars. And till <hi>Zeno</hi> and his Disciples pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to find out this, <hi>Scepticism</hi> gained little Ground; but when they yielded to that Principle, That no <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> was to be had without it, then a mighty Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage was given them, which they improved accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. But the more Judicious Philosophers were forced to quit the <hi>Stoicks Infallible Mark,</hi> and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon such Evidence of Perception, and Sense, and Ratiocination, as might in things not Self-evident form an Assent which excludes all reasonable Doubt of the contrary. But still those who pretended to <hi>Infallibility,</hi> were the most deceived. As <hi>Epicurus</hi> thought there could be no <hi>Certainty</hi> in <hi>Sense,</hi> unless it were made <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi>; and from hence he ran into that gross Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, that the Sun was really no bigger than he seemed to be to our Senses. For, he went just upon Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his Principles, <hi>If there be a possibility of Deception, there can be no True Certainty</hi>; and to make good this <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> the Sun must be no bigger than a Bonfire. But the Wiser Philosophers took in the Assistance of <hi>Reason,</hi> which, though not Infallible, might give such Evidence, as afforded <hi>Certainty,</hi> where it fell short of <hi>Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> As in <hi>Physical</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> things. I grant, that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66277:25"/>
some of those who talked most and best of <hi>Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> fell wonderfully short of it, when they came to apply <hi>Notions</hi> to <hi>Things</hi>; and the <hi>Demonstrations</hi> they made were to little or no purpose, in the promoting of Knowledge, as, that <hi>Man is a Rational Creature,</hi> &amp;c. But their <hi>Physical Speculations</hi> are very far from it; yet this doth not hinder but that a <hi>Certainty</hi> is attainable as to the Nature of Things. And in <hi>Morals,</hi> they knew and confessed there could be no <hi>Demonstration</hi> in them; yet they professed a <hi>true Certainty</hi> they had as to the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Happiness,</hi> and the real <hi>Differences</hi> of <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Vice:</hi> They owned some <hi>Moral Principles</hi> to be <hi>Absolutely Certain,</hi> as <hi>that Good is to be chosen, and Evil to be avoided,</hi> &amp;c. but in particular Cases, they made use of the best Reason they had, to prove some things Good, and others Evil. And although they could not proceed with equal <hi>Certainty</hi> in all <hi>Vertues</hi> and <hi>Vices</hi>; yet in some they had clear <hi>Evidence,</hi> and in others they made use of the best means to give Satisfaction to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and others.</p>
            <p>Thus it is in <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> there are some things <hi>Absolutely Certain,</hi> as, that <hi>God cannot deceive us</hi>; that <hi>the Scripture is our Rule of Faith;</hi> but then, whether such Points be contained in that Rule and be of <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> is not Self-evident; and therefore these must be deduced by all the best Methods of <hi>Reasoning</hi> from a <hi>written Rule</hi>; and when Persons have examined the Scripture with all the Care and Diligence, which one who would arrive at <hi>Certainty</hi> thinks himself ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to, then I do affirm, that such a Man may attain to a true <hi>Certainty and Satisfaction</hi> of Mind about it. And that <hi>true Certainty</hi> is attainable without <hi>Infallibility,</hi> I shall prove by an undeniable Instance (if an Instance willl be allowed; and I hope I shall make it appear as reasonable for me to produce <hi>Instances</hi> as himself,) and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:66277:25"/>
that is, concerning a <hi>Point of Faith</hi> of the greatest Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, <hi>viz. That Jesus Christ was the true Messias fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Prophets.</hi> The Proof of this depended on the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi>; and there could be no Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Interpreter relied upon in this Case. As to <hi>Christ himself,</hi> although he really was so, yet we suppose the Question to be about him, whether he were an <hi>Infallible Teacher</hi> or not; and therefore we must not suppose the thing to be proved. As to the <hi>Publick Interpretation,</hi> which Mr. <hi>S.</hi> makes his <hi>Infallible Rule,</hi> if that were to be relied upon, then a <hi>Jew</hi> was bound not to believe Christ to be the <hi>true Messias,</hi> because the <hi>Publick Interpretation</hi> was against him; and the <hi>Traditional Sense</hi> of the <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> was against him, being for a Temporal Prince; I now demand of Mr. <hi>S.</hi> whether the <hi>Jews</hi> were capable of <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> in this Point or not? If not, then the <hi>Jews</hi> were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused in their Infidelity: If they were, then true Certainty may be had without an Infallible Guide, although the <hi>Publick Interpretation</hi> and <hi>Tradition</hi> be against it. And if it may be had in so difficult a Case, which depended on the <hi>Sense</hi> of <hi>obscure Prophecies</hi>; much more certainly under the clear Revelation of the Gospel; wherein all <hi>Necessary Points</hi> are laid down with so much clearness, that the Fault must be more in Mens <hi>Wills</hi> than their <hi>Vnderstandings,</hi> if they do not apprehend them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Second false Supposition is, <hi>That a Rule of Faith</hi> must be a <hi>Mechanical Rule,</hi> and not a <hi>Rational; i. e.</hi> It must be like a <hi>Carpenters</hi> Rule, that hath all its Dimensions fixed, and ready to be applied to Material things; but in matters of Understanding no such Rule is to be expected. The <hi>Philosophers</hi> who disputed so much about <hi>Certainty,</hi> would have laughed at any man who had applied a <hi>Material Rule</hi> to Intellectual things; yet this is Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s great Example: <hi>I take my Ruler,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Second Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> p. 25.</note>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:66277:26"/>
saith he, <hi>and draw a Line by it; does the streightness or crookedness of this Line depend upon my Vnderstanding?</hi> By no means. But is there any such <hi>Intellectual Rule</hi> as this? There have been great Disputes in the World, among Men of Wit and Subtilty, about the <hi>Certainty</hi> of Human Knowledg; Whether any Infallible <hi>Crite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi> could be found to discern Truth and Falshood? But they never imagined any such thing as an <hi>Intellectual Ruler to draw Lines by</hi>; but that there were certain Differences of Truth and Falshood, which men might find out, but not without Diligence and Application of their Minds to it. And notwithstanding the Characters of Truth and Falshood were in themselves Certain, yet it was very possible for Men to mistake about them; not only for want of Judgment, but of Diligence and Impartiality: So we say here as to a <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi>; we do not suppose it to be a <hi>Material Rule; i. e.</hi> If a Man take the <hi>Letter of Scripture,</hi> and apply it to any Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, he must presently know whether they be true or false; but it is a <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>Intellectual Rule,</hi> which is <hi>absolutely Certain</hi> in it self; and whatever agrees to it is <hi>True,</hi> and whatever doth not is false: But still there may be mistakes in the <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> and <hi>Applying</hi> it; and therefore <hi>Care,</hi> and <hi>Diligence,</hi> and <hi>Impartiality,</hi> are required; by which some may attain to that <hi>Certainty,</hi> which others miss off. As in the <hi>Points</hi> he mentions of <hi>the Presbyterians and Socinians differing about such high Fundamentals, as the Trinity and Godhead of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Why <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> I beseech him? There is a notable Insinuation in this, as though we of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> were <hi>Socinians</hi> in those Points; and none but <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians</hi> were Orthodox in them. But this is an Insinuation which hath as much Folly as Malice in it; since our solemn and express Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:66277:26"/>
are to the contrary: And he may as well call us <hi>Papists</hi> as <hi>Socinians,</hi> since our Writings are as plainly against one, as the other. What our Sense as to these Matters is, he may find in the <hi>Dialogues</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine of the Trinity and Transubstantiation compared;</hi> not long since Published by a <hi>Divine</hi> of the <hi>Church of England.</hi> But to pass this over, 2. Suppose the <hi>Difference</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and the <hi>Socinians,</hi> What then? <hi>Both take the same way of Scriptures Letter Interpretable by private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and yet differ in these Fundamental Points.</hi> And what follows? That the <hi>Scripture</hi> is no Certain Rule? By no means. But that the <hi>Socinians</hi> may err, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly do in misinterpreting this Rule. <hi>But how can it be a certain Rule, if men that use it may err in using it?</hi> How can Reason be certain in any thing, if Men fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Reason may mistake? How can <hi>Arithmetick</hi> be a <hi>certain way of computation,</hi> if Men following the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> may mistake in casting up a <hi>sum?</hi> Doth any Man question the <hi>Certainty</hi> of the <hi>Rule,</hi> for Mens blundering in their Accompts? yet this is his way of Reasoning. And I will put it just with his Propositions.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Arithmetick prescribes a Certain way by Addition and Substraction for us to find out any Sum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Therefore it must be such that they who take it, shall arrive by it, at the exact Sum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>But two Men who have made use of the same way, differ at least a hundred in casting up the Sum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>Therefore Arithmetick doth not prescribe a certain way to attain at a Certain Sum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>Therefore they who take only that way, cannot by it arrive at the Certain Sum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:66277:27"/>Is not this clear and evident Demonstration? But those who consider a little better than Mr. <hi>S.</hi> hath done, will distinguish between the <hi>rule</hi> and the <hi>application</hi> of it. The <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Arithmetick</hi> may be nevertheless <hi>Certain,</hi> although those who want Skill, or Care and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, may mistake in casting up a particular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt.</p>
            <p>The same we say here, <hi>Scripture</hi> is a <hi>Certain Rule</hi> in all <hi>Fundamental Points,</hi> to such as have Capacity and Use, due Care and Diligence in finding them. But we do not deny, but Men through Prejudice, Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, want of Attention, Authority of False Teachers, Impatience of throughly examining things, and not using proper Helps may run into gross Errors; such as these about the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Incarnation</hi>; but still the <hi>Rule</hi> is <hi>Certain</hi> to those who use it aright, although it be very possible for Men through their own Faults to mistake about it.</p>
            <p>And this is no way disagreeing to the infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, who deals with us as with Rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and hath put Faculties into us, that we might use them in order to the <hi>Certainty</hi> of our <hi>Faith.</hi> And such <hi>Moral Qualifications</hi> are required in the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> in order to the Discerning the Doctrine of it, as <hi>Humility of Mind, Purity of Heart, Prayer to God, Sincere Endeavour to do the Will of God</hi>; that it would be very repugnant to the Design of it, to suppose that <hi>the Letter of Scripture</hi> alone would give a Man imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and certain Directions in all Matters of Doctrine being applied to it. Therefore an easie Answer is to be given to Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s. great Difficulty, <hi>viz. How the Sense drawn from the Letter can any more fail to be true, than the Line drawn by the Rule to be straight. For,</hi> we say, <hi>that the Sense truly drawn from the Scripture can never
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:66277:27"/>
fail to be true</hi>; but we do not say, that every Man must draw the <hi>True Sense</hi> from the <hi>Scripture</hi>; for, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Scripture</hi> be an <hi>Infallible Rule,</hi> yet unless every Man that makes use of it be <hi>Infallible,</hi> he may mistake in the <hi>Application</hi> of it. And this to me is so clear, that to make an <hi>Infallible Rule</hi> in his Sense, he must make every Person that uses it <hi>Infallible,</hi> or else he may err in the <hi>Application</hi> of it: <hi>But the Right Way,</hi> saith Mr. <hi>S. will certainly bring a Man to his Journeys End,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Second Letter, <hi>pag.</hi> 6.</note> 
               <hi>and the way must needs be a wrong way if it do it not.</hi> The <hi>Right way</hi> will certainly bring them to their Journeys end, if they continue in it; but here we must consider what is meant by the <hi>Journeys End.</hi> If by it be understood their <hi>Salvation,</hi> then we say, that those who do their utmost endeavours to keep in that way, shall not fail of their <hi>Journeys End.</hi> But if by it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood <hi>the Certain Truth or Falshood of every Opinion tried by the Scripture,</hi> then I answer, that although the Sense of Scripture be infallibly true, yet it was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed as an <hi>Infallible Way</hi> for us to know the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Falshood</hi> of all particular <hi>Opinions</hi> by. For, as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> well observes, <hi>Salvation is that which chiefly imports us</hi>; and it was for that End the Doctrine of Christ is made known to us, and it is an <hi>Infallible Way</hi> to it, if Men continue therein; but for judging the <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Falshood</hi> of <hi>Opinions</hi> without respect to <hi>Salvation</hi> as the <hi>End,</hi> it was not intended as an <hi>Infallible Way</hi> to every one that makes use of it; and therefore it is easie for Men to mistake in judging by it of things it was not design'd for. As if a Man designed to observe all the <hi>old Roman Cities and Stations</hi> here, and were told the <hi>old Roman Way</hi> would be a <hi>Certain Way</hi> to lead him to them, with the help of the <hi>Roman Itinerary,</hi> if that Man objects, that this will not do, for he cannot find out all the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66277:28"/>
               <hi>Modern Towns</hi> and <hi>Villages</hi> by this Means, is it not a just and reasonable Answer to say, that is a most <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way,</hi> which leads a Man to that which it was design'd for; and the <hi>Roman way</hi> was only intended for <hi>Roman Foundations,</hi> but it is very unreasonable to find fault with it, because it doth not lead you to all Modern Towns and Villages. So say I here; the <hi>Scripture</hi> was designed by Divine Wisdom to make us <hi>Wise to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and thither it will infallibly lead us, if we keep to it; but if besides this we would know by it such things as are not necessary to Salvation, we blame it for that, which was not in the <hi>Original Intention and Design</hi> of it. For, when we make use of it to be our <hi>Rule</hi> of Judgment, meerly as to Truth and Falshood of things not necessary to Salvation; it is not because it was designed for that End; but because it is of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation,</hi> and so is the surest Standard of <hi>Divine Truth</hi>; and we are sure there is no other Rule for us to judge besides. From whence we may and ought to reject any <hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> imposed upon us, which are neither contained in Scripture, nor can be proved from it. And so it is our positive <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> as to all <hi>Necessary Articles</hi>; and our <hi>Negative Rule</hi> as to all <hi>pretended Points of Faith,</hi> which are not proved from thence.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I answer, that this Method of Mr. <hi>S.</hi> will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the <hi>Possibility</hi> of any <hi>Rule of Faith</hi>; because none can be assigned, which it is not possible for Men to misapprehend, and to mistake about it. Let us at present suppose Mr. <hi>S.</hi> to substitute his <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> in stead of <hi>Scripture,</hi> viz. <hi>Oral and Practical Tradition.</hi> Why may not Men mistake the <hi>Sense</hi> of <hi>Tradition,</hi> as well as the <hi>Sense</hi> of <hi>Scripture?</hi> Is <hi>Tradition</hi> more <hi>Infallible</hi> in it self? Is it deliver'd by Persons more <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible?</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:66277:28"/>
Doth it make those to whom it is delivered <hi>Infallible?</hi> Why then, may not those who deliver it, and those who receive it, both be mistaken about it?</p>
            <p>This I had mention'd in my <hi>second Letter,</hi> that it was very possible to mistake the <hi>Sense and Meaning of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>;<note place="margin">Second Letter to Mr. <hi>G. pag.</hi> 7.</note> and I instanced in that of <hi>Christ's being the Son of God</hi>; where the Traditionary Words may be kept and yet an <hi>Heretical Sense</hi> may be contained under them. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> answers,<note place="margin">Third Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Letter, <hi>pag.</hi> 6.</note> 
               <hi>That the Sense of the Words and all the rest of Christ's Doctrine is convey'd down by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi> This is bravely said, if it could be made out; and would presently put an End to all Disputes. For if all the Doctrine of Christ be derived down to us in such a manner, that we cannot mistake the <hi>Sense</hi> of it, we must be all agreed, whether we will or not. For, how can we disagree, if we cannot mistake the <hi>Sense</hi> of <hi>Tradition? Not while we hold to Tradition.</hi> Then it seems it is possible not to hold to <hi>Tradition</hi>; and if so, we have found a terrible flaw in <hi>Human Nature,</hi> that will let in Errors in abundance, <hi>viz.</hi> that it may grosly err about the Rule of Faith; yea, so far as to Renounce it. But how is this possible, if the <hi>Sense of Tradition be infallibly convey'd?</hi> For is not <hi>Traditions being the Rule of Faith</hi> any part of it? We must in Reason suppose this: And if we do so, how can Persons Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce its being the <hi>Rule,</hi> while they cannot but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve its being the Rule? If Men may mistake about <hi>Traditions</hi> being the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi>; why may we not suppose, they may as well mistake about any <hi>Points</hi> convey'd by it? For the greatest Security lying in the <hi>Rule,</hi> there must be more Care taken about that, than about the Points convey'd by it.</p>
            <p>But let us see how he proves that Men cannot mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake the <hi>Sense</hi> of <hi>Tradition</hi> in <hi>Particular Points:</hi> The
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:66277:29"/>
force of what he saith, is, <hi>That Men were always Men, and Christians were always Christians</hi>; and Mr. <hi>S.</hi> is always Mr. <hi>S.</hi> pretending <hi>Demonstration,</hi> when there is nothing like it. If Men were always Men, they were always apt to be deceived; and unless Christians by being such are <hi>Infallible,</hi> they are liable to Mistakes. <hi>But the highest means to convey the Sense of Words are to be found in Tradition.</hi> I am quite of another Opinion; I think it the most uncertain way in the World; and the Corruption of the first Ages of the World are an Evident Proof of it; when there were all possible Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of <hi>Tradition,</hi> and yet the Principles of <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion</hi> were strangely corrupted, although they were plain, easie, few, of the highest Importance, and Men lived so long to inculcate them into the Minds of their Children. If therefore, notwithstanding <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> the World might then degenerate into <hi>Polytheism</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi>; what absurdity is it to suppose, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding <hi>Tradition,</hi> the Christian Doctrine might be corrupted likewise?</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> alledges not only <hi>Words</hi> but <hi>Actions, to determine the Sense of them; as, that Christ is the Son of God; by Praying to him, and giving Divine Reverence to Christ without stinting them, or making them scruple, lest they give too much, or commit Idolatry by giving that to a Creature, which is due only to God. And does not this Practice, beyond all possibility of Mistake, insinuate into them, that he is equally to be adored with God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or Co-equal to him, and so not a Creature, but Very God of Very God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Answer,</p>
            <p n="1">I. Would not the very same Reasoning have made the coming in of <hi>Idolatry</hi> impossible? For, that there was but <hi>one True God,</hi> was evident from all Acts of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:66277:29"/>
               <hi>Worship,</hi> being given only to Him, as the proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it: How then could Men so foully mistake, as to give proper Divine Worship to any Creature, there being an infinite Distance between God and his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which every Child could not but know by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Tradition from <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. How was it possible that <hi>External Acts</hi> of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> should so infallibly prove <hi>Christ to be true God,</hi> if all External Acts of Worship be of an <hi>Equivocal Nature,</hi> and receive their Determination from the inward Sense of the Mind? Did not the <hi>Arians</hi> use the same <hi>External Acts</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi> with others, with respect to Christ? Where did they ever separate from the <hi>Christian Assemblies,</hi> on the account of the Worship given to Christ? If not, how was it possible from thence to prove Christ not to be a <hi>Creature</hi>? So that this is very far from putting the Point of the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> beyond the <hi>possibility</hi> of <hi>Mistake.</hi> Especially, when <hi>Solemn Invocation,</hi> which is one of the most natural Parts of <hi>Divine Worship,</hi> came to be allowed to meer Creatures. All the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that can be assigned then, must be from Mens <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Professions,</hi> and not from their <hi>External Actions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. The same <hi>Divine Reverence</hi> was given to <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>Apostolical Times,</hi> and the utmost Care used to instruct People in the True Doctrine of Christ; and yet then we find that Persons did Err in the Sense of that Proposition, That <hi>Christ is the Son of God.</hi> For, even then, the <hi>Ebionites</hi> and <hi>Cerinthians</hi> understood it, not in Respect of <hi>Nature,</hi> but <hi>Adoption</hi>; and so did the <hi>Artemonites</hi> and <hi>Samosatenians</hi> afterwards. And how can that be proved impossible to be done, which we shew was actually done? Men did notoriously mistake the <hi>Sense</hi> of <hi>Christ's being the Son of God,</hi> when it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:66277:30"/>
by <hi>Tradition</hi>; and yet Mr. <hi>S.</hi> pretends it cannot be mistaken, if it be so received.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Third Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> p. 14.</note>Mr. <hi>S.</hi> still urges, That <hi>Faith hath Sense in it; and it is inconsistent with the Nature of Mankind, not to hold some Sense or other, and with the Nature of Christians, not to instruct their Children in that Sense.</hi> And I think <hi>Words written</hi> have as much <hi>Sense</hi> in them as <hi>Words spoken,</hi> and less liable to Mistakes; there being no such mixtures of the Infirmities of Men in a <hi>Written Rule,</hi> as in <hi>Oral Tradition.</hi> But <hi>Instances</hi> are unlucky things to be brought against <hi>Demonstrations,</hi> and such is that of the <hi>Cerinthians</hi> and <hi>Artemonites,</hi> who pleaded <hi>Tradition</hi> for their <hi>Sense</hi>; and yet they were Men, and pretended to deliver the <hi>true Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> to their Disciples.</p>
            <p>I alledged another Instance, how the Sense of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> might be mistaken; and that was about a <hi>Real Presence</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> which might be understood in very different Senses. No, saith Mr. <hi>S. That cannot be; for, Faith works on our devout Affections, which must either oblige us to pay an infinite Veneration to a Creature, if Christ's real Body (and consequently God) be not there, or if Christ be not God, which is the greatest deviation from true Religion that is possible; or else to be highly irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent, and to want the most efficacious Motive that can be imagined to excite and elevate our Devotions, if he be there, or Christ be indeed God.</hi> Truly Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s way of Writing is the most effectual means I know to make me Question whether <hi>written Words be a good way to convey a Certain Sense</hi> to our Minds. For, I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, how <hi>Faiths working on our devout Affections, should oblige us, either to pay an infinite Veneration to a Creature, or else to be highly Irreverent.</hi> For, supposing I believe <hi>Christ's Body</hi> not to be <hi>really</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:66277:30"/>
but yet that <hi>Christ himself is God,</hi> I think my self bound to shew the utmost Reverence to <hi>Christ as God,</hi> even in the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Receiving the Eucharist</hi>: And I am of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the just Apprehension of the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, is as apt to <hi>excite and elevate our Devotion,</hi> as the believing the <hi>Body of Christ</hi> to be there really present. But it is observable, what Mr. <hi>S.</hi> here grants, that if <hi>Christ's Body</hi> be not there, they are guilty of <hi>paying an Infinite Veneration to a Creature, which is the greatest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation from true Religion that is possible.</hi> And upon my Word then they had need have better Assurance, than what he offers, to prove <hi>Christ's real Body</hi> to be there. For, if as great Reverence may be paid to <hi>Christ in Heaven,</hi> as if he were <hi>in the Elements,</hi> I cannot see how the Posture of <hi>Adoration</hi> can any ways determin the <hi>Sense</hi> of <hi>Tradition</hi> in this Matter.</p>
            <p>And thus Mr. <hi>S.</hi> hath left the <hi>Sense</hi> of <hi>Tradition</hi> as <hi>uncertain,</hi> as he pretends that of <hi>Scripture</hi> to be; and if his Argument will hold against the One being the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> it will do as great a Kindness for the Other also. Thus I have fully answered his main Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, against Scriptures being a Rule of Faith, which he hath been so free with me, as to tell me <hi>I cannot Answer</hi>;<note place="margin">

            <p>The summ of it is,</p>
            <p n="1">I. We distinguish <hi>Necessary Points</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> from <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Speculation.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="3">III. We distinguish the <hi>Certainty</hi> of the <hi>Rule,</hi> from the <hi>Certainty</hi> of the <hi>Application</hi> of that <hi>Rule</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:66277:31"/>And then my Answer lies in these things;</p>
            <p n="1">I. That the <hi>Scripture</hi> is a certain <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> as to all <hi>Points necessary to Salvation,</hi> to all such as make use of it as such, and do not through their own fault make a wrong <hi>Application</hi> thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That the <hi>Scripture</hi> was not designed for a <hi>Certain Rule</hi> as to <hi>Vnnecessary Opinions</hi>; and therefore Mens not arriving at a <hi>Certainty</hi> in them, doth not hinder its being a <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. That <hi>Scripture</hi> being our <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> we are bound to reject all pretended <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> which cannot with <hi>Certainty</hi> be proved from the <hi>Sense of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> And so the Proof of <hi>Certainty</hi> lies upon those who affirm such <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and not upon us who deny them.</p>
            <p>This Argument is Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s <hi>Goliah,</hi> and now it is no wonder if his lesser <hi>Men at Arms</hi> soon quit the Field. But I must take some notice of them, lest they be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, by being slighted.</p>
            <p>His next Argument is, <hi>That I contradict myself:</hi> I hope I have in the beginning made him unwilling to repeat such a Charge against me, till he hath cleared himself. But wherein is it? In another place, he saith, <hi>I deny any Absolute Certainty as to Tradition attesting the Books of Scripture; which in the Conference I asserted.</hi> I have looked in the Place he refers to, and there I find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like it. I deny the Necessity of any Infallible Society of Men, either to Attest or Explain the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Where, by an <hi>Infallible Society</hi> of Men, I mean such as have a <hi>Divine Assistance</hi> to that purpose: And what is this to the <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> we have of the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> by <hi>Vniversal Tradition?</hi> But he urges it further, <hi>If this Society be not Infallible, then
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:66277:31"/>
it is Fallible; and if it be Fallible, then we cannot be more than fallibly Certain, and so we can have no absolute Certainty from a Fallible Testimony.</hi> This is the whole force of what he saith. To which I Answer,</p>
            <p n="1">I. I understand no such thing as <hi>Infallibility</hi> in Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, but by <hi>immediate Divine Assistance,</hi> I grant, that the Holy Spirit may, where he pleases, preserve the Minds of Men from any possibility of mistake, as to those things, wherein it doth inlighten them; but set aside this, there is no such thing as <hi>Infallibility</hi>; the utmost is a <hi>rational Certainty</hi> built on clear and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Motives. Where the <hi>Motives</hi> are meerly <hi>probable,</hi> there may be <hi>Opinion,</hi> but no <hi>Certainty</hi>; where the Evidence is thought so strong as to determine Assent, there is a <hi>Certainty</hi> as to the Mind; as when we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly say, we are <hi>certain</hi> of such things, we mean no more, than that we firmly believe them; but when the Evidence is the highest, which in point of Reason the thing is capable of, then there is that which I call <hi>Absolute Certainty; i. e.</hi> such as depends not meerly on the <hi>Assent</hi> of the Mind; but the <hi>Evidence</hi> which justifies that Assent.</p>
            <p n="2">II If by being <hi>fallibly Certain,</hi> he means any <hi>Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,</hi> that notwithstanding such Evidence in all its Circumstances, <hi>I may be deceived,</hi> then I utterly deny it; for otherwise I could not be <hi>absolutely Certain</hi>; but if he means only, that there is no <hi>Divine Infallibility</hi> (and I know no other) then I own that there is still <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Fallibility</hi> consistent with this <hi>Absolute Certainty.</hi> But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> will have <hi>Absolute Certainty to be Infallible:</hi> If nothing will satisfie him, but <hi>Human (i. e.</hi> fallible) <hi>Infallibility,</hi> much good may it do him, but I much
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:66277:32"/>
rather chuse proper Terms, which I know the certain meaning of, than improper, though they make a far greater Noise. I do own an <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> in some Acts of the Mind by <hi>inward Perception,</hi> as that <hi>I think, I doubt,</hi> and <hi>that I am</hi>; I do own an <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> as to common <hi>Objects</hi> of <hi>Sense</hi>; and as to some Dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Reason; I do own an <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> as to some <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Fact,</hi> by a Concurrence of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; but for all that, I do not account Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Infallible,</hi> nor this an <hi>Infallible Certainty,</hi> unless it be taken in another Sense than <hi>Divines</hi> take it in. For even the <hi>Divines</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as well as Ours make a difference between a <hi>Human</hi> and <hi>Acquisite Certainty,</hi> and that which is <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Infallible.</hi> And if Mr. <hi>S.</hi> by <hi>Divine</hi> means <hi>Human,</hi> and by <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible</hi> no more than <hi>Certain,</hi> he must not think he hath gained any great matter, when he hath made use of <hi>Words</hi> in an improper and unusual Sense.</p>

                  <hi>First Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> p. 25.</note>III. His next Argument is, That <hi>our Rule of Faith is common to all the Heresies in the World, which pretend Scripture, as well as we.</hi> This is just the Old <hi>Sceptical</hi> Argument against <hi>Certainty</hi>; if there be any such thing as <hi>Certainty,</hi> you must assign such a <hi>Criterion which is not common to Truth and Falshood</hi>; but if you cannot assign any such Mark of Truth, which may not as well agree to what is False, then there is no such thing as <hi>Certainty</hi> to be had. In Matters of this nature, the Proof must not lie in <hi>generals,</hi> but we must come to <hi>particulars,</hi> to shew the <hi>Grounds</hi> of our <hi>Certainty,</hi> viz. <hi>as to the Trinity, and Incarnation of Christ,</hi> and then if we cannot shew why we believe those Points, and reject the opposite Heresies, as <hi>Arianism, Sabellianism, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychianism,</hi> &amp;c. then we are to be blamed for want of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:66277:32"/>
               <hi>Certainty</hi> in these Points, but not before. <hi>But this,</hi> he saith, <hi>is to make Light and Darkness very consistent, and Christ and Belial very good Friends.</hi> It seems then, there is no difference to be found <hi>by the Rule</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Doctrine of Christ</hi> and the <hi>Devil.</hi> Is this in Truth your avowed Principle? Do you in earnest believe the Scripture to be such a <hi>Chaos,</hi> where there is no difference of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darkness,</hi> and that nothing but <hi>Confusion</hi> can be found in it; And we cannot tell by it, whether we are <hi>to Worship God or the Devil?</hi> If Mr. <hi>S.</hi> grants, that there is enough in Scripture to distinguish these two; then it is a <hi>Rule</hi> so far, as to put a difference between <hi>Light and Darkness,</hi> between <hi>Christ and Belial</hi>; and so these Expressions must be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned as little less than <hi>Blasphemous,</hi> for all his pitiful Defence of them in his <hi>Second Letter</hi>; which is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Second Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> p. 73, 74.</note> 
               <hi>That he never said that Christ and Belial could be reconciled, or advanced any Position that implied it.</hi> But he said, <hi>That to make Scripture our Rule, is to make Light and Darkness consistent, and Christ and Belial very good Friends.</hi> And is not this <hi>Blasphemy</hi> against <hi>Scripture?</hi> and implies, that if we go by that <hi>Rule</hi> only, <hi>they may be very good Friends.</hi> How can this be, unless he asserts that by Scripture alone, we can find no certain difference <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Light and Darkness, between Christ and Belial</hi>? Let Mr. <hi>S.</hi> Answer to this, and not think to escape with such a poor Evasion. If he owns the <hi>Scripture</hi> a <hi>Certain Rule</hi> as to the difference of <hi>Christ and Belial, and Light and Darkness,</hi> then we have gained thus much, that in some Matters of very great Moment, the <hi>Scripture</hi> is a very <hi>sufficient Rule and Ground of Certainty,</hi> as to all Points between Us and Infidels. And if it be so, as to these Points, then why not as well as to other Points consequent upon these? <hi>If Christ be the Eternal Son of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:66277:33"/>
God</hi> in opposition to <hi>Heathen Deities,</hi> and we can know him by <hi>Scripture</hi> to be so, then we may as well know him to be the <hi>Eternal Son of God</hi> in opposition to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> and <hi>Socinians.</hi> If against the <hi>Heathens</hi> we can prove from <hi>Scripture,</hi> that <hi>the Word was made Flesh,</hi> Why will not this as well hold against <hi>Nestorians</hi> and <hi>Eutychians?</hi> And so the <hi>Scripture</hi> becomes a very <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rule</hi> to distinguish <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darkness</hi> in such Points among <hi>Christians</hi> too. For, is it ever the less fit to be a <hi>Rule,</hi> because both Parties own it? <hi>But they differ about the Sense of it, and therefore Controversies can never be ended by it.</hi> If Church-History deceive us not, the greatest Controversies were ended by it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore General Councils were heard of; and more than have been since. Many of those we read of in the First Ages were quite laid asleep,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Theod. Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret. Fab. l.</hi> 2, 3.</note> as <hi>Theodoret</hi> observes; but since <hi>Church-Authority</hi> interposed, in the most Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable manner, some Differences have been perpetuated, as appears by the <hi>Nestorian</hi> and <hi>Eutychian</hi> Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies. I do not blame the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Councils,</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they then did by the Rule of Scriptures, but the Event shewed, that the most probable Means, are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very ineffectual for <hi>ending Controversies.</hi> And those which Men think will most effectually Suppress <hi>Heresies,</hi> do often give a New Life and Spirit to them. So vain are the Imaginations of Men about putting an <hi>End to Controversies,</hi> till they do come to a <hi>Certainty</hi> about the <hi>true Sense of Scripture.</hi> It is possible to stop Mens Mouths by Force and Power, but nothing brings Men to a true Satisfaction, but inward Conviction as to the <hi>true Sense of Scripture</hi>; and there can be no <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Certainty</hi> as to these Points without it. If Controversies be not ended, let us not blame the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of <hi>Providence</hi>; for God doth not always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point

the Means most effectual in our Judgment, but such as are most suitable to his own Design. And we see Reason enough to blame the Folly and weakness, the Prejudice and Partiality, the Wilfulness and Obstinacy of Mankind; and till Human Nature be brought to a better Temper, we may despair of seeing any <hi>End</hi> of <hi>Controversies.</hi> Men may Dispute, and for all that I know, will do to the Worlds End, about the Method to put an End to Disputes. For, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies about <hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>Fatality</hi> have been always the Matters of Debate, among disputing Men, under several Names and <hi>Hypotheses,</hi> and are like so to be to the general Conflagration.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. He saith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>First Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> p. 26.</note> 
               <hi>Scripture is not our distinguishing Rule of Faith, but our own particular Judgments about Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for that which distinguishes my Rule from that of the most abominable Heresies, can only be my own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Letter of Scripture, and wriggle which way I will, there it will, and must end at last.</hi> I wish Mr. <hi>S.</hi> had been a little better conversant in the old Disputes about <hi>Certainty</hi>; for it would have saved me the trouble of answering some impertinent Objections; such as this before us. For they would have been thought mean Logicians, who could not put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the <hi>Rule of Judgment,</hi> and the <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> which a Man made according to the Rule. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Question were about <hi>Sense,</hi> whether that were a <hi>certain Rule,</hi> or not, to judge by; and <hi>Epicurus</hi> should affirm it, and say he so firmly believed it, that he judged the Sun to be no bigger than he seemed to his Senses; would not he have been thought ridiculous, who should have said, this Fancy of <hi>Epicurus</hi> was his <hi>Rule?</hi> The <hi>Rule</hi> he went by was in it self certain; but he made a wrong Judgment upon it; but that was not his Rule.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:66277:34"/>
So it is here. We declare the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be our only certain and standing <hi>Rule,</hi> whereby we are to judge in Matters of Faith; and we understand it as well as we can, and form our Judgments by it; but doth it hence follow, that our <hi>Judgment</hi> is our <hi>Rule?</hi> We may be deceived in our Judgments, but our Rule is <hi>Infallible</hi>; we may differ in our <hi>Judgments,</hi> but our <hi>Rule</hi> is one and the same. And how is it possible for those who differ in <hi>Judgment,</hi> to have the <hi>same Rule,</hi> if our <hi>Rule</hi> and our <hi>Judgments</hi> be the same? For then their <hi>Rules</hi> must be as different as their Judgments. I know not what Modern <hi>Logick</hi> Mr. <hi>S.</hi> learnt; but I am sure he learnt not this way of <hi>Reasoning</hi> from the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Philosophers,</hi> who discoursed about the <hi>Criterion</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another manner than our great pretender to <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi> doth.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Doth <hi>J. S.</hi> now take this for a <hi>Paradox</hi> among us? I assure him, I love not to make <hi>Jests</hi> about <hi>Scripture,</hi> nor <hi>matters of Faith</hi> and <hi>Salvation.</hi> But wherein doth this <hi>Jest</hi> lie? <hi>Why,</hi> forsooth, <hi>I make the People to make Scripture their Rule, and not one in a Million thinks of relying on it.</hi> Have they then any other <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi>

Is it indeed into those who taught them to read? or into the <hi>New Testament,</hi> as the <hi>Ground</hi> of their Faith?

I think not; but only as <hi>honest Tradition</hi> makes him so, and how far that goes towards it, I shall examine afterwards.</p>
            <p>Well; but suppose <hi>John Biddle against the Minister of his Parish, and the whole Church of</hi> England <hi>to boot, understands Scripture to be plainly against a Trinity and Christ's Divinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is but fair for me to suppose him, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Heresie against <hi>J. S.</hi> and let any one judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of us be more likely to Convince him. He owns the Scripture, and confesses if we can prove our Doctrine from thence, he will yield; but he laughs at Oral Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and thinks it a <hi>Jest</hi> for any one to prove such a Doctrine by it. And truly, if it were not for the Proofs from Scripture, I do much Question, whether any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from meer Tradition could ever confute such a one as <hi>John Biddle.</hi> But when we offer such Proofs, as are acknowledged to be sufficient in themselves, we
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:66277:36"/>
take the only proper way to give him Reasonable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. <hi>Suppose he will not be convinced.</hi> Who can help that? Christ himself met with Wilful and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate Unbelievers. And was this any disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his Doctrine? God himself hath never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to cure those who shut their Eyes against the Light.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Page 29.</note>
               <hi>Shall the Believing Church then have the Liberty to interpret Scripture against the Teaching Church?</hi> Who ever asserted any such thing? We only say, that the People are to understand the Grounds of their Faith; and to judge by the best Helps they can, what Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is agreeable to Scripture, and to embrace what is so, and to reject what is not: But among those Helps we take in, not barely the personal Assistance of their own Guide, but the Evidence he brings, as to the Sense of the Teaching Church, in the best and purest Ages.</p>
            <p>It is very strange, that after this, it should present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow,<note place="margin">Page 29.</note> 
               <hi>'Tis evident hence, that Tradition of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Teachers, and not Scriptures Letter, is indeed our Rule; and by it we interpret Scripture.</hi> If this be so <hi>evident,</hi> then how is it possible, we should set up the <hi>Ecclesia Credens</hi> against the <hi>Ecclesia Docens</hi>; as he charged us just before. If <hi>Tradition</hi> be our Rule, and we interpret Scripture by it, what fault then are we guilty of, if Tradition be such an Infallible Rule? But, methinks, this <hi>Hence</hi> looks a little <hi>Illogically</hi> upon the Premises; and if this be his <hi>Conclusive Evidence,</hi> he must excuse me as to the making it a Ground of my Faith.</p>
            <p>But he allows, <hi>That we set up Scripture as our Rule, when we Dispute against them; but when that is done, we set up our own Authority over the People, and do not
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:66277:36"/>
allow them that Priviledge against us, which we take against the Church of</hi> Rome. This is all the strength of what I can make out of that Paragraph. For if all Writing were like his, it would be the best Argument for Oral Tradition; his Sense is so intricate, and his Conclusions so remote from his Premises. Just before he said, <hi>'Tis evident hence that we follow Tradition.</hi> And presently, <hi>'Tis as evident we do not follow it, and set up our own Authority against it. We do interpret Scripture by Tradition</hi>; and yet immediately, <hi>we set up Scripture against Tradition. We plead for the Peoples Right to a Judgment of Discretion</hi>; and yet <hi>we do not allow them a Judgment of Discretion.</hi> What invisible links hath Oral Tradition to connect things, that seem so far asunder?</p>
            <p>But however it be expressed or connected, his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, <hi>That we only set up Scripture against the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and then set up our own Authority over the People.</hi> This is not possible, if we do allow them a <hi>Judgment</hi> of <hi>Discretion</hi>; and this is one of the things he so much charges upon me; and saith, <hi>He never read any Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant that puts Matters more into private hands than I do</hi>;<note place="margin">Page 29.</note> and yet in the very next Page, he saith, <hi>I deny the People the same Priviledge against Pastoral Authority.</hi> How can I deny them such a Priviledge, if I put Matters into their hands above any other Protestant? I do not know, that I do in the least differ from the sixth Article of our Church; nor do I take off from the due Authority of Bishops and Pastors of Churches. But all our Dispute is, about this <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Discretion,</hi> whether it be allowable to People, and how far.</p>
            <p>In his <hi>Third Letter</hi> he resumes this Argument, and thither I follow him,<note place="margin">Third Letter, <hi>p.</hi> 92.</note> that I may lay things together
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:66277:37"/>
into some Method. The words he cavils at, are,
<q>If we have the Consent of all Christian Churches against the only pretended Infallible Judge, we have their Consent likewise, that every Man is to judge for his own Salvation.</q>
What hurt is there in this? <hi>It seems then nothing will content us now but Infallibility.</hi> Was there ever such an awkard Man at Reasoning? It follows indeed, that either there must be an Infallible Judge, or every Man must judge for himself. <hi>Do I then allow no Authority to Church-Governors, that do not pretend to Infallibility?</hi> Yes, very much, while they do not pretend to Impose on our Faith, by a pretence to Infallibility. But what Occasion do I give for this, when I say only, <hi>That every Man must judge for his own Salvation</hi>; and yet he had the Conscience to leave this out in repeating my Sense, but two lines after. May not you mistake or pervert to Day, what you heard Yesterday, when I find you mistaking or perverting my Sense, but at two lines distance? And then run on in a long Discourse, as though you had taken the true Sense of my Words. Is not this a fit Person <hi>to play out Mr.</hi> G <hi>'s Game,</hi> who <hi>shuffles</hi> in so strange a manner, and so openly <hi>plays false Cards?</hi> Where did I ever dispute against Church-Authority in due proposing Matters of Faith, provided that every Man is to judge for his own Salvation? <hi>But I have,</hi> he saith, <hi>an aking Tooth at the Churches intermeddling in Matters of Faith.</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 93.</note> From whence doth this appear? This must either arise from great Ignorance, as to the Right of Judging every Man hath as to his own Salvation; or from a Malicious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, to expose me to all Church-Governors; but I pity his Ignorance, and despise his Malice. What pleasant Entertainment doth he make with the <hi>Sober Enquirer? 'Tis pity</hi> (saith he) <hi>but he had a blew Apron on, and a Tub
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:66277:37"/>
to Hold-forth in</hi>; as a <hi>Sober Enquirer</hi> may possibly find some Pretenders to <hi>Infallibility</hi> have done in their Time. But what is the meaning of all this ado about a <hi>Sober Enquirer?</hi> I had said many years ago,
<q>That the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures being owned, as containing in them the whole Will of God so plainly revealed, that no Sober En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer can miss of what is necessary for Salvation, there can be no Necessity supposed of an Infallible Society of Men either to Attest or Explain these Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings among Christians, any more than there was for some Ages before Christ, of such a Body of Men among the Jews, to Attest or Explain to them the Writings of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets.</q>
And where lies the Heresie or Danger of this Doctrine? If I said that no Sober Enquirer can miss of things necessary to Salvation in Scripture, it is no more than St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> St. <hi>Augustin, Aquinas,</hi> and other School-men, had said before me; and <hi>Were they for blew Aprons and Tubs to Hold forth in?</hi> Nay, to shew how unskilful <hi>J. S.</hi> is in the Writers of his own Church, (if they do own him) even <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himself grants as much as I say. For being to Answer that Place <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5. <hi>If any Man lack Wisdom, let him ask it of God, who giveth liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> &amp;c. he Answers,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bell. de verbo Dei,</hi> l. 3. c. 6. sect. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondeo.</hi>
               </note> This is to be understood of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientia necessaria ad Salutem</hi>; so then a Sober Enquirer praying to God to give him Wisdom, shall not want that which is Necessary to his Salvation. And he quotes several Passages of St. <hi>Augustin</hi> to prove, <hi>that Prayer obtains nothing Infallibly but that which is necessary or useful to the Salvation of him that prays.</hi> If this be then obtained Infallibly, then we see an Infallible Ground of Certainty, as to what is Necessary or Useful to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> indeed saith, that a Gift of Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not to be had by Prayer; and, Do I ever say it
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:66277:38"/>
is? Did I ever give the least Countenance to Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick Pretenders, or to the Breakers of the Laws and Orders of our Established Church? What means then these spiteful Insinuations? Doth the Man hope to raise Himself by exposing Me? Or to be caressed by <hi>F.P.</hi> and <hi>F. W.</hi> by the brave attempt of throwing Dirt so plainly in my Face? Which will never stick, being so unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully thrown, either to my Prejudice, or his Advantage.</p>
            <p>But this Matter about the Peoples Judgment of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scretion, must not be thus pass'd over. For, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes it at the End of his <hi>Third Letter,</hi> and thought it a good relishing bit to conclude with. And towards the very end, he begins to state the Controversie, this true Logician having forgotten it before, or reserved it for a Disert at the last.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Third Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> p. 99·</note>
               <hi>To come closer</hi> (saith he) <hi>and take a more distinct view of this Judgment of Discretion.</hi> It was even time to come closer in the 99th. <hi>p.</hi> of the <hi>Third Letter.</hi> Alas for Mr. <hi>G.!</hi> he is like to have a hopeful Game of it, when his Substitute talks at this rate at the very end of the Game. But let us see what feats he will do now he <hi>comes closer. Now he will acquaint me, how far he allows it, and far and how in what he rejects it.</hi> This is well; but why no sooner? He was at' another Game before, <hi>viz.</hi> two or three throws at the <hi>Sober Enquirer,</hi> and having knock'd him down with his <hi>blew Apron</hi> and <hi>Tub,</hi> he now comes to <hi>T. G</hi>'s <hi>Cards</hi> again. And let us see how well he plays them. First, He grants, <hi>That every Man is to judge for his own Salvation; i. e.</hi> he yields what the <hi>Sober Enquirer</hi> aimed at, and now methinks he desires <hi>the blew Apron and Tub, to Hold-forth</hi> himself. Secondly, He saith, <hi>All Mankind are agreed in it.</hi> It seems then the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> are <hi>true Catholicks</hi> in Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s Opinion. Thirdly, He yields, <hi>That every Man
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:66277:38"/>
is to judge of the best way to Salvation, and of all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies between Them and Vs.</hi> Now the <hi>Tub</hi> is turn'd to a <hi>Chair,</hi> and the <hi>Holder-forth</hi> become a <hi>Judge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies.</hi> Nay, he goes so far as to say, <hi>the contrary Tenet is ridiculous, as what's most</hi>; nay, that it is <hi>sottishness to hold it; and to deprive Mankind of this Priviledge of judging thus, is to debar him of the Light and Vse of his Reason, when it is most useful for him.</hi> Is not all this very obliging? But where now lies the difference? <hi>Why,</hi> truly, <hi>if his Discretion leads him to the Infallible Rule of Tradition, all is well; but if not, it is no longer Discretion.</hi> What? has he been Judge of all the Controversies between Us already, and is he to seek for his <hi>Rule</hi> still? What <hi>Discretion</hi> had he all that time, to judge without a Rule! What a <hi>Judge</hi> of <hi>Controversies</hi> have we found at last? Methinks the <hi>Sober Enquirer</hi> far exceeds him in point of common <hi>Discretion</hi>; for he never pretended to judge without a Rule, much less all the Controversies between Us. But this discreet Judge of all Controversies first deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins all the Points; and when he hath done this, he finds out his Rule. Of all the Judges of Controversies that have been yet talked of, commend me to this set up by <hi>J. S.</hi> For, how is it possible for him to judge amiss, who had no Rule to judge by?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You see</hi> (saith he) <hi>how we allow them the Vse of their Reason and Judgment of Discretion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 102.</note> 
               <hi>till it brings them to find a certain Authority, and when they have once found that, the same Judgment of Discretion which shewed them that Authority was Absolutely Certain, obliges them to trust it, when it tells them what is Christ's Faith, without using their private Judgments any longer about the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Points themselves thus ascertained to them, but sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to it.</hi> To which I Answer,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:66277:39"/>I. The same reason which enabled Men to find out this <hi>Infallible Guide,</hi> or <hi>Certain Authority</hi> will help them to judge concerning this Authority, and the Matters proposed by it. For, either he hath a Rule to find out this <hi>Authority,</hi> or he hath none; if he hath a Rule, it must be either Scripture, or pure Natural Reason. If Scripture, that only affords <hi>Fallible Certainty,</hi> he saith over and over, and so a Man can never come cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to this Authority. And if the Foundation be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, what can the Rule do? But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> doth not pretend <hi>Scripture,</hi> but <hi>Reason,</hi> for his Infallible Rule. Then I demand, whether Reason doth afford an Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Ground of Certainty, as to this Certain Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or not? If it doth, we are yet but <hi>Fallibly Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>; if it doth not, then what need this Certain Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; for in the Opinion of all Reasonable Men, <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Reason</hi> is better than <hi>certain Authority.</hi> And he cannot deny the Certainty of Reason, who builds the Certainty of Authority upon it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Suppose the particular Points proposed by this Certain Authority be repugnant to that Certainty of Reason, by which I am required to believe it: As sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose this Authority tells me, I am no longer to rely upon my Reason, but barely to submit, although the Matter proposed be never so much against it; What is to be done in this Case? I am to believe this Certain Authority on the Account of Reason, and that requires me to believe such things as overthrow the Certainty of Reason; How is it possible for me to rely on this Certain Authority on the Certainty of Reason, when that Authority tells me, there is no Certainty in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:66277:39"/>III. Must I believe <hi>Reason</hi> to be <hi>Certain</hi> just so far and no further? But who sets the bounds? Hath God Almighty done it? When and where? I may and ought to use my Reason in searching after this Certain Authority, and judge all Controversies in order to the finding it out; all this is allowed; but as soon as ever this Certain Authority is discover'd, then <hi>Goodnight Reason</hi>; I have now no more Use for you. But who bid you be so ungrateful to that Certain Reason, which conducted you so far? It is very possible it may be as Useful still, why then do you turn Reason off so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly after so good Service?</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Are all People capable of this Certain Reason, or not? It requires, it seems, a great deal of Logick to prove this Certain Authority, or this Infallible Guide by Reason; and I am one of those that think it can never be done: Suppose then, some of us duller People can never comprehend the force of this Reason, which is to lead us to an Infallible Guide, What is like to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of us Uncapable People? Are we all to be damned for Dunces and Blockheads? No, not so neither: This is really some Comfort. For then it is to be hoped we may go to Heaven without finding out this <hi>Certain Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>; and then we may have True Faith without it. This is still better and better. And then I pray what need have I to find out this Certain Authority at all, if I may have True Faith and be Saved without it?</p>
            <p n="5">V. I have greater Certainty by <hi>Reason</hi> of the <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Authority</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> than you can have of the <hi>Certain Authority</hi> of <hi>Tradition.</hi> Here is <hi>Reason</hi> on both sides, and <hi>Authority</hi> on both sides; but I say there is no Comparison between either the <hi>Reason</hi> or the <hi>Authority.</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:66277:40"/>
The <hi>Reason</hi> to believe the <hi>Scripture,</hi> is so incomparably beyond the Reason to believe <hi>Oral Tradition.</hi> And the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> hath so much greater Force on the Consciences of Men, that it is very extraordinary among those who own Scripture to be the Word of God, to find them compared in Point of <hi>Authority.</hi> For, we must deal plainly in this Matter; the Scripture we look on as the <hi>Rule</hi> of our <hi>Faith,</hi> because it is the <hi>Word of God.</hi> If you do not own it to be so, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve all into <hi>Tradition,</hi> we know what you are; but if you do own the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be of <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> how can you pretend to set up any <hi>Certain Authority</hi> in Comparison with it?</p>
            <p n="6">VI. If this <hi>Certain Authority</hi> be only to lead us into the <hi>Certain Sense</hi> of Scripture, then it must be either into the <hi>Sense</hi> of plain Places, or of difficult and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure: If of plain Places, then it is to kindle a Torch to behold the Sun; if of obscure Places, then who hath appointed this Certain Authority to Explain them? Who is to appoint such a Certain Authority in the Church, to Explain his Word, but God Himself? And we desire to see some plain Places, that set up this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to Explain those which are obscure and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. We think it our Duty to read and <hi>search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and especially the <hi>New Testament,</hi> where we find very great Occasion for this Certain Authority to be mentioned. We find Churches newly settled, and many Disputes and Controversies started among them; and those of great and dangerous Consequence; we find the Apostles giving frequent Advice to these Churches with respect to these Differences, and with great earnestness giving Caution against Seducers, and warning them of the danger of them; but not one
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:66277:40"/>
Word can we find in all their Epistles tending this way, or mentioning any <hi>Certain Authority</hi> they were to submit to, for the putting an End to all Controversies. This is really a Matter of so much Concernment to the whole Christian World, that if any such thing had been in the Design of Christianity, I can never believe that the Apostles would have omitted it in their several E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles. Had not they sufficient Care of the <hi>Certainty</hi> of Mens Minds, and of the Peace of the Church? Was it a <hi>Secret</hi> concealed then from them? Or not thought fit to be communicated by them, when it was most necessary to prevent the early Corruptions and Errours of the Christian Churches? But they are so far from it, that I cannot find any Intimation to that purpose in all their Writings, although they had the fairest Occasions for it.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. If Men by <hi>Certain Reason</hi> have found out this <hi>Certain Authority,</hi> What are they to do with this <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Reason</hi> afterwards? Methinks it is a little hard for ever to discharge so useful a Servant immediately after so extraordinary a piece of Service, as the finding out an <hi>Infallible Guide.</hi> We do not find the Apostles directing the People not to make use of their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, because their Guides were Infallible. I am apt to think the Apostles were as <hi>Infallible</hi> as <hi>Tradition</hi> or <hi>Church-Authority</hi> ever since; and therefore what allowance was made by them to a <hi>Judgment</hi> of <hi>Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is still to continue. What doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> mean to speak to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in such a manner,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.15.</note> 
               <hi>I speak as to Wise Men, judge ye what I say</hi>: How different is this from, <hi>I speak by an Infallible Spirit, and ye are not to judge what I say?</hi> When he saith to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.21.</note> 
               <hi>Prove all things,</hi> Doth he mean, <hi>Swallow all things, and Prove nothing?</hi> When St. <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>Try the Spirits,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1.</note> 
               <hi>whether
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:66277:41"/>
they are of God,</hi> Doth he only mean, till they had found a Certain Authority? Did not they believe St. <hi>John</hi>'s Authority to be Certain? If not, to what purpose did he write this Epistle to them? If he did, he supposed them still to have a liberty of Judging, even those who pretended to Inspiration. <hi>For, many false Prophets are gone out into the world.</hi> And there are certain Rules and Marks to judge of the Pretences to an Infallible Spirit, which were in vain assigned, if they were not to judge by them.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Suppose Men differ about this <hi>Certain Authority,</hi> wherein it lies, and how far it extends; Are not they to exercise their <hi>Reason</hi> still about this? Suppose some pretend, that it lies in an <hi>Infallible Assistance</hi> which Christ hath promised to his Church in all Ages; and Others say, this is impossible to be a Ground of Faith, because it is it self an Article of Faith: Must not a Man exercise his Reason about this? Here is <hi>Certain Authority</hi> pleaded; but Others say, there is <hi>Certain Reason</hi> against this Pretence of <hi>Certain Authority</hi>; and they must grant I must follow <hi>Certain Reason,</hi> though against <hi>Certain Authority.</hi> Again, Others say, the <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Authority</hi> of <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> is a Novel, vain and dangerous Opinion, <hi>destructive of Faith,</hi> and leading to <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Atheism</hi>; What is to be done in this Case? Must our Reason be quitted, and Men not be allowed to judge of this <hi>Authority</hi> by it? Yes, <hi>till they come to own it, and then they are to judge no longer; i. e.</hi> put out your Eyes once, and ye need never think of opening them after. Be very circumspect in the Choice of your Way, till you come to a <hi>Precipice,</hi> and when you are come there, be sure to throw your self from it head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and there is an <hi>End</hi> of <hi>Controversies.</hi> But we do
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:66277:41"/>
not judge this a very Reasonable Method; but think he had much better keep upon plain Ground, and use the best Method he can to find the true Way; and if his Judgment, will serve him to find the <hi>Way</hi> to a <hi>Precipice,</hi> we think it will much better serve him to keep him from it; And that he had better bear with some imperfection of his Sight, than put out his Eyes that he may be the more quietly led, he knows not whither.</p>
            <p>There is only one thing more, which deserves to be taken notice of, about this Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>J. S.</hi> saith, <hi>I expresly exclude the Churches Help</hi>; which is, as he triumphantly concludes his Third Letter, <hi>The First Principle, nay the Quintessence of all Heresie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Third Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Page,</hi> 104.</note> 
               <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticism in the Egg, perfect Enthusiasm when hatcht, and downright Atheism when fledg'd.</hi> This is a parting Blow indeed. It is the bite of an Angry Viper, at its last Gasp, when it puts its utmost force into the Venom, and hopes even dying to destroy. Others love to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude gently, but <hi>J. S.</hi> is a Man by himself, and as though he were writing Epigrams, would reserve his Sting for the last. But what Ground is there for all this venemous Froth? Even just as much as there was for the Author of <hi>Pax vobis</hi> to say, <hi>that I am for intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Paganism</hi>; or for another to make me <hi>the Founder of Anti-Catholick, and Anti Christian Doctrines,</hi> whereas I profess to own no other than what have been received in this Church ever since the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But some Mens <hi>Spleen</hi> and <hi>Gall</hi> must have a Vent lest it destroy them. It is some satisfaction to me to think that none but such, who either <hi>Oppose</hi> or <hi>Betray</hi> our Church, set themselves thus to defame me; and it is a great comfort to find such feeble Reasoning, where so much Spite and Malice is discover'd. Thus
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:66277:42"/>
it is here, with <hi>J. S.</hi> he could merit nothing without giving me hard words, and because many look on the Beginning and End of a Book, who mind nothing else in it; therefore he hath here put together as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of my Doctrine, no less than <hi>Heresie, Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism, Enthusiasm, and downright Atheism.</hi> He thought he could not make my Case Equal with his own, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less I were charged with <hi>Heresie,</hi> and <hi>Principles leading to Atheism.</hi> But he is charged by the most <hi>Zealous Catholicks,</hi> and in respect to his avowed Principles; but my charge here is by an enraged Adversary; and for such a Doctrine which is owned by all Men of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding in both Churches, and if I may name him among them, even by <hi>J. S.</hi> himself. My words are, <hi>If it be said,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2d. Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, p. 21.</note> 
               <hi>that the Churches Power will become explicit to any sober Enquirer, then every such Person may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Churches help find out all necessary Points of Faith.</hi> And where lies the Heresie, the Enthusiasm, the Atheism of this Doctrine, which I have already shewed was asserted both by Fathers and School-men? And <hi>J. S.</hi> himself grants, that every Man is to judge for his own Salvation; and of the best way to his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and of all the Controversies between them and us, and especially of the true Grounds of Faith; and all this without the Churches help. And if he can do all this, I desire to know whether he cannot find out all Necessary Points of Faith? Hath he indeed, resolved all Controversies, and yet wants some necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Points of Faith? And hath he found out the Churches Authority too, without the Churches Help, and yet doth he want some necessary Points of Faith? Then it follows, that after the submitting to the Churches Authority, there are still necessary Points of Faith which may be wanting; and then an absolute Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:66277:42"/>
is not all that is required of one that hath found out the Churches Authority. But my whole Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there proceeds upon a Supposition, <hi>viz.</hi> that if one may without the Churches Help find out the Churches Authority in Scripture, then why not all necessary Points of Faith? So that it goes upon a Parity of Reason; and I see no Answer at all given or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, but only he endeavours to stop my Mouth with a handful of Dirt.</p>
            <p>Thus I have dispatched this long Argument about the <hi>Judgment</hi> of <hi>Discretion.</hi> And I shall now sum up my Answer in these particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Every Christian, as such, is bound to enquire after the true Way to Salvation, and hath a Capacity of Judging concerning it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Every Christian proceeding according to the best Rules of judging, hath Reason to receive the Scripture as the Rule of his Faith.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Scripture is so plain in all Necessaries, and God hath promised such Assistance to them, that sincerely seek it, that none who do so, shall want the knowledge of such things as are necessary to their Salvation.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. When any thing is offer'd as necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in order to Salvation, every Christian hath a Right and Liberty of Judging, whether it can be proved by the Scripture to be so necessary or not.</p>
            <p n="5">V. We do not allow to particular Persons the same Faculty of Judging in doubtful Points of Controversie, which we do as to Matters that immediately concern their Salvation.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:66277:43"/>VI. No pretence of Infallibility or Authority can take away that Right of Judging, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them by the Apostles, whose Authority was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. This Right of Judging doth not exclude the Churches due Authority as to Matters of Faith and Controversies of Religion, (as it is declared <hi>Art.</hi> 20. of our Church) but all that we now plead for, is (not any Authority as to others) but a Right of Judging as to themselves, in Matters that concern their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. The Certainty of Faith, as to them depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two Things; 1. The clearness of Scripture about them, which implies the <hi>Certainty</hi> of <hi>Reason.</hi> 2. The Promise of Divine Assistance which makes their <hi>Faith Divine,</hi> both as to its <hi>Principle,</hi> its <hi>Ground,</hi> and its <hi>Effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I have not yet ended his <hi>Objections</hi> about our Rule of Faith; For</p>
            <p n="6">
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Third Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Page,</hi> 34.</note>VI. He objects, <hi>That we cannot necessarily resolve our Faith into the Writings of the Apostles only.</hi> What is the meaning <hi>that we cannot necessarily resolve it?</hi> I think we must Resolve it into a Written Rule, till we see another proved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Did the Apostles when they went to convert the World, go with Books in their Hands, or Words in their Mouths?</hi> Doubtless, <hi>with Words in their Mouths. Or were those Words a jot less Sacred, when they came from their Mouths, than when they put them in a Book?</hi> Not one jot. <hi>Or lastly, doth any Command from Christ appear to write the Book of Scripture, or any Revelation before hand, that it was to be a Rule of Faith to the future Church? No such matter; and the Accidental Occasions of its
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:66277:43"/>
writing at first, and its Acceptation afterwards bar any such pretences. On the other side, their grand Commission was not</hi> scribite, <hi>but only</hi> praedicate Evangelium.</p>
            <p>I have given an Account so lately of the Reasons and Occasions of writing the <hi>Gospels</hi> and <hi>Epistles</hi> of the New Testament, that I need only here to give these general Answers.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Whatsoever was done as to the Writing the Books of the New Testament, was done by the immediate Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Appointment of the Holy Ghost.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke,</hi> 1.4. <hi>Job.</hi> 20.31</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. The Reason given, by the Writers of the Gospels themselves, is, that Matters of Faith might be delivered with the greatest Certainty.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Those Writings were not intended only for the Benefit of the Church then being, but for future Ages; and thence the Books of Scripture were so received and esteemed in the Primitive Churches.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The most Antient Writers of the Christian Church assure us, that the Apostles wrote the same Doctrine they taught, and for that purpose, that they might be <hi>a Pillar and Foundation of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. The most certain way we now have to know what Doctrine the Apostles taught is by their Writings; since they taught and wrote the same Doctrine; and we are certain we have the Doctrine they wrote, but we have no other Way to be certain what Doctrine they taught.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. He objects, <hi>That the Question being put con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the New Testament's containing all Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of Christ and his Apostles, I gave no direct Answer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Third Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> p. 38.39, 40.</note> 
               <hi>but shuffled it off to Matters necessary to Salvation.</hi> The setting out of this is the Subject of some pages. To which I give an easie Answer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:66277:44"/>The Question concerning the New Testament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining all the Divine Revelations of Christ and his Apostles, may be taken in two Senses.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As relating to the <hi>entire Object</hi> of Faith; and so the Answer was most direct and plain, to the second Question,
<q>That the Rule, whereby we hold all the same Doctrine, that was taught by Christ and his Apostles, is by the Divine Revelations contained in the Writings of the New Testament.</q>
For since we believe all that is there, and nothing but what is there, that must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Entire Object of our Faith. And the word <hi>All</hi> must relate to that.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to all those things which particular Persons are bound to believe, as contained therein; and so the Question being put, about <hi>the Vniversal Testimony to assure us,</hi> i. e. all particular Christians, <hi>That the New Testament contained all the Divine Revelations of Christ and his Apostles:</hi> My Answer was direct and apposite to this Sense, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Universal Testimony of the Christian Church, as to the Book of Scripture, and the Doctrine therein contained, is a sufficient Ground to make us certain, <hi>i. e.</hi> all particular Persons, of all Matters necessary to our Salvation. So that the Substance of my Answer lies in these three things.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That all our Faith is contained in Scripture; and thereby we hold all the Doctrine taught by Christ and his Apostles.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That although all particular Persons may not reach to the entire Object of Faith contained in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet they had thereby a Certainty, as to all Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters necessary to their Salvation.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:66277:44"/>III. That the Ground of Certainty as to both these, was the Universal Testimony of the Christian Church, concerning the Books of Scripture, and the Doctrine contained therein.</p>
            <p>The Words of my Letter are,
<q>We are to consider,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Second Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> p. 17.</note> that the Scripture being our sole and entire Rule of Faith, all Matters necessary to Salvation, must be supposed to be contained therein; and therefore the same Testimony, which delivers the Scripture to us, doth deliver all the necessary Articles as contained therein. Which are there received as in the Lump; and if we receive the Book which contains all, we must by the same Authority receive all contained in it. As if a Purse be left to a Man by his Fathers Will, full of Gold and Silver, and this by the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors be declared to contain all the Gold and Silver his Father left him they who deliver this Purse to him from the Executors, do certainly deliver to him all the Gold and Silver left him by his Father. But if he suspects there was both Gold and Silver left him by his Father, which was not in that Purse, then he must call in Question the Integrity of the Executors, who declared that all was contained therein. This is now the Case of the Christian Church, as to all Divine Truths which respect Mens Salvation; the Primitive Church, who answer to the Executors in the other Case, did unanimously declare that all such Truths were undoubtedly contained in the Written Word. Although therefore there may be a real Difference in the nature of the Doctrines therein contained, as there is between Gold and Silver, yet he that receives all, must receive one as well as the other; and the Matters of Salvation, being of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:66277:45"/>
greatest Moment, they that receive the whole Will of God upon Grounds of Certainty, must be assured that therein they receive all Matters necessary to our Salvation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Never was any Purse so rifled as this is by <hi>J. S.</hi> he examines not only the Coin in it, but the very <hi>Strings</hi> and <hi>Linings</hi> of it. He is a dreadful Man at Ransacking a Metaphor.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Third Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> p. 40.</note> He tells me, <hi>My Similitude is so far from running on four Legs, that it is in many regards lame on the right (and indeed only) foot it ought to stand on; and which is worse, perhaps against my self. The sum of it amounts to this, that because Scripture contains all, and Protestants have Scripture, therefore they have all. A strange kind of Discourse! As if, because they have it in a Book, therefore they have it in their Minds and Souls, in which, and no where else Faith is to reside.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But was not the Question put, whether we had <hi>All the Points of Faith which our Saviour taught?</hi> And how could I answer a Question about <hi>All,</hi> but by shewing where we had <hi>All?</hi> If All the Doctrine of Christ be there, we must be certain we have all, if we have the Scripture which contains all. <hi>But it is not enough to have it in a Book.</hi> I grant it. But still if you ask, <hi>where all my Faith is contained</hi>; I must refer you to that Book which contains All. For I profess to believe every thing there, and nothing as a Point of Faith, but what is there. We do not pretend, that it is enough for Persons to say, their Faith is in such a Book; but we grant that they ought to read and search, and actually believe what ever they find in that Book; but still all Points are not equally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to all Persons that are therein contained, but all such as are necessary to Salvation lie there
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:66277:45"/>
open to the Capacities of all who desire to know them.</p>
            <p>Now this is one of the things <hi>J. S.</hi> finds fault with this similitude of a Purse for, <hi>viz. That People think it is an easie thing to open, and as easie to come at the Sense of Scripture, as to take Money out of a Purse: 'Tis but plucking the Strings, and the Deed is done.</hi> And is this any Disparagement to a Rule of Faith to be plain and easie? If it were not so, it could not be a Rule of Faith for all Persons. We do not say, that any Person by opening the Scriptures, may presently attain to the Certain Sense of all Places of Scripture; but that which I assert, is, That no Man who sets himself to read and consider the Scriptures as he ought, and prays for Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from God, shall miss of knowing all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to his Salvation. But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> is for mending the Similitude, and truly he doth it after an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner. <hi>He will allow the Scripture to be a Purse, provided the Purses Mouth were tied up with a Knot of such a mysterious contrivance, that none could open it but those who knew the Mind of the Bequeather; and that the Church, to which it was left as a Legacy, had knowledge of his Mind, and so could open it, whilst Others only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed themselves more while they went about it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Point then between Us, is, whether the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were left only to the Church to Interpret it to the People in all Points; or whether it were intended for the general good of the whole Church, so as thereby to direct themselves in their Way to Heaven; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, whether it may not be opened and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by all Persons in Matters that are necessary to their Salvation.</p>
            <p>One would think by the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Scripture, keeping it so much out of the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:66277:46"/>
Peoples hands, and talking so much of the Danger and Mischief that comes by it, that they did esteem it just as the Old <hi>Romans</hi> did the <hi>Sybillin</hi> Oracles, which were to be kept up from the view of the People, and only to be consulted in Cases of great Difficulty, and no farther Questions were to be asked, but what the Keepers of them declared to be their meaning, was to be so received without any farther Examination. And this is the Sense of the Politicians of that Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Scripture.</p>
            <p>But when they have written like <hi>Divines,</hi> and have been driven to state the Controversie truly, they have been forced to such Concessions, as have overthrown the <hi>Political Hypothesis.</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="1">I. They cannot deny, that the Scripture was design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a Certain and Infallible Rule of Faith to all. This <hi>Bellarmin</hi> proves in the beginning of his Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bell. de Verbo Dei</hi> l. 1.2.</note> where he shews at large, That the Law was the Rule in the <hi>Old Testament. To the Law, and to the Testimony. Blessed are they that search thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> &amp;c. That in the <hi>New Testament</hi> Christ proves his Doctrine by the Scriptures, and refers the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees to the Scriptures, and confuted the Sadduces out of them. That the Apostles direct Christians to honour, and esteem, and to rely upon them. And then he proves, that a Rule of Faith must be Certain and Known; and for the Scriptures, he saith, <hi>Nihil est Notius, nihil Certius.</hi> Nothing is more Known, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more Certain. How can this be, if there be such <hi>Mystical Knots which tye it together, that none but the Church-Guides can unloose?</hi> How can this then ever be so Known, as to be a Rule of Faith to the People? And not meerly <hi>a Rule, but a most Certain and Safe Rule.</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:66277:46"/>
Which is the greatest Non-sense in the World, if it cannot be understood by those, who are to make it their Rule. They may as well say, That <hi>Algebra</hi> was a Rule for Masons and Carpenters, and a <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Staff for a Taylor's Measure.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> hath beaten his Brains so long about <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Rulers,</hi> and that which is <hi>ruled</hi> and <hi>regulated</hi> by them, that we must not expect that he should be tied down to Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Notions; and therefore I must consider what he saith, after above Twenty years hard labour about these things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He tells me plainly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Third Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> p. 81.</note> 
               <hi>I quite mistake the meaning of the word Rule. For</hi> (saith he) <hi>it speaks Rectitude.</hi> No doubt a Right Rule doth. <hi>But still I mistake his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> How so? There must be a <hi>Rectitude</hi> in the Rule. <hi>That is not it.</hi> What then? <hi>It must be evident Rectitude, i. e.</hi> Evident to be Right. <hi>Not so.</hi> I hope we shall come at it at last. <hi>It is such an Evident Rectitude as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves those who regulate themselves by it from Obliquity or Deviation, that is, in our Case, from Errour.</hi> And is this the wonderful Mystery? There wants but one Word to make it past dispute, <hi>viz.</hi> who <hi>effectually regulate themselves by it.</hi> For <hi>Regulating</hi> is an ambiguous Word, and may be taken, either 1. For what a Man takes and professes to be his <hi>Rule</hi> which he is to act by; so a <hi>Ciceronian regulates</hi> himself by <hi>Cicero, i. e.</hi> he declares his <hi>Manner of Speech</hi> to be the <hi>Rule</hi> he orders his Speech by. And yet it is very possible that such a Man may use Phrases which are not <hi>Cicero</hi>'s, for want of sufficient Skill and Care. 2. For what he doth in Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to his Rule. And so he doth <hi>Regulate</hi> himself by <hi>Cicero,</hi> who doth not in the least swerve from his Manner of Speaking. But <hi>Cicero</hi> is the Rule to both these. And so the Question here comes to this, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:66277:47"/>
that can be said to be a true Intellectual Rule, which Men through their own default, and not through any defect in the Rule, may deviate from? If a Rule be in it self Certain, and be certainly received for a Rule, that is surely enough to make it a Rule to a Man; but it is not necessary to the being of a Rule, that a Man can never deviate from it by his own Fault. For, there is no Intellectual Rule can be assigned, but it is possible for a free Agent to deviate from; although he do at the same time profess it to be his Rule. Do not all Christians agree the Commands of Christ to be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Rule of Life? And <hi>J. S.</hi> by his admirable Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick will either prove this not to be a Rule, or that it is impossible for Men to Sin. For, saith he, <hi>A Rule speaks Rectitude, and that such an evident one as preserves those who regulate themselves by it from Obliquity or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation.</hi> Yes, saith he, this is very plain, those who Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate themselves by Christ's Rule, cannot Sin; I grant it, those who do effectually Regulate themselves by it; but Others may profess this to be their Rule, and the most Infallible Rule of Life, and yet through their own Fault may deviate from it. So here Persons may own the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be a most Certain &amp; Infallible Rule as to Truth and Falshood; and they are sure while they effectually <hi>regulate</hi> themselves by it, they can never Err; but while they profess to do it, they may. So that all Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s Subtilty vanishes into nothing, by so plain and easie a Distinction. Therefore I am still of the mind, that a Rule of Faith is that whereby we are to judge what we are bound to believe as to Divine Revelations. No, saith <hi>J. S.</hi> I ought to have said, <hi>It is that by which, while we follow it, we shall be absolutely secured from erring in Faith.</hi> This follows from the <hi>Rectitude</hi> of the Rule, that while Men keep to it, they cannot Err;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:66277:47"/>
but it doth not follow from the Nature of the Rule, that Men must necessarily follow it. For is it possible for Men to misunderstand a Certain Rule or not? <hi>i. e.</hi> such a Rule which if they truly follow, they shall be secured from Erring: If not, then the Rule must be plain and evident to all Capacities, to such a degree, that they cannot fail in judging by it. If it be possible, then, although the Rule be in it self Certain and Infallible, yet it is possible for Men to Err through such a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, and while they think they follow the Rule, they may run into Errour. And it is strange to me, that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> in all this time hath not discerned the Fallacy that hath misled him. If it hath really misled him, and not been set up by him, on purpose to Confound and Confute Hereticks, as he tells the Cardinals at <hi>Rome.</hi> But one of that Number hath fully proved, as I have shewed already, that the Scripture was intended for a Rule of Faith to the People; and then it follows from <hi>J. S.</hi> himself, that while they Regulate themselves by it, they can never Err. What Reason then can be given, why such a Rule of Faith should be kept from them? And the Purse be tied up with so many Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Knots, which are utterly inconsistent with the Notion of a Rule of Faith.</p>
            <p n="2">II. They grant, that there is a great difference in the Points contained in Scripture; of which some are allowed to be <hi>simply necessary to Salvation</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bellar. de Verbo Dei,</hi> l. 4. c. 11.</note> as those which are required to Baptism; and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> yields, <hi>That all these Points are certainly contained in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and were the things which the Apostles constantly preached to all People.</hi> Who cannot be denied to have been capable of Understanding these things, when they heard them preached; and how could they lose the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:66277:48"/>
Capacity of Understanding them when they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten? And if they might still Understand them, then the Scripture hath no such <hi>Mysterious Knots,</hi> but all Points necessary to Salvation may be understood by the People. So that as to these Points of greatest Importance, the Scripture must be left as a Legacy to all Christians, and not only to the Guides of the Church.</p>
            <p>But <hi>J. S.</hi> craves leave to Explain himself; and it is great pity to deny it him.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Third Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> p. 44.</note> 
               <hi>Mistake me not,</hi> saith he, <hi>I do not mean Scriptures Letter is not clear in such Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages as concern Morality, or the X Commandments; nor in Matters of Fact, as the Marks or Signs of the Messias foretold by the Prophets</hi>; (Methinks the <hi>Mysterious Knots</hi> should have been about <hi>Prophecies,) nor in Parables explained by himself and such like; but in Dogmatical Points or Tenets, which are Spiritual, and oftentimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Mysteries, as a Trinity, Christ's Godhead, the Real Presence of his Body in the Sacrament, and such like; and in such as these our Rule is not intelligible enough to keep the Followers of it from Erring.</hi> I Answer, Either the Apostles Preached these Points to all Persons as <hi>necessary to their Salvation,</hi> or they did not. If not, how come they to be <hi>necessary</hi> to be believed now? If they did, then the People were capable of Understanding them when they heard them, and therefore may as well understand them when they read them. I do not mean the <hi>Manner</hi> as to the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Incarnation</hi> (as to <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> I know nothing in Scripture about it either as to <hi>Thing</hi> or <hi>Manner</hi>) but the Revelation of such a Doctrine. So that if these Points be owned to be <hi>necessary to Salvation,</hi> they must be so plain that Men may understand their Duty to believe them. For, that is the Bound I keep my self within, that all things Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to Salvation, are so plain, that we may be certain
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:66277:48"/>
of our Duty to believe them; but if not, we may Err without Prejudice to our Salvation.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>S.</hi> asks <hi>what I mean by all things necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Nothing but what all others do mean by it.<note place="margin">Pag. 48.</note> 
               <hi>Did Christ</hi> (saith he) <hi>teach any unnecessary Points?</hi> Alas for him! But are all Points taught by Christ, or written in Scripture, equally necessary to the Salvation of all People? No, he saith presently after, <hi>That he will grant that fewer means than the Knowledge of all Christ taught, may suffice for the Salvation of some particular Persons.</hi> Very well; now I hope he will make some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the main business in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> To prove that Absolute Certainty of all that Christ Taught, is Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to Mens Salvation, when he grants that some may be Saved, without so much as <hi>Knowing all that Christ Taught.</hi> To what purpose was all this Heat about the Certainty of our Faith, as to all that Christ Taught, if at last some may be Saved without so much as Knowing it? How doth Mr. <hi>S.</hi> prove, That those <hi>some</hi> are only the Ignorant People in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; but that all Ours are tied to no less than Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Certainty of all that Christ Taught. He would have done well, to have proved such a Privilege for Ignorance to have been limited to their Communion; and that no Claim can be allowed as to the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of any other particular Persons. <hi>Some few</hi> (he saith again) <hi>may be Saved without the Knowledge of such and such Points,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 48.</note> 
               <hi>slender Motives being enough for their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.</hi> I thank Mr. <hi>S.</hi> for this. It seems the Point as to <hi>Salvation</hi> is gained, unless particular Persons among us can be proved to be none of these few. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are, it seems <hi>they may be Saved</hi>; but I hope, not without True and Saving Faith; whence it follows, that such Faith hath no necessary Relation to these
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:66277:49"/>
high Points; and there is no need of Infallible Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, as to them, of all Christ Taught. One of these high Points, is that of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi>; too high for me and Thousands and Millions besides, ever to apprehend, let us do our utmost; nay we cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend (such is our dulness) that we can have any Certainty, as to Sense or Reason, if we hold it. We hope therefore <hi>J. S.</hi> will enlarge his Number, and not talk only of <hi>some Few that may be Saved</hi> without the Knowledge of such deep Mysteries; we desire to be admitted into his Number, for truly our Capacities can never be stretched so far, as to comprehend the Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Transubstantiation. Suppose <hi>our Motives be slender,</hi> yet they are such as move us to that degree, that we cannot overcome the Reluctancies of Sense, and Reason, and Revelation, and Tradition against it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note>But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> brings himself off with a <hi>Salvo; Though all Points are not necessary for every particular Person, yet all of them are necessary for the Body of the Church, whose Pastors are to Instruct their Children in them, and apply the Efficacy of them to their Souls, as their Capacities admit, and Exigencies require.</hi> It seems still they are not Necessary to particular Persons, but according to their Capacities and Exigencies, but <hi>they are to the Body of the Church.</hi> But how came they to be Necessary to the Body of the Church? For Instance, The Point of Transubstantiation is a very deep Point; and although particular Persons may be Saved without believing it, yet I cannot understand how this deep Point comes to be Necessary, in any Respect, for the Body of the Church. I hope <hi>J. S.</hi> will not deny this to be one of his Necessary Church-Points: Let him then shew, how it comes to be so <hi>Necessary for the Pastors of the Church to Instruct their Children in it.</hi> My <hi>Capacity,</hi> I assure him,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:66277:49"/>
will not reach to this, and therefore I hope I may be excused; and in his own words, my mind is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>being cultivated by such elevating Considerations.</hi> I do not believe there is any such danger of <hi>the Flocks dying,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 49.</note> 
               <hi>or falling short of their full growth they might have had in the Plentiful Pasturage of the Church,</hi> as <hi>J. S.</hi> elegantly speaks, if they do not believe <hi>Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or any such <hi>deep Points.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But still <hi>we have no Absolute Certainty of our highest Fundamentals.</hi> No? We affirm the Contrary; and from Absolutely Certain Grounds. It is <hi>Absolutely Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> that whatever God Reveals is true, and ought to be believed by us. And we are, as absolutely Certain as Scripture and Reason can make us, that God hath Revealed the Fundamentals of our Faith. <hi>But there is Experience to the Contrary.</hi> What Experience? That we are not Certain? We affirm that we are; and who can tell best? How comes Mr. <hi>S.</hi> to know we are not Certain when we say we are? <hi>But all are not, as Socinians,</hi> &amp;c. What are they to us? Are not we cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, because some are not <hi>Certain?</hi> What pittiful Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning is this? Is Mr. <hi>S.</hi> Certain of his <hi>Infallible Ground</hi> of Certainty, <hi>Oral Tradition? Why do I ask such a Question?</hi> For very good Reason; because there are some not Certain of it, and even in his own Church; but cry out upon it, as Fallible, Fallacious, Dangerous, and Destructive of Faith, and leading to Atheism. From whence it follows, on Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s. Principles, that he cannot be Certain himself, because others are not. Nay, it is impossible he should have any Certainty on his own Grounds. For he can have no Rule of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, as I shall evidently prove from his own Words. A Rule must have <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi>; Absolute Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty there cannot be where Persons are left uncertain;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:66277:50"/>
but there are many in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that not only doubt of his Rule of Infallible Certainty, but utterly deny it, and dispute against it. How is it then possible, for him to be certain of it on his own Grounds?</p>
            <p>But it is time to proceed to another Objection against our Rule of Faith.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Third Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Page,</hi> 50.</note>VIII. <hi>J. S.</hi> saith, <hi>We can be no more certain of our Rule, than we are of the Truth of the Letter of Scripture; but we cannot be certain we have the Right Letter, unless we have a Right Translation, and that must be from a true Copy; no Copy can be true, unless Conformable to the Original; and if there be any failure in any of these, nay, if we have not absolute Certainty of all these, we cannot have any ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Certainty of our Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Objection,</hi> those of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who believe Scripture to be a Rule of Faith, (though not the Complete) are concerned to Answer, as well as we. For, the Matters of Faith contained in Scripture are convey'd to their Minds after the same manner. But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> saith <hi>Their Case is different from ours.</hi> Do not they make the <hi>Vulgar Translation Authentick?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 51.</note> And will not the same Objections then lie against all those who rely upon it? Let us see how <hi>J. S.</hi> clears this Matter: 1. <hi>The Canon of the Books comes down,</hi> saith he, <hi>by the Testimony of all Christian Churches, that are truly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</hi> And we say, the Canon of the Books comes down by the Concurrent Testimony of all Christian Churches, however differing in other things. And herein, I think, we have much the advantage. For, we do not except against the Testimony of any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches; nor condemn them as not truly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian till their Cause be better heard and examin'd. 2. <hi>The Doctrine of Christ,</hi> saith he, <hi>transfused into the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:66277:50"/>
hearts of the faithful, both taught them how,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 51.</note> 
               <hi>and obliged them to correct the Copy in those particular Texts that concerned Faith.</hi> What is this, but in plain terms to expose the Scriptures to the Scorn and Contempt of Atheists and Infidels? Who would desire no better a Conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion than this, that the Scripture hath been corrected in Matters of Faith, according to the Faith of the Church. If this be granted, it is impossible to prove that we have any true Original Texts, <hi>in Matters of Faith:</hi> For if the Church did correct the Copy in those particular Texts, which concerned Faith, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Sense of the faithful; then the Church in every Age might so correct it: and consequently we can never be sure, that the Texts continue the same for any two Ages together; unless it be first proved im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for the Sense of the Church to vary in any two Ages; or of those who think themselves bound to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Texts. And I should be very sorry to have my Faith rest upon such a slippery Foundation. I will put the Case, as to the <hi>Arian Controversie.</hi> How was it possible for the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers to have convinced the <hi>Arians</hi> on such a Supposition as this?
<q>You alledge several Texts of Scripture, might they say, to prove the Godhead of Christ, and his Equality with the Father; but how can we know that these were Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Texts, and not corrected by the Guides of the Church then, according to their own Sense? We do not deny that there were some leading Men of this Opinion, and having gained a Party to themselves, they corrected the <hi>Texts</hi> according to it: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can never be satisfied, that these were the Original Texts, because we can bring down a Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a contrary Sense from the Apostles times.</q>
I do not see what satisfaction they could ever receive,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:66277:51"/>
if this pernicious Principle be allowed, that the Texts were to be corrected in Matters that concern Faith, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Sense of the Church. But he saith it is, <hi>If any Errour, through the carelesness, unattentiveness, or malice of the Translators, or Transcribers at any time had crept in.</hi> This doth not one jot mend the Matter. For if the Faith of the present Church be the Rule, then the Texts are to be corrected according to it, and the blame to be laid on the Carelesness or Malice of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slators and Transcribers. This is a miserable Account of the <hi>Certainty of Texts of Scripture in Points of Faith</hi>; As to <hi>other Texts of inferiour concern,</hi> as he speaks, <hi>they could be best corrected, by multitudes of other ancient Copies, the Churches Care still going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, as was shewn in the highest manner, by the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>that so it might be as exact as Human Diligence could well render it.</hi> As to multitudes of Copies they serve us as well as them; but as to the Care of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> I am by no means sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. For 1. They went no farther than a Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and declared that Authentick; without due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Original Text. 2. The Care taken was not so exact; for then <hi>Clemens</hi> the Eighth did great Injury to <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fifth, when he recalled and corrected his Bibles in so many Places after <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fifth, had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished his for an Exact Edition. 3. There are still complaints in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of want of Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the Vulgar Latin. 4. After all this is but <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Diligence,</hi> and no such <hi>Absolute Certainty,</hi> as <hi>J. S.</hi> requires from us.</p>
            <p>But it may be, he will say, <hi>That he doth not at all make it his Rule of Faith</hi>; Let him declare so much; and then we know what to Answer. <hi>This is still putting off.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will give a distinct Answer.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:66277:51"/>I. We do utterly deny that it is in any Churches Power <hi>to correct Original Texts, because they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Sense of the present Church</hi>; or any Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations any farther, than they differ from the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals. And I do not know any assertion that shakes more our Faith, as to the Scripture, than this of <hi>J. S.</hi> doth.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The early Appeals made to <hi>Scripture</hi> in Matters of Faith, by the Writers of the Christian Church, make us Certain that there could be no such <hi>Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> or <hi>Corrections</hi> of the Texts, according to these use of the Correctors. As for Instance, we find the Places produced against the <hi>Arians</hi> used before against the <hi>Samosatenians</hi> and <hi>Artemonites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be said, <hi>They might correct the Fathers to</hi> I answer, That there is no imaginable Ground for any such suspicion; because the Fathers lived in distant Places and Countries, and therefore when their Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies agree about some places of Scripture alledged by them, there can be no Reason to suspect any Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption or Alteration of the Text. As for Instance, no one Text of the whole New Testament, hath been more suspected than that of 1 S. <hi>John</hi> 5.7. <hi>There are three that bear Record in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. And it cannot be denied, that there hath been great variety, both in the Greek and Latin Manuscripts about it; yea, there was so in S. <hi>Jeroms</hi> time, as appears by his Preface to the Canonical Epistles; who charges the leaving it out to the unfaithfulness of the Translators. S. <hi>Jerom</hi> is cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out upon as a Party in this Controversie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is said on the other side, that he put it in as favouring his own Opinion. But his Integrity is vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated herein,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>S. Cyprian. de <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nit. Epist. ad Jubai.</hi>
               </note> because S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> so long before the <hi>Arian Controversie</hi> produced this Place. So that our
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:66277:52"/>
Certainty as to Scripture doth not depend upon the meer Letter, but upon comparing the best and most antient Copies, with the Writings of the Fathers, who still made use of the Scriptures in all Discourses and Debates about Matters of Faith.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>Readings</hi> in Matters that are not of Faith, cannot hinder our Certainty in Matters of Faith. We do not pretend, that there is no kind of variety in the Copies of the New Testament; but I am of Opinion that this rather establishes than weakens our Faith. For, considering the great Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of them, and how insignificant they are, it shews that this Book was liable to the common Accidents of Books; but yet, that there is no such variety, as to make one suspect any Fraud or Design in the Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that appear in the Manuscript Copies. And as to Translations that have been made among us, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who are not able to examin them by the Originals, have no Reason to suspect them, as to any Matter of Faith. Not meerly from the Skill and Integrity of the Persons, and the Care that hath been taken, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was so much the Concernment of some Men to have lessen'd the Credit of our Translations, as much as was possible, and they have not been able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any thing that might shake the Faith of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering Man.</p>
            <p>If it be said after all, This is but <hi>Human Faith,</hi> and not <hi>Divine</hi>; I answer,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. We must be careful to distinguish the Certainty of <hi>Human</hi> and <hi>Divine Faith</hi> in this Matter. We do not pretend that we have an Absolute Divine Certainty of things that are only capable of Human Certainty; and we do not say, that we have only Human Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of things capable of <hi>Divine Certainty.</hi> If the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:66277:52"/>
Question be put concerning the <hi>Objects</hi> of <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> then we do answer, That we have a <hi>Divine Certainty</hi> of them from those things, which are the proper Evidence of Divine Revelation. We believe the Doctrine of Christ with a Divine Faith, because it was confirmed by Miracles and Prophecies: We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the New Testament to be written by the Holy Spirit, because the Promise of the Spirit was fulfilled upon them; and especially in a thing of so great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to the whole Christian Church. But if the Question be asked only concerning a Matter of Fact, as whether the Books that bear such Names were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Persons, whose Names they bear; then I can have no greater Certainty than belongs to a Matter of Fact; but then it is so circumstantiated, that I have a greater and more absolute Certainty, as to this, then any other Matter of Fact which wants the Proofs that this hath. And if as to Books, and Copies, and Translations, we have as high a Certainty, as the thing is capable of, it is madness to expect and require more. For where there is but a Human Testimony, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the Certainty of Divine Faith, which must not only have a Divine Object, but must rest on a Divine Testimony; but where the Testimony is <hi>Human,</hi> the Certainty must be such as relates to the highest of that kind. But still, such a Faith may have Absolute Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of its kind; and although in regard of its Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony it be Human Faith, yet in regard both of its <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> its <hi>inward Cause,</hi> and its <hi>Effects,</hi> it may be truly call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Divine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">IX. The last <hi>Objection</hi> is, concerning <hi>the Number of Canonical Books.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Third Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> p. 58.</note> 
               <hi>Pray satisfie us</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>S.) about this exact Number of Books; and how many will just serve
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:66277:53"/>
turn.</hi> One would think by his Objections, <hi>J. S.</hi> were preparing Matter for the <hi>Critical History</hi> of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> he seems so concerned to lessen the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of it. But I shall Answer the Objections he offers.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">Page 56.</note>1. <hi>There may have been Books lost that were written by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons divinely inspir'd, and we have no unanimous Consent of the Christian Church that there is none lost; and those Books might contain Matters different from, or to be super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to the Canon we have now; and without this, we can have no Certainty, that the Books we have now, contained all the Divine Revelations.</hi> I Answer,</p>
            <p n="1">I. If we have the unanimous Consent of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, that we have the Canon of the <hi>New Testament</hi> entire, then we have their Consent, that there is no Book, written by Divine Inspiration, lost. And this appears by the Contest in the IV. Century, about the just Number of the Canonical Books; The Churches then differ'd about some Books not then Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally receiv'd; as the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> in some, and the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in others. Which shews, that the Churches were then so solicitous to preserve any Books that appear'd to be written by Persons Inspir'd, that although these did then want Universal Consent, yet they were still kept, and read, and dispers'd, till upon further Examination they came to be Universally read. It is not therefore in the least probable they should suffer any Apostolical Writings to be lost.</p>
            <p n="2">II. This is to charge the Christian Church with so gross a Neglect, as overthrows the force of all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for Tradition. For we must suppose an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Writing sent to some Church by Direction of the Holy Spirit, and yet that Church be so noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:66277:53"/>
careless, as to lose a Book containing in it many Points of Faith; now I appeal to any one of common Sense, whether he could trust their Word for Matters of Faith, who could be so negligent as to lose a great many Points of Faith at once. And the more such a Book were dispersed, the Argument is still stronger against <hi>Tradition.</hi> Besides, this shews the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency of Oral Tradition, if these Points of Faith are lost; because such a Book was lost, wherein they were contained. If Tradition had been so effectual a Means of Conveying Matters of Faith, it should have appear'd in such a Case, <hi>viz.</hi> in preserving such Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, though the Books were lost: But we find nothing like this, so much as pretended. Although it were much easier pretended than proved.</p>
            <p n="3">III. This is to suppose the Providence of God not to be immediately concerned in preserving Books writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Divine Inspiration. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> doth really suppose that Books written by Divine Inspiration may have been lost, or at least that we cannot prove that they are not: But we think it a considerable Proof, that they could not, because the Divine Providence doth so immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it self in preserving that which tends so much to the Good of his Church. <hi>If a Hair doth not fall from our Heads, nor a Sparrow fall on the Ground,</hi> without the Providence of God (as our Saviour affirms) is it not very unreasonable to suppose that a Divine Book,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.29, 30.</note> written for the Benefit of the Christian Church, should be wholly lost? Especially considering the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Care the first Christians took, in Times of the greatest Persecutions, to preserve the Scriptures; and no force or violence could extort them out of their hands. On Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s Supposition, it was no hard Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:66277:54"/>
for a Book of Scripture to be lost, <hi>viz.</hi> if the several Books had been committed to the Custody of some Men in Trust for the whole Church; but if we consider the things as they really were, it will appear hardly possible. For the Books were not kept up at first in a few hands, but dispersed abroad in multitudes of Copies, and received with mighty Veneration both on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Authors of them, and the Matters contained in them. They were read both in Publick and in Private, they heard them in their Assemblies, and they made them their constant Imployment at home; they were their Rule of Life, as well as of Faith. And how is it possible to suppose any Book so received, so esteemed, so dispersed, so constantly read, could be suffer'd to be lost among Christians?</p>
            <p>If it be Objected, <hi>That they were not all so esteemed at first, as appears by the Epistle to the Hebrews, and therefore might more easily be lost</hi>; I Answer, That however they were not universally received at first, yet they were by those Churches to whom they were written; and among them they were not kept up, but mightily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed; so that there was no way to lose them, from the first spreading of them abroad; unless we can suppose such multitudes of Christians to conspire together to suppress a Book of so great Concernment to themselves. As if Persons who claim an Estate by virtue of some Deeds, should all agree to imbezel them, or any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial part of them. Here was no pretence for Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and Abridgments, which some make use of to lessen the Authority of the Books of the <hi>Old Testament</hi>; for here we have the very Authentick Writings of the Apostles, and their own Epistles in their own style and Expressions. And supposing the Churches, to whom they were sent, to have received them as their Writings,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:66277:54"/>
and to have communicated them to others, as they did, I do not see, under these Circumstances, how a Book, containing Divine Revelations, could be lost.</p>
            <p n="2">II. He Objects,<note place="margin">Page 58.</note> 
               <hi>That the Canon of Scripture was not entire, but deficient for some hundreds of years, till the whole Canon was collected and acknowledged, and therefore so long the Church had no Perfect Rule of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Answer,</p>
            <p n="1">I. I distinguish between a Compleat Rule of Faith, and a Compleat Canon of Scripture. For, if the Books owned and universally received, contain in them all Matters of Faith, then the Rule of Faith is Compleat, although some particular Books may be still in Dispute. As for Instance, it is certain, that in St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Time, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did not receive as Canonical the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>; Had not that Church therefore a Compleat Rule of Faith? If God hath so abundantly provided for his Church, that there may be a full Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of all Points of Faith in the rest, then the dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Authority of such an Epistle, doth not dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the Compleatness of the Rule of Faith. For, if they have all Points of Faith, they must have a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. It is no Prejudice to the true Canon of Scripture, that some particular Books of the <hi>New Testament</hi> were for some time disputed by some particular Churches. For, if it were done without Ground, it doth reflect more on those Churches than on those Books; especially when those very Churches afterwards received them. And this was the Case of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>: St. <hi>Jerom</hi> affirms, <hi>That not
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:66277:55"/>
only the Greek Churches all received it,</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>but that all the Ancient Writers did so; and not meerly as an Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical, but as a Canonical Epistle.</hi> Therefore this must be a late thing in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; and in probability, began upon the <hi>Novatian</hi> Controversie, which Epistle was thought too much to favour the <hi>Novatian</hi> Doctrine; and when that <hi>Controversie</hi> did abate, that <hi>Epistle</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered its <hi>Authority</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> is angry with me,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Third Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> p. 57.</note> 
               <hi>for reflecting on the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>for not receiving the Epistle to the Hebrews in St.</hi> Jerom<hi>'s Time; which</hi> (he thinks) <hi>was an Act of Prudence, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to the Judgment or Determination of any Church, whether Greek or Latin.</hi> One may see by this how well versed he is in the Canon of Scripture, when St. <hi>Jerom</hi> declares, that not only all the Greek Writers received it, but all the Ancient, and that as <hi>Canonical.</hi> Was here no antecedent Judgment of the Church in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Doth not the Consent of all Ancient Writers, even in St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Time, make a Judgment of the Church? But he adds, <hi>That what I make a heinous Crime in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>was a commendable Caution in it.</hi> That which I said, was, That it hence appear'd, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was far from being believed then to have the Authority of making the Canon of Scripture, or being Infallible in Faith. And what saith <hi>J. S.</hi> in Answer to this? Not one Syllable, but runs it off to another thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But why do I not as well blame the Greek Churches for not receiving the Apocalypse?</hi> They do not pretend to such Authority and Infallibility in this Matter, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth. I do not deny that there were some Greeks then to blame in rejecting the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse, but <hi>Bellarmin</hi> saith, they were but few and obscure Persons; and he produces the Testimonies of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:66277:55"/>
               <hi>Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Theophilus Antiochenus, Melito Sardensis, Dionysius Alexandrinus, Clemens Alexandrinus, Origen</hi> and <hi>Athanasius,</hi> all approving it. And the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of disputing it arose from the Millenary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which some thought they could not confute, as long as the Apocalypse had such Authority in the Church.</p>
            <p>And such Disputes as these, which wore off by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, are no real Prejudice to the Canon of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> which was at first generally received; and although some few Books were contested for a time, yet they recover'd their Authority, and have ever since been received by the Universal Consent of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches.</p>
            <p n="3">III. He Objects against this Universal Consent, the <hi>Testimonies of</hi> Marcion, Ebion, Valentinus, Cerinthus,<note place="margin">

All that I said, was, We have the Universal Consent of all Christian Churches for the Canon of the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> i. e.

            <p>

               <note place="margin">Page 74.</note>To this he gives no other Answer, <hi>but that my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Fifth Question, is co-incident with that to the Fourth.</hi> I thought <hi>J. S.</hi> in the Self-evident way, would have liked my Answer the better for it. But he doth not comprehend the design of it. I had said before, That we relied on the Universal Testimony of the Christian Church; upon that the Question was asked, What I meant by the Christian Church: My Answer was, <hi>That it was that which was made up of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches</hi>; i. e. saith <hi>J. S. That all the Parts make the Whole</hi>; and what Incongruity is there? When Mr. <hi>G.</hi> said, That the Christian Church may be taken in several Latitudes, he desired to know in what Sense I took it; and could I answer him more directly than to tell him, I took it in the largest Sense, as it was made up of all the Parts; and not in such a Sense as they do, who give the Denomination of the Whole to a Part?<note place="margin">Page 75.</note> 
               <hi>But by this I do not seclude all Hereticks.</hi> I do not take upon me to judge of all the Bodies of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in the World, whether they be justly charged with Heresie or not; but I take them only as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and from their Universal Consent, I prove the Certainty of the Canon of Scripture. <hi>Hereby I profess a Brotherhood with Excrementitious Outcasts.</hi> I know not what <hi>Brotherhood</hi> lies in making use of their Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but I had rather do it, than with unsufferable Pride and Folly call so many Bodies of Christians; for whom Christ died, <hi>Excrementitious Outcasts.</hi> But although he seems to own that their Testimony doth strengthen the Evidence for the Canon of the <hi>New Testament</hi>; yet he calls it back again,<note place="margin">Page 76.</note> and for extraordinary Reasons. 1. <hi>They may have corrupted the Letter of Scripture, although they may allow of the Books.</hi> Let us then take their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony for the Books, and examine the Letter after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.

               <note place="margin">Page 57.</note> 
               <hi>but we must have Assurance not only of each Verse, but of each significant Word in the Verse.</hi> How hardly are some Men satisfied about the Certainty of Scripture! Are there not different Copies in all Parts to examin and compare, if there be cause of Mistrust; and if there be none, What Prejudice is this to our Certainty? At this rate, Men may argue against every thing; and that there can be no Certainty of any Writing, unless the Person stood by and saw the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor write; and even then he might question his Senses too. These Objections do indeed lead to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable Scepticism in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 76.</note> 3. <hi>The Judges suspect the Justness of the Cause, if known Knights of the Post are called in to corroborate the Evidence.</hi> What a desperate Cause is that, which forces Men to fling such Dirt in the Face of so many Christian Churches? And that without the least Evidence or Proof against them. How come all the <hi>Greek, Abyssine, Coptick, Oriental</hi> Christians, to be compared to <hi>Knights of the Post,</hi> because they afford a Concurrent Testimony with us about the Canon of the <hi>New Testament?</hi> They may be the honestest and best Part of Christendom, for any thing <hi>J.

It is not enough for you to say, They are all accounted Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks or Schismaticks by you; for we that know how unjust and unreasonable your Censures are so near home, have no Cause to regard them at such a distance.</p>
            <p>Thus I have Answered all the Objections I have met with in <hi>J. S.</hi> against our Rule of Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:66277:57"/>I now come to the last part of my Task, which is to examin the Arguments produced to prove the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi> of <hi>Oral</hi> and <hi>Practical Tradition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">First Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter p. 8.</note>The main Argument is thus set down by Mr. <hi>S. All Traditionary Christians believe the same to day which they did yesterday, and so up to the time of our Blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; and if they follow this Rule, they can never err in Faith, and therefore are Infallible. And they could not innovate in Faith, unless they did forget what they held the day before, or out of malice after it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the Parts of this Argument Mr. <hi>S.</hi> endeavours to shew to be <hi>Self-evident</hi>; but in truth it is a <hi>Self-evident Fallacy</hi>; as I shall shew at large. But before I particularly lay it open, I must consider what he saith against the Method I used in the Conference for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering it.</p>
            <p>I then thought, and do still, that the clearest An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to an Argument, which proves a thing impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was to bring an undeniable Instance that such a thing really was, which was proved impossible to be. And to this purpose I produced <hi>the Instance of the Greek Church, which professed to follow Tradition, and yet they could not deny to have erred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Mr. <hi>S.</hi> saith, <hi>Is giving no Answer at all; for this is no Answer to his Argument,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 10.</note> 
               <hi>but producing a new Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against him.</hi> And he magisterially tells me, <hi>That it is my turn to answer; and therefore I am confined to</hi> Concedo, Nego <hi>or</hi> Distinguo: <hi>as the Propositions are either true, false or ambiguous, or I may deny the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, if I find more terms in the Conclusion than in the Premisses. But these are my Bounds which I must not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</hi> But with submission to these Logicians, I answer, That where an Argument is designed to prove a thing
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:66277:57"/>
impossible, which is contrary to Sense and Experience, the producing an evident Instance is the plainest and shortest way of Answering; as well as in an Induction which is allowed to be disproved by a plain Instance. As in the Case of <hi>Zeno</hi>'s Argument against Motion; <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> his Moving was a far more effectual Answer, than if he had stood a great while with his <hi>Concedo, Nego</hi> and <hi>Distinguo.</hi> J. S. confesses, <hi>That the vanity of</hi> Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no<hi>'s Argument was not ill ridiculed by</hi> Diogenes <hi>his moving before him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 11.</note> And why might not I then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the vanity of this Demonstration by the Instance of the Greek Church; unless some fault be found in the Instance. <hi>He brings the Argument, and I an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance against it, what are People the wiser? and which shall they be for; the Argument or the Instance? Zeno</hi> brought his Argument, and <hi>Diogenes</hi> his Instance; were not By-standers the wiser, when it so apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved the foppery of the Argument? Doth <hi>J. S.</hi> think the vanity of it was not enough exposed by that means? But he saith, <hi>This is excepting against the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, when there lies none against the Premisses.</hi> No such Matter; for it shews there is a Fallacy in the Premisses: <hi>It is however but an Argument,</hi> ad hominem; call it what you will, so it doth my business;<note place="margin">Page 12.</note> to shew the vanity of the Demonstration. <hi>This way doth but sham an Adversary.</hi> And truly that is a great matter, if they be such as <hi>P.G. They are of no use for discovery of Truth.</hi> As much as laying open Sophistry helps to the discovery of Truth; which is not a little when we deal with Sophistical Disputers.</p>
            <p>But we come to the <hi>Instance.</hi> How doth he after all clear this Instance of the Greek Church? Doth he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that they hold to Tradition? No. Doth he deny that they have erred notwithstanding? All that he
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:66277:58"/>
saith is,<note place="margin">Page 13.</note> That P. G. <hi>was no ways obliged not to deny that the Greek Church had erred in Points of Faith.</hi> No? then he must grant that the Roman Church hath erred, for they contradict each other. Let him take his choice; one doth my business as well as the other, and more effectually destroys the pretence of Infallibility in the Roman Church. <hi>But I say, they did not err.</hi> What is my saying to the business in hand? Besides, there are other Points contradictorily held between the Greek and Roman Churches, besides that of the <hi>Filio<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan>
               </hi> and the Argument holds as well in any other, as in that. And therefore he must fix the Errour on one side or other.</p>
            <p>After all this flourishing he takes heart, and resolves to grapple with the Instance. <hi>Let us see what your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance will do.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 14.</note> Now I thought we shall have a direct Answer. But I am strangely disappointed. For he runs still back to that, <hi>That I do not believe it erred.</hi> Was the Instance brought against me, or against <hi>P. G? But his Answer doth not make or marr the business.</hi> The business of the Demonstration it doth, and that was my business. <hi>But this doth not prove that a Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Tradition errs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 15.</note> 
               <hi>unless I will grant that the Greek Church hath erred.</hi> What strange Trifling is this? The Dispute was about <hi>P. G</hi>'s. Argument, and not my Opinion. Is this the Answer to the Instance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Greek Church which Mr. <hi>M.</hi> promised? If this pass for an Answer, I think <hi>J. S.</hi> may defend <hi>Sure footing.</hi> I mentioned <hi>P. G</hi>'s. Answer, <hi>That the Greek Church followed Tradition till the</hi> Arians <hi>left that Rule, and took up a new one. And why saith</hi> J. S. <hi>hath he not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered well?</hi> Because he did not answer to the purpose; which was not about the <hi>Arians,</hi> but the present Greek Church. <hi>But a Church may follow Tradition at
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:66277:58"/>
one time, and leave it at another.</hi> Very true; but the Greek Church did not forsake Tradition, and yet erred. And therefore Tradition and Errour were found toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therein lies the force of this undeniable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. The rest is such Trifling, that I am really ashamed to answer it over and over. Still he attempts to give an Answer, and still fails; but it is something new, and therefore shall be considered. <hi>His Answer,</hi> saith <hi>J. S. holds as well as to the present as past Greek Church.</hi> His answer! Where is it?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Page</hi> 16.</note> 
               <hi>It was that those who err in Faith must leave Tradition.</hi> But the Greeks did not leave Tradition, and yet erred in Faith; so that the Instance holds good still. <hi>He denies that Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and Tradition can be found together in the Greek Church, or any other Ancient or Modern, i. e.</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion must be held against all the Instances in the World. <hi>But I ought to say, whether the differences were in matters of Faith.</hi> Yes, in such which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> accounts matters of Faith. <hi>But how can an erring Church still plead Tradition and adhere to it?</hi> Answer the Instance; for the Greek Church doth plead Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. <hi>But then pleading Tradition is no more but quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some Expressions of ancient Writers, as the</hi> Arians <hi>did:</hi> Not so neither; for the Greek Church relies most up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Tradition from Father to Son in Practise of any Church in the World. <hi>But if they adhere to Tradition, and that Tradition leads them to Christ, who could not err, how can they possibly err? For, pray did Christ teach any Errour?</hi> No certainly. <hi>When a Father believed what Christ taught him, and the Son what the Father believed, did not the Son too believe what Christ taught? Run it on to the last Son that shall be born in the World, must not every one believe what Christ taught, if every one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved what his Father believed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:66277:59"/>And so Goodnight to the Greek Church; we are come back to the Argument.<note place="margin">Page 19.</note> 
               <hi>I might as well have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced in the Latin Church it self.</hi> Truly I think so too; and so you shall find in a short time; and how little Advantage you get by such a Challenge.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Page 20.</note>
               <hi>But it is impossible for a Church to adhere to Tradition, and yet to Err; therefore if the present Greek Church have Erred, it has not adhered to Tradition; if it have adhered to Tradition, it hath not Erred.</hi> That is, the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment must be good, let the Instance be what it will. But an easie Distinction will shew the Weakness of this Argument.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adhering to Tradition</hi> may be taken Two ways.</p>
            <p n="1">I. For Adhering to Tradition, as the Rule and Means of Conveyance of Matters of Faith.</p>
            <p n="2">II. For actually Adhering to that very Doctrine which Christ taught, and hath ever since been truly convey'd down by Tradition.</p>
            <p>In this latter Sense we grant it impossible for Men to Err, while they actually adhere to that very Doctrine which Christ taught, and is supposed to be deliver'd down by Tradition. But this is not the Matter before us; which lies in these Two Points.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Whether Tradition be an Infallible Way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the Doctrine of Christ down to us.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Whether it be impossible for those who hold to This as Their Rule, to Err or not.</p>
            <p>And so the Answer is plain to the main Argument. If by <hi>Traditionary Christians,</hi> be meant such as adhere to that very Doctrine which Christ taught, and was
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:66277:59"/>
actually conveyed down to them, then such Traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Christians, so believing, cannot Err.</p>
            <p>But if by Traditionary Christians be meant such as take Tradition for an Infallible Rule of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Matters of Faith; then we say such Traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Christians may and have Erred: And that for Two Reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Because Tradition is no Infallible Rule.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Because although it were, yet Men might Err, either by mistaking it, or departing from it.</p>
            <p>But saith <hi>J. S.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 8.</note> 
               <hi>They cease to be Traditionary Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians if they do not believe the same to Day which they did Yesterday, and so up to Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If by Traditionary Christians be meant, they do not really believe what Christ taught, we grant it, that they are.</p>
            <p>If by <hi>Traditionary Christians</hi> be meant such as bear the Name of Traditionary Christians, and look on Tradition as their Rule, and imagine they have the same Faith which Christ taught; then they are still Traditionary Christians.</p>
            <p>And now I am to give a clear and distinct Answer to the <hi>Demonstration</hi> of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>Oral Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as it is managed by <hi>J. S.</hi> and taken into Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>All Traditionary Christians believe the same to day which they did yesterday, and so up to the time of our Blessed Saviour.</hi> J. S. <hi>hopes I have nothing to say to this</hi>; but he is mistaken. For I have many things to say to lay open the Notorious Fallacy of it in every Clause.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>All Traditionary Christians.</hi> Who are they? Are all <hi>Christians Traditionary Christians?</hi> This were to the purpose, if it could be proved. But how doth
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:66277:60"/>
this appear? Why is it not said, <hi>All Christians have gone upon this Principle?</hi> He knew this could never have been proved. And therefore he puts in the thing in dispute, and would have it taken for granted, that there were no other but <hi>Traditionary Christians.</hi> Which I deny, and I am certain he can never prove it. Suppose then that there were <hi>Christians</hi> not <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionary</hi> as well as <hi>Traditionary,</hi> the Proposition ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ridiculous; so far is it from Demonstration. <hi>Traditionary Christians</hi> believed so; <hi>Non-Traditionary Christians</hi> believed otherwise; and which are to be believed, is the Question; and that to be determined by the Certainty of the Ground they went upon; and so we are come to the Debate between <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Tradition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>All Traditionary Christians believe the same to Day which they did Yesterday.</hi> This is capable of a threefold meaning.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That they do actually believe the same to Day which they did Yesterday. Which is a meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent thing, and proves nothing. Or,</p>
            <p n="2">II. That they are bound to believe to Day, as they did Yesterday. And that may be on several Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Because they see Evidence from the Word of God to Day as well as they did Yesterday.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Or because their Guides of the Church teach them the same to Day which they did Yesterday, whom they believe to be Infallible.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Or, meerly because they receive it by an <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> and not on the other Accounts; and then
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:66277:60"/>
it proves no more than that they are bound to do it; and it is too well known that many fail to do what they are <hi>bound to.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or III. That they do Infallibly believe the same to Day which they did Yesterday. But then this ought to have been inserted in the Proposition, That Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary Christians cannot fail to believe to Day what they did Yesterday. If it be said, <hi>That this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in their being Traditionary Christians,</hi> then I say, the whole is a Fallacy of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for he supposes all true Christians to be <hi>Traditionary Christians,</hi> and then that they Infallibly hold to <hi>Tradition</hi> as their <hi>Rule,</hi> and from thence he proves <hi>Tradition</hi> to be <hi>Infallible.</hi> But if the Body of Christians may go upon another Rule, or if going upon Tradition, they may misun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it, then there is no inseparable connexion in the several Links of this Chain.</p>
            <p>And there is a further Fallacy in supposing that if any change in Faith happens, it must be as sudden and remarkable, as if all Men should <hi>to day refuse to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what they believed Yesterday.</hi> Whereas the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Opinions are oft-times wrought by insensible Degrees, and many concurrent Causes; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the very same Words may be used and the Faith altered, as in the Case of <hi>Merit, Sacraments, Sacrifice,</hi> &amp;c. which sheweth Men may continue the very same Terms, and yet believe quite a different thing. And where Changes are gradual, it is very unreasonable to pitch upon such a precise and narrow space of time, as between <hi>to Day</hi> and <hi>Yesterday.</hi> By the same Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, one may demonstrate it to be impossible that any Language should be changed; for People speak the same Language <hi>to Day which they did Yesterday</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:66277:61"/>
and the same <hi>Yesterday which they did the Day before,</hi> and so up to the very building of <hi>Babel</hi>; and yet we all know that Languages are continually changed, and to such a degree, that in some Ages they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not understand, what was at that time intelligible by all. In such cases, it is enough to assign the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Causes and Reasons of Alterations without fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a precise and determinate Time. And those I shall speak to afterwards.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>And so up to the time of our Blessed Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To prove any thing from hence it must be shewed,</p>
            <p n="1">I. That there can be no Pretence to Tradition ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up without Ground; for if there may, it can by no means follow, That if Men pretend to Tradition, that Tradition must run up to the Time of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But then they cease to be Traditionary Christians.</hi> What then? Not in pretence, for they may call themselves so still; but in reality they are not.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That if Men lay claim to a Rule they must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways observe it. We do not pretend to it as to the Scripture: And what Reason is there for it as to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? But if Men may pretend to follow <hi>Tradition,</hi> and do not, then from their being <hi>Traditionary Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> it can by no means follow that this Tradition must be carried up to the Time of our <hi>Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. The second Proposition is, <hi>And if they follow this Rule, they can never err in Faith. This is pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably self evident,</hi> saith <hi>J. S.</hi> So say I too, but it is only to be a meer Fallacy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:66277:61"/>
               <hi>To follow this Rule is to believe the same to Day which they did Yesterday, and so up to Christ, or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: If they did this from Christs time, and so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, they must continue to believe the same to the End of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If they <hi>really believe</hi> the same Doctrine which <hi>Christ taught,</hi> no doubt they cannot err. But the Question is, Whether this be an Infallible Rule for us to Judge, they could never mistake in this Rule, nor follow any other: For if either of these could happen, the Demonstration is lost. If it were possible for Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors to come in some other Way, or for Persons to misapprehend the Doctrine delivered; then it is not possible for us by this Way to be convinced they could not err. The latter I have already spoken to; I shall now shew that there were some other ways that Errors might come in. And here I shall pass over the <hi>Common Infirmities</hi> of <hi>Human Nature,</hi> which I think <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> can never Cure, and which leave Men always lyable to Error; but I shall name some more particular <hi>Ways</hi> of introducing them.</p>
            <p n="1">I. By the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>False Teachers.</hi> And for this I shall not run back to the <hi>False Apostles</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers</hi> in the <hi>Apostles</hi> times and afterwards; but I shall bring a present Instance in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>; and that is of <hi>Michael de Molinos,</hi> a Person solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned at <hi>Rome, Aug.</hi> 28. of this Year for 68 <hi>Propositions</hi> taken out of his Books and owned by himself, <hi>as the Decree saith;</hi> which are there said to be <hi>Heretical, Erroneous, Blasphemous, Offensive, Rash, Seditious, and contrary to Christian Discipline.</hi> This Man is said to have had <hi>Thousands</hi> of Disciples in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> in the very Heart of the <hi>Traditionary Church.</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:66277:62"/>
Now, I desire <hi>J. S.</hi> to inform me, If <hi>Tradition</hi> be <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi> and that be the Way followed in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> how it was possible for such Multitudes to be deceived in Matters of such Consequence? To say they were not deceived, is to expose the Authority of the Guides of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to the greatest Contempt; To say they were deceived, is to own, That notwithstanding <hi>Tradition,</hi> a single Priest may gain such <hi>Authority,</hi> as to deceive <hi>Thousands</hi>; and where lies then the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>Tradition?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. By <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> or a Pretence to <hi>Immediate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi> For this I shall not produce the Old In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances in <hi>Ecclesiastical History,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Euseb. l.</hi> 5. c. 3. c. 14. c. 28. l. 7. c 31.</note> as of <hi>Montanus, As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clepiades, Theodotus, Manichaeus, Arius, AEtius,</hi> &amp;c. who all pretended to Revelations for their particular Opinions. But I shall keep to the late Instance of <hi>Molinos,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Theod.</hi> l. 1. c. 4. l. 2.</note> who asserts, That the Perfection of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian State lies in <hi>a Simple, Pure, Infused and Perfect Contemplation, above the Vse of Ratiocination or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursive Prayer, and that in order to this, nothing is so necessary as Self-annihilation.</hi> This Doctrine is now condemned at <hi>Rome</hi>; but how came it into the Church; <hi>Did not they believe the same to Day which they did Yesterday?</hi> If there were <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> for it, how came it to be condemned? If not, then not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> dangerous Doctrines may get in under a pretence of a more <hi>Sublime</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Way</hi> of <hi>Perfection,</hi> than is to be attained in the Dull and Heavy Way of <hi>Tradition from Father to Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. By a Pretence to a more <hi>Secret Tradition.</hi> And thus <hi>Christianity</hi> was at first corrupted, by such as
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:66277:62"/>
pretended that there was a <hi>Mystical Doctrine</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by <hi>Christ</hi> of a more purifying Nature, than the Plain and Common Doctrine taught to all People by the <hi>Apostles.</hi> So <hi>Hegesippus</hi> in <hi>Eusebius</hi> affirms,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Euseb.</hi> l. 3. c. 32. l. 4. c. 22.</note> 
               <hi>That the Christian Church was corrupted by this Means</hi>; and to the same Purpose <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> So that <hi>Tradition</hi> was so far from securing the <hi>Church</hi> from <hi>Error,</hi> that it was the Means of bringing it in. And the <hi>Publick Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> could not hinder this coming in of Error, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Secret Tradition</hi> was pretended to be more Divine and Spiritual; the other was only for <hi>Babes,</hi> and this for <hi>grown Christians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. By <hi>Differences</hi> among <hi>Church-Guides</hi> about the <hi>Sense</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Tradition.</hi> Thus it was in the <hi>Samosatenian, Arian, Pelagian, Nestorian, and Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chian Controversies.</hi> Neither of the Parties disowned <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Tradition</hi>; and those who were justly condemned, pretended still to adhere to both. And if such Flames could not be prevented, so much nearer the <hi>Apostles Times,</hi> by the help of <hi>Tradition,</hi> What Reason can there be to expect it so long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</p>
            <p n="5">V. By too great a <hi>Veneration</hi> to some particular Teachers, not far from the Apostolical Times, in regard to their <hi>Learning</hi> or <hi>Piety</hi>; which made their Disciples despise <hi>Tradition</hi> in Comparison of their <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> And thus <hi>Origens</hi> Opinions came to prevail so much in the Church; and the Mixture of <hi>Platonism</hi> with <hi>Christianity</hi> proved the occasion of several Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, with Respect to the <hi>State of Souls after Death,</hi> as well as in other Points.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:66277:63"/>VI. By <hi>Compliance</hi> with some <hi>Gentile Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> in Hopes to gain more easily upon the Minds of the People; who having been long accustomed to the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Tutelar Deities,</hi> it was thought no Imprudent Thing in some Guides of the <hi>Church,</hi> when the main Doctrines of <hi>Paganism</hi> were renounced, to humour the People in these things; so they were <hi>Accommodated</hi> to <hi>Christianity</hi>; but others vehemently opposed this Method, as repugnant to the True Primitive Christianity. But by Degrees, those <hi>Superstitions</hi> prevailed; and the <hi>Original Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Church thereby corrupted.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. By <hi>Implicit Faith</hi>; which puts it into the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the <hi>Church-Guides</hi> to introduce what Doctrines they thought fit. When the best of the People were told it was against the <hi>Fundamental Rights of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church</hi> for them to examine any Opinions which were proposed to them by their Guides, <hi>That they neither did, nor could, nor ought to understand them</hi>; and when once this Point was gained, People never troubled themselves about <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; for all they had to do, was only to know what was decreed by the Church, though with a <hi>Non-ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stante</hi> to a Divine Institution; as is plain in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance,</hi> notwithstanding all the Tricks to avoid it.</p>
            <p>If then, Errours might come into the Church all these ways, what a vain thing is it to pretend, That <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> will keep from any possibility of Error?</p>
            <p>And so I need give no other Answer to his last Proposition, <hi>That if Men did innovate in Faith, it must be either through Forgetfulness or Malice</hi>; for
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:66277:63"/>
I have shewed many <hi>other Causes</hi> besides these; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since I intend to shew in a particular Discourse how the <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Corruptions</hi> we charge on the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did come into it: My design here being only to shew the <hi>Possibility</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>There remain only two things which deserve any Consideration: 1. About the Charge of <hi>Pelagianism.</hi> 2. About the <hi>Council of Trents</hi> Proceeding on <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> which will admit of an easie Dispatch.</p>
            <p n="1">I. As to the Charge of <hi>Pelagianism.</hi> It doth not lie in this, <hi>That he requires any Rational Inducements to Faith,</hi> which we do assert as well as he. But it lay in these Two things.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That a <hi>Divine Faith</hi> was to be resolved into a <hi>Natural Infallibility.</hi> For we were told that <hi>Divine Faith must have Infallible Grounds</hi>; and when we come to examine them, we find nothing but what is <hi>Natural.</hi> And now to avoid the Charge of <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gianism,</hi> this <hi>Divine Faith</hi> is declared to be <hi>meer Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Faith</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Third Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> p. 24.</note> and so <hi>Human Faith</hi> is said to have <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Grounds,</hi> but <hi>Divine Faith</hi> must shift for it self. For saith <hi>J. S. 'Tis confess'd and ever was, that the Human Authority of the Church or Tradition, begets only Human Faith as its Immediate Effect; but by bringing it up to Christ, it leads us to what's Divine.</hi> Well; but what <hi>Infallible Ground</hi> is there for this <hi>Divine Faith</hi>? Where doth that fix? Is it on the <hi>Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of <hi>Tradition</hi> or not? If not, then we may have <hi>Divine Faith</hi> without it. If it doth, then <hi>Divine Faith</hi> is to be resolved into Natural Means: And what is this but <hi>Pelagianism?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:66277:64"/>II. <hi>That he excludes the Pious Disposition of the Will,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Faith Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated,</hi> p. 155.</note> 
               <hi>from piecing out</hi> (as he calls it) <hi>the Defect of the Reasons why we Believe.</hi> And in another place he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the Wills Assistance in these words, <hi>That Faith, or a Firm and Immoveable Assent upon Authority is not throughly Rational,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 157.</note> 
               <hi>and by consequence partly Faulty, if the Motives be not alone able to convince an Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rightly disposed without the Wills Assistance.</hi> How then can a <hi>pious Disposition</hi> of the <hi>Will</hi> be necessary in order to the Act of Faith? And is it not <hi>Pelagianism</hi> to exclude it?</p>
            <p>Therefore I was in the right, when I said, That this way of <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> resolves all into a <hi>meer Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Faith</hi>; and that this is the unavoidable Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it. <hi>No,</hi> he saith, <hi>he resolves all into Christs and the Apostles teaching.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 27.</note> How ridiculous is this? For, did not <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Coelestius</hi> the very same? And the thing I charged upon them, was, That they went no farther upon this Principle than they did. Upon this he asks a very impertinent Question; but if I do not Answer it, I know what Clamours will follow. <hi>Pray do you hold that Christ is a meer Man, or that Believing him is a meer Human Faith, or that the Doctrine taught by Him or Them is meerly Human?</hi> What Occasion have I given for such a Question? But I perceive there is a design among some, to make me be believed to be no Christian. I pray <hi>God</hi> forgive the <hi>Malice</hi> of such Men. I thank God, I have better Grounds for my <hi>Faith</hi> than <hi>Oral Tradition.</hi> I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Christ to be more than <hi>meer Man,</hi> even the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Son of God,</hi> and that his <hi>Doctrine</hi> is <hi>Divine,</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> had <hi>Infallible Assistance</hi> in delivering
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:66277:64"/>
it. But what is all this to the present Question? I perceive some men when they are hard pinched, cry out, that their Adversaries are <hi>Atheists</hi> or <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> &amp;c. and hope by this means to divert them from the business before them. But these Arts will not do. And such a Dust cannot so blind the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Eyes, but he must see it is raised on purpose, that he may not be discerned in making an Escape.</p>
            <p n="2">II. As to the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trents</hi> proceeding upon <hi>Tradition.</hi> That which I said, was, The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath no where declared in Council, that it hath any such Power of making <hi>Implicit Articles of Faith</hi> contained in <hi>Scripture</hi> to become <hi>Explicit</hi> by its explaining the Sense of them. And the Reason I gave, was, Because the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not pretend to make <hi>New Articles of Faith</hi>: But to make Implicit Doctrines to become Explicit, is really so to do; as I there proved. Now what saith <hi>J. S.</hi> to this?</p>
            <p n="1">I. He saith, <hi>That the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>defines it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Church to judge of the True Sense and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scripture.</hi> As though all that belonged to the <hi>Church,</hi> must presently belong to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>; or all <hi>Judgment</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> must be <hi>Infallible</hi>; or must make things <hi>necessary to be believed</hi> which were not so before.</p>
            <p n="2">II. He shews, <hi>That the Church did proceed upon this Power.</hi> What <hi>Power?</hi> Of making things not Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to become Necessary?</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>It declares</hi> Sess. 13. <hi>That from some Texts men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, the Church was ever persuaded of the Doctrin of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:66277:65"/>
Transubstantiation.</hi> This is an admirable Argument, to prove, that it can make that Necessary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which was not, because it was always believed.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Sess. 14. <hi>It declares</hi> 1 Cor. 11. <hi>to be understood of Sacramental Confession by the Custom and Practise of the Church.</hi> Then I suppose the Church thought it Necessary before.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Sess. 14. <hi>It declares</hi> Jam. 5. <hi>to be understood of Sacramental Confession.</hi> But how? By its Power of making it Necessary to be believed meerly by such Declaration? No; but by <hi>Apostolical Tradition</hi>; then the meaning is, that it was always so understood.</p>
            <p>But because the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> doth pretend to <hi>Apostolical Tradition</hi> for the Points there determin'd, and the shewing that it had not <hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tradition,</hi> is the most effectual Confutation of the present Pretence of <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> I shall reserve that to another Discourse, part whereof, I hope, will suddenly be Published.</p>
