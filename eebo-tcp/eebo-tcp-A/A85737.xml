            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

which are faſt chained and fettered to ſinne, Satan, and the world. All men in their naturall eſtate and condition are ſlaves to the world, ſervants of corruption, and bondmen to Satan. <hi>Chriſt by the labours of his Miniſters in the Gospell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates spirituall liberty and freedome to the ſoules of Gods choſen.</hi> We all continue faſt tyed with the cords and bands of carnall luſts and affections, till Chriſt ſends his Miniſters amongſt us.</p>
                     <p>The colt was firſt looſed, and then brought to Chriſt. <hi>The powers of ſinne and ungodlineſſe muſt firſt be diſſolved within us, before we can come to Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> We muſt be looſed and ſet free from the power of ſinne, Satan, and the world; which formerly ruled and ſwayed like Maſters over us, or elſe we are unfit for Chriſts ſervice: He that will not be untyed and looſed from his ſinne, cannot be united unto Chriſt; the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of Chriſts Miniſters in reſpect of us are fruitleſſe, if they doe not looſe us from the power of ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt commandeth the two Diſciples to bring the colt to him, not to keep him to themſelves, not to imply him in their owne ſervice. <hi>It is the duty of Gods Miniſters to draw the ſoules of men not unto themſelves, but unto Chriſt:</hi> They are corrupt and carnall Miniſters that ſeeke to exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not the Lord Ieſus, in the eyes and hearts of their hearers; the drawing and working home of the ſoules of men to Chriſt Ieſus, is the chiefeſt crowne and honour of all miniſteriall labours; they who make either their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, or applauſe the end of their miniſteriall ſervice, are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceitfull workers.</p>
                     <p>The Lords and owners of this colt, though they queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned with the Diſciples, why they looſed him, yet at their word they readily let him goe. <hi>Chriſt makes his word in the mouth of his Miniſters powerfull and effectuall in the hearts of his people to move them to reſigne themſelves and all that they have to Chriſt and his ſervice.</hi> Chriſt makes the ſoules of ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Gods Election, to obey the voice of his Miniſters in the Goſpell. Chriſt ſent not his Diſciples to looſe and bring unto him ſome magnificent and ſtately horſe, ſuch as Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

and Nobles uſe to ride on, but the fole of an Aſſe, an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, dull, and plaine beaſt. <hi>Chriſt doth moſt uſually ſet up his spirituall throne and kingdome in the hearts of men of meane and low condition, and of little of no esteeme in the world.</hi> Men moſt eminent for their morall and temporall endowments, are often found the greateſt ſtrangers to Chriſt and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: Chriſt is many times carried in triumph in the hearts of poore and deſpiſed people, when ſuch as have the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the world will not vaile and ſtoop to him.</p>
                     <p>The Diſciples did not onely bring this colt to Chriſt, but they alſo ſpread their cloathes upon him, and ſo prepared and fitted him for Chriſt to ride thereon. <hi>Gods Miniſters must by their doctrines garniſh the ſoules of men, that they may be fit for Chriſt to raigne in them.</hi> Nothing ſhould be of ſuch eſteeme or uſe with us, but we ſhould readily ſpare it for Chriſts ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, be ready to ſtrip our ſelves of all, even our very gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to exalt the Lord Ieſus; we ſhould rather chuſe to make our ſelves naked, then ſuffer Chriſt to be diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                     <p>The Diſciples having caſt their garments upon the beaſt, they ſet up Chriſt thereon. <hi>The exaltation of Chriſt muſt be the prime intendment and labour of every Minister of Chriſt;</hi> they muſt never reſt nor pleaſe themſelves in their labours, till they have ſet up Chriſt, and cauſed him to raigne in the hearts of their hearers. That man is very low, and baſe in his undertakings, who ſtrives not to make Chriſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt being by the Diſciples ſet upon this colt, a great multitude ſpread their garments in the way, and others cut downe branches from the trees, and ſtrawed them in the way. <hi>When Chriſt is by his Miniſters exalted, and lifted up in the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospell, many ſoules vaile and bow to him,</hi> embrace, and reverence him, as their ſpirituall King and Soveraigne, proſtrating themſelves and all that is theirs under him. The multitude did not only ſtraw the way with their garments, and branches, but they alſo cryed <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to the ſonne of <hi>David:</hi> Bleſſed is he that commeth in the name of the Lord, <hi>Hoſanna</hi> in the higheſt. <hi>Humble and beleeving ſoules receive

Worſhipping in Spirit and in truth is the worſhip which Chriſt requireth, accepteth, and wherein he delighteth, obedience from an unſanctified heart is but filthy water from an uncleane fountaine, and bad fruit of a corrupt tree: Chriſt takes no pleaſure in it, the ſacrifice, prayer, and whole way of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord.<note place="margin">2.

                     <p>The ſecond generall thing obſerved in theſe words, is, <hi>ſpirituall vivification.</hi> Chriſt living in all them that live the life of grace: <hi>The life of a Chriſtian is a borrowed life,</hi> he hath it not of himſelfe but from another, it is no naturall, but a ſpirituall life, a life not ſpringing originally from man, but derivative and flowing from Chriſt: Every Chriſtian though wondrouſly enriched by Chriſt, yet is very poore of himſelfe, his very ſpirituall life is a borrowed thing; Sinne hath made man extreamely poore, it hath not onely robbed him, but alſo ſlaine him, it hath utterly taken the life of grace from him, and none but Chriſt can quicken him. The Chriſtian hath no cauſe of glorying in himſelfe, but all his glory is in Chriſt; the very whole of true Chriſtians is from Chriſt Jeſus; Chriſt is both the fountaine filling, and the life quickening them; they cannot but acknowledge with <hi>Paul, It is Chriſt lives in them.</hi>

The Lord let looſe <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> upon Iſrael to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe heavy burthens upon them, to deale hardly with them, to beat and ſcourge them, to purſue and follow them, when he intended to ſet them free from <hi>Egypt:</hi> Chriſt lets looſe Satan and corruption upon man, to tempt and vexe, to accuſe and torment man, when he intends to free man, to reſtore ſpirituall life and liberty unto man.

There is a ſupply in Chriſt Jeſus for all mans ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, a helpe for all mans diſtreſſes, a comfort for all mans ſorrowes; but if man want Chriſt there is none to quicken and reſtore him to the firſt reſurrection, there is none to free him from the bondage of Satan, there is none to guide him in the way to Heaven, there is none to reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him with grace and ſanctification, there is none to reſcue him from the ſpirituall enemies which doe beſiege him. In the abſence of the Lord Jeſus there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe for ſoul-diſtreſſes, no helpe againſt ſoul-diſcomforts; the having of all things is as nothing if man have not Chriſt with them; what if thou haſt the ſtature and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of <hi>Goliah?</hi> yet without Chriſt, thou wilt fall in the battell: what if thou haſt the favour and honour of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?</hi> yet without Chriſt, all this <hi>will availe thee nothing,</hi> and at length ſhame will be thy portion: what if thou haſt the riches of him in the Parable? yet not having Chriſt, thou wilt <hi>eat the bread of ſorrowes,</hi> be in ſtraights in the midſt of thy ſufficiency, and at laſt the evill ſpirits

                     <p n="2">2. This teacheth <hi>Submiſſion unto one Law.</hi> The Church is one myſticall common-wealth, and muſt be ſubject unto one Law of Chriſt.

The whole Church of Chriſt hath one patterne, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which they muſt build their faith and their love, even the whole Fabricke of their worſhip and ſervice. The ſhip hath one compaſſe by which it roweth, and one Pilate by which it is guided: The Church is the ſhip, the Word the Compaſſe, and Chriſt the Pilate; by Chriſt and his Word muſt the whole Church of God be ordered and ruled. The Word of God is a <hi>ſure word,</hi> to which we muſt give heed, as to a light that ſhineth in a darke place. The Law of the Lord is <hi>perfect,</hi> it needs no addition, as the Sun needs not the help of any candle to increaſe his light in ſhining on them that travell. The Scriptures are a compleate and perfect Schoole, <hi>profitable for Doctrine, for reproofe, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſſe, that the man of God may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, throughly furniſhed unto all good works.</hi> God gave <hi>Moſes</hi> a perfect patterne for the building of the Tabernacle without addition or dimunution. Gods word is a perfect patterne, compriſing the whole frame of mans conversation: It is Gods prerogative to preſcribe, and mans duty to conforme. <hi>Ye ſhall not adde unto the word Which I command you</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>neither ſhall you diminiſh ought from it, that you may keep the Commandements of the Lord your God which I command.</hi> All other Doctrines are <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> and not light, they cannot guide us, they are <hi>falſe plants,</hi> of mans, and not of Gods planting, they beare no good fruit to feed us, and God the great Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman of the vineyard will plucke them up; they are <hi>ſand,</hi> he that builds upon them ſinks; they corrupt and <hi>adulterate</hi> the Doctrine and Religion of Chriſt, as the tares the wheate, as the evill herbe the Prophets pot. Mans ſervice is no ſervice of Chriſt if it receive not it's rule from Chriſt; in vaine, ſaith
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:121039:189"/>
Chriſt, doe ye worſhip me, teaching for Doctrines the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of men.</hi> He that mingles humane devices with his religious duties, makes it a humane, and no divine ſervice; As the Elements once mingled in a compound body doe loſe their proper formes: ſo Religions mingled with humane tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and made compounding parts of a mixed worſhip and ſervice, doe loſe their formes, and ceaſe to be religious in Gods account. As ſilver mingled with braſſe doth loſe the nature, and name of ſilver, and currant coyne, and will not paſſe with men, the touchſtone diſcovers it, and the skilfull Goldſmith rejects it: Thus the worſhip of God mixed with the dreſſe of mans invention, loſeth both the name and nature of true worſhip. The word diſcovers it to be counterfeit, and God doth not regard it, nor the performers of it: Of ſuch therefore the Prophet ſaith, <hi>reprobate ſilver ſhall men call them, becauſe the Lord hath reiected them.</hi> This <hi>alienates</hi> from Chriſt, it divides the heart, and places the feare, truſt, love, and joy of the ſoule upon ſome forraine thing, ſome Idoll of mans deviſing. A woman that embrace a ſtranger with her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in her boſome, and mingles ſtrangers with her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, is no more a chaſte, and loving wife, her heart is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſhe is become an adultereſſe. The mingling of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine inventions with Chriſts precepts in his ſervices, is in Gods interpretation, ſpirituall fornication, their hearts are gone from Chriſt their husband, they are taken up with ſtrange lovers. To this purpoſe is that of the Prophet <hi>Eſay, the faithfull City is become an</hi>

When humane devices are made ingredients and compounding parts of Gods ſervice, they are in Gods account very ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pollutions; and doubtleſſe, he that in Gods worſhip is an admirer of humane inventions, is no lover of the Lord Jeſus: Oile will not mixe it ſelfe with water, nor iron with clay,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:121039:189"/>
no more will true Religion be mixed with that which is corrupt; the Arke and <hi>Dagon</hi> cannot ſtand together; Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is not like lead, you cannot bow it, but like glaſſe, breake it you may, bow it you cannot, mingle it, and you deſtroy it, it is no more Religion but ſuperſtition, as ſilver mixt with droſſe is no more accounted ſilver but droſſe, though it hath ſome ſilver in it: Beſides, it is treaſon in a common-wealth, for any man to mingle the Lawes of a forraine Prince with; the Lawes of his owne Prince, no King will endure it; and what is this but ſpirituall treaſon againſt Chriſt, to mingle humane devices, and forraine traditions with Chriſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, the Lord will never endure it; therefore marke what Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If any man ſhall adde unto theſe things, God ſhall adde unto him the plagues that are written in this booke;</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as we are a ſpirituall common-wealth, ſo let us obſerve the Lawes of Chriſt the ſpirituall King of this Kingdome. <hi>Let us walke according to his rule, And peace ſhall be upon us as upon the Iſrael of God.</hi>

Our Sympathy with the Churches, afflictions ſhould perſwade us to this, we muſt apprehend, the calamity which reſteth upon the Church, as reſting upon our owne perſons: <hi>If one member</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul) doe ſuffer, all the members ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with it.</hi> A dead member indeed hath no ſympathy with the reſt; but the living member hath a fellow-feeling, a quicke and exquiſite ſence within, when any of the members are pained or hazarded. <hi>Who is weake</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) and I am not weake, who is offended, and I burne not.</hi> The bleſſing which is attendant on our endeavouring the welfare of the Church, is an Argument of great force to move us to this worke; hereof the Lord ſaith, <hi>they ſhall proſper that love thee:</hi> They
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:121039:191"/>
that love thee, they that are carefull for thee, ſolicitous and ſtudious to maintaine ſoundneſſe of Doctrine and purity of divine worſhip in thee; they that humble themſelves in thy behalf, when troubles are upon thee; they that put themſelves forth to the utmoſt, to relieve thee in thy wants, to comfort thee in thy ſorrowes, to aſſiſt thee againſt thy oppoſers; they <hi>ſhall prosper,</hi> it ſhall be well with them, they ſhall not goe without a bleſſing, their worke and labour of Love ſhall not be forgotten. Beſides, our welfare is very much dependant upon the welfare of the whole Church of Chriſt: The wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of every member in a common-wealth, and in a body na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, is deeply intereſted in the proſperity and good ſucceſſe of the whole. Thus the proſperity or fall of the Church in generall, is our fall or proſperity in particular. The ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſome part of a building is a ſtrengthening and a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of the whole building; the fall of any part is a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, a diſgrace, a prejudice to the whole; and thus it is in this caſe, <hi>We live</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) if ye ſtand faſt in the ſaith,</hi> if ye abide in Chriſt, thrive in grace, and make a gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe in the wayes of life, then we live, then we rejoyce, and are full of comfort, then our hearts are much ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Lord. Our Subjection to changes, miſeries, and troubles, ſhould very much quicken us to the preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration of the reſt of Chriſts afflicted members, the Lord may make us drinke of the ſame cup, as in the prophecye of <hi>Jeremy</hi> the Lord cauſed the cup of his wrath to goe round, <hi>he made all the Nations to drink thereof,</hi> and if we have no compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on others now, who ſhall have compaſſion upon us then, if we withdraw our helping hand from others, who ſhall reach forth the hand of aſſiſtance unto us; for God doth ſo order it in the courſe of his providence, that look <hi>what meaſure we meet to others</hi> in their diſtreſſe, <hi>the ſame ſhall men meaſure againe to us</hi> in our neceſſity. Beſides, this is a work very acceptable to God, and very profitable to the Church of God; doubtleſſe it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>David</hi> well when <hi>Joab</hi> ſought to bring home <hi>Abſolon</hi> to him, and when <hi>Abner</hi> undertooke to bring about all <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Thus when we endeavour to reconcile God and his Church, to bring men about to God, by our prayers, exhortations,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:121039:192"/>
and their repentance, is a worke very pleaſing unto God; and herein we prove inſtruments of the greateſt honour, game, and comfort to our fellow brethren. O therefore I as we are all one common-wealth, let us labour the good of this our common-wealth, Let Magiſtrates and Miniſters be to the Church like the ſiery pillar to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a light, and a defence; Let Miniſters like Bees make the honey, compoſe ſweet and wholeſome Doctrine, gathered from the flowers growing in the garden of the ſacred Scriptures, and ſo frame it that it may be ſweeter then the honey or the honey-combe unto the palate of the Church; and let Magiſtrates like hives preſerve this honey of wholſome Doctrine, that nothing doe adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it; Let Miniſters by the <hi>executive power</hi> of the Word and Sacraments, and Magiſtrates by their <hi>directive and coactive power</hi> demeane themſelves to the great behoofe and benefit of Gods Church; and as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo let both Magiſtrate and Miniſter labour the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and corporall freedome of the Lords people: And as every member, joynt and ſinew in the body naturall, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes his office for the good of the whole; ſo let Chriſts members from the higheſt to the loweſt, according to their ſeverall places, ſtations and abilities, promote the welfare of Chriſts Church and ſervants.</p>

                     <p>Turne from the booke of the Scripture to the booke of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and here you ſhall ſee a Deity ſhining as the Sun in the Starres, and putting it ſelfe forth as the root in the branches, and appearing as the Artificer in his workmanſhip: And thus looke,</p>

When we ſee a great and ſtately houſe builded, artificially compoſed, ſeverall peeces of ſtone, timber, lime, earth, and other materials skilfully and ſtrongly joyned together, variety of roomes framed for the entertainment of many gueſts, and other offices belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the houſe, and windowes made in fit and convenient places, to give light thereunto, we all know that ſome skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full workman hath been labouring there, the houſe having no power nor wiſedome to raiſe it ſelfe; and thus when we looke upon this great and mighty houſe of the world, and ſee it compoſed of ſeverall creatures, Heavens, Aire, Waters, Earth, &amp;c. variety of roomes fitted for men, Beaſts, Birds, Fiſhes, and all other gueſts belonging to this houſe: The Sun, Moone, and Starres ſet on high, as great lamps and lanthornes to give light thereunto, we cannot but acknowledge that ſome Almighty and All-wiſe workman hath been the builder thereof none of theſe being able to create and ſet themſelves in this orderly manner; this we muſt needs acknowledge though we ſee not the builder: When we ſee the body and branches of a Tree ſpringing, we know there is a root, though
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:121039:231"/>
it be hidden in the earth, and we ſee it not: When we ſee as that noble <hi>Dupleſſes</hi> obſerves, a river flowing, we preſently conclude there is ſome Spring or Fountaine whence it hath Originall, though we ſee not the ſame; and thus from the Creation, and the things ſeen, we muſt of neceſſity conclude, there is a Deity, though inviſible, and not ſeen, otherwiſe then as we ſee the cauſe in the effect.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Looke upon the <hi>order of things moving.</hi> We diſcerne many things moving in the world, as Sun, Moone, and Stars in Heaven, the Birds in the aire, Men and Beaſts upon the earth, Rivers running, Seas ebbing and flowing; and every thing that moves muſt of neceſſity be moved of ſome other, by the conſideration whereof we are neceſſarily led to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a firſt mover, which is God, giving motion to all, himſelfe not moved: When we ſee the body moving, we know there is a ſoule within moving it, though we ſee not the ſoule: When we ſee the wheeles of a watch moving, we know there is a ſpring that ſets them all on going. Thus the motion of the creature plainly demonſtrates a firſt mover, though our eyes behold him not, according to the Rule, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunda moventia non movent, niſi per hoc quod ſunt a primo motu.</hi>

one another, yet theſe you ſhall ſee concurring and agreeing together in the building of the univerſe, and in the body of man and beaſt, which plainly ſhews the wiſedome and power of ſome ſupreame Commander, making ſuch a ſweet harmony betweene diſagreeing creatures, as betweene diſſonant ſtrings upon a muſicall inſtrument, we acknowledge the art of a skilfull Muſitian in the latter, and can we doe leſſe then acknowledge an infinite wiſedome and power of ſome ſupreame commander in the former.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Looke upon the <hi>degrees of excellency and goodneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong things:</hi> Some are more good and more excellent; ſome leſſe good, and leſſe excellent; the Sunne hath more light then the Starres; the Vine is more excellent then the Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; man hath more noble endowments, then the unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creatures; and whence is this, but as every creature hath more or leſſe good communicated to it, as it doth more or leſſe approach unto ſome chiefeſt good, ſo that there muſt be ſome chiefe and moſt excellent good communicating free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more or leſſe good to every kinde of creature as hee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</p>
