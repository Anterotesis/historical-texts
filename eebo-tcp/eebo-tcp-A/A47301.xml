            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE, AND RIGHT REVEREND FATHER in GOD, HENRY LORD BISHOP of LONDON, And One of His Majesties Most Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Privy-Council, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving published this Treatise to promote, as much as in me lies, an intire Practice of our Blessed Saviours Precepts, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable expectation of his Rewards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us; I have presumed to address it to Your Lordship, hoping it will find Acceptance in Your Pious Judgment for
<pb facs="tcp:66440:3"/>
the sake of those things which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, and because Your Lordship is a most eminent Example as a <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and a most discreetly zealous and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Promoter as a <hi>Bishop</hi> of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it.</p>
            <p>In this Work my Great Design has been to press men to a conscientious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their whole Duty, and to show them how much contentment, and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of Spirit they have reason to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy in the careful observance of it. And these are ends so excellent, as may well excuse the imperfections of any honest En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, which shall be put forth in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to them. For what greater service can be done to our Blessed Lord, than to exalt his Authority in the hearts and lives of all his Followers? What grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter honour can be brought to Religion, than to promote a pious practice, and thereupon a constant joy and cheerfulness in the minds of all its Professors? And
<pb facs="tcp:66440:3"/>
what more faithful kindness can be shown to the Souls of Men, than cleerly to lay before them, and most earnestly to press upon them such things as will give them peace and comfortable expectations of God's love and favour in this World, and secure their eternal happiness in that which is to come? And since I have directed all the Parts, and every thing that I have said in the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, to these ends; I am willing to hope, that, notwithstanding all its defects, I have therein done no unacceptable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to my Saviour, and to all good men, who will be much readier to encourage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny honest tendences to this purpose, than to reprove, and throw them by, for the sake of those weaknesses, and that want of skill, which shall be found in them.</p>
            <p>In this hope, my Lord, I make bold to Present it to Your Lordship, whose great and most exemplary Virtue will not, I believe, be averse from Patronizing
<pb facs="tcp:66440:4"/>
that, which tends even in a low degree to further and promote it. I pray God preserve Your Lordship, and continue You, what You now are, an Illustrious Pattern of all Private and Political Virtues to this Your Native Country. That Religion may still be adorned, and this distressed Church supported, by that exemplariness of an upright Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that great Prudence, and unweari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Diligence, and undaunted Courage, and most wise and steady Zeal, which Your Lordship has always shown in Your High Station for the things of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Your Care, and which have rendred You greatly serviceable to Your Saviour, and a most valuable Blessing to this poor Church and Nation. This, my Lord, is the most hearty Prayer of,</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE design of this ensuing Treatise is to increase the <hi>piety,</hi> and promote the <hi>peace</hi> of all sincerely honest Consciences, by stating plainly and fully what are the <hi>terms indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensably required of all Christian men to their eternal pardon and salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this I have endeavoured to be as clear, and particular as possibly I could. For I write up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Subject wherein all men are infinitely concerned; and therefore I have studied to write so as all might understand me. I have carried on my Discourse all along with a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular eye to the benefit of the <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Reader, and suited things, as far as their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would bear, and my skill would reach, to <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>vulgar</hi> apprehensions. And that they might have nothing to hinder or offend them in their progress, I have been industrious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly careful through the Body of the whole
<pb facs="tcp:66440:5"/>
Book to insert nothing of the <hi>learned languages</hi>; but wheresoever any thing of that seemed fit to be added for the sake of others, I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the <hi>Text</hi> unmixt, and cast it into the <hi>Margine.</hi> In the whole Work my study has been to speak things <hi>useful</hi> and <hi>necessary</hi> to be known, that the weight and worth of the matter might purchase a favourable censure for all the defects of Art, which shall be found in the composure.</p>
            <p>By what I have here offered upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I doubt not but it will appear, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our <hi>Religion</hi> is most <hi>strictly pure,</hi> and <hi>nobly vertuous</hi>; yet is it by no means <hi>melancholy,</hi> or apt in its <hi>own nature</hi> to engender <hi>tormenting fears</hi> and <hi>endless scruples.</hi> For the <hi>Terms of pardon</hi> and salvation are no <hi>intricate</hi> or <hi>uncertain,</hi> but a <hi>fixt</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> thing: They are neither over-hard for our <hi>active powers,</hi> nor dark and inevident to our <hi>understandings</hi>: so that by the assistance of God's Grace we may <hi>perform</hi> them, and be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well <hi>assured</hi> of it when we do. God exacts an <hi>honest,</hi> but not an <hi>unerring</hi> obedience; he bears with our <hi>weaknesses,</hi> though not with our <hi>wilful failings</hi>: and this is ground enough where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to <hi>secure peace,</hi> and yet in no wise to <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant piety,</hi> since although our Religion is so exactly holy as utterly to dash all wicked mens
<pb facs="tcp:66440:5"/>
presuming hopes; yet is it so indulgent still as to tempt no man, who is honestly obedient, to despair.</p>
            <p>In pursuit of this Argument <hi>what piety is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensably required,</hi> and <hi>what failings shall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged,</hi> that men may know when to <hi>hope</hi> and when to <hi>fear,</hi> and neither foster a peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out piety, nor phansie such a rigour in piety as leaves no room for peace, I have proceeded as <hi>particularly</hi> and <hi>perspicuously</hi> as possibly I could; being unwilling in a matter of this import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to leave my Reader either in <hi>doubt</hi> by an account which is too <hi>general</hi> and <hi>ambiguous,</hi> or in <hi>darkness</hi> by such as is <hi>obscure.</hi> And to give a prospect of the whole business, I have laid things down in this order in <hi>five</hi> Books.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>first</hi> Book I have shewn <hi>what the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of happiness</hi> is in <hi>general</hi>; viz. <hi>our obedience to the Laws of the Gospel,</hi> it being that whereby at the last Day we must all be judged to live eternally. And because some are tempted to think obedience needless when they read of pardon and hapiness promised to other things, as <hi>Faith, Repentance,</hi> &amp;c. I have shewn particularly of those Speeches that they are <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonymical,</hi> and that life and mercy are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to them as they are separate from obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but only as they effect and imply it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:66440:6"/>But <hi>obedience</hi> being a <hi>general</hi> word, and mens great backwardness to it rendring them very slow to run it out into all those <hi>Particulars</hi> which are contained in it: to bring this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course yet <hi>nearer,</hi> and set it <hi>home</hi> upon their <hi>Consciences,</hi> I proceed in the <hi>second</hi> Book to show <hi>what those Laws are in particular which we are bound to obey,</hi> what is <hi>the nature of those several ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and vices which are enjoined or forbidden by them</hi>; and from <hi>what expectations, and under what forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we are bound to obey them.</hi> This indeed I found to be a toilsome work, and the most tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous part of this whole enquiry: but I thought it extreamly needful to a <hi>thorow piety,</hi> and a <hi>well-grounded peace,</hi> and that made me that I would not pass it over. For in the business of <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> men will ordinarily go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they needs must, but stand their ground, and dispute it out so long as they have any post in reserve to which they can still retreat. First, <hi>They do not believe that this</hi> or <hi>that particular vertue,</hi> which is urged upon them, <hi>is a Law of God</hi>; or, if they are forced to believe that, <hi>they think it is not so necessary that Heaven and eternal life should depend upon it</hi>; or if at last they are made to see that too, yet still <hi>they are in ignorance</hi> or <hi>errour about the nature of it,</hi> and so have <hi>no sense of guilt,</hi> or <hi>remorse of mind</hi> when
<pb facs="tcp:66440:6"/>
they <hi>transgress</hi> and <hi>act against</hi> it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to make every <hi>particular</hi> Law have a full force upon them, both its <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>necessity</hi> must be evidently laid before them. They must be shewed what that is which it requires, and under what penalties it requires it. And then their Consciences are awakened, and their fears are raised, and so the Law is set in its full force to oblige them to its perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Thus necessary is such a particular Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course upon the several Laws of God and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Duty to a <hi>pious performance</hi> of them; and it is no less necessary to a <hi>peaceable assurance</hi> in them that do. For unless a man knows the several instances of Duty, and understands what is meant by them; he cannot discern when he keeps, or when he breaks them, and so can have no comfort, or promise himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reward upon his performance of them.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>third</hi> Book I proceed to shew <hi>what sort of obedience is indispensably required of us to all the particular Laws</hi> which are described in the <hi>Second.</hi> And the necessary qualifications of it I reduce to <hi>two</hi>; viz. <hi>sincerity,</hi> and <hi>integrity.</hi> In discoursing upon which I endeavour to set out all the <hi>Parts,</hi> and state the <hi>just bounds</hi> of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; and to examine those <hi>pretences,</hi> and confute those <hi>false grounds</hi> whereby men, who
<pb facs="tcp:66440:7"/>
are unwilling to perform it, seek to evade or undermine it.</p>
            <p>And having in the <hi>three</hi> first Books proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus far in asserting the necessity, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out the true compass and just extent of <hi>pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>; I go on to consult more directly the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests of <hi>peace</hi> in those <hi>two</hi> that follow.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>fourth</hi> Book I shew <hi>what defects are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with that indispensable pitch of piety before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,</hi> and <hi>what destroy it.</hi> And this being a Point whereupon the peace of Consciences so nearly depends, I have been <hi>particular</hi> in the <hi>explication</hi> of it, and <hi>large</hi> in the <hi>proof.</hi> Those sins which are <hi>inconsistent</hi> with it, and <hi>destroy a state of Grace,</hi> are such as are <hi>voluntary</hi> and <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>: whereof some only <hi>destroy the state of acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance for the present</hi>; but others either <hi>greatly wound,</hi> or <hi>utterly extinguish that habitual Vertue which should restore us to it for the time to come.</hi> But others there are which are <hi>allowed by it,</hi> and <hi>do not overthrow</hi> it; <hi>viz. all such defects as are invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,</hi> whether they be sins of <hi>innocent unwilled ignorance,</hi> or <hi>inconsideration.</hi> In discoursing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, as I have been studious to explain them so <hi>particularly</hi> that no <hi>honest heart</hi> might fall into <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>doubts</hi> about them; so have I been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful withal to adde such <hi>marks</hi> and <hi>limitations</hi> to them, that no <hi>wilfully ignorant</hi> or <hi>inconsiderate</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:66440:7"/>
Sinners may take encouragement thence to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>fifth</hi> Book I shew <hi>what is the remedy for all sin,</hi> and the Gospel-instrument of reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; that so when at any time men are pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with just fears by being fallen into real danger, they may again be restored to peace in their own minds by being first restored to Gods pardon. And having proceeded thus far in shewing what <hi>measures and degrees of piety God will exact of us,</hi> what <hi>failings he will connive at in us,</hi> and <hi>upon what terms,</hi> when once we have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, <hi>he will be again reconciled to us</hi>: I have gone in the last place to <hi>remove several causeless grounds of scruple,</hi> which make good men fear where no fear is, and condemn themselves when God will graciously acquit them.</p>
            <p>These are the matters treated on in the ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Discourse, which was at first drawn up to serve the spiritual necessities of a <hi>truly pious soul,</hi> and which I have now sent abroad into the world, being made to believe it will not be altogether unserviceable to the Publick. If thereby I may promote the great end of my <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> in contributing to the <hi>growth of piety</hi> and the <hi>peace of consciences</hi>; I shall think my self most happy in having been a Furtherer, though in a low degree, of so noble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb facs="tcp:66440:8"/>
a Design. But whatever the success in that be, I am sure I shall have the reward of a <hi>religious Design,</hi> and an <hi>honest endeavour,</hi> from him who estimates our <hi>pains,</hi> not by their <hi>events,</hi> which are not in our <hi>own power,</hi> but by their <hi>natural tendency,</hi> and our <hi>intentions,</hi> which are. In which confidence I send it out into the world, depending upon his Grace to set it home upon the Conscience, and make it effectual to guide the practice, and secure the comfort both of thee and me. For which end I hope I shall have the hearty prayers of all good men, especially of those, if any such there be, who shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive benefit by this Treatise.</p>

                  <p>God is to be obeyed with the fourth fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>culty, <hi>viz.</hi> our executive or bodily powers, and outward operations. The great difficulty of Obedience in this instance. Four false grounds where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon men shift off the necessity of this service with their works and actions. First, A hope to be saved for a true belief or orthodox opinions, Mens confidence in this represented The folly of it. Orthodox Faith and Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fessions no further available, than they produce obedient works and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Secondly, A hope of salvati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on upon an Obedience of idle desires and ineffective wishes. An opinion of some Casuists, That a desire of Grace is Grace, refuted This sta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted, and a distinct explication of what is promised to the desire of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and what to Obedience it self. The pretence for this acceptance of idle desires from <hi>Gal. 5.17.</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. An account when the will and desire is taken for the deed and performance. That Text <hi>2 Cor. 8.11, 12.</hi> plainly vindicated. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, A hope of being saved notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they do sin, because they are insnared into it through the strength of temptations. The folly of this. Our own lusts make tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions strong. The Grace of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel is sufficient to overcome them. Fourthly, A hope of being excused because they transgress with an unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mind. These mens state repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented. Vnwillingness in sin a miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, but no sufficient excuse. Some strugling in most actions both of good and bad men. The strife of the Flesh and Spirit. Two sorts of men feel nothing of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven after the Resurrection, and some profligate Sinners here now on Earth. All good men, and the generality of evil are subject to it in this life. Mens peremptory will and last choice deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines their condition. <hi>259</hi>

                  <p>Of the partiality of mens Obedience from their love of some particular sins. Three pretences whereby they justifie the allowed practice of some sins, whilst they are obedient in some other instances. The first pretence is the preservation of their Religion and themselves in times of persecution. A particular account of mens disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence under this pretence. The vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb facs="tcp:66440:12"/>
of it shown from the following con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations. Religion needs not to be rescued from persecution. The free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of outward means of Religion is restrained by it, but the substance of Religion it self is not. It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in some parts, and ennobled in all by sufferings. Where it needs to be defended, disobedience is no fit means to preserve it, because God cannot be honoured, nor Religion ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by it. Religion and the love of God is only the colour; but the true and real cause of such disobedience is a want of Religion, and too great a love of mens own selves. Men are liable to be deceived by this pretence from a wrong Notion of Religion for religious opinions and professions. A true Notion of Religion for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious practice upon a religious belief, as it implies both faith and obedience. The danger of disobedience upon this pretence. The practice of all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men in this case. Of Religion in the narrow acceptation, for religious professions and opinions. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable way of mens preserving it. <hi>First,</hi> By acting within their own sphere. <hi>Secondly, By</hi> the use only of lawful means. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By a zeal in the first place for the practice of religious Laws, and next to that for the free profession of religious opi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nions. <hi>330</hi>

                  <head>The Contents.</head>
                  <p>The nature of prejudice. It a cause of ignorance of our Duty. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt things being proposed to a free and empty, and to a prejudiced or prepossessed mind. An evident proposal sufficient to make a free mind understand its Duty; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides it, a confutation of its repugnant prejudice is necessary to a mind that is prepossessed. An account of several Opinions which make men ignorant of several instances of Duty. One pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, that nothing is lawful in Gods Worship, but what is authorized by an express command, or example of Scripture; the acts of sin that are justified by this prejudice. Another that all private men are publick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors of Religion, and the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith; the acts of sin justified by this Opinions. Other Opinions cause a sinful neglect of the Sacraments. These are incident to some honest and obedient hearts. An account of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prejudices, as that Christ is a Temporal King; the acts of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence authorized by this Opinion. That a good end will justifie an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil action; the acts of sin upon this perswasion. That Dominion is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Grace; the disobedient acts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed by this Principle These are more disobedient and damning. The case stated, what prejudices are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with, and what destroy salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Some prejudices get into mens minds, not through a disobedient heart, but through weakness of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and fallibility of the means of knowledge. These are consistent with a state of salvation. An instance of this in the prejudice of the Apostles about preaching of the Gospel to all Nations. Other prejudices get into mens minds through damning lusts or sins. A brief account of the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of mens lusts and vices upon their Opinions. This is illustrated in the Gnosticks. They were famous for covetousness, and worldly complian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and for impure lusts, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in bodily pleasures. The effect of these in producing agreeable Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. Another of their vices was a turbulent and seditious humour. Their Opinion was answerable. A further illustration of it from the Pharisees. An account of their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the influence which they had in begetting vile perswasions. This influence of mens lust upon their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments proved from the Scriptures.
<pb facs="tcp:66440:14"/>
The damnableness of such prejudices as enter this way. Certain marks whereby to judge when prejudices proceed from unmortified lusts. As <hi>first,</hi> If the sin whereto the prejudice serves, is unmortified in them. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> If it lye so near to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, that we could not but see that it ministred to it, when we embraced it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Though it lye more remote, if we still adhere to it when we plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see that some unquestionable and notorious Laws are evacuated, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed by it. A Rule to prevent dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>obedient prejudices; <hi>viz.</hi> Let Laws be the Rule whereby to judge of truth in opinions, not opinions the Rule whereby to measure the Obligation of Laws. Some Reasons of this, <hi>viz.</hi> Because Laws are more plain and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but opinions are more difficult and dubious: Obedience to Laws is the end of revealed truth, and so fit to measure it, not to be measured by it. <hi>480</hi>

Where there is something of choice in it they extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the sin and abate the punishment, though they do not wholly excuse it.

                  <p>Consideration is necessary to choice. Some sins are inconsiderate. Three innocent causes of inconsideration: <hi>1.</hi> Suddenness and surprize of oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.
<pb facs="tcp:66440:14"/>
An account of this. The involuntariness of it. Slips upon it are consistent. <hi>2.</hi> Weariness of our thinking powers or understandings. An account of this; and of its invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntariness. The consistence of our transgressions by reason of it. <hi>3.</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>composure or disturbance of them. An account of this. The causes of it are Drunkenness, or a strong Passion. Drunkenness is always our own fault. Our Passions grow strong in us some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by our own indulgence, and then they are our damning sin, and we must suffer for the evil that we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit under them: sometimes through the suddenness, and greatness of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Objects; and then they are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable, and our inconsiderate slips upon them are excusable. The pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions which have good for their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as Love, Desire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cannot by any force of outward objects be so suddenly forced upon us. But the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions which have evil, as grief, anger, and fear especially, often are. The reason of this difference. Inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration upon the latter excusable, but not upon the former. This difference made by our Saviour in a case where both were criminal. Excusable slips upon discomposure of our thinking powers, are such as proceed from an unwill'd sudden grief or anger, but especially from a sudden fear. No fear is involuntary but what is sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and sins upon deliberate fear are damning; but upon unwill'd sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fear, grief, or anger, consistent with salvation. Cautions about in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate sins to prevent false con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. No sin is innocently incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate: <hi>1.</hi> Where we have time and an undisturbed understanding. <hi>2.</hi> Where the sin is mischievous, or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly criminal. <hi>3.</hi> When we do not strive against it. We must endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour against all involuntary failings, though we cannot resolve against them. <hi>4.</hi> When we are not sorry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have committed it, nor beg pardon for it. <hi>5.</hi> When it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with observation.

                  <p>THE rigour of the Mosaick Law is taken away by Christ, who came to preach Pardon upon Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance where that denounced an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable punishment. Repentance is the great Remedy. God heartily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires mens Repentance, and promises Forgiveness to it. This has been preached in all times. The Remedy for our unknown sins. They are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of a particular Prayer and Repentance, but are forgiven upon a
<pb facs="tcp:66440:15"/>
general one. The Remedy of wilful sins is a particular Repentance. That is available for their pardon; for wilful sins after Baptism, as well as before it. Two places, which seem to deny all pardon to wilful sins after Baptism, cleared; the wilful sin, <hi>Heb. 10.26,</hi> is not any wilful transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of any particular Law of Christ, which have all been pardoned; but a wilful apostasie from his whole Religi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on, which is proved from sundry things there spoken of it. The fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away mentioned <hi>Heb. 6,</hi> is like wise apostasie from Christianity, which is shewn from those things which they are said to fall from, and those others which are said to be implied in their falling. An account of the desperate state of these men. The state of some habitual Sinners desperate and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimable, by reason their period of Grace is over, but this is no discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to any mans Repentance. <hi>568</hi>

                  <p>Of the necessity of Reconciliation upon Sins whereby we have offended, and of Restitution upon others whereby we have injured our Brethren. In sin three things considerable, the offence against God, and the offence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury against men. Sins whereby God alone is offended, are sufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, and pardonable upon refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and amendment. Those where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we have also offended, or injured our Brethren, are not sufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, or pardonable upon that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, unless moreover we seek to be reconciled, and make restitution. These two means of pardon, for affronts, and injuries against men, are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary fruits of a sincere and sufficient repentance. Of sins whereby we have justly offended our Brethren. Their ill effects represented, which are to be redressed by penitential acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and seeking to be reconciled. These penitential acknowledgments necessary only to appease these, whom by our sin we have offended; and so unnecessary, when they know nothing of our offence. Where they do, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation is necessary so far only as it can be had, and where we have an opportunity of seeking it. This Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course upon Reconciliation summed up. Of sins of injustice, whereby we have injured men. Reparation ordinarily necessary to a sincere, and always to a sufficient Repentance of them. 'Tis necessary moreover in it self, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of strict Justice. An account of particular injuries, how to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired where the injured persons can, and how where they cannot receive it. Restitution necessary whether our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren know themselves to be injured by us, or no. It is due only upon sins of injustice. Of the perfect right which we have to things of strict Justice, and of the imperfect right which we have to things of Charity, whence the performance of them is sometimes
<pb facs="tcp:66440:15"/>
called righteousness. In sins of in justice, reparation due so far only as we can, and according as we have opportunity to make it. In judging of a just opportunity, caution given that we be neither too strict, so as more than needs to prejudice our selves; nor too loose, so as to over-charge our Neighbours.

                  <p>Involuntary sins imply something of our own fault, and so 'tis fit we should be sorry for them, and beg pardon. They had a remedy under <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law, and have now likewise under Christ's Gospel. We are qualified for their pardon, not by a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar repentance and reformation: but in the general, by our obedience in all our wilful and chosen actions; in particular, by our prayers for Gods pardon, and our Charity and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the sins of other men.

Several need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less grounds of their fears. <hi>1.</hi> Ineffective desires of evil. This represented. No man otherwise good shall be condemned for inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective lusts and thoughts of evil, These are considerable either as to their first birth, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged continuance. The first stirrings of lusts after evil things are unavoidable. The after-entertainment is by our own indulgence. Even these are uncondemning so long as they neither are consented to, nor fulfilled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in themselves not deadly under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, but a temptation to deadly and damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sins. The way whereby sin wins up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men, and the nature and force of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation. To be tempted is no sin, which is proved from the nature of temptation, from <hi>Adams</hi> being tempted before be sinned, and from Christ's being tempted, who knew no sin. Degrees in temptation or in lusts of evil. Some are checked quickly, and are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted long to parly. This happens only in grown men and perfect Christians, and that too not in all instances. These certainly are not damning. Others stay longer, and strive and contend with our mind or conscience, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at last they are vanquished by it. This happens ordinarily to younger Converts, and in extraordinary temptations to grown Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. These still are uncondemning, which is shewn from <hi>Gal. 5.16, 17;</hi> and from the instance of our Saviour Christ. What lusts and desires of evil are damning. They are condemning when they make us consent to a damning sin. A distinct account of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>affectedness or distraction sometimes in their prayers. Of the necessity of fixedness and fervency in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion when we can, and of Gods readiness to dispense with them when we cannot enjoy them. Attention disturbed often whether we will or no. A particular cause of it in fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayers. Fervency and affection not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending so much upon the command of our wills, as upon the temper of our Bodies. Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency is unconstant in them whose temper is fit for it. God measures us not by the fixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our thoughts, or the warmth of our tempers, but by the choice of our wills and the obedience of our lives. Other qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in prayer are sufficient to have our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers heard when these are wanting. Yea, those Vertues which make our prayers acceptable, are more eminently shown in our Obedience, so that it would bring down to us the blessings of prayer, should it prove in those respects defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive. A third cause of scruple is the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of idle or impertinent words mentioned <hi>Mat. 12.36.</hi> The scruples upon this represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The practical errour of a morose behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our incurred upon it. This discountenanced by the light of Nature, and by Christianity. The benefits and place of serious Discourse. Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable conversation a great Field of Vertue. The idle words <hi>Mat. 12,</hi> not every vain and useless; but false, slanderous and reproachful words; this proved from the place. <hi>664</hi>

                  <p>Some good mens fear upon this account. What is meant in Scripture by the Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost or Spirit is taken for the gifts or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it; whether they be first ordinary, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in our minds or understandings, or in our wills and tempers; or secondly, extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and miraculous. Extraordinary gifts of all sorts proceed from one and the same Spirit or Holy Ghost; upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count any of them indifferently are sometimes called Spirit, sometimes Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost and Spirit are frequently distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then by Holy Ghost is meant extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gifts respecting the understanding; by Spirit extraordinary gifts respecting the executive powers. The summ of the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Holy Ghost. What sin against it is unpardonable. To sin against the Holy Ghost is to dishonour him. This is done in every act of sin, but these are not unpardonable. What the unpardonable sin is. Of sin against the ordinary endowments of the Holy Ghost, whether of mind or will; the several de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in this, all of them are pardonable. Of sin against the Spirit. Blaspheming of this comes very near it, and was the sin of the Pharisees, <hi>Mat. 12;</hi> but it was pardonable. Of sinning against the Holy Ghost. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost the last means of reducing men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Gospel, that Covenant of Repentance. The sin against it is unpardonable, because such Sinners are irreclamable. All dishonour of this is not unpardonable; for <hi>Simon Magus</hi> dishonoured it in actions, who was yet capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of pardon; but only a blaspheming of it in words. No man is guilty of it whilst he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues Christian. <hi>681</hi>

               <head>The Contents. </head>
               <p>Religious men inquisitive after their future State. Three Articles of Christian belief cause such inquisitiveness. The Articles of Eternal Life, and the Resurrection, make men desire satisfaction. The Article of the last Judgment encourages the search, and points out a way towards it. A proposal of the present design and the matters treated of in the ensuing Discourse.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>AMong all those things which employ the minds of Religious and Considerate men, there is none that is so much a matter of their thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful care and solicitous enquiries, as their <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happiness</hi> or <hi>Misery</hi> in the <hi>next</hi> World.</p>
            <p>For in Christs Religion there are <hi>three</hi> great Articles, which being believed, and seriously considered by a nature restlessly desirous of its own happiness (and such ours is) must needs render it very inquisitive after some
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66440:17"/>
security of its future good estate, and they are these; The <hi>Immortality of the Soul,</hi> the <hi>Resurrection of the Body,</hi> and the <hi>great Day of Doom</hi> or <hi>last Judgment.</hi> Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is firmly perswaded of these three, as every man is, or at least pretends to be, who professes himself a <hi>Christian,</hi> he assuredly believes that when this Life is over, both his Body and Soul shall live again, and be endlessly Delighted or Tormented, Comforted or Distressed in the next world, according as their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is when they leave this. For by the Doctrine of <hi>Eternal Life</hi> he is assured that his Soul shall live, and be adjudged to an Eternal bliss or misery. By the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> he is perswaded that his Body, with all its powers, shall spring out of the dust, and be again enlivened with its ancient Soul, to be a sharer of its state, and joyntly to undergo an endless train of most exquisite woes or pleasures. And since it is the very frame and fundamental principle of our Natures studiously to pursue Pleasure, and to fly as fast from Pain, to seek good and to avoid evil: These states of future Happiness and Misery, are such as no man, who sees and believes them, can possibly be unaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, or unconcern'd in. But whosoever in his own thoughts views and beholds them, must needs find all his faculties awake, and through an innate care, and natural instinct, solicitously inquisitive after that lot which shall fall to their own share.</p>
            <p>Now if this endless happiness and misery both of Soul and Body in the next world were only <hi>casual</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent,</hi> the gift of <hi>blind chance,</hi> or <hi>partial</hi> and <hi>arbitrary favour</hi>; then would the belief of it perplex us indeed with fears and misgiving thoughts, but never encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us on to any exact care or diligent enquiry. It would be in vain for us to seek what we could never
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66440:17"/>
find, and downright folly to endeavour after satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and certainty in things which are utterly casual and Arbitrary. For what comes by <hi>chance</hi> is neither fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen by us, nor subject to us. And what is given <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily,</hi> without all rule or reason, is as fickle and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant as Arbitrary will it self is. It cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by any endeavours, because it doth not regard them; Neither can it be collected beforehand from any fixt rule or reason, seeing it observes none. And what neither our greatest wisdom can foretel, nor our exactest care prevent, it is wholly to no purpose to make a matter of our study and enquiry.</p>
            <p>But as for the Everlasting happiness or misery of our Souls and Bodies in the other Life, and at the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, they are not left at <hi>random,</hi> nor fall out by <hi>accident</hi>; but are dispensed by a <hi>wise hand,</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a <hi>fixt</hi> and <hi>established rule.</hi> For it is God who distributes them, and this distribution is in Judgment; and the procedure in that is by Laws, and those laws are unalterably fixt for us, and most plainly declared and published to us in the Gospel. So that now it is no impossible, no nor extream difficult thing for us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand which shall be our own state in the next world. For the laws are well known, proclaimed daily to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ear, by a whole order of men set apart for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; their sence and meaning is obvious to any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon understanding; and the Judgment according to them at that day will be true and faithful. God will Absolve all those whom his Gospel acquits, but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn every man whom it accuses. There will be no perverting of Justice through fear or favour, no Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence passed through partiality or ill will; but a Tryal every way unbyassed and uncorrupt, where <hi>Every one shall receive according to the things done in the body,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:66440:18"/>
2 Cor. 5.10. And <hi>Judgment shall pass upon all men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their works,</hi> Rom. 2.6.</p>
            <p>And thus as the belief of the two former Articles, <hi>the immortal state either of Bliss or Misery for our Souls,</hi> and the <hi>Resurrection of our Bodies,</hi> will inflame us with <hi>rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less desires:</hi> so if we seriously believe it, will this third Article of the <hi>great and general Judgment</hi> possess us with sure <hi>hopes</hi> of being satisfyed in this great enquiry, which of the two States will fall to our own share.</p>
            <p>And as this belief of the last Judgment will be the most effectual means to <hi>encourage,</hi> so will it be withal the surest to <hi>guide</hi> our Enquiries after it. It chalks us out a method for our search, and directs us to the readiest course for satisfaction. For if the happiness and misery of the next world is to be dispensed to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man for a reward or punishment, according to the direction of those Laws which promise or threaten them: then have we nothing more to do in this enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but to examine well what those laws are, what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience they require, what allowances and mitigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they will bear, and what lot and condition they assign us. For in that day we shall be look'd upon to be what they declare us; and be doom'd to that state which they pronounce for us. What they speak to us all now, that the Judge of all the world will pronounce upon us all then: their sentence shall be his, and what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce he will execute. He will judge us by no other measure but his own Laws; those very Laws which he has taken so much care to proclaim to us, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to press upon us; which he has put into every one of our hands, and made to be sounding daily in our ears; the <hi>laws</hi> and <hi>sanctions of the Gospel.</hi> Our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ the Judge himself has told us this long ago, <hi>The word that I have spoken, the same shall judge men at
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66440:18"/>
the last day,</hi> Joh. 12.48. And his great Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> has again confirmed it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>God shall judge the world</hi> at that day <hi>according to my Gospel,</hi> vers. 16. If we perform what those Laws peremptorily require, they now already declare us blessed, and such at the last day will Christ pronounce us. But if by sinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them we fall short of it, they denounce nothing but everlasting woes and miseries, and those he will execute: For he tells us plainly, that when he shall come to judgment <hi>in the Glory of his Father with his holy Angels, he will reward every man according to his works,</hi> Mat. 16.27. <hi>To them who, by patient continuance in well-doing, seek for glory and immortality,</hi> he will give <hi>eternal life,</hi> Rom. 2.7. <hi>But to them who obey not the Truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation, and wrath, tribulation and anguish,</hi> and that <hi>upon every man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be Jew or Gentile,</hi> vers. 8, 9. For all this shall be acted in the greatest integrity, without preferring one before an other. It is only the difference in mens works, which shall difference their conditions; but they who have been equal in their sins, shall be equal also in their sufferings. For <hi>at the appearance of Jesus Christ, God,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>without any respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons judges according to every mans work,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.7.17.</p>
            <p>The way then whereby to satisfie our selves in this great matter, is this, To look well into the Gospel, there to learn what we should be; and into our own hearts and lives, there to see what indeed we are; and thence to conclude what in the next world, whether in a state of Life or Death, we shall be.</p>
            <p>And to shew this to every man, and to let him see now beforehand how he stands prepared for the next world, and whether, if he should be called away pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to the Bar of that Judgment, he would be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66440:19"/>
acquitted or condemned in it, is my present business and design. It is to let us see our <hi>Eternal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> before we enter on it, and to make it evident to every man, who is both capable and willing to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, what shall be his endless doom of Life or Death before the Judge pronounce it.</p>
            <p>And since the <hi>Rule</hi> of that Court whereby we must all be tryed, and which must measure out to us either Life or Death, is, as we have seen, none other than the <hi>Gospel</hi> of our Judge and Saviour Jesus Christ: that I may manage this enquiry with the greater light and clearness, I will proceed in this method.</p>
            <p>First, I will enquire, <hi>What is that condition of our happiness or misery, which the Gospel indispensably exacts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>What are its mitigations and allowances, those defects which it pardons and bears with.</hi>

                  <p>Obedience the indispensable condition of happiness. The Laws of the Gospel are given as a Rule to it. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are all upon condition of it, and intended to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage it. All the threatnings are now denounced, and will be executed upon the disobedient. Of those other things whereto Pardon is promised, as well as to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Of Metonymy's. Of the Principles of Humane Actions. Of Principles of Obedience. All those speeches metonymical, where obedience is not express'd, and yet pardon is promised.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THat <hi>Condition which the Gospel indispensably requires of us,</hi> and <hi>which is to mete out to us our last doom of Bliss or Misery,</hi> is in the <hi>General</hi> our <hi>Obedience.</hi> When we are brought to that Bar, and stand to be judged according to those Laws which are proclaim'd to us in the Gospel, it is only our having kept them,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66440:20"/>
and Repented of all such transgressions of them as we have wilfully been guilty of, which can capacitate us to be rewarded by them. For 'tis just with them, as it is with all other Laws, they never promise any thing but to obedience, but threaten and punish all that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey. Whosoever breaks and despises them is guilty, they do not comfort but accuse, not acquit but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him. For there is no Law that is wisely order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but is sufficiently guarded against affront, and back'd with such punishments as will make it every mans interest to fulfil and keep it. The evil threatned, must always by far exceed the pleasure that is reaped by disobedience; so that no man may have any temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sufficient to bear him out in Sin, or ever hope to be a gainer by his transgression.</p>
               <p>This is the tenour of all wise laws, whose enactors have both <hi>wit</hi> and <hi>power</hi> sufficient to defend them. They have dreadful Punishments annexed to them, which take place upon disobedience; they encourage and reward the obedient, but severely punish all that dare presume to disobey.</p>
               <p>And this is most eminently seen in all the Laws of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. He gave them for the <hi>compleatest Rules</hi> to mens Lives, and has annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them most <hi>glorious Promises</hi> to encourage our obedience, but has made them breath out nothing but woes, and <hi>intolerable punishments</hi> to all that disobey.</p>
               <p>He has given them for <hi>Rules of Life,</hi> and <hi>annexed Rewards as encouragements to obedience.</hi> He never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his Laws for an entertainment of our eyes, but for a Rule for our Actions; not for a matter of talk and discourse, but of practice; not to be complemented by words of honour, and lofty expressions, but to be own'd in our lives, and served by obedience. He is our King, and issues out his Laws as the instruments
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66440:21"/>
of his Government: he is our Lord, and they are Rulers for his Service. They must be guides of our Lives and Actions; it is not enough to know and talk of them, but as ever we hope to live by them we must do and keep them. For in the end they will be available to no mans happiness, but his who has conscientiously per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them. <hi>In Christ Jesus,</hi> or the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, nothing</hi> avails but <hi>keeping of the Commandments of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.19. <hi>Blessed are they,</hi> saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John, who do the Commandments, for they only have right to the Tree of Life,</hi> Rev. 22.14. It is not an idle wish, or ineffectual endeavour; but a thorough practice and performance of Christs Laws which can continue us in his Love, and approve us Righteous in his Judgment. <hi>If ye keep my Commandments,</hi> says he, <hi>ye shall abide in my Love,</hi> Joh. 15.10. <hi>Let no man deceive you,</hi> for it is <hi>he</hi> only <hi>that</hi>

of Christian Laws, which was published in the Sermon upon the Mount, whereof this is in part the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Matt.</hi> 7.21. He tells us that when the Son of Man shall come to judgment, <hi>he will reward every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his works,</hi> Matt. 16.27. and he repeats it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in his declaration to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John, Behold I come quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and my reward is with me, to give every man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as his work shall be,</hi> Rev. 22.12 And so it was in that Prophetick sight of the Last Judgment, which this same Apostle had vouchsafed him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. For there, as we are told, when <hi>the Sea gave up the Dead which were in it; and Death and Hell delivered up the Dead which were in them; and they all both small and great stood before the Throne, and him that sate thereon: they were judged every man according to his WORKS,</hi> vers. 11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p>His Laws then Christ has given us, not for talk and discourse, but for action and practice; and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises he has annexed to them; not as rewards of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but only of active service and obedience: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if men fail, Gods Rewards belong not to them: they can make no claim or colourable pretence to them because they cannot show that which is to be rewarded by him.</p>
               <p>Nay further, if men disobey, they are not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from all glorious hopes; but are moreover put into a desperate state of <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>dreadful expectations.</hi> For God has back'd his Laws with <hi>threatnings</hi> as well as <hi>promises</hi>: and as they propose most noble <hi>rewards</hi> to all that are obedient; so likewise do they breath out most intolerable <hi>punishments</hi> to all that disobey. For every Man at the last day will be declared <hi>a Child of wrath,</hi> who is a <hi>son of disobedience</hi>; and he shall most certainly be Damned who dyes without amendment and Repentance, in works which are wilfully and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66440:22"/>
sinful. Christs Gospel has already judged this long before-hand; and at that day he will confirm it. <hi>When the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels: i. e.</hi> when he shall come with his Royal attendance to judge the world, <hi>He will take vengeance,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, on all them that OBEY not his Gospel, who shall be punished with everlasting destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the presence of the Lord,</hi> 2 Thess. 1.7, 8, 9. When he comes in state with <hi>the ten thousands of his Saints,</hi> it will be <hi>to execute Judgment upon all that are ungodly, for all the ungodly DEEDS which they have committed,</hi> Jude 14, 15. And when our Lord himself gives a relation of his proceedings at that day, he tells us that whosoever they be, or whatsoever they may pretend, if their works have been disobedient, they shall hear no sentence from him but what consigns them to Eternal Punishment. <hi>I will profess</hi> thus <hi>unto them,</hi> says he, <hi>I never knew you: Depart from me, ye that WORK iniquity,</hi> Matt. 7.23.</p>
               <p>This will be the method of Christs Judgment; and these the measures of his Sentence: he will pronounce Mercy and Life upon all that are obedient, but Death and Hell to all that disobey.</p>
               <p>And indeed it were hight of folly and madness to expect he should do otherwise, and to fancy that when he comes to judge us, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>according to the</hi> Laws of his <hi>Gospel,</hi> he should absolve and reward us, when in our works and actions we have transgressed them. For this were to thwart his own rule, and to go cross to his own measures; it were to encourage those, whom his laws threaten; to acquit such as they condemn: and, in one word, not to judge <hi>according</hi> to them, as he has expresly declared he will, but <hi>against</hi> them.</p>
               <p>If we would know then what condition we shall be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66440:22"/>
adjudged to in the next world, we must examine what our obedience has been in this. We can have no as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of a favourable Sentence in that Court, but only the doing of our duty. Our last doom shall turn, not upon our <hi>knowing</hi> or <hi>not knowing,</hi> our <hi>willing</hi> or <hi>not willing</hi>; but upon our <hi>obeying</hi> or <hi>disobeying.</hi> It is in vain to cast about for other marks, and to seek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter other evidences: nothing less than this performance of our duty can avail us unto life; and by the <hi>merits of Christ,</hi> and the <hi>grace of his Gospel,</hi> it shall.</p>
               <p>And thus we see in the <hi>general</hi> what those terms and that condition are, which, to mete out our last doom of Bliss or Misery, the Gospel indispensably exacts of us. It is nothing less than a <hi>working service</hi> and <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> the enquiry to be made at that day being only this, whether we <hi>have done what was commanded us.</hi> If we have performed what was required of us, we shall be pronounced Righteous, and sentenced to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life: but if we have wilfully transgressed, and wrought wickedness; without amendment and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, we shall then be declared, incorrigible Sinners, and adjudged to Everlasting Death.</p>
               <p>This indeed is a very great truth, but yet such as very few are willing to see and to consider of. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is a very laborious service, and a painful task; and they are not many in number who will be content to undergo it. And if a man may have no just hopes upon any thing less than it, the case of most dying men is desperate. But as men will live and dye in sin, so will they live and dye in hopes too. And therefore they catch at softer terms, and build upon an easier condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And because the Gospel promises Salvation, and a happy sentence to <hi>faith, love, repentance,</hi> our <hi>being in Christ,</hi> our <hi>knowing Christ,</hi> and other things besides obedience: they conclude that they shall be acquitted
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66440:23"/>
at that Bar upon the account of <hi>any,</hi> or <hi>all</hi> of these, though they do not obey with them. They make Faith, Love, Repentance and the rest, to be something se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from obedience; something which will save them, when that is wanting. So that if they <hi>be in Christ,</hi> if they <hi>know</hi> and <hi>believe with the mind,</hi> and <hi>love</hi> and <hi>repent in their hearts</hi>; their hope is to be absolved at the last day, be their lives and actions never so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient.</p>
               <p>But this is a most dangerous and damning errour. For it makes men secure from danger, till they are past all possibility of recovering out of it; and causes them to trust to a false support so long, till it lets them drop into Hell, and sink down in damnation.</p>
               <p>And although it be sufficiently evident from what has been already said, that our obedience is that only thing which will be admitted as a just plea, and as a qualification able to save us in that Court: yet because I would fully subvert all these false grounds, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men support their pernicious hopes and sinful lives together, I will go on to prove it still further.</p>
               <p>And this will be most plainly effected by shewing that all <hi>those other terms</hi> and <hi>conditions, whereto the Gospel sometimes promises pardon and happiness, concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all in this, and save us no otherwise than by being springs and principles of our obedience.</hi> They are not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to our doing of our duty, and keeping the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; but imply it. For when pardon is promised to <hi>Faith,</hi> to <hi>Love,</hi> to <hi>Repentance,</hi> or any thing else; it is never promised to them as <hi>separate</hi> from obedience, but as <hi>containing</hi> it. Obedience is that still for which a man is saved and pardoned; it is not excluded from them, but expressed by them.</p>
               <p>In order to a clearer apprehension of the truth of this, I think fit to observe that there is an ordinary
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66440:23"/>
figure and form of speech very usual both with God and men, which the Rhetoricians call a <hi>Metonymie</hi> or <hi>Transnomination,</hi> and that is a <hi>transferring of a word, which is the particular Name of one thing, to express an other.</hi> The use of it is this, that in things which have a near relation and dependance upon each other, as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the <hi>cause</hi> and its <hi>effect</hi> have, the particular name of either may many times signifie both, so that when the name only of one is expressed, yet really both are meant and intended. And then by that word, which in its proper sence stands only for the effect, we are to understand, not it alone, but together with it the cause also that produced it: and by that which properly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the cause, we are to mean, not the bare cause alone, but, besides it, the effect which flows from it likewise.</p>
               <p>As for the latter of these, the <hi>bare naming of the cause when we intend, together with it, to express its natural consequent and effect too</hi>; because it is that which chiefly concerns our present business, I will set down some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of it which daily occur in common speech. If we advise a man to <hi>trust his Physician</hi> or his <hi>Lawyer,</hi> our meaning is not barely that he should <hi>give credit</hi> to them; but together with that, that he shew the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of such credit, in <hi>following</hi> and <hi>observing</hi> them. If we are earnest with any man to <hi>hearken to some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> that is given him, we intend not by hearkning to express barely his <hi>giving ear</hi> to it, but besides that his suffering the effects of such attention in <hi>practising</hi> and <hi>obeying</hi> it. And thus we commonly say that we have got a Cold, when we mean a Disease upon cold; or a Surfeit, when we understand a sickness upon Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting. In these, and many other instances which might be mentioned, we daily find that in the speech and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of men, the cause alone is oft times named, when the effect is withal intended, and accordingly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66440:24"/>
to be expressed; and that both are meant, when barely one is spoken. The effect doth so hang upon its cause, and so naturally and evidently follow after it, that we look upon it as a needless thing to express its coming after, when once we have named its cause which goes before: but we ordinarily judge it to be sufficiently mentioned, when we have expressed that cause which as is evident to us all, produces and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it.</p>
               <p>And as it is thus in the speech of <hi>men,</hi> so is it in the language of <hi>God</hi> too. He talks to us in our own way, and uses such forms of speech and figurative expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as are in common use among our selves. And to seek no further for instances of this, than these that lye before us, he expresses our <hi>works</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> by our <hi>knowledge,</hi> our <hi>repentance,</hi> our <hi>love,</hi> and such other <hi>causes</hi> and <hi>principles</hi> as effect and produce it.</p>
               <p>For we must take notice of this also, that our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward works and actions depend upon a train of powers within us, which, as springs and causes of them, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and effect them. For our <hi>passions</hi> excite to them; our <hi>understandings</hi> consider of them and direct them; our <hi>wills</hi> command and choose them; and then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in pursuance of all these, our <hi>bodily powers</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute and exert them. The actions of a man flow from all the ingredients of the humane nature, each principle contributes its share, and bears a part towards it. For from the constitution of our natural frame, our actions are placed wholly in the power of our own wills; and our wills are set in a middle station, to be moved by our appetites and passions, and guided and directed by our minds or intellects. We do and perform no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what we will; neither do we will any thing but what we know and desire; what our reason and passion inclines and directs to. And because
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66440:24"/>
these three inward faculties, our <hi>minds,</hi> and <hi>wills,</hi> and <hi>passions,</hi> give being and beginning to our outward works and practice: therefore are they, by the Masters of <hi>moral Philosophy</hi> and <hi>Divinity,</hi> ordinarily called the <hi>Causes</hi> and <hi>Principles of Humane Actions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But these three principles of humane actions in <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> lye not more open to produce good than evil. They are all under the unrestrain'd power of our own free will: it is that which determines them either for God or against him; but in themselves they are indifferently fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and serve equally to bring forth acts of Obedience, or of disobedience and sin. To make these principles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of <hi>works</hi> or <hi>actions in general,</hi> to become princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>good works</hi> and <hi>obedience,</hi> there are other near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er tempers and qualifications required, which may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine them, that in <hi>themselves</hi> are free to both, to effect one, and be Authours of such actions only where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we serve and obey God. And this is done by the nearer and more immediate efficiency of <hi>Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Love,</hi> and the like. For he who knows Gods Laws, and believes his Gospel with his understanding; who in his heart loves God, and hates Sin; whose will is utterly resolved for good, and against evil: he it is, whose faculties in <hi>themselves</hi> indifferent are thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately disposed, who is ready and prepared to perform his duty. His Faith directs him to those Laws which he is to obey, and to all the powerful motives to Obedience: it shews him how it is bound upon him by all the Joys of Heaven, and by all the Pains of Hell, and this quickens his passions, and confirms all good resolutions, and makes him in his will and heart to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and desire it. And when both his mind, his will, and passions, which were before indifferent, are thus gained over and determinately fixed for it; in the efficiency of inward principles there is no more to be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66440:25"/>
done, but he is in the ready way to work and perform it in outward operation. So that as our minds, wills, and passions, are principles of humane actions in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, whether good or evil: these nearer dispositions, our Faith, Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are principles particularly of good works and obedience.</p>
               <p>And since our obedient actions proceed in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from the power and efficiency of these principles: God, according to our own way of expressing things, is wont many times only to name them, when he intends withal to express our obedience it self which results from them. Although he barely mention one, yet he understands both; and in speaking of the cause, he would be taken to imply the effect likewise. Thus when he promises <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> to our <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and <hi>belief of his Gospel,</hi> to our <hi>Repentance from our Sins,</hi> to our <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Fear of God,</hi> which, with several others, are those preparatory dispositions that fix and determine our minds, wills, and passions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in themselves, to effect Obedient actions; he doth not in any wise intend that these shall Save us, and procure Pardon for us without Obedience, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by signifying and implying it. Wheresoever Mercy and Salvation at the last day are promised, and this condition of our working and obeying is not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, it is always meant and understood. That which such mercy was promised to, is either the <hi>cause</hi> of our Obedience, or the <hi>effect</hi> and <hi>sign</hi> of it; the speech is <hi>metonymical,</hi> and more was meant by it than was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed. Though the word was not named, yet the thing was intended; for obedience is ever requisite to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and nothing has Mercy promised to it in the last Judgment, but what some way or other is a sign of it, or produces and effects it.</p>
               <p>This I might well take for granted upon the strength
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66440:25"/>
of that proof which has been already urged for our Obedience being the sole condition of our being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted at that day. But because the interest of souls is so much concerned in it, I will be yet more particular, and proceed to show further that this sence and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of all such places is the very same that God himself has expressly put upon them. For concerning all those things, whereto he has promised a favourable sentence at the last Judgment, he assures us that they are of no account with him, nor will be owned as a good plea at that Bar when they are separate from Obedience, but then only when they effect and work it. But when he says that Faith, Repentance, Love, or any other thing shall save us, he means not all, or any, but only a working Faith, an obedient Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, an active Love; a Faith, Love, and Repentance, which do not overlook Obedience, but accompany and produce it. So that first or last Obedience is still that wherein all the rest must concenter and agree, that alone condition which our judge will accept, and which we may safely trust to. And this will fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by running over the particulars.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. Of Pardon promised to Faith, Knowledge and being in Christ.</head>

                  <head>The CONTENTS. </head>
                  <p>Of Pardon and happiness promised to Faith and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Of the nature of Faith in general. Of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Jewish, and Christian Faith. Of this last as ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying and saving. Of the fitness of Christian Faith and Knowledge to produce Obedience. Pardon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to them no further than they are productive of it. Of Pardon promised to being in Christ. Christ sometimes signifies the Christian Religion, sometimes the Christian Church. Being in Christ, is being of Christs Religion, or a member of Christs Church. The fitness of these to effect Obedience. Pardon promised to them no further than they do.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FIRST this condition of our acceptance which is to mete out to us our last doom of Bliss and Mercy, and whereto Life and Pardon are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised at the last day, is sometimes called <hi>knowledge,</hi> or, what is only a more particular way of knowing, a knowing upon witness or testimony, <hi>Faith.</hi> By, or upon the account of, <hi>his knowledge,</hi> or the knowledge of him, <hi>shall my Righteous Servant,</hi> when he sits to judge them, <hi>justifie many,</hi> says God of our Judge and Saviour Christ by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah, Isa.</hi> 53.11. And <hi>this is Life Eternal,</hi> says our Lord himself, <hi>to know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66440:26"/>
sent,</hi> Joh. 17.3. And then as for <hi>Faith,</hi> which is the particular way of knowledge among us Christians, who owe all that we know in order to Heaven and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the witness and testimony of Jesus Christ, the places which promise Life and Pardon unto it are to be met with in abundance. <hi>Whosoever believes on me,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>shall not perish, but have Everlasting Life,</hi> Joh. 3.15, 16. And again, <hi>This is the will of him that sent me, that whosoever believes on me may have Everlasting Life,</hi> Joh. 6.40. And when he sends out his Apostles after his Resurrection to proclaim the terms of Mercy and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to all the world, he bids them say, <hi>Whosoever believeth and is Baptized shall be saved,</hi> Mar. 16.16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>belief</hi> in the <hi>general,</hi> is a <hi>thinking something to be true upon the testimony of those persons who declare it.</hi> And herein it differs from other sorts of <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> because in them we believe upon the evidence and apparent reason of the <hi>things themselves</hi>; but in this upon the witness and authority of those <hi>persons who reveal</hi> them. For then we are said to <hi>know, when we assent upon the Authority of things</hi>; but then to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, when we assent upon the Authority of persons</hi>; when not the evidence of the things revealed, but the word and testimony of the revealer make us give credit to his Revelation.</p>
               <p>This is the nature of Faith in general, it is a giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing credit to a thing, or taking it to be true upon the testimony or authority of such persons as declare it. And according to the difference of this testimony, our Faith upon it is differenced and distinguished also. For if we believe any thing upon the bare word of a man, it is an <hi>Humane</hi>; if upon the bare word and testimony of God, it is a <hi>Divine</hi> Faith.</p>
               <p>Divine Faith then is nothing else, but <hi>a belief of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelations,</hi> a taking any thing to be true because
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66440:27"/>
God has told us it is so. And therefore we may be said to have Divine Faith of as many things as God has any way attested or revealed to us. And for Gods Revelations, they have been derived to us in several ways, and by several instruments.</p>
               <p>For some things God has revealed to us by the <hi>light of Nature.</hi> That light came from him, and is his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. For <hi>the spirit of a Man is the Candle of the Lord,</hi> which, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John</hi> saith in another case of our Saviour, <hi>enlightens every man that cometh into the world,</hi> Joh. 1.9. And in this general sence of Faith, for a <hi>natural Faith</hi> or a belief of all natural Revelations; all matters of knowledge are likewise matters of Faith, because at last all natural light and evidence of things rests upon Gods Revelation; that very evidence being no otherwise a proof to us that things are true, than we are assured that God is the Author of it, and that it is his Testimony and declaration to them that they are so. And by this way of Revelation, this natural light, God has declared to us two great foundations of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <hi>his own existence,</hi> and <hi>his Providence</hi>; that there is a God, and that he will love and reward all such as serve and worship him. The belief of which Articles so testified, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> affirms to be a part of <hi>Faith</hi>; yea a part so <hi>fundamental</hi> as is absolutely necessary to our pleasing of God and to all Religion: <hi>without Faith,</hi> saith he, <hi>it is impossible to please God, for he who comes to God must believe that HE IS, and that he is A REWARDER of them that diligently seek him,</hi> Heb. 11.6.</p>
               <p>Other things God has revealed, not by the <hi>light of nature,</hi> seeing they are such things as that alone could never have discovered to us, but either by his own <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate voice or inspiration,</hi> or by the <hi>mediation</hi> and <hi>message of inspired men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:66440:27"/>By the former he revealed to <hi>Noah</hi> the <hi>Drowning of the old world,</hi> Gen. 6.13. the belief whereof is called <hi>Noah</hi>'s <hi>Faith, Heb.</hi> 11.7. To <hi>Abraham</hi> his having a <hi>numerous Issue</hi> by his <hi>Wife Sarah,</hi> when as yet they had no Child, and in all appearance were too <hi>old</hi> ever to expect one, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.5, 6 and <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.17, 19. the belief whereof is likewise call'd <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Faith, Heb.</hi> 11.17, 18, 19. To <hi>Moses</hi> his <hi>passing over all the houses of the Israelites,</hi> where he should see the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Paschal Lamb sprinkled for a <hi>Token,</hi> when he would slay all the First-born throughout all the Land of <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 12.12, 13. the belief of which Revelation is also call'd the <hi>Faith of Moses, Heb.</hi> 11.28.</p>
               <p>By the latter he reveal'd his will more largely to the whole <hi>people of Israel</hi> by the mouth and <note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 3.19.</note> 
                  <hi>mediation</hi> of his Servant <hi>Moses</hi>; and because both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> concurr'd in this Testimony, their belief of his message was their <hi>Faith, not in God only,</hi> but together with him in his <hi>Servant Moses</hi> too. For because the Law and Religion which they received, though it came ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally from God, was yet derived down to them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by his Ministry, and they knew no otherwise what God had spoken to them than by his Testimony and upon his Authority: therefore are they said in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and embracing that Divine Law, which was delivered to them by <hi>Moses,</hi> to believe, not <hi>the Lord</hi> alone, but also his <hi>Servant Moses, Exod.</hi> 14.31. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.46. to be <hi>Baptized into Moses,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2. to be <hi>Moses</hi>'s <hi>Disciples, Joh.</hi> 9.28. to <hi>trust</hi> or place their hope <hi>in Moses, Joh.</hi> 5.45. to <hi>obey</hi> or <hi>hearken</hi> unto <hi>Moses, Luk.</hi> 16.31.</p>
               <p>But the most clear and full Revelation that God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made of his will to men, was by the message and mediation of his own Son, <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> For <hi>God who at sundry times, and in divers manners spake in times
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66440:28"/>
past to</hi> the Jews by <hi>Moses</hi> and to <hi>the Fathers by the Prophets; hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son,</hi> Heb. 1.1. And the belief of his Gospel, or taking for certain Truths upon his Authority all those things which he has declared to us in Gods Name, is call'd the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> as the other was the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Faith. For he being the great Author and deriver of this last and greatest Revelation of God down to us, and our belief of it being upon his immediate Authority, he being, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>the Authour and finisher of our Faith,</hi> Heb. 12.2. Our belief of it is called, not only <hi>Faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God,</hi> Heb. 6.1. but also <hi>Faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> Acts 20.21. And because the knowledge of our whole Religion got into our minds this way, upon our submission to Christs Authority, and our Faith or belief of his Testimony; therefore is our <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> it self most commonly in the Scriptures called our <hi>Faith.</hi> The Preaching of it is called <hi>Preaching the Faith,</hi> Gal. 1.23. the hearing of it, <hi>hearing of Faith,</hi> Gal. 3.2. the profession of it, a <hi>profession of Faith,</hi> Heb. 10.23. the contending for it, a <hi>striving for the Faith,</hi> Phil. 1.27. the erring in it, an <hi>erring from the Faith,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.10. the falling from it, <hi>a making shipwrack of the Faith,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.19. obedience to it, the <hi>obedience of Faith,</hi> Rom. 1.5. and the Righteousness required in it, and effected by it, <hi>the Righteousness of Faith,</hi> Rom. 4.11.13.</p>
               <p>So that in like manner as the <hi>Mosaick Faith</hi> was a belief of the Divinity of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, upon the <hi>Authority of Moses:</hi> the <hi>Christian Faith</hi> is a belief of the Divine institution of our Christian Religion upon the <hi>Authority of Christ.</hi> It is a taking upon his word all those things for truths of God, which he has declared to us in Gods Name. A belief begot in us by vertue of his Testimony, that all his Doctrines
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66440:28"/>
are Gods Truths; that all his Laws are Gods Precepts; that all his promises are Gods Promises; and that all his threats are Gods threatnings: in sum, that that whole Religion and Gospel which Christ has delivered to us in Gods Name, is the very Religion and Word of God.</p>
               <p>The belief of all this upon the <hi>Authority of Christ</hi> makes our <hi>Faith Christian</hi>; and the <hi>good effects</hi> of it upon our <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>lives</hi> make it <hi>justifying and saving.</hi> For when by vertue of this Faith we truly Repent and sincerely obey, which is the great condition, as we have seen, whereupon at the last day we must all be pardoned and justified Eternally; it is a <hi>justifying:</hi> as when by vertue of it we are saved and delivered from the dominion and service of our Sins, which as the Angel hath <note n="b" place="margin">Matt 1.21.</note> assured us, are those principal evils that Christ came to <hi>save us from,</hi> it is a <hi>saving</hi> Faith.</p>
               <p>This is the nature of our <hi>Christian knowledge,</hi> and our <hi>Christian Faith.</hi> And as for it now, it is the very <hi>fundamental cause</hi> and natural spring of all our Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an service and obedience. For it is because we believe Jesus to be the Lord, because we know those Laws which he has given us, and give credit to him when he tells us of the insupportable punishments which he will one day inflict for sin, and of the glorious rewards which he will confer upon obedience: It is by means of our knowledge and belief of all these in our minds, I say, that we serve and obey him in our outward actions. It is our knowledge and belief that lets us see the reasonableness of his Precepts, the power of his Assistances, the glory of his Rewards, and the terror of his Punishments; and in all respects convinces us of the beauty and profit of Obedience. And this sight and conviction in our minds cannot well miss of gaining our hearts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions. For the belief of his endless judgments will
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66440:29"/>
raise our fears; the belief of his infinite rewards will quicken our hopes; the belief of his inexpressible kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness will kindle our love; and by all these our souls will be led Captive into eager desires, and firm reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, and be fully purposed to keep Gods Laws, that so they may avoid that terrible Death which he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, and attain those matchless joys which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to our Obedience. And when once, by means of this faith and knowledge, Gods Laws have gain'd both our wills and passions, which are the inward springs and causes of them, they cannot fail of being obeyed in our works and actions which are produced by them. But we shall quickly go on to perform what we resolve, and to do what we desire; and so in very deed fulfill and obey them. Upon which account of our Christian Faith having so mighty an influence upon our Christian and obedient practice, our obedience it self, as being the effect of it and produced by it, is call'd <hi>the obedience of Faith,</hi> Rom. 16.26. The Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which it exacts of us, and <note n="c" place="margin">Jam. 2.22. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>cooperates</hi> to work in us, <hi>the Righteousness of Faith,</hi> Gal 5.5. Our Christian warfar or striving against Sin, is called <hi>the good sight of Faith,</hi> 1 Tim, 6.12. And because in this contest our great succors which protect us, and keep us from faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and at last make us victorious, are some points or promises of our Religious belief: therefore it is stiled <hi>a shield, and a breast-plate of Faith,</hi> 1 Thess. 5.8. and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John</hi> affirms plainly <hi>that this is the victory over the world, even our Faith,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.4.</p>
               <p>And for this reason it is, because our Faith and knowledge are so powerful a cause and principle of our Obedience, that God speaks so great things of them, and has made such valuable promises to them. He never intends to reward the Faith and knowledge of our minds, further than they <note n="d" place="margin">

                  <hi>working Faith,</hi> that they confer a right to the promised reward, and are available to our Salvation. For when in the places mentioned, or in any other, God promises that he who <hi>knows Christ,</hi> or <hi>believes in Christ</hi> shall live; he speaks <hi>metonymically,</hi> and means Faith and knowledge with this effect of a working ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and obedience.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>knowledge,</hi> 'tis plain that God accepts it no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise than as it effects obedience, nor can we any otherwise confide in it. <hi>Hereby</hi> alone, says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John, we know that we know him,</hi> in that sence of knowledge whereto God has promised life and pardon, <hi>if we keep his Commandments.</hi> But <hi>he that saith I know him, and</hi> for all that <hi>keepeth not his Commandments, he is a lyar, and the truth is not in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.3, 4.</p>
               <p>And then as for <hi>Faith,</hi> no man is interpreted to have that Faith which is made the condition of our pardon and acceptance, but he who is acted by it, and in his works is obedient to it. <hi>The Faith,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, which in Christ Jesus</hi> or the Christian Religion <hi>availeth any thing</hi> to that <hi>Righteousness</hi> which all Christians <hi>hope for,</hi> is that only <hi>which worketh by Love,</hi> Gal. 5.5, 6. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins the change within, by <hi>purifying of our hearts</hi> and desires, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. and thence goes on to perfect it in our outward works and actions. And unless it proceed to this, it will never be able to bear us out, and to justifie us at Gods Bar: for there, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>James</hi> tells us, <hi>by our</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Matt. 25.34, 35, 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>works we must all be justifyed, and not by a Faith only</hi> which works nothing, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.24. Such alas! will be wholly useless, and of no consideration in that Court; it will not any way profit, and then
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66440:30"/>
certainly it cannot save us. For <hi>what doth it profit, my Brethren, though a man</hi> be able to <hi>say,</hi> either here or hereafter, <hi>he hath Faith, and hath not works?</hi> will that be allow'd a sufficient plea in Gods Judgment? <hi>shall</hi> that <hi>Faith save him?</hi> no surely, it never will, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.14. This unworking Faith is not that effectual Faith which the Gospel encourages, but its worthless shell and liveless carkass. <hi>For wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? Even as the body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,</hi> vers. 20, 26. It is Faith only in an imperfect degree, and a weak unprofitable measure; for it is not arrived to a perfect pitch, to that compleat state whereto the Gospel doth at present promise Life, and Christ will at the last Day award it, till it shows it self in action, and our lives express the power of it. <hi>Our Father Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>James, was justified by works,</hi> produced by Faith, <hi>when,</hi> in an unstagger'd belief that God would make good his promise of a numerous issue by his Son <hi>Isaac,</hi> though it were by raising him up again from the <note n="g" place="margin">Heb. 1.17, 19.</note> dead, he would obey his command which seemed quite to overthrow it, and <hi>offered up his Son upon the Altar. Seest thou how his Faith</hi> in Gods Power and Promise <hi>wrought</hi> prevalently over all opposition <note n="h" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, wrought to his works or to make him work.</note>, <hi>to</hi> the production of that <hi>his</hi> strange <hi>work</hi>; and <hi>by</hi> this justifying <hi>work</hi> upon it <hi>was</hi> his <hi>Faith made perfect?</hi> vers. 21, 22.</p>
               <p>So that when all is done, we see that there is no Life or Pardon promised to any Faith or knowledge which are separate from Obedience, but to such only as cooperate to them, and imply them. There is no belief wherewith our Judge at the last day will be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, or wherein we are safe; which either he will accept, or we may trust to, if our dutiful works are wanting. So that <hi>this is,</hi> and ever will be, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:66440:30"/>
says, <hi>a faithful saying, and such as every good Christian man ought constantly to receive</hi> or affirm, <hi>that they who</hi> have Faith, or <hi>have believed in God, be careful to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> obedience and <hi>good works,</hi> because it is they which at the last day must do all men good, <hi>are good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable unto men,</hi> Tit. 3.8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This condition of our acceptance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gospel promises a happy sentence of Life and Pardon in the last judgment, is sometimes called <hi>Being in Christ. There is no condemnation,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, to them who are in Christ Jesus,</hi> Rom. 8.1.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Christ</hi> we must know, many times in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture signifies the <hi>Religion</hi> of Christ. Thus <hi>the Law</hi> is said to be <hi>a Schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, i. e.</hi> the imperfect rule of the Mosaick Religion was fitted for the minority of the world, and intended to train men up, as Children are by School Discipline, for the more perfect and manly institution of the Christian, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24.

And our Lord himself tells the Jews in the Parable of the Rich Man, that they <hi>have Moses and the Prophets,</hi> and bids them <hi>hear them, Luk.</hi> 6.29. where he cannot mean their <hi>persons,</hi> in regard they were dead long before, and got without the reach of their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but their <hi>Writings and Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as <hi>Christ</hi> many times signifies the <hi>Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> so is <hi>being in Christ</hi> the very same with <hi>being of his Religion,</hi> or <hi>being a Christian.</hi> Thus S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> tells us of <hi>Andronicus</hi> and <hi>Junia,</hi> who embraced the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Doctrine whilst he persecuted and opposed it, that <hi>they were in Christ, i. e.</hi> in Christs Religion, before him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.7. They who dyed <hi>in the profession of the Christian Faith,</hi> are said to be <hi>fallen asleep in Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.18. <hi>The veil of Moses is done away in Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.14. <hi>The veil of Moses, i. e.</hi> the types and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure shadows of the Mosaical Religion, are <hi>done away in Christ, i. e.</hi> by the plain clearness of the Christian. Thus I knew a <hi>man in Christ,</hi> is no more than I knew a <hi>Christian man,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.2. and the <hi>Churches of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea in Christ,</hi> are the very same as the <hi>Christian Churches among the Jews,</hi> Gal. 1.22. So when we read that <hi>in Christ Jesus neither Circumcision availeth any thing, nor Vncircumcision; but a new Creature,</hi> Gal. 6.15. the meaning is only this, that what price soever the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Moses</hi> put upon this outward Rite of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and those other Jewish observances whereof it was the federal undertaking: yet the <hi>Religion of Christ</hi> doth not regard them at all, but that all which can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail us <hi>in it</hi> is only a new Creature. And to the same sence S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> speaks of <hi>a good conversation in Christ, i. e.</hi> in Christs Religion, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. And to name no more instances in a case so evident, we read not only of men, but likewise of bonds <hi>in Christ; i. e.</hi> of mens being bound for the Religion and Faith of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66440:31"/>
Christ. <hi>My bonds in Christ,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, are manifest in all the Palace, and in all other places,</hi> Phil. 1.13.</p>
               <p>But besides this sence of the words, our <hi>being in Christ,</hi> for our <hi>being of the Christian Religion</hi>; there is another very near it, which it is pertinent to our present busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to observe; and that is our <hi>being in the Christian Church.</hi> Thus S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> says that <hi>we being many members, are</hi> yet <hi>one body,</hi> or Corporation <hi>in Christ,</hi> or in the Society and Church of Christians, wherein we are <hi>every one members one of another,</hi> Rom. 12.5. And Gods gathering together all particular Christians scatter'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the world into <hi>one Catholick Church or Society,</hi> is called his <hi>gathering together in one all things in Christ,</hi> Eph. 1.10. Thus our admission <hi>into Christs Church</hi> by <hi>baptism,</hi> is called our being <hi>engraffed or implanted into him. We have been planted together,</hi> says the Apostle, <hi>in the likeness of his death</hi>; or in Baptismal immersion, which is a representation of burial after death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5.</p>
               <p>As for our <hi>Being in Christ</hi> then, which sets us beyond the reach of danger and condemnation, it is the same as our <hi>being of the Christian Religion,</hi> and <hi>members of the Christian Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this Communion and membership of Christs Church, and profession of his Religion, is a most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and effectual means to make men practise and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey it. For to be in the Church of Christ, is to live under the preaching of his word, the solemn return of Holy Prayers, the Administration of Blessed Sacraments, the counsel and direction of wise Guides, the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of good examples, the correction and discipline of Church Governours, and all the other outward means of Grace and Obedience. And then the profession and owning of his Religion, if it be true and undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled, implies our Faith and belief of it; which is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:66440:32"/>
the great and only expedient that Christ could think of for the reformation of a wicked world; and which, as we have already seen, is a most effectual means and sure principle of good life and practice.</p>
               <p>And because our <hi>being in Christ, i. e.</hi> our profession of Christs Religion, and Communion and Society with Christs Church, is so powerful a principle of our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient service; therefore has God promised to it that Life and Pardon which is the inseparable reward of Obedience it self. He doth not in any wise intend that every man who bears the Name of Christ, and is of his retinue, that will make a bare profession of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in calling of him <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> without any real works and performance, shall have right to these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when he comes to Judgment. <hi>Not every one that saith unto me Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; but he only who doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven,</hi> Matt. 7.21. Nay in the next verse he goes higher, <hi>Many will say unto me in that day, Have we not</hi> done more than barely professed thy Name, have we not done thee high and honourable service, <hi>viz. prophesied in thy Name, and in thy Name cast out Devils, and in thy Name done many wondrous works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me,</hi> you are no such <note n="k" place="margin">

He speaks metonymically, and implies our works and actions, as well as that Communion and profession which signifies them, and ought to produce them.</p>
               <p>And in this the Scriptures are express, <hi>He that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:66440:32"/>
KEEPS his Commandments dwells in Christ, and Christ in him,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John,</hi> 1 Ep. 3.24. It is nothing less than our fulfilling of his Laws who is head of that body where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we joyn our selves as members; and our being indeed what we pretend, and obeying the rules of that Religion which we profess, that will at the last day be interpreted for our <hi>being in him</hi> in such sort as qualifies us to be saved by him. <hi>Whoso KEEPETH his word,</hi> says the same Apostle, <hi>in him is the love of God made perfect, and hereby,</hi> by this perfection of love in Obedience, <hi>we know that we are in him:</hi> So that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he be <hi>that saith he abideth in him,</hi> he <hi>ought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self also so to walk even as he walked,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.5, 6. The necessity of connexion between these two, <hi>viz. being a member of Christs Church, and a good Man</hi>; between <hi>professing of Christs Religion, and obeying it</hi>; was so evident, and so well known and allowed of in the first times of Christianity, that both were under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, when either was mentioned. To <hi>put on Christ</hi> in the Apostles days, was the same as <hi>to make no provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof,</hi> Rom. 13.14. And <hi>to learn Christ,</hi> was but another phrase for <hi>to put off concerning their former CONVERSATION the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful Lusts; and to put on the new man, which after</hi> the similitude of <hi>God is created in righteousness and true holiness,</hi> Eph. 4.20, 22, 24. A <hi>Christian</hi> and a <hi>keeper of Gods Laws,</hi> were then only two words for the same thing. For they thought nothing could be a greater contradiction, than for a man to profess himself a servant of Christ, and yet to pay him no Obedience; to own the Name of a Christian, and yet to lead the life of a Heathen. <hi>The time past of our lives,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> or that time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we became Christians, <hi>must suffice</hi> us wherein <hi>to have wrought the will of the Gentiles,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.3. But
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:66440:33"/>
when once we have listed our selves in Christs service, and are <hi>called upon by his Name,</hi> we must renounce all our former ways, and <hi>depart from all iniquity,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19.</p>
               <p>So that in the language of those <hi>first times,</hi> and in the meaning of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> mens <hi>being in Christ</hi> is by no means separate from <hi>obedience,</hi> but implies it. To talk of an <hi>interest in him,</hi> without <hi>fulfilling of his Laws,</hi> is but vain Cant and unprofitable speech. It is to talk without Book, and to use a Scripture phrase, but against the Scriptures meaning. For at the last day, when Christ comes to expound his own Gospel, we shall hear him pronounce, what <hi>it</hi> has already in plain words declared to us, that no man is savingly <hi>in Christ</hi> who is <hi>out</hi> with his Laws; but that he only is so <hi>in him,</hi> as to be secure from all Condemnation, who has <hi>kept</hi> his Commandments and faithfully <hi>obey'd</hi> him.</p>

                  <p>Of Pardon promised to Repentance, Regeneration, a New Nature, a New Creature. The Nature of Repentance, it includes amendment and Obedience. The Nature of Regeneration and a New Creature. Its fitness to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Obedience. Some mens Repentance ineffectual. The folly of it. Pardon promised to Repentance and Regeneration no further than they effect Obedience. In the case of dying Penitents a change of mind accepted

without a change of practice. That only where God sees a change of Practice would ensue upon it. This would seldom happen upon death-bed resolutions and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. The general ineffectiveness of this shown by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. Two reasons of it. <hi>1.</hi> Because it proceeds ordinarily upon an inconstant temporary principle, <hi>viz.</hi> nearness of Death and present fears of it. Though it always begins there, yet sometimes it grows up upon a principle that is more lasting, <hi>viz.</hi> a conviction of the absolute necessity of Heaven and a Holy Life. <hi>2.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is ordinarily in a weak and incompetent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. All TRVE resolution is not able to reform Men. Sick-bed resolutions generally unable. Such ineffective resolutions unavailing to mens Pardon.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>THirdly,</hi> That condition which the Gospel exacts of us as the terms whereupon we must hope to find Life and Pardon at the last day, is oft-times called <hi>Repentance, Regeneration, a New Creature, or a New Nature.</hi> Christs fore-runner, <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> came preaching <hi>Repentance for the remission of sins,</hi> Luk. 3.3. And when Christ himself commissions his Apostles to publish his Gospel over all the world, their instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are to <hi>preach Repentance and remission of Sins in his Name to all Nations, beginning at Jerusalem,</hi> Luk. 24.47. And according to this order they practised. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> in his first Sermon, <hi>and be baptized for the remission of sins,</hi> Acts 2.38. And again, <hi>Repent that your sins may be blotted out,</hi> Acts 3.19. And then as for <hi>Regeneration, a New Creature, and a New Nature</hi>; they are such qualifications as fit us for Eternal Life, and without which we shall never be admitted to it. It is, says our Saviour to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> a mans <hi>being born again</hi> that must capacitate him to <hi>enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> Joh. 3.3. In <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> or the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66440:34"/>
Religion saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, neither Circumcision availeth any thing, nor Vncircumcision, but a NEW CREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TVRE,</hi> Gal. 6.15. The condition required of all men to Life and Pardon, as <hi>the truth is in Jesus, is this, that they put off the OLD MAN, and be RENEW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED in the spirit of their mind; and that they put on the NEW MAN, which after</hi> the similitude of <hi>God is Created in righteousness and true holiness,</hi> Eph. 4.21, 22, 23, 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repentance</hi> in the constant and plain notion of the Scriptures, is <hi>such a vertuous alteration of the mind and purpose, as begets a like vertuous change in the life and practice.</hi> It begins in our <hi>thoughts and resolutions,</hi> and is made perfect in our <hi>works and actions.</hi> It first casts all false principles and foolish judgments of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireableness of sin, and the dreadfulness of vertue; all opinions that hinder a good life, and encourage wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness; all inveagling thoughts and bewitching imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; all firm purposes and studied contrivances of evil <hi>out of our minds:</hi> and thereby purges all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and disobedience <hi>out of our lives and actions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It implies a change of <hi>mind,</hi> as is well noted by the Greek <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> name for <hi>Repentance,</hi> which is very expressive of its nature. For it signifies an <hi>alteration of the mind,</hi> a <hi>transformation of our thoughts and counsels</hi>; and is the same that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> calls a being <hi>renewed in the spirit of our mind,</hi> Eph. 4.23. And this God expressly calls for when he summons the wicked to <hi>repentance, Isa.</hi> 55. <hi>Let the wicked man forsake his thoughts, and turn</hi> them from his sin <hi>unto the Lord, and</hi> then <hi>he will have mercy upon him,</hi> vers. 7.</p>
               <p>It includes also an alteration of the <hi>life and practice,</hi> a <hi>forbearing to repeat the sin which we repent of.</hi> And this is a natural effect of the former, in as much as our works and actions will still go along with our studies
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:66440:34"/>
and contrivances, our purposes and resolutions. Now this part of <hi>repentance</hi> from sin, <hi>viz. a leaving</hi> or <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking</hi> of it, is its prime ingredient, and the chief thing which the Scriptures express by it; it is the <hi>main end,</hi> whereto the former serves only as the <hi>principle and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument. Godly sorrow,</hi> or the grief and trouble of our minds for having offended God, <hi>working,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> says, that <hi>Repentance</hi> which will never fail us, nor ever need to be <hi>repented of,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. And that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance includes this alteration of our lives, as well as that other of our minds, the Scriptures plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press to us, when they stile it a <hi>Repentance FROM dead works,</hi> Heb. 6.1. a <hi>TVRNING away from all trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, and doing that which is lawful and right,</hi> Ezek. 18.27, 30. <hi>A CONVERSION FROM darkness unto light,</hi> Acts 26.18. a <hi>putting AWAY the evil of our DOINGS, by ceasing to DO evil, and learning to DO well,</hi> Isa. 1.16, 17.</p>
               <p>These <hi>two</hi> changes, a change of <hi>mind</hi> and a change of <hi>practice,</hi> make up the essence, and integrate the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a saving Repentance. It implies first a change in our <hi>minds</hi> and <hi>tempers,</hi> and upon that a correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent change in our <hi>lives</hi> and <hi>actions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as for the former of these, this change of our <hi>minds</hi> and <hi>tempers</hi> in <hi>new thoughts, new counsels, new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires</hi> and <hi>resolutions:</hi> this vertuous alteration both in our <hi>wills</hi> and <hi>understandings,</hi> which are those two powers that make up our <hi>rational nature,</hi> is that which the Scriptures call our <hi>new nature</hi>; the begetting of which in us is called our <note n="b" place="margin">

                  <hi>regeneration,</hi> or our <hi>being born again.</hi> For the <hi>tempers</hi> and <hi>inclinations</hi> of our souls, are usually in our common discourse called our <hi>nature.</hi> A man of a <hi>loving condescensive disposition,</hi> is called a man of a <hi>good nature</hi>; and one of a <hi>sowr re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful temper,</hi> is called a man of an <hi>ill nature.</hi> And
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:66440:35"/>
the <hi>change</hi> from one to the other is called a <hi>change</hi> of Nature, a making of him a <hi>new Creature,</hi> and a <hi>new man.</hi> And thus we are daily wont to say of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, who from wicked and sinful inclinations is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a disposition which is vertuous and holy, that he is become a <hi>new</hi> man. And as this is our language, so is it the Scriptures too. For our putting on the <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and habitual inclinations of righteousness and true holiness,</hi> is called our putting on the <hi>new man,</hi> Eph. 4.24. The alteration from an <hi>unbelieving and uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> to a <hi>believing loving temper,</hi> to a <hi>Faith that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by love,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  <hi>John,</hi> when he tells us of all those which have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived such vertuous and holy dispositions from God, as make them resemble him and like unto him, that they are <hi>the Sons of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. and <hi>born of him,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.1, 4. In like manner as the Disciples of the Prophets among the Jews, because they received those qualifications from their institution whereby they were made like unto them, are usually in the Old Testament called <note n="c" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Now this first part of Repentance, or this <hi>inward change of mind and purpose,</hi> which is called a <hi>New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and a <hi>New nature</hi>; is a most direct cause and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Author of <hi>a like change in our outward works,</hi> and of an <hi>obedient service.</hi> For it cuts off the very root of all Transgression, and plants that of Obedience instead of it. It makes us now in obeying, to follow our own temper and inclination; and our doing of Gods will to become our desire, as well as it is our duty. So that now when we perform Gods commands, we do
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:66440:35"/>
nothing more than follow the natural tendencies of our own souls; our duty is become our choice and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and it is not without pains and difficulty that we can either omit, or transgress it. For it is an equal force and violence to a <hi>renewed</hi> and <hi>obedient nature</hi> to act sin, as it is for a <hi>wicked and debauched</hi> one to work obedience. He whose nature carries him on to <hi>love</hi> and <hi>pity,</hi> can as hardly be <hi>rigorous</hi> and <hi>cruel</hi>; as he on the contrary can abstain from <hi>cruelty,</hi> whose nature is <hi>harsh</hi> and <hi>revengeful.</hi> To act <hi>against</hi> nature any way is not without difficulty, and to <hi>follow</hi> it is always easie. And if it be changed from sin and disobedience, to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and holiness; it is then as truly a <hi>self-denial</hi> to sin and transgress, as it was before to perform and obey. Nay if this alteration gets up to a full growth, and obedience become <hi>perfectly</hi> our nature: it is then not only <hi>uneasie,</hi> but even almost <hi>impossible</hi> to sin against it. For then we shall be arrived to that pitch which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Johns</hi> words express, when he says that <hi>he who is born of God,</hi> or formed into this new nature which makes him like unto, and comes from God, <hi>CANNOT sin,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.9.</p>
               <p>So that if Obedience has got this hank of us, if by this <hi>first part of Repentance, or this new nature,</hi> it be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed in our tempers and inclinations; and become the employment of our thoughts, the desire of our hearts, and the matter of our firm purposes and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions: it cannot miss of our works and actions. It has won the principles that command them; so that nothing more is needful to be done towards their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement, but they will be sure to follow after them.</p>
               <p>Now because <hi>Repentance</hi> in its whole nature implies Obedience as its chief ingredient; and because the first part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>change of mind,</hi> which is called a <hi>new nature,</hi> or a <hi>new creature,</hi> is so natural a principle, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:66440:36"/>
so powerful a cause to work and effect it: therefore, and upon no other reason, doth God in the Scriptures so far encourage them. He means not in any wise at the last day to acquit and reward men upon such <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> and <hi>new birth</hi> as is void of <hi>obedient works and actions</hi>; but upon such only as <hi>include</hi> or <hi>effect</hi> them.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, indeed, the <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>disobedient,</hi> who will not <hi>reform</hi> and <hi>obey,</hi> but would notwithstanding have <hi>right</hi> to Life and Pardon, call something else <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> which is void of all <hi>amendment</hi> and <hi>obedience.</hi> If they <hi>confess their sin,</hi> and are <hi>sad upon it,</hi> if they <hi>wring their hands, and beat their breasts,</hi> and then, <hi>giving it hard names and reproachful titles, beg God to forgive them</hi>; they think they have done an acceptable service, and <hi>sufficiently repented</hi> of it. They take no care to <hi>keep off</hi> from it, provided they continue to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail</hi> and <hi>confess</hi> it. For although they bring in before God <hi>large Catalogues</hi> of sins, yet they never <hi>strive</hi> to <hi>lessen</hi> them. But when they profess to him how they have <hi>deserved</hi> his wrath and Eternal judgment; they want nothing but opportunity still further to <hi>provoke</hi> it. When they acknowledge how <hi>vilely</hi> they have <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted</hi> him in the breach of his Laws, they are still ready to <hi>repeat</hi> it. All the hard names which they give their sins, are false and forced expressions, they mean no hurt to them all the while. For although they <hi>revile</hi> them in their words, yet they <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>applaud</hi> them in their practice. They are still in love with them at their next meeting, and for all the ill language which they gave them when they spake of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, they will embrace them upon the first occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and repeat them upon every return of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But can any considerate man think that such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance as this shall avail him before God, and save
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:66440:36"/>
him from perishing when Christ comes to judgment? Surely he must know nothing, either of <hi>Gods nature,</hi> or of his <hi>word,</hi> who can be imposed upon so grossly. For God by the necessity of his very <hi>nature</hi> perfectly hates all sin, and so can never be reconciled to any man bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for <hi>telling</hi> him that he is a sinner. To inform him only that we have rebell'd against him, is to acquaint him that we are his enemies, whom, to vindicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and the Authority of his Government, he should destroy and ruine, not cherish and protect. The <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> declares that he will take severe and endless ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on all that dye unreformed, and finally disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient: and then to <hi>own</hi> our disobedience to his <hi>face,</hi> without a true turn and a firm purpose of reformation, is to <hi>bid</hi> him maintain his Law, and execute his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; to <hi>provoke</hi> justice, and not to <hi>appease</hi> it; to <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten</hi> and <hi>assure</hi> our misery, but by no means to <hi>prevent</hi> or <hi>retard</hi> it.</p>
               <p>But that <hi>Repentance</hi> whereupon God will Pardon us, and that <hi>Regeneration</hi> which he will eternally Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, is such only as either <hi>includes,</hi> or <hi>ends</hi> in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and reformation. When he graciously proclaims, that <hi>whosoever repenteth him of his former sins, and is born again, shall be saved</hi>; he means whosoever doth the one, and is the other, and <hi>obeys</hi> with them. His speech is <hi>metonymical,</hi> he intends obedience, and the thing implies it, although his words do not express it. For all the while it is only a <hi>repentance</hi> which is <hi>obedient,</hi> and a <hi>new Nature</hi> that is <hi>operative</hi> which in the last judgment he will eternally reward, and pronounce for ever Blessed.</p>
               <p>For of <hi>repentance</hi> he tells us plainly, how that which he means when he promises Life and Pardon to it, is such only as implies a <hi>forsaking in our works and actions</hi> those Sins which we repent of. It is a <hi>Repentance

Nothing less than a <hi>good life</hi> will be allowed, either by <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Men,</hi> for a sufficient proof of a <hi>good heart</hi>; nor any thing below a <hi>new Conversation</hi> and Obedience, will pass for a good evidence of a <hi>new Nature.

whosoever DOTH not Righteousness is not of God,</hi> vers. 10.</p>
               <p>So that when Christ comes to judge us according to his Gospel, we see plainly that no <hi>repentance</hi> will bear us out, nor any pretended <hi>regeneration</hi> or <hi>new Nature</hi> avail us unto life, but that only which either implies, or ends in our Obedience. For no man can with any show of reason hope to be acquitted and rewarded at that Bar, but he that <hi>repents unto amendment,</hi> that is <hi>Created unto good works,</hi> and <hi>is born again, to a new practice and obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>One</hi> case indeed there is, wherein a <hi>new birth</hi> will surely save a man without a <hi>new practice</hi>; and that is <hi>when a man is forthwith called away upon the change, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any opportunities of action come.</hi> Some men are listed into Gods service late, at the <hi>eleventh hour of the day,</hi> Matt. 20.6. They have just time to become obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in <hi>will</hi> and <hi>purpose,</hi> but not in <hi>life</hi> and <hi>practice</hi>; they have no leisure left them to work in, but the night comes suddenly upon them, when all the time of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is at an end. And this is the case of all dying Penitents.</p>
               <p>And here indeed the <hi>will</hi> shall be accepted for the <hi>deed.</hi> For in heart and mind such Penitents are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Gods honest servants; their desires are in great strength, and their inward purposes are come up to effectual degrees, that want nothing but time wherein to show themselves, and are sufficient, whensoever an opportunity should occur, to beget a change of life, and to make their actions answer them. So that if they are destitute of an entire obedience, and have not as yet evidenced their change of nature in their change of practice; that is not for want of <hi>inward readiness</hi> but of <hi>outward opportunities</hi>; and therefore it is not so' much their <hi>fault</hi> as their <hi>unhappiness.</hi> And when God
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:66440:38"/>
sees it is thus, he takes the inward will and choice, for the outward service and performance. He judges us by our wills, which are in our own power; and not by chance and fortune, which are utterly without it. This he doth in evil actions, as shall be shown afterwards; the will in them is taken for the deed, and if once our hearts are effectually resolved and fully set upon them, in his account we are guilty of them, though by some intervening accidents we are hindred from committing them. And since,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Bernard</hi> argues undeniably in this matter, he is much more prone to pity than he is to punish, and had far rather interpret things to our profit than to our prejudice: we may be sure that our obedient purposes shall have as much force to the full as our disobedient have, and that an effectual will in them, when nothing but time is wanting to perform in, shall pass for the deed likewise. God is by no means forward to seek our hurt, and to take advantages of our necessities; but in this, and all other cases, where there is first an <hi>effectually willing mind,</hi> and nothing but opportunity is wanting to an answerable practice, he takes, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> says, the will for the deed, and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts men according to that</hi> sufficient and effectual desire which <hi>they have; and not according to that</hi> outward performance, which through some unhappy and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting accidents, <hi>they have not,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.12.</p>
               <p>And of this we have a clear instance in one <hi>dying Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent,</hi> the <hi>Thief upon the Cross.</hi> His return was late indeed, he begun not to befit himself for the next world, till he was in his departure out of this. His conversion was in his very last hour, under the pangs of Death, and at the instant of Execution. But when Christ saw that his change of heart was <hi>true, full,</hi> and <hi>sufficient</hi>; and needed nothing but opportunity to show it self <hi>effectual</hi>; he tells him that it should serve his turn,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:66440:39"/>
and secure his happiness. Because he would have been obedient in his practice if he had lived to it, he shall be rewarded at the last day as if he had. For <hi>this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day,</hi> says he, <hi>shalt thou be with me in Paradise,</hi> Luk. 23.42.</p>
               <p>Thus available, I say, a <hi>new nature</hi> and an <hi>inward change</hi> is, although it want an outward practice, when it is <hi>sufficient</hi> and <hi>effectual</hi> to produce it, and would <hi>certainly effect it,</hi> if there were but <hi>time</hi> and <hi>opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty allow'd for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then here is the <hi>dangerous</hi> state and <hi>deplorable</hi> case of all such dying Penitents, that 'tis twenty to one, if they defer repentance to their death-bed, that all the change which then appears in them is not so <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,</hi> nor would, were there a due time allow'd for it, prove so <hi>effectual.</hi> And of this we have a clear ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, in that among all the <hi>holy vows</hi> and <hi>pious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,</hi> which are begun by men upon a <hi>sick-bed,</hi> when they are in sight of death and expect a dissolution; there are so few that continue with them, and prove <hi>effectual</hi> to make their lives and actions answer them when they <hi>recover.</hi> There is not, I believe, one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Christian in five hundred, but will show some signs of sorrow, and put up devout Prayers, and make holy vows and purposes when he apprehends himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to dye: and yet of all them who are raised up again, 'tis a very small and inconsiderable number that make good those vows, and effect what they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved upon. And now if these men had dyed when they thus repented, in what a miserable state had they been! For this change in their will and <hi>purpose</hi> is no further <hi>available</hi> to their <hi>Salvation,</hi> than it would be <hi>effectual</hi> to a like change in their <hi>lives</hi> and <hi>practice.</hi> God accepts the <hi>holiness</hi> of the <hi>mind</hi> only as it is a <hi>holy principle,</hi> and imputes the <hi>reward</hi> of <hi>obedience</hi> to it no
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66440:39"/>
farther than he foresees, that if he allow'd time, <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> would <hi>ensue</hi> upon it. The <hi>will</hi> is never taken for the <hi>deed,</hi> but when it is able to <hi>effect</hi> it, when the deed would be sure to follow so soon as an opportunity were offer'd for it. And this God sees before hand, although we do not: he is able to judge of the since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of mens desires, and of the sufficiency of their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses before their following works declare them. And according to what he foresees they would afterwards effect; he either accepts, or rejects them. But when mens after-works come as a clear evidence of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sincerity, or insufficiency of their sick-bed resolutions; they may see plainly themselves, what God saw long before, that all the change of mind, which was <hi>then</hi> wrought, was utterly insignificant and unavailing. When they trusted to it, they relyed upon a broken reed; their confidence upon it was ill grounded, and if they had dyed with it, it would most certainly have deceived them.</p>
               <p>Thus utterly uncertain and uncomfortable a thing is a mere unworking change, and a late death-bed Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. It may <hi>sometimes</hi> prove sufficient to beget an after-change of practice, and when God sees it would, he will undoubtedly accept it. But it very <hi>seldom</hi> doth, and no man who dyes in it can possibly tell whether it would or no. It is very great odds that it would prove too weak; so that although there be <hi>some,</hi> yet is there very small hope that any dying man can place in it.</p>
               <p>And that which renders it ordinarily so insufficient, and thereupon so uncertain and uncomfortable, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Because it generally proceeds from an <hi>uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, temporary principle:</hi> Or,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because, when the <hi>principle is genuine and lasting,</hi> it is still too <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>in an incompetent measure</hi> and <hi>degree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:66440:40"/>1. That penitential grief and change of mind which is wrought upon a Death-bed, is <hi>ordinarily</hi> ineffective, and insufficient to produce a <hi>constant</hi> change of life and practice, because it <hi>generally</hi> proceeds from an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant and temporary principle.</hi> It is commonly foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon a reason that doth not hold in all times, a reason that is good in sickness, but not in health; that concludes for a Pious change, whilst we are under our sick-bed sorrows; but not when, being freed from them, we come under the pleasure of temptations. For the great and general motive which makes all those, who never thought of reforming in all their lives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to resolve upon it when they are on their Death-bed; is plainly the <hi>nearness</hi> of the next world, and their apprehension of their <hi>sudden death</hi> and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Could they hope to live longer, they would sin still. But they look upon themselves as going to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and they have so much Conscience left in them, as to believe that there is a Hell for the impenitent; and their own self-love is extreamly startled at that, and makes them run to any shelter: So that they make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fearful confessions, and fervent Prayers, and Holy purposes, and say and do any thing whereby they may quiet their present fears, and catch at any comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hopes of avoiding it. The ordinary cause then of all this work, is not any <hi>love</hi> of God, or <hi>hatred</hi> of Sin; but only a <hi>fear</hi> of Punishment. And that too not a <hi>fear</hi> of it at a <hi>distance,</hi> and as at some removes from them; but only as <hi>near</hi> at hand, and just hanging over them. But now as for this apparant <hi>nearness</hi> of Death, and this <hi>confounding</hi> fear upon it; it is plainly a <hi>short</hi> and <hi>transient,</hi> an <hi>unconstant, temporary</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. It is a reason to them no longer than they are <hi>sick</hi>; for when they <hi>recover</hi> and are well again, Death is as <hi>far</hi> off, and they are become again as fearless as
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:66440:40"/>
ever. They are got out of its neighbourhood, and it gives them no further trouble: So that all their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer fears abate, and their vertuous resolutions fall, as beginning now to want that which first gave life to them, and should support them. And now when op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of Sin are offered, and the pleasurable baits of Temptations invite; they have nothing left that is able to resist them. Whilst they were <hi>sick,</hi> they were not <hi>capable</hi> to be tempted; and then Death being <hi>near,</hi> it enabled them to purpose well, and to make a pious resolution. But now, since they are <hi>well,</hi> Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are become as strong as ever; and the thoughts of Death being <hi>far</hi> removed, they have no resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that can withstand them, but are quickly changed again into the same men, as <hi>sensual</hi> and <hi>sinful</hi> as they were before.</p>
               <p>Indeed it sometimes happens, that those souls which were at first awakened by such a <hi>transient, temporary</hi> motive; go on to others afterwards, that are more <hi>fixt</hi> and <hi>lasting:</hi> and then they are furnished with Armour in all times, and have a motive that may bear them out when Death is <hi>far</hi> off, as well as when 'tis near at hand; in time of health, as well as in time of sickness. For they who were at first affrighted into a change of mind and holy purposes, by the near approach of Death and Judgment, go on sometimes to confirm their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions upon more lasting principles. They think themselves into a deep sense <hi>of that ingratitude towards God which is in Sin, and of its mischievousness to their own selves; how it robs them of all that Eternal Good which their hearts desire, and brings them under all those insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and endless evils which they fear: all which it doth for the purchase of some light, empty, and transient Pleasures, which are vastly below the joys of Heaven; and for the avoidance of some short pain and uneasiness, which are
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:66440:41"/>
infinitely nothing in comparison of the Pains of Hell.</hi> And these thoughts give them a firm and lasting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the utter necessity of renouncing all evil courses, which are so destructive; and of leading a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and obedient life, which are so infinitely becoming them, and beneficial to them. And this conviction now can <hi>beget</hi> and <hi>preserve</hi> a resolution that is sufficient and effectual, victorious and prevailing. It will be a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to them to resolve and practise at all times, in sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and in health; when they are not tempted, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so when they are. For Heaven and the Love of God is always a necessary end, and Obedience is always a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary means or instrument. So that if Men resolve upon a conviction of this necessity, they resolve upon a reason that may well hold always. They will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly have the highest reason to be so convinced; and still to repeat and fortifie their resolution upon such conviction; and to act and practise that which they have so wisely resolved. And when a Sick-mans change is built upon this ground, and proceeds upon this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; it may be permanent and fixt, effectual and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing. As it is in all those who are Converted by Sickness and Afflictions, that <hi>great,</hi> and usually <hi>last</hi> means which God makes use of for the reclaiming of sinful Men.</p>
               <p>But generally Mens sick-bed purposes go no further than the <hi>first</hi> ground. They <hi>always</hi> begin upon the fears of present Death, and the near approach of Judgment; and though <hi>sometimes</hi> they go higher still, yet <hi>ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> they rest there; so that they have no change longer than their sickness lasts. And this <hi>Repentance</hi> is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>insufficient</hi>; this <hi>will</hi> can never be accepted for the <hi>deed</hi>; because if they were allow'd to recover again, and to live on till an opportunity of Doing came, the good will and purpose would be quite lost, and able to effect nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:66440:41"/>But although a Death-bed change should proceed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both these grounds, and the dying men should resolve to amend, both <hi>upon the sense of sudden Death,</hi> which will maintain their resolution so long as it is near, and also <hi>upon a conviction of the absolute necessity of Heaven and a Holy Life,</hi> which may make them resolve still when the present danger is over: yet may their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance after all be insufficient and avail nothing. For a Death-bed Repentance when it doth proceed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>genuine and lasting</hi> motive, is still oft times inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, because the <hi>change</hi> is,</p>
               <p n="2">2. In too <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>incompetent a measure and degree.</hi> It is not every degree even of <hi>true</hi> and <hi>undissembled</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution that will overcome a mans Lusts, and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him to such a pitch as to make him prevail over all Temptations. A thousand good resolutions go to Hell, because although they are <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>true,</hi> yet they are <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>ineffectual.</hi> For how many men are there who resolve against their sins, who do not yet get quit of them? They purpose to leave them; but for all that they live still in them: their mind and will is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them; but yet they continue to work and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise them. When once men have got <hi>violent lusts,</hi> and <hi>vicious habits,</hi> and Sin by a <hi>long use</hi> is become al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most a <hi>second nature</hi> to them: it is not every <hi>measure,</hi> no nor every <hi>moderate degree</hi> of resolution that can morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and overcome them. For a <hi>weak</hi> resolution is quickly overthrown, mens Lusts are too hard for it, and quite overbear it: it may make some resistance, create some trouble, and cause some delay; but that is all that it can do: it can only contend and struggle, but it is not able to overcome. This is plain from every Religious Mans experience; and this S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> sets down expressly in his character of the <hi>unregenerate striver</hi> in the <hi>seventh</hi> Chapter of the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Romans.</hi> For there was
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:66440:42"/>
a real change in his <hi>mind,</hi> without a change in his <hi>practice</hi>; a <hi>resolution</hi> without <hi>effect</hi>; and a <hi>will</hi> without <hi>performance:</hi> the <hi>violence of his Lusts</hi> was too hard for the <hi>convictions of his Conscience,</hi> and led him Captive, even against his <hi>will,</hi> into a course of Sin and disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. <hi>With the MIND,</hi> says he, <hi>I serve the Law of God, but with the FLESH the Law of Sin,</hi> v. 25. <hi>What I DO, I ALLOW not; for what I WOVLD that I DO not; but what I HATE, that I DO,</hi> v. 15, 19. <hi>To WILL is present with me, but how to PERFORM that which is good I find not,</hi> v. 18. <hi>For the Law of my MEMBERS wars against the Law of my MIND, and brings me into CAPTIVITY to the Law of Sin,</hi> v. 23.</p>
               <p>Thus weak and unable, ineffective and idle, are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny true and real resolutions. They have not strength enough to do their work; the opposition is greater than they can overcome; so that they are able to make no alteration, but for all this <hi>change of mind,</hi> men will continue <hi>wicked</hi> and disobedient in their <hi>practice</hi> still.</p>
               <p>And of this sort <hi>generally,</hi> even when they proceed upon a <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>lasting</hi> motive, are the Penitential purposes of Dying-men. For, alas! when Men have lived all their Lives in a course of Sin, and their minds have been always taken up with it, and their hearts wholly inslaved to it: it is no easie matter to bring them off, and to fill them with such firmness of purpose, and strength of pious resolution as would be able ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to mortifie and subdue it. This is a most laborious work, and a difficult undertaking. It requires much <hi>time,</hi> and the <hi>freedom</hi> of all our faculties. For how hard a thing is it, even for men in <hi>health,</hi> when their <hi>thoughts are free, distracted by no business, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by no pain, and disturbed by no disease or other hindrance,</hi> to work themselves up to an effectual and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:66440:42"/>
prevailing resolution against <hi>any one</hi> Sin which they have been habitually inured, and for a long time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaved to? And even of them who do at last <hi>effectually</hi> resolve against it, how few are there who came to such a pitch of resolution at the <hi>first tryal?</hi> No, their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding is <hi>gradual,</hi> they go on from step to step; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry following resolution is more firm, and stronger than that which went before; till after several repetitions and advances, they arrive at last to a degree and pitch of holy purpose so <hi>compleat</hi> as can <hi>effect</hi> that vertuous change of <hi>life</hi> and action which they aim at. So that their <hi>spiritual</hi> Life is not brought on to perfection in a moment, more than their <hi>natural</hi>; but requires much <hi>time,</hi> and much <hi>exercise</hi>: for as their sinful habits were not at first <hi>acquired,</hi> so neither are they to be <hi>conquered</hi> by <hi>one</hi> action, but by <hi>many.</hi> And since the process in Repentance, even from <hi>one single</hi> Sin, is so <hi>long</hi> and tedious ere it has arrived to a <hi>saving</hi> pitch, and so difficult to a <hi>healthy</hi> man, who has nothing to <hi>trouble</hi> and <hi>distract</hi> him: what must an <hi>universal reformation</hi> be to a <hi>dying</hi> person, whose time is <hi>short,</hi> and much <hi>disturbed</hi>; who cannot repeat <hi>many</hi> resolutions, nor make a tryal of the force and power of <hi>any one,</hi> and who is most likely to be <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>languid</hi> in all those good purposes which he makes, by reason that his <hi>thoughts are heavy, and his attention broken, and all his faculties are oppressed with pain, and become weary and unactive through a wasting Disease?</hi> Surely if the <hi>first resolutions</hi> of <hi>healthy Men</hi> are <hi>generally</hi> so ineffective and insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; these purposes of <hi>dying Penitents,</hi> which in all <hi>advantages</hi> for a <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>prevailing</hi> resolution fall much <hi>below</hi> them, must needs be generally of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effective sort too.</p>
               <p>And when they are so, they stand us in no stead in Gods account, but are <hi>utterly unavailable</hi> to any mans
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:66440:43"/>
                  <hi>Salvation.</hi> A man who only <hi>purposeth,</hi> but doth not <hi>practise</hi>; who barely <hi>wills,</hi> but is not able to perform; is in the <hi>way to life</hi> indeed, but he is far from having yet <hi>attained</hi> to it. He is still in a sad case, and under a <hi>damning</hi> Sentence. For he is, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> says in that <hi>seventh</hi> Chapter to the <hi>Romans</hi> where he describes him, <hi>slain by Sin,</hi> vers. 11. It <hi>works death in him,</hi> vers. 13. he is yet under, as the <hi>Law of Sin,</hi> so <hi>the body of Death</hi> too, vers. 24. But the change of <hi>mind</hi> which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us, is such as works a change of <hi>practice.</hi> If he sees it <hi>sufficient</hi> to effect that, he accepts it indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the effect follows: he takes the <hi>will</hi> for the <hi>deed,</hi> when he sees the will is so strong as that upon any fit occasion it would produce it; and upon this account he accepted the <hi>dying Thief,</hi> Luk. 23.42. But if it be only an <hi>impotent</hi> and <hi>ineffective</hi> will, and he discerns plainly that no obedient works would <hi>follow</hi> it: it is no such <hi>will</hi> as he rewards, and for such Penitents, he will by <hi>no means</hi> absolve, but utterly condemn them.</p>
               <p>And since the change of mind and penitential pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses of <hi>dying</hi> persons, even when they are upon <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine</hi> and <hi>lasting</hi> grounds, so as in the following parts of a mans life, if God should please to spare him, they would do <hi>something</hi>; would yet be <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi> and so unable to do <hi>enough</hi>: here is still a further reason of the <hi>ordinary</hi> insufficiency of such Repentance, and why those <hi>dying</hi> men will not <hi>ordinarily</hi> be saved by it, but perish notwithstanding it.</p>
               <p>To conclude this point then, we see that 'tis <hi>possible</hi> for such <hi>New-birth</hi> to save a Man, as has not yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a <hi>New practice</hi>; and for dying Penitents to be accepted upon a <hi>change of mind,</hi> without a like <hi>change of life and actions.</hi> This I say is <hi>possible,</hi> it <hi>sometimes</hi> is, and sometimes has been done: but this indeed is very <hi>rare</hi> and very <hi>seldom,</hi> so that no Man in his sober

                  <p>Of Pardon promised to Confession of Sins. The nature and qualifications of a Saving Confession. Its fitness to make us forsake Sin. The ineffectiveness of most mens Confessions. The folly and impiety of it. Pardon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to Confession no further than it produces Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Of Pardon promised to Conversion. The nature of Conversion. It includes Obedience, and is but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name for it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>FOurthly,</hi> That condition of Life and Pardon which the Gospel indispensably exacts of us, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon at the last day Christ will accept and reward us, is sometimes called <hi>Confession</hi> of our Sins to God. When we acknowledge them, God will be sure to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them; he has engaged his word and faithfulness
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:66440:44"/>
for it, and so cannot recede from it: <hi>If we</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Levit. 26.40.42.</note> 
                  <hi>confess our Sins,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John, God is just and FAITHFVL to forgive us our Sins,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.9.</p>
               <p>Now as for this <hi>Confession</hi> of our Sins, whereupon God promises mercifully to forgive them, it is not a bare <hi>naming</hi> of them, or giving in an <hi>Historical Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> of them to Almighty God, that he may <hi>know</hi> them and be informed of them. No, he sees all our thoughts afar off, and our actions long before. We cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him when we lay open our transgressions before him; for we could never find any place wherein to act them so retired, but it was under his eye; nor any time and circumstances so secret, as to escape his knowledge. So that our Confession cannot be to <hi>instruct him</hi>; but only to <hi>shame,</hi> and to <hi>humble,</hi> and to work other effects in our <hi>own selves.</hi> And therefore it must not be a bare <hi>recital</hi> of such offences as we have committed; but an acknowledgment <hi>duly qualified,</hi> and accompanied with such <hi>tempers</hi> of mind, as will lead us on to <hi>forsake</hi> and <hi>amend</hi> them.</p>
               <p>It is a Confessing of them with <hi>shame,</hi> with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble debasement, and sense of our unworthiness, who could ever be so vile as to be guilty of them. And such was <hi>Ezra</hi>'s Confession, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. <hi>O my God,</hi> saith he, <hi>I am ASHAMED and blush to lift up my face to thee my God, for our iniquities are encreased over our head, and our trespasses are grown up unto the Heavens,</hi> vers. 6.</p>
               <p>It is an acknowledgment of them with <hi>hatred</hi> and <hi>detestation,</hi> as things that are utterly <hi>odious</hi> and <hi>loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some</hi> to us, which therefore we are prone to <hi>fly from,</hi> as from what is most <hi>offensive.</hi> And such is that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession whereunto God directs the <hi>Jews</hi> by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ezekiel, Ye shall remember your ways,</hi> saith he, <hi>and all your doings wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall LOATH your selves in your own sight for all
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:66440:44"/>
your evils that you have committed,</hi> Ezekiel 20.43.</p>
               <p>It is a recital of them with <hi>sorrow</hi> of mind, and a <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled heart</hi>; with such <hi>pain</hi> as we use to feel in those things which most <hi>afflict</hi> us: which therefore we are forward <hi>to avoid,</hi> as what creates the greatest <hi>torment.</hi> And such was that of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> who when he <hi>remembred,</hi> and made mention of his Sin to God, <hi>wept,</hi> saith the Text, <hi>bitterly,</hi> Matt. 26.75. And of <hi>David,</hi> who tells us in the 38. <hi>Psalm,</hi> that when he <hi>declares</hi> to God <hi>his iniquity,</hi> he will <hi>be SORRY</hi> for his Sin, <hi>vers.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>It is a Confession of them, with a <hi>resolution,</hi> upon all this shame and sorrow which we have undergone for them, never more to be reconciled to them, or to act them over again and <hi>repeat</hi> them. A Confession of the <hi>mouth,</hi> that is accompanied with a <hi>turn</hi> and change of the <hi>heart,</hi> which is now set as much against them, as formerly it was inclined to them. And such was that Confession which Wise <hi>Solomon</hi> durst recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to Gods mercy, and beg him to accept of for mens Pardon and Forgiveness. <hi>If they Repent,</hi> saith he, <hi>and say we have done perversly, we have committed wickedness: and so RETVRN unto thee with all their hearts, and all their soul: then hear their prayer, and forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed,</hi> 1 Kings 8.47, 48, 49, 50.</p>
               <p>It is such an acknowledgment of our Sins, lastly, as <hi>undoes,</hi> so far as is possible, all that which we had <hi>done wickedly</hi>; and makes all just and sufficient recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>satisfaction</hi> for them. And this is that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of all Sins of injustice, which God himself prescribes. <hi>When a Man or Woman,</hi> saith he, <hi>shall commit any sin</hi> of injury and wrong, <hi>that men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> one against another, <hi>to do a trespass</hi> thereby <hi>against the Lord, and that person be guilty: then shall they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:66440:45"/>
their Sin that they have done, and shall RECOM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PENCE their Trespass with the principle thereof,</hi> or the thing it self which they took away wrongfully, <hi>and shall add</hi> moreover <hi>unto it a fifth part</hi> more <hi>thereof, and give it unto him against whom they trespassed,</hi> Numb. 5.6, 7.</p>
               <p>Now a Confession of our Sins thus <hi>qualified, viz.</hi> a Confession of them <hi>with blushing and being ashamed of them; with an implacable hatred and loathing indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of them, with bitter sorrow for them; with firm purpose and resolution against them, and with all possible en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to undo them by making just recompence and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction:</hi> A Confession, I say, thus attended is a most natural cause, and powerful principle of our <hi>leaving</hi> and <hi>forsaking</hi> them. The <hi>four</hi> first concomitant tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, are all most <hi>effectual causes</hi> of better obedience and reformation; and the <hi>last, viz. making of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi> is an <hi>instance</hi> and <hi>effect</hi> of it. <hi>Shame,</hi> and <hi>sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> and <hi>hatred</hi> are the great rules and measures of what we shall <hi>forsake,</hi> the prime springs and directors of all <hi>aversation</hi> and <hi>avoidance.</hi> Nothing is more natural for us, than to be slow to do that we are ashamed of; to avoid what we hate; to turn away from that which grieves and torments us. So that if once disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence fall under these passions, it has lost all its inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and will surely be excluded from the service of our works and actions. Our passions oppose it, and our wills are set against it: and when both these are not only got loose from it, but also most resolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with it; it is wholly bereft of all its power, and can do nothing in us. We have no temptation to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue it further; we are weary of it, and offended at it, and so are sure to leave and forsake it.</p>
               <p>And because this Confession, thus qualified and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as we have seen, is so genuine a cause of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:66440:45"/>
obedience and reformation: therefore alone it is that so great things are spoken of it. When God says <hi>he that confesses his sin shall find mercy,</hi> he means <hi>he that confesses and forsakes it,</hi> that acknowledges his offences in such sort, as to renounce them and become obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. His speech is <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tonymical,</hi> he implies Obedience, although he doth not mention it. For no Confession of sin will serve any mans turn at the last day, except he leave it, and in his life and actions bid adieu to it.</p>
               <p>The world indeed, abounds with another sort of Confession, which costs less, and effects nothing. They confess their sins without <hi>shame,</hi> and relate them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>sorrow,</hi> and name them without <hi>hatred</hi>; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them to God without <hi>resolving</hi> against them, and acknowledge them daily without any <hi>amends,</hi> or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any recompence and <hi>satisfaction</hi> for them. For they cannot but be hardned against <hi>shame,</hi> who day by day, if not several times every day, have the face to tell God that they have rebell'd against him; and yet never endeavour to come with another story by disavowing and forsaking their Rebellion. They must needs be void of <hi>sorrow</hi> for sin, who will never keep back from it: it cannot but <hi>please</hi> them, so long as they continue to pursue it. For they would not continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repeat their pain, and at every turn act over again their own torment and vexation. It is beyond all doubt that they do not <hi>hate</hi> but entirely <hi>love</hi> diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, so long as they slip no opportunities of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. They are plainly <hi>resolved</hi> upon it, whilst they are most firmly fixt, and forward to embrace it. And since notwithstanding all their hideous Confessions, they stand ready still to close with their Sin upon the first meeting, and to repeat what they confessed upon the next occasion; it is plain that their <hi>hearts</hi> were never against it, whatever their words were. They
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:66440:46"/>
only shewed their wit, but not their passions or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion; they declaimed against it, but all the while they meant no hurt to it. For even whilst they inveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against the <hi>baseness,</hi> the <hi>loathsomness,</hi> the <hi>destructive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of their Sin; their own heart did not believe it.

               <p>But can any man be so blind as to think, that such a <hi>Confession</hi> of Sins as this can in <hi>any wise</hi> please God, and procure his Pardon? Has he any kindness for our Sins, that he should take delight to hear them spoken of? Are they so acceptable a service, that we may hope to gain his favour barely by reciting them in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence? No, he hates them as things that are most loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to him, and will not endure to have them men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned without real detestation. Is any man so weak as to think that he <hi>honours</hi> God, merely by <hi>reckoning</hi> up his own offences? That he gives <hi>glory</hi> unto him by declaring to his face how vilely he has affronted and despised him? To Confess <hi>thus,</hi> is to <note n="b" place="margin">

It is a telling of him that we have disobeyed, and are resolved to go on in it: an open profession and avowing of our Rebellion, without any real signs or approach to amendment and due subjection. It is a transgressing bare-faced, an addition of <hi>impudence</hi> to <hi>sin</hi>; a continuing daily to Rebel against him, and yet coming as daily into his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry presence to declare and own our continued Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions. And this now is not to supplicate, but to defie; not to beg peace, but to declare enmity; it is by no means the way to soften and appease, but a most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual course to exasperate, and implacably to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:66440:46"/>But then to go on still further, and to <hi>pretend</hi> to him that we are <hi>sorry</hi> at our heart, and <hi>loath</hi> our selves for having sinned against him, and are <hi>resolved</hi> to do so no more; when <hi>really,</hi> as our after-actions (which are the truest interpreters of our hearts and minds) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, there is no such thing: this is to add <hi>mockery</hi> to <hi>sin,</hi> and a <hi>fresh affront</hi> to our <hi>former disobedience.</hi> It is most grossly to play the <hi>hypocrite,</hi> and in the most fulsome fashion to <hi>dissemble</hi> with him. It is an endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to put <hi>tricks</hi> upon the Almighty; a tryal of his <hi>skill</hi>; a seeking to delude and impose upon an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely wise</hi> and <hi>all-seeing God,</hi> by such <hi>thin pretences</hi> as cannot but be seen through and discovered by any <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Man.</hi> But let no Man vainly deceive himself, for God is not mocked; nor can all the arts of Earth and Hell out-wit and go beyond him. No, he sees clearly through all this hypocrisie, and he will most severely punish it. And when he comes to judge of mens Confessions at the last day, he will then, in the face of all the world, distinguish <hi>reality</hi> from <hi>comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; an <hi>acknowledgment of Repentance,</hi> from one of <hi>form and custom</hi>; and will for ever reward the <hi>first,</hi> whilst he punishes Eternally the latter. He will Pardon no Confession of our Sins at that day, but only such as is <hi>sorrowful, penitent,</hi> and <hi>obedient</hi>; we must amend those faults that we confess, before we can with reason hope that he will accept us.</p>
               <p>And for this the Scripture is clear. It is only our <hi>returning</hi> upon Confession that shall be rewarded and forgiven. <hi>If they Repent,</hi> says <hi>Solomon, and SAY, we have done perversly, we have committed wickedness; and so RETVRN unto the Lord with all their heart and all their soul: Then HEAR their Prayer, and forgive thy people that have sinned against thee,</hi> 1 King 8.47, 48, 49, 50. And to name but one place more, these
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:66440:47"/>
words of <hi>Solomon</hi> are full and home to the purpose, <hi>He who Confesses, and FORSAKES his Sin shall find mercy,</hi> Prov. 28.13.</p>
               <p>That Confession of our Sins then whereupon Christ our Judge will at the last day accept and Pardon us, is such only as ends in Reformation and Obedience. The service of our lives must go along with that of our lips; we must do as we say, and avoid what we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, before we can safely trust, that God will Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence us to that Mercy and Life, which are not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of <hi>idle</hi> acknowledgments, but only of a confess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> This Gospel condition of Life and Pardon is sometimes call'd <hi>Conversion.</hi> Without this we can have no hopes of happiness; <hi>For except ye be CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERTED,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>and become as little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> as void as they are of all former impressions and courses, and free to enter upon new ones, <hi>ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Matt. 18.3. But if our Conversion goes before, Gods Pardon is sure to follow after; that being the duty, and this the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. <hi>Repent, and be CONVERTED,</hi> says the Apostle <hi>Peter, that your Sins may be blotted out,</hi> Act. 3.19. Conversion sets us without the reach of Death, and beyond the precincts of Damnation; for <hi>he who Converts a Sinner from the error of his way, doth save a Soul from DEATH,</hi> Jam. 5.20.</p>
               <p>Now our <hi>Conversion from Sin to God,</hi> is nothing else but our <hi>Obedience</hi> in another word. For it denotes a <hi>turn</hi> and a change, not only of our <hi>wills</hi> and <hi>desires</hi>; but withal, and that principally, of our <hi>works</hi> and <hi>actions.</hi> For our <hi>course of actions</hi> is in the familiar, and customary use of the Scriptures call'd our <hi>way</hi>; our <hi>Conversation, walking</hi>; and our <hi>particular actions,</hi> so many <hi>several</hi> steps: and our <hi>turning out</hi> of a course of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:66440:47"/>
Sin and Transgression, <hi>into a course</hi> of Righteousness and Obedience, being like the turning out of a wrong way into a right, is call'd our <hi>turning from</hi> Sin, and our <hi>turning to</hi> God, <hi>i. e.</hi> in one word our <hi>Conversion.</hi> So that to be <hi>Converted,</hi> is nothing else in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture language but to have the <hi>course</hi> of our works or actions turned, and from <hi>workers</hi> of sin, to become <hi>workers</hi> of obedience.</p>
               <p>When Mercy and Life then are promised to our Conversion; they are not made over to any thing which is separate from Obedience, but to that only which denotes it, and is but another name for it. We are not <hi>Converted</hi> until we <hi>obey</hi>; so that Obedience still is that which must procure our peace, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate us for Pardon and happiness when Christ comes to judge us.</p>

                  <p> Of Pardon promised to Prayer. Of the influence which our Prayers have upon our Obedience. Of the presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption or idleness of most mens Prayers. Of the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, hypocrisie, and uselessness of such Petitions. Then our Prayers are heard, when they are according to Gods will: when we pray for Pardon in Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and for strength and assistance in the use of our own endeavours. Pardon promised to Prayer no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than it effects this Obedience, and penitential en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>SIxthly,</hi> That condition whereto the Gospel promises a gracious sentence of Mercy and Life, is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times call'd <hi>Prayer,</hi> or <hi>calling upon God. The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him,</hi> says <hi>David, to all that call upon him in truth,</hi> Psal. 145.18. <hi>Thou Lord art good and ready to forgive, and plenteous in mercy to all that call upon thee,</hi> Psal. 86.5. For so surpassing is his goodness and the riches of his grace, that any thing may be had of him for <hi>asking</hi>; to them who <hi>desire</hi> it, he can <hi>deny</hi> nothing. <hi>Ask, and it shall be given you,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>for EVERY one that asketh receiveth,</hi> Matt. 7.7, 8. And that in <hi>all</hi> things equally, one as well as another, if they do not distrust him and <hi>disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> his Love. <hi>For ALL things, WHATSOEVER you shall ask in Prayer BELIEVING, you shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:66440:48"/>
Matt. 21.22. So that if men want any thing which they desire that God would bestow upon them, it is because they do not <hi>beg</hi> it of him. <hi>Ye have not,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>James, because ye ask not,</hi> Jam. 4.2. For not only the <hi>overflowing goodness of Gods own nature,</hi> but, besides that, the <hi>interest of his Son Jesus Christ</hi> our <hi>ME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIATOR</hi> at his right hand, gives us a full security in all our requests, that we shall obtain any thing which we ask in his name. <hi>Ask any thing,</hi> says he, <hi>in my name, and I will do it,</hi> Joh. 14.14. Nay so dear is he to Almighty God, that although he himself should not move in it, yet through the strength of Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible love to him, they who beg in his name can miss of nothing. <hi>In that day,</hi> says he, after I am taken from you, <hi>you shall ask ME nothing: Verily, verily, I say unto you, whatsoever you shall ask the FATHER in MY NAME, he will give it you. And I say not that I will PRAY the Father for you, for the Father him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self loveth you, BECAVSE ye have loved me,</hi> Joh. 16.23, 26, 27. And <hi>seeing,</hi> as the Apostle says, <hi>that we have so great</hi> and powerful a <hi>High Priest at Gods right hand,</hi> whether our suit be for pardon, or strength, or for whatsoever else; <hi>Let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain Mercy</hi> for pardon of past sins, <hi>and find grace to</hi> prevent future, and to <hi>help in time of need,</hi> or in the most <note n="a" place="margin">

               <p>Now our <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>calling upon God,</hi> are a mighty <hi>means</hi> and <hi>instrument</hi> of our <hi>serving</hi> and <hi>obeying him.</hi> And as all the forementioned means had a <hi>natural</hi> fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and tendency, to make us <hi>do</hi> the will of God: so have our <hi>Prayers</hi> a <hi>supernatural,</hi> and help us to <hi>fulfill</hi> the Divine Laws, not so much through any efficacy of their <hi>own nature,</hi> as through the aids of <hi>divine grace.</hi> For we have great difficulties to conflict with, and great hindrances to overcome in the <hi>doing</hi> of our duty. There
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:66440:49"/>
is much hardship in a holy course to make us <hi>unwilling</hi>; and if we have a will to it, we yet find much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in our selves that renders us <hi>unable</hi> to continue in good living, and to perform constantly all those good things which God has commanded us. For we have much ignorance of what we should <hi>do,</hi> and much other business besides it: and as for that moreover which we do know, we are apt many times to forget it; or through the throng of other things, through sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and surprize, not to consider of it when we should use it; or when in our minds we do clearly see it, yet full often we cannot bring over our wills to choose and embrace it. For our lusts and passions prove many times of more force with our wills, than our reason and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and we are either born down by the weight and strength, or wearied with the tediousness and length of a temptation.</p>
               <p>And now to supply all these defects, and to support us in the doing of our duty notwithstanding all these infirmities, we have an absolute necessity of the help and assistance of Gods grace. We want the <hi>good time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of his <hi>providence,</hi> to have temptations assault us when we are best able to overcome them, and our duties stay for us when we may most easily perform them. We stand in need of the <hi>suggestions of his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> to cure our forgetfulness; of the <hi>aids of his grace</hi> to enlighten our minds, and clear up our notions, and bend our wills, and establish our resolutions; and so to make us <hi>unmoveable</hi> in a good course. So that we have an utter necessity of his help, both in the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals of his <hi>providence,</hi> and in the concurrence of his <hi>spirit,</hi> to enable us to obey his Laws, and make us, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>both to will, and to do what he requires of us,</hi> Phil. 2.13.</p>
               <p>But now it is our Prayers which bring all these <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:66440:49"/>
aids</hi> down unto us. They obtain for us a <hi>good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> and a <hi>powerful spirit,</hi> which in spite of all our natural weaknesses shall work out our Obedience. God will not deny us these when we ask them. For, as our Saviour argues unanswerably, <hi>If ye being EVIL will</hi> yet <hi>give GOOD gifts to your Children: how much more shall your heavenly Father,</hi> whose <hi>GOODNESS</hi> infinitely exceeds yours, and who cannot be tainted with any of your <hi>ILLNESS, give the HOLY SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT,</hi> that best of gifts, <hi>to them that ask him,</hi> Luk. 11.13. And since our Prayers procure such a never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aid, and so Almighty an assistance for us; they must needs be a certain cause and instrument of our active service and obedience. They imply <hi>in us</hi> an hearty desire of having, and fetch down <hi>to us</hi> a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent power of doing our duty, and keeping Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. And when there is both a preparedness in us to use, and a readiness in God to give us grace sufficient with it to do his will, there is nothing further wanting to our performance of it.</p>
               <p>And forasmuch as our Prayers imply the one, and procure the other; because they fetch down Divine aids, and express our forwardness to obey with them: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have they so much favour shown them, and Life and Pardon promised to them. For God never intends to reward an <hi>idle</hi> and <hi>unobeying</hi> Prayer, but such only as is <hi>industrious</hi> and <hi>obedient.</hi> Our Prayers must first make us do what he <hi>commands,</hi> before they obtain those mercies for us which he <hi>promises.</hi> For when he tells us that they who <hi>call upon him shall find favour and mercy,</hi> he speaks <hi>metonymically,</hi> he includes obedience, although he doth not express it. He means them only who <hi>pray for</hi>

who <hi>ask for grace and strength,</hi> and <hi>work</hi> with it after it is granted. No prayers are of any account with him but the prayers of the obedient; so that if ever we expect to be saved by them at the last day, we must obey with them.</p>
               <p>The Prayers indeed which are generally offered up to God, have little of this in them. For if men pray for <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>pardon,</hi> they take no care to come fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> which is that indispensable condition whereupon the Gospel doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us to ask and hope for Pardon. And if they pray for any <hi>vertue</hi> or <hi>grace,</hi> they expect it should drop into them without any <hi>endeavours</hi> of their own, and will take no pains to <hi>cooperate</hi> with and <hi>use</hi> it. Their prayers for <hi>Mercy</hi> are generally <hi>presumptuous,</hi> and their prayers for <hi>Grace unendeavouring</hi> and <hi>idle.</hi> Obedience all the while is the least in all their thoughts and has the least of all their care. For their petitions are all put up for <hi>pardon</hi> whilst they <hi>continue</hi> in their <hi>sins</hi>; or for <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> whilst they <hi>put</hi> forth no endeavours. All their Religion is only to be often upon their knees, to keep up Prayers in their Families morning and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening; to send up a great many <hi>Lord forgive me's, Christ help me's</hi>; they are a <hi>praying</hi> and <hi>desiring,</hi> but not a <hi>working</hi> and <hi>obeying</hi> people. They are of a sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did niggardly Religion, which would receive all, and give nothing: their petitions look altogether on the <hi>reward,</hi> but quite overlook the <hi>duty</hi>; they would take all from God, but do nothing for him.</p>
               <p>But this is such a way of praying as will most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delude men, but can never do them good. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate hope and downright folly to expect that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver God should hear our prayers for Pardon, whilst we continue in our sins. For since he has so <hi>frequently,</hi> so <hi>plainly,</hi> and so <hi>peremptorily</hi> declared, That at the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:66440:50"/>
last day he will Pardon none but the <hi>penitent</hi> and <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient:</hi> it is <hi>impudent incredulity</hi> to beg pardon, whilst, without any amends, we <hi>continue</hi> to <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>disobey.</hi> It is to desire of him that he would <hi>break his word,</hi> that he would Pardon and <hi>acquit</hi> us when his Gospel <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns</hi> us. It is to beg of him that he would frame <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Religion, and <hi>another</hi> Law than that of his Son Jesus; a Religion that would <hi>save</hi> us, when that <hi>kills</hi> and destroys us. By such asking forgiveness from him, whilst we go on in <hi>rebelling</hi> against him, we do as good as desire that he would cease to be <hi>governour</hi> of the world, and <hi>leave</hi> us to our own selves; that we might have no <hi>law</hi> but our own <hi>wills</hi>; that we might <hi>do</hi> what he <hi>forbids,</hi> without <hi>undergoing</hi> what he <hi>threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens.</hi> We only ask <hi>leave</hi> to sin; and crave a <hi>liberty to transgress,</hi> without <hi>suffering</hi>; and desire that <hi>we</hi> might <hi>break</hi> his Laws, but that <hi>he</hi> would not <hi>punish</hi> us. And what man now <hi>dare</hi> presume, that such <hi>shameless</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires as these should be granted to him? That God should <hi>desert</hi> his <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>alter</hi> his <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>cast</hi> off his <hi>government</hi> over men when they <hi>request</hi> it? For in <hi>very deed</hi> we see, that <hi>to desire him to forgive us, whilst we are going on in our sins,</hi> is in effect to put up all these frontless, and abominably impudent petitions to him.</p>
               <p>And then as for the other sort of petitions, our <hi>ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for any vertue or grace, without putting forth any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours after it,</hi> it is as certain to meet with no good answer as the other. For to pray thus is plainly to play the <hi>hypocrite</hi> with God Almighty, and flatly to <hi>dissemble</hi> with him. It is to <hi>beg</hi> what we do not <hi>care for</hi>; to <hi>ask</hi> what we <hi>refuse</hi>; to <hi>pretend desire</hi> (for all praying is desiring) for that which we account is <hi>worth no endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi> And what a miserable piece of falshood is this now, when a man makes his actions most palpably to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:66440:51"/>
give the lye to his words? He tells God that he <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly desires</hi> his help to work in him a <hi>pure heart</hi>; but yet he will <hi>do nothing</hi> for it, nor avoid the least occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>uncleanness.</hi> He <hi>begs</hi> his grace to assist him to a <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>patient spirit:</hi> but when he is off his knees his work is done, for he never after <hi>uses</hi> any <hi>means to procure it,</hi> or takes any care to <hi>nourish</hi> and <hi>preserve</hi> those degrees of it which he hath already. Surely any man of common understanding must needs see, that such desires as these were never in his heart, but only from the teeth forward. In reality he cares not what becomes of the graces which he has prayed for, and was no farther concerned about them, than that he might be able <hi>barely to say</hi> that he had asked them. Or at best, if he did desire them at all; yet was his desire far from that degree which he pretends; it was a <hi>weak wish,</hi> rather than a <hi>desire</hi>; an imperfect inclination, that could effect nothing. It may be he had <hi>rather have</hi> that grace which he asks, than <hi>go without it</hi>; but he had <hi>rather want it</hi> than <hi>be at any pains for it.</hi> He loves and desires the least ease, far more than the vertue; and is resolved to keep that, although he loses this. So that although he do think the grace which he prays for to be worth something, yet he esteems it next to nothing; he judges it to be worth no pains, and deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no endeavour, and so has either no desires of it at all, or such weak and feeble ones as are just as good as none.</p>
               <p>Yea it is well if many times his heart is not <hi>set against</hi> those very graces that he begs whilst he is asking of them, which is more than barely being <hi>unconcerned</hi> for them. For how often doth it happen that a man prays for <hi>charity,</hi> whilst he is in love with <hi>malice</hi>; that he begs <hi>sobriety,</hi> whilst his heart is upon <hi>drunkenness</hi>; that he asks <hi>justice,</hi> whilst his affections hanker after <hi>deceitful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ness</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:66440:51"/>
and <hi>wrong?</hi> This, in very deed, is the case of <hi>most,</hi> if not of <hi>all impenitent</hi> and <hi>wicked</hi> men. For they love their Sins, and resolve to continue in them; and yet even then pray for such Graces as are contrary to them. Now here it is plain that their <hi>heart</hi> doth not go along with their <hi>tongues</hi>: they are not willing to <hi>lose</hi> that, which they pray to God they may <hi>leave</hi>; and are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to <hi>receive</hi> that, which they beg to <hi>have.</hi> They only <hi>pretend</hi> desire, but are <hi>possessed in truth</hi> with hatred and aversation.</p>
               <p>And then as for all the <hi>good promises</hi> which they make to God in their Prayers, <hi>viz. That if he will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them, they will never do so any more; but become new men, and watch more carefully, and sin more seldom, and obey more constantly and universally</hi>; so long as their Prayers are thus <hi>unendeavouring</hi> and idle, all this is but <hi>meer wind, vain hypocrisie,</hi> and <hi>deceitful talk.</hi> For if, when their prayers are over, they take no care still to perform that obedience which they promised whilst they were at them; is it not clear to every eye that all is cheat and falshood, and that they lye and dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in these their <hi>promises,</hi> as well as we saw they did in their <hi>professions?</hi> All their engagements are stark nought, they meant no such thing whilst they made them, nor ever after think upon them to make them good and fulfil them.</p>
               <p>And can any man now be so intolerably weak and shamefully blind, as to imagine that God should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward such <hi>idle talk,</hi> as all these unendeavouring pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for grace are, and give a blessing upon such <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical din and feigned language?</hi> To dissemble thus with God Almighty is not to <hi>honour,</hi> but to <hi>abuse</hi> him: and so fits us, not for any expressions of his <hi>love,</hi> but only of his <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>indignation.</hi> It is to <hi>pass affronts,</hi> instead of <hi>begging kindness</hi>; to make a <hi>mockery</hi> of his
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:66440:52"/>
                  <hi>condescensions</hi>; and to turn that <hi>sacred</hi> and <hi>inestimable liberty,</hi> which he has graciously indulged mankind, of <hi>making known their desires to him for a supply and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of them,</hi> into a <hi>fraudulent trick</hi> and <hi>opprobrious couzenage.</hi> And since all these <hi>unendeavouring prayers for Gods grace,</hi> are an <hi>hypocrisie</hi> so <hi>gross,</hi> and a <hi>mockery</hi> so reproachful; we must needs conclude that he will utterly reject <hi>them,</hi> as well as our <hi>prayers for pardon whilst we continue in our sins</hi>; and instead of granting and fulfilling, deride and avenge them.</p>
               <p>But if ever we hope to have our Prayers heard the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>only</hi> way is to observe S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John</hi>'s rule, of <hi>ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only what is according to Gods will. For this,</hi> says he, <hi>is the confidence which we have in him, that if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.14. And what that will of God is concerning any of those things which we have to pray for; we can learn no where but from his Holy Gospel. Now in that we are plainly told, that as for <hi>Pardon,</hi> his peremptory will is, That no man shall meet with it but he only who has Repented and obeyed him. <hi>REPENT,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter, that your sins may be blotted out,</hi> Acts 3.19. And <hi>except you REPENT,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>you shall all Perish,</hi> Luk. 13.3. For when we are all brought to Christs Tribunal at the great day, to be there Eternally acquitted or condemned; we are taught in the most express words, that <hi>Judgment shall pass up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every man according to his WORKS,</hi> Rev. 20.12, 13 So that if we would ask <hi>pardon</hi> and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness according to <hi>Gods will</hi>; and in such sort as he has promised to grant it, and we may justly hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; we must desire it in <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Repentance,</hi> and in true <hi>resolutions</hi> and readiness to <hi>obey.</hi> And then as for <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> to enable us to overcome any sin, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any vertue; we are expressly informed that his
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:66440:52"/>
                  <hi>will</hi> is to grant to such persons only, as <hi>endeavour</hi> after those graces which they pray for, and are careful to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise</hi> and <hi>work with</hi> them. God will not bestow <hi>new grace</hi> upon us, till he see that we have made good use of what he has bestowed <hi>already.</hi> We must improve those <hi>talents</hi> which have formerly been entrusted with us, before he will think us qualified to receive more. For so we are taught in the <hi>Parable</hi> of those Men who had received the <hi>talents, Matt.</hi> 25. As a conclusion whereof, we have this laid down as a <hi>rule</hi> of divine dispensations: <hi>To him that hath, i. e.</hi> hath wrought with, and made use of that talent of grace which was granted to him, as <hi>those servants</hi> had done who are mention'd <hi>vers.</hi> 20, 22. <hi>to him shall be given</hi> still more, <hi>and he shall have more abundance: But from him that hath not, i. e.</hi> hath not exercised and improved that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he has already been entrusted, as that wicked Servant had not done, who had hid it, <hi>vers.</hi> 25. so far is he from receiving more, <hi>that,</hi> like as it was from the <hi>idle unworking servant,</hi> vers. 28. <hi>from him shall be taken even what he hath,</hi> vers. 29. And in that very place where S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that <hi>God worketh in us both to will, and to do</hi>; he acquaints us moreover that the way whereby he doth that is, by blessing our <hi>own endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,</hi> and giving success to our <hi>own working</hi>; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly useth it as an argument thereunto, <hi>work out your own salvation</hi>; and doubt not but you will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to go through with it, <hi>for it is God that</hi> prospers your endeavours, and, by giving strength and success to them, <hi>worketh in you both to will and to do,</hi> Phil. 2.12, 13. So that if we would ask <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>strength</hi> according to Gods <hi>will,</hi> and in such sort as he will grant them; at the time of Praying we must <hi>sincerely resolve</hi>; and when our Prayer is over, we must <hi>care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> and <hi>honestly endeavour</hi> after them. An <note n="d" place="margin">Jam. 5.16.</note> 
                  <hi>effectual
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:66440:53"/>
desire</hi> shall serve our turn; and a <hi>working Prayer</hi> shall procure a blessing: but besides it no other will.</p>
               <p>Whatever therefore vain and wicked people may imagine; there is no Prayer that will avail them when obedience is wanting. If we pray for <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> God will by no means hear us unless our <hi>hearts</hi> are <hi>penitent,</hi> and our <hi>lives obedient.</hi> And in our Prayers for <hi>forgiveness,</hi> we must pray for <hi>obedience</hi> too. We must be as sollicitous for the <hi>doing</hi> of our <hi>duty,</hi> as for the <hi>receiving</hi> of our <hi>reward</hi>; and never in our Prayers omit to ask for that, which Christ thought fit to give us as the highest instance of those things which we are to pray for, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Holy Spirit, Luk.</hi> 11.13. And when we do pray for that, or for any particular graces of it; we see that we have not done our work bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>desiring</hi> it, till we go on also to <hi>endeavour</hi> after it. We must <hi>resolve</hi> when we pray to seek that grace which we ask for; and we must <hi>effectually labour</hi> after it, in the diligent use of all those means whereby it is either acquired or encreased, when our Prayer is over. All the way it is only our obedience which can effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally recommend our prayers; so that whensoever we ask for any thing, if we would have any just hope of receiving it, we must be sure to obey with it.</p>
               <p>And for this the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are express and plain. <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart,</hi> saith the Psalmist, <hi>the Lord will not HEAR me,</hi> Psal. 66.18. And God himself says the same by his Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> in words most full and forcible. <hi>When you spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea when you make many Prayers, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood. Wash you, make you clean, put away the EVIL of your DOINGS from before mine eyes, cease to DO evil, learn to DO well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</hi> When you
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:66440:53"/>
have done this, you are fit to be hearkned to, <hi>come now and let us reason together</hi>; pray for Pardon, and I will forgive you, and <hi>though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow,</hi> Isa. 1.15, 16, 17, 18. So long as men <hi>persist</hi> in their <hi>sins,</hi> it is in vain for them to hope that God should ever accept their Prayers. For <hi>he that turns away his ear,</hi> saith the Wise Man, <hi>from HEAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING the Law; even his PRAYER shall be an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,</hi> Prov. 28.9. But if any man would have his <hi>Prayers granted,</hi> he must take care to have his <hi>life obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.</hi> For <hi>the eyes of the Lord are over the Righteous,</hi> saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter, and his ears are open to THEIR Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:</hi> but the <hi>FACE of the Lord is against them that DO evil,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.12. The acceptableness of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians Prayers, consists, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> intimates, <hi>in lifting up holy hands,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.8. Before <hi>God</hi> will <hi>Pardon</hi> any man upon his Prayers, <hi>Christs Gospel</hi> must <hi>absolve</hi> him; it must <hi>promise,</hi> before God <hi>perform</hi> with him. No man has any other assurance that he shall receive what he desires, but his having done what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. <hi>Whatsoever we ask we receive of him,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John, because we KEEP his Commandments, and DO those things that are pleasing in his sight,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.21, 22.</p>
               <p>And by all this it clearly appears, that no Prayers will <hi>avail</hi> us unto <hi>life</hi> and <hi>pardon</hi> at the last day, unless we <hi>keep</hi> Gods Commandments, and obey with them. There is no <hi>grace</hi> to be obtain'd without <hi>endeavours</hi>; nor any <hi>pardon</hi> to be purchased without <hi>obedience.</hi> God will not <hi>hear</hi> us, if we refuse to <hi>hearken</hi> unto him. Nothing can maintain a good understanding betwixt God and us, but only the <hi>DOING</hi> of our duty: upon this condition he will grant us any thing, but without it we can procure nothing. So that after all it is only our Obedience which can make our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:66440:54"/>
available; and if ever we expect that God should grant them, we must be sure to work and obey with them.</p>

                  <p>Of Pardon promised to our fear of God, and trust in him. Of the influence which mens fears have upon their endeavours, and how they carry on ignorant minds into Superstition, but well informed judgments to Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Of the influence of mens trust in God upon their Obedience. The ineffectiveness of most mens trust. Of the presumption and infidelity of such confidence. That Pardon is promised to fear and trust so far only as we obey with them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>SEventhly,</hi> That condition whereupon we shall be Eternally accepted at the last day, is sometimes call'd our <hi>fear of God,</hi> and sometimes our <hi>trust</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> in him.</p>
               <p>As for our <hi>fear</hi> of God, it is made the great means of our Pardon and acceptance. <hi>I will teach you the good and right way</hi> to your bliss and happiness, said <hi>Samuel</hi> to the Israelites; <hi>only fear the Lord, and</hi> in vertue of that fear, <hi>serve him,</hi> 1 Sam. 12.24, 25. This fear has given right to pardon in all times, and will eternally secure
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:66440:54"/>
it. For <hi>Gods mercy is on them that fear him, from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to generation,</hi> Luke 1.50.<note place="margin">Ps. 115.11, 13·</note> 
                  <hi>From everlasting to everlasting,</hi> Psal. 103.17. So that well might <hi>Solomon</hi> say, <hi>The Fear of the Lord is a Fountain of life,</hi> Prov. 14.27. and that he <hi>surely knew it will go well with them that fear the Lord,</hi> Eccles. 8.12.</p>
               <p>And then as for our <hi>Hope,</hi> or <hi>Trust</hi> in God; great things are spoken of it. <hi>Blessed is he,</hi> saith the Psalmist, <hi>who maketh the Lord his Trust,</hi> Psal. 40.4. He is secure from all effects of his wrath and anger; for the Lord <hi>taketh pleasure in them that hope in his mercy,</hi> Psal. 147.11. In particular, our <hi>relying on Christ</hi> and <hi>confiding in him</hi> for our pardon and eternal salvation, is said to be that which will never fail or deceive us. For <hi>he that</hi> hopeth or <hi>believeth on him,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, shall never be ashamed,</hi> by a misplaced confidence or expectation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.11.</p>
               <p>Now our <hi>fear</hi> of God, and our <hi>hope</hi> or <hi>trust</hi> in his mercy, are of all our passions the most active Causes and powerful Springs of our good works and obedience.</p>
               <p>As for our <hi>fears,</hi> no passion puts us upon so much pains and industry as they do. They make us act to the utmost of our power, and do all that is to be done to get protection from that evil which excites them. For fear has the deepest root in our natural <hi>self-love,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of our own preservation; being raised in us by the nearness of such things as either utterly destroy, or in some degree impair it. And therefore in them the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctivity of our self-love is shown to the utmost; as vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently as we desire and endeavour to preserve ourselves and our own ease; so vehemently must we desire and endeavour likewise to remove the matter of our fears, which hangs over us to destroy, or to torment us.</p>
               <p>The most natural effect of <hi>fear</hi> then is a most <hi>vigorous endeavour</hi> by all means to remove that evil which we are afraid of. And according as this may be done <hi>several
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:66440:55"/>
ways</hi>; so doth our passion of fear exert it self after <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral manners.</hi> If we think the evil may be <hi>conquered,</hi> it pushes us on to <hi>fight</hi> and <hi>subdue</hi> it. If it be <hi>above our strength,</hi> but may yet for all that <hi>be avoided</hi>; it puts us upon all means of <hi>concealment</hi> or <hi>escape</hi>; and makes us seek either to <hi>lye hid,</hi> or to <hi>fly from</hi> it. But if there is neither any prospect of <hi>withstanding the power,</hi> nor of <hi>escaping the eye</hi> of him who is ready to inflict it; as there never can be when God, who is both <hi>Almighty</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing,</hi> is the Person feared; then it hurries us on by all means to <hi>regain his favour</hi> and good will, that thereby we may <hi>prevent</hi> it. And in Times of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> when men had great <hi>fears</hi> and little <hi>knowledg,</hi> when they were grievously afraid of God, but knew not what things he loved and delighted in, nor wherewith they might please him; this fear of God put them upon all the <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensical services,</hi> and <hi>foolish propitiations of Superstition.</hi> But where God has <hi>plainly and clearly revealed his will,</hi> and manifested to all that it is their <hi>obedience</hi> alone that can <hi>continue</hi> them in his favour, or <hi>restore</hi> them to it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have lost it: here the only effect of fear, must needs be that which is known to be the only means of favour, <hi>viz.</hi> our <hi>keeping of his Commandments,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. So that our fear of God is a most sure prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and effectual means of our serving and obeying him.</p>
               <p>And then as for our <hi>hope,</hi> or trust in Gods mercy, it is a most natural cause of our <hi>doing</hi> our <hi>Duty</hi> likewise. For all <hi>hope</hi> implies both <hi>desire</hi> and a <hi>likelihood</hi> of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that which is desired; which <hi>two</hi> are all that is at any time needful to make us vigorously endeavour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it. For if men will be at no pains for a thing, it is either because they have little or no desire of it, or no probability of succeeding in it. But when once they are push'd on by an <hi>eager desire,</hi> it is only <hi>despair</hi> that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:66440:55"/>
can dull their endeavours in pursuit of it. So that if we <hi>hope</hi> for mercy, we shall be at some pains for it, and by an active service and obedience seek to procure it.</p>
               <p>Indeed when the good thing that is hoped for needs no labour of ours, but our naked <hi>trust</hi> and <hi>reliance</hi> is all that on our sides is required to it; our <hi>hope</hi> will effect no endeavour after it, because none is necessary to obtain it. But as for that <hi>eternal life</hi> and pardon, which Christs Gospel proposeth to our hopes; they are offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us only upon certain <hi>Terms</hi> and <hi>Conditions,</hi> and will never be attained by us without our <hi>Service</hi> and <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> And seeing <hi>obedience</hi> here is the <hi>necessary means</hi> to the acquisition of that which we <hi>desire,</hi> the same <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> which carries us on towards <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> must spur us on withal to works of <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> also. They must be a Spring of industry and good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, because they make us resolve to procure that, which is not to be got without them.</p>
               <p>And in regard our <hi>fear</hi> of God, and our <hi>hope</hi> or <hi>trust</hi> in his <hi>mercy,</hi> are such powerful Principles of our <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to his Laws; therefore are <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> which are the rewards of <hi>Obedience,</hi> so frequently <hi>promised</hi> to them. God never intends to reward an <hi>idle fear,</hi> or an <hi>unactive</hi> and <hi>careless trust</hi>; but such only as are <hi>industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and <hi>obedient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true indeed the generality of men have taken up a dangerous errour; especially in the latter of these, and are bold and presumptuous in their <hi>hopes</hi> at the same time that they are most wicked and disobedient in their lives and practice. They find no service of their own works wherein they may be confident, and therefore they fly from them to Gods Goodness. They know this full well by themselves, that <hi>they</hi> are <hi>wicked</hi>; but they know withal, that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>gracious,</hi> and their <hi>hope</hi> is, that He will be <hi>merciful</hi> to them <hi>notwithstanding their

sins.</hi> They find themselves <hi>condemned</hi> indeed by his <hi>Gospel</hi>; but their trust is to be <hi>relieved</hi> by his <hi>Nature</hi>; they are <hi>punishable</hi> and wretched by his <hi>Laws,</hi> but they expect to be <hi>saved</hi> by his <hi>pity</hi> and <hi>kindness.</hi> The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations of his Word, 'tis true, breathe out nothing to them but Death; but their hope is, that he will be better than his Word, and that through the infiniteness of his mercy, they shall at last be adjudged to pardon and eternal life.</p>
               <p>But such <hi>bold hopes</hi> and <hi>presumptuous confidences</hi> as these, are the ready way to <hi>provoke</hi> and <hi>offend God,</hi> but by no means to <hi>attone</hi> and <hi>appease him.</hi> For thus to <hi>hope in his Mercy</hi> against the <hi>plain Declarations of his Will,</hi> is to chashier those measures of life which he hath given us, and, by usurping the place of Judg and Governour of the World, to make others of our own. It is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to oppose his <hi>Essence</hi> to his <hi>Gospel,</hi> by making <hi>it bless</hi> those whom <hi>this condemns,</hi> and to become <hi>Infidels</hi> to his <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> under <hi>colour</hi> of <hi>promoting his Mercy</hi> and <hi>Goodness.</hi> It <hi>reproacheth his Nature</hi> under a <hi>pretence of Honouring</hi> it, by making his Vertues enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere, and his Excellencies inconsistent, and robbing him of one most glorious Attribute to exalt another. But when he comes at last to judge the World, he will ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually assert the truth of his Gospel, and vindicate the Honour of his injured Attributes; in passing a just censure, and inflicting a most severe punishment on all such blasphemous presumptions as these are. For it is not an <hi>idle trust in God,</hi> or <hi>ineffective recumbency and reliance on Christ for salvation</hi> that shall avail any man at that Day. No, if they have despised his Laws, and their lives are disobedient, let them be as presumptuous as they please with God, and as bold as they will with their Saviour, they shall certainly go to Hell in the midst of all their high flown hopes and daring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidences.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:66440:56"/>
For God will be as good as his Word, and punish disobedience according as he has threatned it. It is not only in his <hi>Word,</hi> but in his very <hi>Nature,</hi> that he hates and abhors sin: so that he can never be brought to reward and encourage it, being determined by his <hi>Natural Inclination,</hi> as well as by the Truth of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, eternally to punish and avenge it. <hi>He is not a God,</hi> saith the Psalmist, <hi>who hath pleasure in wickedness</hi>; no, as an Argument of that, he will not endure it in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, <hi>Evil shall not dwell with him. The foolish,</hi> or disobedient, <hi>shall not</hi> be suffered to <hi>stand in his sight,</hi> for <hi>he hateth all the Workers of iniquity,</hi> Psal. 5.4, 5.</p>
               <p>No man therefore must dare to place his <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>trust in God,</hi> till in his <hi>works he honestly obeys him.</hi> It is only our <hi>doing</hi> what he requires, that can give us suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient grounds to <hi>expect</hi> the performance of those mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which he promises. A <hi>faithful obedience</hi> is the only firm foundation of a <hi>sure Trust,</hi> we must keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments before we can safely confide in him.</p>
               <p>When God says then that he who <hi>fears the Lord shall be blessed,</hi> and that he who <hi>trusts</hi> and <hi>hopes in him shall not finally be ashamed</hi>; he speaks not of such <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>trust</hi> as are <hi>separate</hi> from obedience, but of such only as are conjoyned with it. The Phrase is <hi>metonymical,</hi> our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient works are implyed, although they are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly mentioned; for we must <hi>obey</hi> him through <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>do</hi> what he commands us in <hi>hopes</hi> of obtaining those mercies which he promises, or else we shall never attain those blessings which we hope for.</p>
               <p>And for this the Testimonies of the Scriptures are <hi>many</hi> and <hi>plain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For as for our <hi>fear of God,</hi> it is of no account with him further than it makes us obedient. <hi>The fear of the Lord,</hi> says <hi>Solomon, is to hate evil,</hi> Prov. 8.13. It must be an instrument of amendment and reformation; a
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:66440:57"/>
                  <hi>fear whereby men depart from evil,</hi> Prov. 16.6. A means of <hi>perfecting</hi> our obedience and holy living; for that is S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi>'s Character of it, when he tells us of <hi>PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FECTING holiness in the fear of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. and of <hi>WORKING out our own SALVATION with fear and trembling,</hi> Phil. 2.12. It is only when obedience thus follows upon our fear, and is effected by it; that God accepts and rewards it. <hi>I will teach you the right way</hi> to pardon and happiness, said <hi>Samuel, Fear the Lord,</hi> and, together with that, <hi>SERVE him,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.24, 25. For if we would <hi>hear the conclusion of the whole matter,</hi> as saith the Wise Man, we must <hi>fear God and keep his Commandments; this</hi> obedience and fear together <hi>is the whole Duty of man,</hi> Eccles. 12.13. No man therefore can lay a just claim to Gods mercy at the last day; but he who has fear'd him in such sort, as out of that religious fear intirely to obey him. But whosoever fears so, mercy shall rest on him for ever. For <hi>the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them that fear him,</hi> provided that out of that fear they <hi>keep his Covenant, and his Commandments to DO them,</hi> Psal. 103.17, 18.</p>
               <p>And then for our <hi>trust</hi> and <hi>hope in Gods mercy,</hi> it is no <hi>saving trust,</hi> but a <hi>blasphemous and bold presumption,</hi> if we hope in him whilst we are disobedient and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious against him. A good mans <hi>trust</hi> is only in <hi>promised</hi> mercies, which are never made to such as wilfully and impenitently transgress Gods Laws, but only to those who honestly obey them. It is a trust, as the Psalmist speaks, <hi>in Gods Word,</hi> and not against it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.42. And because that word denounces nothing but woes and threatnings to all wicked men, therefore, as he speaks in another place, <hi>shall the righteous</hi> alone <hi>trust in him,</hi> Psal. 64.10. The hope of a Christian is not <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,</hi> but suspended upon his performance of certain
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:66440:57"/>
terms; a hope upon his active service and obedience. So that whosoever has it, and expects not to be disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in it, must <hi>purifie himself,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3. Disobedience, so long as men continue in it, is a most <hi>desperate</hi> and forlorn Condition, there being no just hope to any man but in <hi>well-doing.</hi> It is, says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, in teaching us to deny all ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live godlily, soberly and righteously in this present world,</hi> that the Gospel encourages us to <hi>look for the</hi> fulfilling of our <hi>blessed hope,</hi> Tit. 2.12, 13. And the way to <hi>hold fast the confidence and joy of</hi> a just <hi>hope</hi> in Christ <hi>firm unto the end,</hi> he informs the Hebrews, is only by <hi>hearing,</hi> and thereupon obeying <hi>Gods voice, and not hardening their hearts,</hi> as the Israelites did, <hi>in the provocation,</hi> or those transgressions wherewith they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him, <hi>in the day of</hi> their <hi>temptation in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> Heb. 3.6, 7, 8. And the <hi>full assurance of hope,</hi> as he again declares to them, is no otherwise to be upheld but by <hi>mens diligence in obeying, and in the work and labour of love</hi>; which implies the whole of our obedience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10, 11. So that, as the Psalmist says, they must <hi>trust in the Lord,</hi> and, together with that, <hi>do good,</hi> who are to receive mercy from him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.3.</p>
               <p>If men therefore will dare to sin, and yet presume; affront God Majesty, and still trust in his Mercy: they must needs <hi>deceive</hi> their own Souls to their utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. For it is a <hi>vain confidence</hi> and an <hi>impudent presumption</hi> in any man to <hi>rely</hi> upon <hi>Gods goodness</hi> for the pardon of his sins, <hi>without repenting</hi> of them, and <hi>obeying</hi> him; whenas he has plainly told us, That his <hi>goodness</hi> it self shall pity and pardon none but the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent</hi> and <hi>Obedient.</hi> He trusts to a false hope, and leans upon a broken Reed; for as long as his transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions continue to separate between him and his God, whatever God <hi>CAN</hi> do, yet certainly he <hi>WILL</hi> not
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:66440:58"/>
save him. <hi>The Lords hand,</hi> saith the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> to the afflicted Jews, <hi>is not shortened that it cannot save, nor his ear heavy that it cannot hear: but your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear. For your hand's are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity, your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseness: none calls for Justice, nor any pleads for Truth</hi>; and since your disobedience is so heinous, your hopes must needs be false, <hi>you TRVST in vanity,</hi> Isai. 59.1, 2, 3, 4. Christ himself never dyed to reconcile God to mens sins, and to procure hopes of pardon for the finally impenitent and unperswadably disobedient. So that no man may ever think himself delivered to act wickedness; or wilfully transgress Gods Laws, and still dare to trust in him. But if any are so bold and front<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, Christ will rebuke them at the last Day, as God doth the presumptuous Jews by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah; Behold,</hi> says he, <hi>you trust in lying words which cannot profit</hi> you. <hi>Will you steal, murther, and commit adultery, and swear falsly, and</hi> notwithstanding all that, <hi>come and stand before me in this house which is called by my Name,</hi> as Men that owne my service, and dare trust in my love, <hi>and say,</hi> as in effect you do by such usage, <hi>we are delivered to do all these abominations?</hi> Dare you by thus presuming upon my favour in the midst of all your transgressions, make me become a Patron and Protector of your villainies? <hi>And is this house which is called by my Name, become a Den</hi> or Receptacle and Sanctuary <hi>of Robbers in your eyes? Behold I, even I, have seen it, saith the Lord</hi>; and that surely not to encourage and reward, but most severely to punish it; for <hi>I will</hi> utterly <hi>cast you</hi> out of <hi>my sight,</hi> Jer. 7.8, 9, 10, 11, 15. God will by no means endure to have his own most <hi>holy Nature</hi> become a <hi>support to sin,</hi> nor his <hi>Religion</hi> to be made a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:66440:58"/>
                  <hi>refuge</hi> for <hi>disobedience,</hi> nor his <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> a <hi>Sanctuary</hi> to <hi>wicked</hi> and unholy <hi>men.</hi> So that no man must dare to hope and trust in him, but he only who honestly observes his Laws and uprightly obeys him.</p>
               <p>That <hi>fear of God</hi> then, and <hi>trust in his mercy</hi> which the Gospel encourages, and Christ our Judge will at the last Day accept of, is not a fear and trust <hi>without obedience,</hi> but such only as <hi>implies</hi> it. We must <hi>serve him in fear,</hi> and <hi>obey him through hope,</hi> as ever we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect he should acquit and pardon us. For no fears or hopes will avail us unto bliss, but those that amend our lives, and effect in us an honest service and obedience.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>EIghthly,</hi> That condition which the Gospel indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sably requires of us to our pardon and happiness, is sometimes called <hi>Love.</hi> For of this S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> says plainly, that it is the <hi>fulfilling of the Law,</hi> Rom. 13.10. It is the great condition of Life, the standing Terms of mercy and happiness. We have the same Apostles
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:66440:59"/>
word for it of our <hi>love of God. Those things which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eye hath seen, nor ear heard, neither have entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart of man to conceive, are prepared for them who LOVE God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. And again, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>If any man love God, the same is</hi> known or <hi>accepted of him,</hi> vers. 3. And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John</hi> says as much of the <hi>love of our Neighbour. Beloved, let us LOVE one another, for LOVE is of God, and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.7. And again, <hi>God is Love, and manifested his Love in giving Christ to dye for us. And if we love one another, God dwells in us. For hereby,</hi> by this mark and evidence, <hi>we know that we dwell in him, and he in us; because he hath given us of</hi> this loving temper and <hi>Spirit of his,</hi> ver. 8, 9, 12, 13. And to the same purpose he speaks fully in the third Chapter of that first Epistle, <hi>We know,</hi> says he, <hi>that we have passed from death unto life; because we LOVE the BRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THREN,</hi> ver. 14.</p>
               <p>Now our hearty <hi>love both of God and men,</hi> is a most natural and easie Principle of an intire service and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. For the most genuine and proper effect of Love, is to seek the satisfaction and delight of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons beloved. It is careful in nothing to behave it self unseemly, but to keep back from every thing that may offend, and forward in all such services as may any ways pleasure and content them. If they <hi>rejoyce,</hi> it <hi>congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulates</hi>; if they <hi>mourn,</hi> it <hi>grieves</hi> with them. If they are in <hi>distress,</hi> it affords <hi>succour</hi>; if in <hi>want, supply</hi>; in <hi>doubts,</hi> it ministers <hi>counsel</hi>; in <hi>business, dispatch.</hi> It is always full and teeming with good offices, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms it self into all shapes whereby it may procure their satisfaction, and render their condition comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and easie to them. So that it exerts it self <hi>in pity to the miserable, in protection to the oppressed, in relief to the indigent, in counsel to the ignorant, in encouragement
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:66440:59"/>
to the good, in kind reproof to the evil, in thanks for kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, in patience and forbearance upon sufferings, in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of wrong and injuries:</hi> In one word it is an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Source and Spring of all works of <hi>Justice, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Humility and Peace.</hi> Now the Body of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is made up of these Duties. For <hi>what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, O man,</hi> saith the Prophet <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah, but to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God,</hi> Mic. 6.8. Those things which God has ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted into his Service, and made the matter of our duty towards one another, are nothing else but these natural effects of love and kindness, and expressions of good nature towards all men. All the Precepts of Religion only forbid our doing evil, and require our doing good to all the World. And since, as the Apostle argues, love seeketh all things that are good, and <hi>worketh no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to our Neighbour; therefore Love</hi> must needs be <hi>the fulfilling of those Laws</hi> which concern them. <hi>This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi> for instance, as he illustrates it, <hi>Thou shalt not commit Adultery; thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness; thou shalt not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet:</hi> all these, <hi>and if there be any other Commandment</hi> relating to our Brethren, <hi>it is briefly comprehended in this</hi> Saying, <hi>Thou shalt LOVE they Neighbour as thy self.</hi> For <hi>LOVE worketh none</hi> of all these <hi>ills to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, therefore LOVE is the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> Rom. 13.9, 10.</p>
               <p>Thus doth our <hi>Love of our Neighbour</hi> fulfil all those particular Laws which contain our Duty towards <hi>them</hi>: and in like manner our <hi>Love of God</hi> fulfils all those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Precepts which comprehend our Duty towards <hi>him.</hi> For all that he requires of us towards himself, is neither more nor less than to <hi>honour and worship him</hi>; to do nothing in all our behaviour that savours of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respect towards him; nor by any thought, word or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:66440:60"/>
to disgrace or contemn him. But now nothing ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders any person so secure from contempt, as our love and affection for him. Affront and reproach are a great part of enmity and despite, and so can never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from us towards those whom we love and value. But this is always certain, that if we are kindly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards any person, we shall not fail to express a due honour of him, and bear him a just respect and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that if we do indeed love God, he is secure from all affront; and disobedience being a most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate reproach, since our Love will not permit us to dishonour, it can never suffer us to disobey him.</p>
               <p>Thus mighty and powerful, easie and natural a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of an universal obedience, both towards God and men, is an universal Love: it doth the work without difficulty, and carries us on to obey with ease; in as much as all the particular Precepts and Instances of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, are but so many genuine effects, and proper expressions of it. The effects of our love are the parts of our obedience; the products of our Duty and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as well as of our passion. So that it is a most natural Spring of our obedient service, because it prompts us to the very same things, to which God has bound and obliged us by his Precepts.</p>
               <p>But besides this way of an universal love's influencing an universal obedience, through this coincidence of the effects of Love and the instances of Duty; our Love of God, who is our <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Governour,</hi> were a sure principle of our obedience to him, were his Precepts instanced, not in the same things which are the effects of a general Love, which is the true Case; but in things different from them. For although our love would not prompt us to perform them by its natural tendency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and for their own sakes: yet it would through submission and duty, and for his sake who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:66440:60"/>
them. It would make us deny our selves to pleasure him; and produce other effects than our own temper enclines us to, to do him service. For as Love is for doing hurt to none; so least of all to Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: it will give to every one their own, but to them most especially. Now Duty and Service is that which we owe to our Rulers; and the proper way of Love's exerting it self in that, is by obedience. If we love, we shall be industrious to please; and the only way of pleasing them, is by doing what they command us. For there is no such offence to a Governour, as the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of his Laws; no injury like that of opposing his Will, and despising his Authority. To do this is to renounce all subjection, and to cast off his Yoke; and so is not to express love, but to declare enmity; not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately to owne, but in open malice to defie him. But if any man would contribute to his delight, there is no way for that but by a performance of his pleasure: it is nothing but our obedience that can add to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, or evidence our Love. For disobedience to our Governours is clearly the most profest hatred, as the observance of our Duty is the most allowed instance of friendship and good will.</p>
               <p>So that Love is a Spring and Principle of our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not only because the Commandment and it run pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel, and the instances of Gods Laws are the same with the effects of a general Love; but also because our love of God would make us obey him, even in such instances of Duty as differ from them. For all that aversion which we have to the thing commanded, would be outweigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our desire to please him who commands it: and although we should neglect it upon its own; yet for his sake we should certainly fulfil and perform it.</p>
               <p>And because our Love of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>men</hi> is so natural a Spring, and so sweet and easie a Principle to produce
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:66440:61"/>
in us a perfect and intire obedience to all <hi>those</hi> Laws which concern <hi>either,</hi> or to any <hi>other</hi>: therefore has God promised so nobly to reward it. He never intends to crown an idle and unworking love; but such only as is active and industrious. For when he says that he who <hi>loves God and men is known of God, and accepted by him, and born of him; and that God dwells in him, and has prepared Heaven for him:</hi> he speaks <hi>metonymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> and means all the while a love with these religious effects, a love that is productive of an entire service and obedience.</p>
               <p>And to this Point the Scriptures speak fully. For as for our love of God himself, and of our Saviour Christ; that is plainly of no account in his judgment, but when it makes us keep his Commands, and become industriously obedient. <hi>If ye LOVE me,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>keep my Commandments; for he that hath my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and KEEPETH them, he it is that loveth me; and he</hi> only <hi>who</hi> so <hi>loveth me,</hi> in obeying me, <hi>shall be beloved of my Father, and I will love him,</hi> John 14.15, 21. <hi>Whoso keepeth Gods Word,</hi> saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John, in him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily is the love of God made perfect: and hereby</hi> it is, by this perfection of Love in Obedience, that <hi>we know we are in him,</hi> 1 John 2.5. But if we have only a pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>verbal love,</hi> or an <hi>inward passion</hi> for God, and shew no <hi>Signs</hi> or <hi>Effects</hi> of it in our <hi>obedient works</hi> and <hi>actions</hi>: we shall be as far from being accepted by him, as we are from any true and real service of him. He will look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all our Professions only as vain speech, and down-right flattery: but will not esteem it as having any thing of sober truth and reality. For <hi>whosoever hath this Worlds goods, and seeth his Brother hath need, and</hi> obeys not Gods Command of shewing mercy (and the Case is the same in other Instances) but <hi>shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him; how dwells the love of God in him?</hi> 1 John 3.17.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>John, let us not love</hi> only <hi>in word, and in tongue; but in deed</hi> also <hi>and in truth.</hi> For it is <hi>hereby,</hi> by this operative love, that <hi>we know we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts</hi> in full confidence of his mercy <hi>before him,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.18, 19. Our <hi>love to them</hi> is to be manifested as <hi>Christs</hi> was to us, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>good effects</hi> and a <hi>real service</hi>; yea, when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion requires it, and their eternal weal may be very much promoted, and their Faith confirmed by it, in giving up our selves to <hi>Martyrdome,</hi> and laying down our own lives for their advantage. <hi>Hereby,</hi> says this same Apostle, <hi>perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us.</hi> And if we would be reputed to have that love which, as we are told at the fourteenth Verse, wafts us over <hi>from Death unto Life; we ought,</hi> upon a fit occasion, not to flinch from the most costly service, but even <hi>to lay down our</hi> very <note n="a" place="margin">S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

It is only this obedient and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative love of men which will be owned by Christ our Judg, and confer a just claim to Life and Pardon at the last Day. Our Love will not be rewarded as a thing that is <hi>absolute</hi> in it self, but only as an <hi>Instrument</hi>; in as much as <hi>it makes us,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>to fulfil the whole Law</hi> which makes any thing an instance of Duty towards them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8. But if we only profess love to them in <hi>kind words</hi> and <hi>tender expressions,</hi> but shew none in our <hi>works</hi> and <hi>actions</hi>; this idle, useless love will be of no account to <hi>us,</hi> nor benefit us more
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:66440:62"/>
than it profits <hi>them. For if a Brother, or a Sister,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>James, be naked and destitute of daily food; and one of you</hi> gives them only some good words, and <hi>says unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warm'd</hi> with Cloths, <hi>and filled</hi> with Food; but <hi>notwithstanding</hi> all this affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate language, <hi>ye give them not</hi> in the mean while <hi>those things which are needful for the Body; what doth it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit?</hi> Nothing at all surely, nor will it ever advantage your selves as an instance of that <hi>mercy which rejoyceth against judgment,</hi> Verse 13. more than it profits them, <hi>James</hi> 2.15, 16.</p>
               <p>So that when Christ comes to Judgment at the last Day, we see plainly that no love either of <hi>God</hi> or <hi>men</hi> will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail us; but only that which has kept the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; we shall never be acquitted at that Bar upon a pretence of love without obedience: for all that can possibly stand us in any stead there, is a <hi>loving service,</hi> a love which has made us careful and diligent to obey.</p>
               <p>And thus at last we have fully seen, that as for all those other things besides obedience, whereunto the Gospel promises pardon and happiness; they are by no means available to our bliss when they are separate from obedience, but then only when they effect and imply it. They all aim at it, and end in it, and are of no account in Gods Judgment further than they produce it. It is not either <hi>our knowing Christ, or our believing Christ, or our being in Christ, or our trusting in Christ, or our loving Christ, or our fears of God, or our confessions of sins, or our pouring out many prayers</hi>; or any thing else that will save us whilst we disobey. No, at the last Day we shall certainly be damned notwithstanding them, if the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of our works is wanting. It is only a <hi>working service</hi> that will please our Judge, and which can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly secure us: if we are able in that Court to produce that, it will clear us, but without it nothing else will.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:66440:62"/>
Christs Gospel, whereby all of us must stand or fall at that Day, has fully declared this already; and Christ himself will then confirm it. So that 'tis in vain to cast about for other <hi>marks,</hi> and to seek after other <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences</hi> for our title to bliss and happiness; nothing less than our Repentance and Obedience will avail us unto life, and through the <hi>merits</hi> of Christ, and the <hi>Grace of his Gospel</hi> it shall.</p>
               <p>And now at last we see clearly what that Condition is which the Gospel indispensably requires of us, and which is to mete out to us our last doom of bliss or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery; that in the <hi>general</hi> it is nothing else, neither more nor less than our <hi>obedience.</hi>

                  <hi>customary gratification</hi> therefore, and <hi>indulgence</hi> of them in any thing, even in instances that are <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> we suffer our bodily appetites to grow <hi>strong</hi> in us, and to get the <hi>guidance</hi> and <hi>management</hi> of us; they will over-rule us in instances that are <hi>prohibited,</hi> as well as in those that are <hi>allowed</hi>; and make us fulfil them in things <hi>sinful,</hi> as well as in things <hi>innocent.</hi> So that if we would be sure to conquer and subdue them in all such <hi>instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> as are <hi>sinful,</hi> we must take care that they grow not strong upon us in any <hi>instances whatsoever</hi>; but <hi>infeeble</hi> them, and keep them low, and make them tame and governable, ready to come or go at our own pleasure. And this now is a piece of Command and Mastery, which is never to be hoped for in <hi>gratifying</hi> and <hi>indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging</hi> them in <hi>any</hi> sort of instances, but only by <hi>morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi> and <hi>denying</hi> them in <hi>all.</hi> For this power of <hi>deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> them at our own <hi>pleasure</hi> cannot otherwise be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but by a <hi>long use</hi> and <hi>custom</hi> of <hi>denials</hi>: we must learn to <hi>deny</hi> and <hi>mortifie</hi> them in particular Instances, before we can in any reason hope to deny them for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together.</p>
               <p>And this <hi>mortification</hi> and <hi>denial</hi> of our <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>innocent</hi> bodily appetites, being thus plainly necessary to the <hi>denial</hi> and <hi>mortification</hi> of our <hi>sinful</hi> and <hi>unlawful bodily desires and actions</hi>; our Lord Christ, who best understood the necessities of our natures, what instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were most necessary, and what means most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate for us, has enacted it into a Law. So that now 'tis every mans duty to <hi>mortifie</hi> and <hi>deny</hi> not only all <hi>sinful bodily actions and desires</hi>; but, so far as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary unto that, all such as are innocent and lawful also. And according to the different degrees of mens progress herein, are their different perfections in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and their different measures of security and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that they shall continue in it.

                  <hi>unmortifiedness</hi> of their fleshly desires which can prove a Snare to them, and a dangerous temptation; <hi>Every man,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               <p>And all the forenamed Vertues, <hi>viz. Temperance, Sobriety, Chastity,</hi> &amp;c. are Duties incumbent upon us, and implied in that care which this general Vertue <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety</hi> takes of our meaner Part, our <hi>Bodies.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <head>The CONTENTS. </head>
                  <p>Of the Duties of Piety and Righteousness, both compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in one general Duty, LOVE. It the Epitome of our Duty. The great happiness of a good nature. The kind temper of the Christian Religion. Of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of LOVE. The great Duty to God is Honour. The outward expression whereof is worship. The great offence is dishonour. Of the several Duties and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions contained under both.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FOR the <hi>two</hi> remaining Members in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi>'s Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>viz. Godliness</hi> or <hi>Piety,</hi> and <hi>Righteousness,</hi> which require something from us to <hi>God</hi> or to our
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:66440:69"/>
                  <hi>Neighbour</hi>; they may yet be reduced into a narrower compass, and are both comprized in that one word <hi>LOVE.</hi> For all that ever God requires of us, either to <hi>himself</hi> or towards <hi>other men,</hi> is only <hi>heartily</hi> and <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually</hi> to <hi>LOVE</hi> them. And this <hi>abridgment</hi> of our whole Duty, in respect of these <hi>two</hi> remaining parts of it towards <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man,</hi> into that <hi>one</hi> compendious Law of <hi>LOVE,</hi> is no more than what our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> and his Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> have already made to our hands. For hear how they speak of it: <hi>Jesus saith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lawyer, Thou shalt LOVE the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and all thy soul, and all thy mind. This is the first and great Commandment: and the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self. On these two,</hi> which in the thing commanded, <hi>LOVE,</hi> are but one, <hi>hang all the Law</hi> (of the ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>viz.</hi> which meddle not with our Duty towards our selves, but only towards God and our Neighbour) <hi>and the Prophets,</hi> Matth. 22.37, 38, 39, 40. And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> speaks home to the same purpose: <hi>By love,</hi> says he, <hi>serve one another; for all the LAW is fulfilled in one word, even this, Thou shalt LOVE thy Neighbour as thy self,</hi> Gal. 5.13, 14. And speaking again of the Laws concerning our Neighbour, he tells us that <hi>LOVE worketh no ill to his Neighbour,</hi> and <hi>therefore Love is the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> Rom. 13.10.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>rare</hi> and <hi>heavenly</hi> a <hi>Religion</hi> is that of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ: a <hi>Religion</hi> that is not content to have only <hi>great</hi> and <hi>eminent measures of goodness</hi> in it, but is <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly made up</hi> of <hi>LOVE</hi> and <hi>good Nature.</hi> All that it requires from us is only to be <hi>kind-hearted,</hi> and full of good Offices both towards <hi>God</hi> and <hi>men.</hi> Every man of a <hi>loving good nature</hi> is enclined by his <hi>temper</hi> to do all that is demanded by <hi>Gods Law</hi>; so that he has nothing remaining to turn his <hi>temper</hi> into <hi>obedience,</hi> but
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:66440:70"/>
to <hi>direct</hi> his <hi>intention,</hi> and to exert all the effects of love for the sake of Gods Command, which he is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise strongly excited to by the natural propensions of his own mind. His passion and his God require the same service, and that which is only a natural fruit of the first, may become, if he so design it, a piece of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Obedience to the latter. For the particular effects of <hi>Love,</hi> are the particulars of our <hi>Duty. Love</hi> is the great and <hi>general Law,</hi> as <hi>ill-will</hi> and enmity are the <hi>prime transgression</hi>: and the instances of Love are the instances of our obedience, as all the particular effects of ill-will are those very instances wherein we disobey. So that by running over all the special effects of love or ill-will, we may quickly find what are the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of Duty and Transgression.</p>
               <p>Now the prime and most immediate Effects of <hi>Love</hi> are,
<list>
                     <item>1. To do no <hi>evil</hi> to the persons beloved, nor to take away from them any thing which is theirs, and which they have a right to. And this founds all the Duties of <hi>Justice.</hi> But</item>
                     <item>2. To do all <hi>good offices</hi> and show <hi>kindness</hi> to them, which founds all the Duties of <hi>Charity.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>And these two take in our whole Duty, both in <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety</hi> towards God, and also in <hi>Righteousness</hi> towards men.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The proper and genuine effect of <hi>love to God</hi> is to do <hi>no evil,</hi> but in great readiness to do <hi>all the good</hi> and service which we can for him: in which two are implied all the branches of <hi>piety,</hi> which is the great and general Duty towards him.</p>
               <p>To be <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>serviceable</hi> to God is nothing more than to <hi>honour</hi> him. For his Nature is so perfect and self-sufficient that it cannot receive; and ours so impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and poor that we cannot give any thing else but
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:66440:70"/>
honour to him. As on the other side, to do <hi>evil</hi> to him is only to <hi>dishonour</hi> him. For he is out of our power as for any other injury, and there is no way possible left for us to reach him, but only by our contumeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous usage and disrespect of him.</p>
               <p>To do no <hi>evil,</hi> I say, but to be <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>serviceable</hi> to God, is nothing more but to <hi>honour</hi> him. It implies our having in our <hi>minds honourable opinions</hi> of him, and expressing in our <hi>carriage</hi> and <hi>behaviour</hi> a <hi>respect</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment</hi> of those <hi>glorious Attributes</hi> and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are in him. The former, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>high opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> of his <hi>Excellencies,</hi> those particularly which are instances of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> in our <hi>minds,</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Honour.</hi> The latter, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>expressions</hi> of this honourable opinion and acknowledgment in our <hi>thoughts, words</hi> or <hi>actions,</hi> is called <hi>worship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this <hi>worship</hi> is an acknowledgment either,

which we receive proceed from him; which is <hi>thankfulness.</hi>
                     </item>

                     </item>
                     <item>5. Of his <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>Authority.</hi>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. In <hi>acquiescing in his Disposals,</hi> as being most wise and most authentick; which is <hi>submission</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signedness.</hi>

               <p>These are those particular effects which flow from our <hi>love of God,</hi> and which make up that part of Duty which he requires from us towards <hi>himself.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Now God, as I said, being out of our reach as to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny possible way of being injured by us or suffering evil from us, otherwise than by our <hi>vilifying</hi> him, and les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sening of his <hi>honour:</hi> the prime effect of our hatred of him can be no other than our <hi>dishonouring</hi> him.

               </p>
               <p>All these Particulars of <hi>Justice</hi> now mentioned, are natural effects of <hi>love to our Neighbour,</hi> in as much as it makes us keep off from offering any <hi>injury</hi> or doing any <hi>evil</hi> to him. Upon which account S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> says of it, that as for these particular Laws of <hi>Justice,</hi> it <hi>fulfils</hi> them <hi>all.</hi> Which he shows by an induction of such Particulars as I have named. <hi>He that loveth another,</hi> saith he, <hi>hath fulfilled the Law, viz.</hi> that part of it which requires Duties of Justice towards others. <hi>For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not bear false witness, thou shalt not covet</hi>; which are the five last Commandments of the Decalogue: <hi>and if there be any other Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:66440:74"/>
it is briefly comprehended in this</hi> Saying, <hi>Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self.</hi> Now <hi>Love worketh no ill,</hi> neither these nor any other, <hi>to his Neighbour; therefore Love is the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> Rom. 13.8, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, 10.</p>
               <p>And as this first effect of Love to our Neighbour, <hi>viz. its keeping us back from offering any injury or doing any evil to him,</hi> contain in it all the Laws of <hi>Justice</hi>: so doth its other effect, <hi>our doing all good offices, and shewing kindness to them,</hi> comprehend in it all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Laws of Charity wherewith we stand obliged to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards other men.</p>
               <p>Love is not only <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>harmless,</hi> and careful to create no trouble, nor occasion any prejudice; but moreover it is all <hi>kindness, benevolence</hi> and <hi>good nature,</hi> and <hi>diligent</hi> in creating all the <hi>pleasure</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> it can to its <hi>beloved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this <hi>goodness, kind-heartedness,</hi> or <hi>desire to please and delight others,</hi> will be an <hi>universal</hi> cause of <hi>benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence</hi> or doing good to them, and make us cast to please them in so many ways, and advantage them in so many relations, as we can at any time be placed in. In <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> it will effect these Vertues in the <hi>Cases</hi> following:</p>
               <p n="1">1. As <hi>to what we see them to be in themselves,</hi> and in this respect it produces in us,
<list>
                     <item>1. If they are <hi>worthy</hi> and <hi>vertuous,</hi> a <hi>great opinion</hi> and venerable esteem for them; which is <hi>honour.</hi>

                     <item>
                        <p n="2">2. If they have <hi>honest hearts,</hi> but yet are <hi>weak in judgment</hi> and knowledg, a <hi>compassionate sense</hi> of their weakness, and an endeavour to relieve them; which is <hi>pity</hi> and <hi>succour.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And if this <hi>weakness</hi> be instanced in <hi>judging</hi> those things to be a <hi>matter of sin,</hi> and so <hi>unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> for them to <hi>do,</hi> which no <hi>Law of God</hi> has <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden</hi>; and which therefore we, <hi>who better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand</hi> it, see plainly that we <hi>lawfully may do</hi>;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:66440:75"/>
and <hi>our practice</hi> of it <hi>before them,</hi> who, distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own skill, are swayed more by our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample than their own opinions, would draw <hi>them</hi> on to <hi>practise</hi> it too, though their own <hi>Conscience condemns</hi> it, which would be to them a <hi>sin</hi>; in this Case the way of Loves affording <hi>pity</hi> and <hi>succour,</hi> is by making us <hi>forgoe the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful practice</hi> of it at <hi>that</hi> time; which is <hi>restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Christian Liberty for our Brothers edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi>

And whilst the judgments and opinions of many good people were in <hi>these</hi> things thus <hi>weak</hi>; the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> that they might secure the <hi>innocency</hi> of their <hi>practice</hi> under their <hi>errour,</hi> and prevent their being <hi>scandalized</hi> or <hi>drawn on to do what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves condemned as evil</hi> through the <hi>authority</hi> of other mens <hi>examples,</hi> whom they looked upon as <hi>wiser Christians,</hi> are wont very much to press this part of <hi>Charity, our using of our Christian Liberty,</hi> not in all things for our own ease, but for our <hi>weak Brethrens edification.</hi> Particularly S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                           <hi>Paul</hi> is earnest in it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.</p>

               <p>Thus <hi>limited</hi> and <hi>confined</hi> was the <hi>Jewish Love</hi>; God had chosen them out of all the Nations of the World for a <hi>peculiar people,</hi> and had hedged them in from the rest of mankind by <hi>peculiar Laws</hi> and a <hi>peculiar Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And upon this they concluded, that whatsover God required of them, he did it as their <hi>political King,</hi> and as the <hi>particular Head</hi> of the Jewish Nation; and that he intended those Laws which he gave them as Rules for their behaviour towards their <hi>own Brethren,</hi> and <hi>Fellow-Subjects,</hi> not towards <hi>Strangers</hi> of Foreign Nations.</p>
               <p>But as for our <hi>Lord</hi> and Sovereign <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> he is a <hi>Governour,</hi> and has enacted all his Laws, not for the guidance of any <hi>one Nation</hi> or People, but of <hi>all the world.</hi> He told his Disciples when he sent them out to preach the Gospel, That <hi>all power was given to him both in Heaven and in Earth</hi>; and thereupon commissioned
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:66440:82"/>
them to <hi>go out,</hi> and proclaim his Laws, not to the <hi>Jews</hi> alone, but <hi>to all Nations,</hi> Matth. 28.18, 19. And by this <hi>universality</hi> of his Empire he has <hi>taken away the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition-wall which was between Jews and Gentiles, having made them both one,</hi> Ephes. 2.14. So that now there can be no further colour or pretence for a <hi>limited</hi> and restrained affection; all the World by this means being now again made <hi>one People, Fellow-subjects,</hi> and <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> and <hi>Neighbours</hi> unto one another.</p>
               <p>Whatever the <hi>Jews</hi> conceived of their Laws therefore, 'tis plain that all the Laws of <hi>Christ,</hi> which command all manner of <hi>Justice, Charity</hi> and <hi>Peaceableness,</hi> and forbid all expressions of <hi>uncharitableness, injury</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceableness</hi> towards our <hi>Neighbours,</hi> make these things <hi>due</hi> to all <hi>mankind.</hi> It is not either <hi>distance of Country,</hi> nor <hi>contrariety of interest,</hi> no nor, what is most of all presumed to exempt us from the obligation of these Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>diversity of opinion</hi> or <hi>perswasion in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> which takes away from any man his right to all that kindness and advantage from us, which all these forementioned Laws give him. But of whatsoever <hi>Country, Calling,</hi> or <hi>Religion</hi> he be, he is the <hi>Neighbour</hi> here meant, to whom all these instances of Love, which are the particular Laws of Duty, must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p>And this our Saviour has determined once for all in his Answer to the <hi>Lawyer,</hi> Luke 10. For when he put the Question to him, <hi>Who is my Neighbour,</hi> to whom the Law commands all these things to be done? <hi>ver.</hi> 29. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> answers him by a Parable, that it is every man in the World whom he may at any time have to do with, although he be never so much a <hi>Stranger,</hi> nay of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and opinion in Religion never so contrary unto his. For what <hi>Religion</hi> was ever more <hi>odious</hi> unto any one, than the <hi>Samaritan</hi> was to the <hi>Jews?</hi> So great a dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:66440:83"/>
had they of it, that when they would give a Name of the vilest ignominy and greatest hatred to <hi>Christ</hi> himself, they told him he was a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> and joined with it such a farther Character as they thought would best suit with it, <hi>his being possessed with a Devil. Say we not well,</hi> answer'd they, <hi>that thou art a Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and hast a Devil?</hi> John 8.48. But yet for all this height of enmity between the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritans,</hi> he tells the <hi>Jewish</hi> Lawyer, who demanded of him <hi>who</hi> was his <hi>Neighbour,</hi> that <hi>a</hi> Jewish <hi>man fell among Thieves, who wounded him, and left him half dead; and</hi> that <hi>a Samaritan coming by had compassion on him, and bound up his wounds, and took care of him.</hi> Hereby insinuating, That any man, though so contrary to him in Religion as these two were to one another, is the Neighbour whom the Law intends; and therefore in full answer to his Question, he bids him, <hi>Go, and do so likewise,</hi> Luke 10.30 to 38.</p>

               <p>So that the effects of <hi>ill will</hi> and <hi>hatred,</hi> or Laws <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding</hi> in this relation, are, on the Masters side, the Law against <hi>not providing maintenance for his Servant,</hi> against <hi>not catechizing or instructing him,</hi> against <hi>unequal Government,</hi> against <hi>unjustness, wantonness and rigour in commanding,</hi> against <hi>imperiousness,</hi> against <hi>immoderate threatning,</hi> against <hi>railing,</hi> against <hi>defrauding or keeping back the wages of the Hireling,</hi> against <hi>not praying for him,</hi> and <hi>imprecation</hi> or <hi>praying against him</hi>: and on the Servants side the Law against <hi>dishonour</hi> of <hi>his Master,</hi> against <hi>irreverence,</hi> against <hi>non-observance,</hi> against <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing or aggravating his Masters faults,</hi> against <hi>not vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating

               </p>
               <p>And thus we have seen what are the particular effects of love and hatred both towards <hi>all men in general,</hi> and also towards <hi>all in those several relations</hi> wherein we stand concerned with one another in the World. And in them are contained all the particular Commands and Prohibitions, which make up this third Branch of Duty, <hi>viz. righteousness,</hi> or our Duty towards our <hi>Neighbour.</hi> All that God requires of us towards other men, is only to have a <hi>hearty kindness</hi> for them, and in this manner to express it. And all that he forbids is only our <hi>hatred</hi> of them, with all the forementioned effects of it. So that in the above-named instances and effects of <hi>Love,</hi> in <hi>Justice, Charity, Peace,</hi> with those others in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations now recited, is comprized the whole of this last Member of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi>'s Division, <hi>righteousness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus at last we have seen what are all the <hi>particular</hi> instances of those three <hi>general</hi> Laws, <hi>sobriety, piety,</hi> and <hi>righteousness</hi>; wherein, if we add two or three more, is comprized the Body of our whole Duty.</p>
               <p>If we adde <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> more, I say; for besides the several Laws already mentioned, there are three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Duties yet remaining of a more <hi>positive</hi> and <hi>arbitrary</hi> nature, which Christ has bound all Christians to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve; and they are the Law of <hi>Baptism,</hi> of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> and of <hi>Repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baptism</hi> is our <hi>incorporation into the Church of Christ</hi>; or our <hi>entrance into the Gospel Covenant,</hi> or <hi>into all the duties and priviledges of Christians, by means of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ceremony of washing or sprinkling in the name of the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:66440:95"/>
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Eucharist</hi> or <hi>Lords Supper</hi> is our <hi>Federal Vow,</hi> or <hi>repetition of that engagement which we made at Baptism, of performing faith, repentance and obedience unto God; in expectation of remission of sins, eternal happiness, and those other promises which by Christ's death are procured for us upon these terms: which engagement we solemnly make to God at our eating Bread and drinking Wine, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance and commemoration of Christs dying for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repentance</hi> is a <hi>forsaking of sin,</hi> or <hi>an amendment of any evil way upon a sorrowful sense, and just apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its making us offend God, and subjecting us to the danger of death and damnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if to all the forementioned instances of those <hi>three grand</hi> Vertues, which by the Apostle, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12, 13, are made the summ of our Christian Duty, we join these <hi>three positive</hi> and <hi>additional</hi> Laws; we have all that whereby God will judge us at the last Day, even all those <hi>particular Laws</hi> whereto our obedience is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired as <hi>necessary</hi> to <hi>salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus we have seen what those particulars Laws are, which the Gospel indispensably requires us to obey. They are no other than those very instances which I have been all this while recounting and describing. But because the Catalogue of them hitherto has been broken and interrupted, and therefore cannot be run o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so easily as might be desired in a matter of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; I will here repeat them all again for the greater ease of all such pious souls as desire to try them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by them, and place them all in one view, and all together.</p>
               <p>The commanding Laws then whereby at the last Day we must all be judged, are these that follow:</p>

               </p>
               <p>To all which we may add the two <hi>arbitrary instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>positive Laws</hi> of the Gospel, <hi>Baptism,</hi> and the <hi>Eucharist</hi> or <hi>Lords Supper</hi>; and when we transgress in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the instances forementioned, that great and only remedy of Christs Religion, the Law of <hi>repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, so far as I can call to mind at present, is a just e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numeration of those particular Injunctions and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, whereto our obedience is indispensably required, and whereby at the last Day we must all be judged either to live or dye eternally.</p>
               <p>But supposing that some particular instances of Love and Duty are omitted in this Catalogue; yet need this be prejudicial to no mans happiness, since that defect will be otherwise supplied. For as for such omitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, where there is an occasion for them, and an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity offered to <hi>exercise</hi> them, mens <hi>own reason</hi> and <hi>passion</hi> will represent and suggest them for a <hi>rule of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>; and when they <hi>wilfully transgress</hi> them, their own Conscience must needs check and reprove them, which will be sufficient to them for a <hi>rule of trial.</hi> For all the Laws of this <hi>second,</hi> which is the <hi>Gospel-Covenant,</hi> are so agreeably suited to our natural reason and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that every mans own mind may be a sufficient Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor. What our own understanding tells us is fit and becoming us that we should do; that has God bound upon us by his Laws, and made it our Duty to do. His Precepts are the very same with the best results and purest dictates of our own reason; so that every pious and honest Conscience cannot but of it self ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove all that God has enjoined it. Which God himself
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:66440:97"/>
has clearly intimated, when he says of all the Laws of the <hi>second,</hi> which is the <hi>Gospel-Covenant,</hi> that he <hi>will put</hi> the <hi>Laws</hi> contained in it <hi>into their minds, and write them in their hearts</hi>; so that in regard they have them so legible within themselves, <hi>they shall not</hi> need to be still enquiring of others, and to <hi>teach every man his Neighbour, and every man his Brother, saying, Know the Lord</hi>; and that in this or that particular you must serve him; <hi>for all shall know him</hi> and his Laws without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Monitor than their own Conscience, <hi>from the least to the greatest,</hi> Heb. 8.10, 11.</p>
               <p>Besides, as for all the Laws of <hi>piety</hi> towards God, and of <hi>righteousness</hi> towards men, which make up by far the greatest part of our Duty; they are only so many several effects and various expressions of our <hi>Love</hi> to them. So that he who acts nothing against love, breaks none of all these Laws, but keeps them every one. Whereof Christ himself (who has given these Laws, and who is to judge of our obedience to them) and his Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> have given us sufficient assurance, when they both affirm of <hi>Love,</hi> that, as to these two gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of Duty, it is <hi>the fulfilling of the Law.</hi> And therefore any man that knows what <hi>Love</hi> is, may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understand what is <hi>Law</hi>; and when he is about to venture upon any action, it is but asking his own soul whether it be <hi>against Love,</hi> and he has his Answer whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no it be <hi>against Duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And since whensoever we have occasion for it, we shall be admonished of our Duty both these ways, both from our <hi>reason</hi> and our <hi>passion,</hi> though this Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue prove defective in some instances, and omit it: that defect can be of no danger, seeing it will be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise supplied. We may by its help know those Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which it mentions; and by the help of the other two, those Particulars wherein it fails us. So that we
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:66440:98"/>
shall still be sufficiently <hi>directed in our Duty,</hi> and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what we should <hi>do</hi>; and when we sin against it wilfully, our own Conscience is privy to it, which will enable us to examine also whether indeed we have <hi>done</hi> it, or no.</p>
               <p>This then may suffice for a particular enumeration of all the <hi>commanding</hi> Laws of God, whereto our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is required as an indispensable condition of our life and happiness.</p>
               <p>And as for all the <hi>forbidding</hi> Laws, which contain those things which under the highest pains of death and misery we are indispensably required to abstain from; they are these that follow:</p>
               <p>The Law against unsoberness towards our selves, with all its particulars; which are, the Law against <hi>pride,</hi> against <hi>arrogance</hi> or <hi>ostentation,</hi> against <hi>vain-glory,</hi> against <hi>ambition,</hi> against <hi>haughtiness,</hi> against <hi>insolence,</hi> against <hi>imperiousness,</hi> against <hi>dogmaticalness,</hi> against <hi>envious backbiting,</hi> against <hi>emulation,</hi> against <hi>worldliness,</hi> against <hi>intemperance,</hi> against <hi>gluttony,</hi> against <hi>voluptuousness,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>drunkenness,</hi> against <hi>revelling,</hi> against <hi>incontinence,</hi> against <hi>lasciviousness</hi> or <hi>wantonness,</hi> against <hi>filthiness,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>obscene Jestings,</hi> against <hi>impurity</hi> or <hi>uncleanness,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>sodomy,</hi> against <hi>effeminateness,</hi> against <hi>adultery,</hi> against <hi>fornication,</hi> against <hi>whoredom,</hi> against <hi>incest,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>rape,</hi> against <hi>covetousness,</hi> against <hi>grudging</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining,</hi> against <hi>refusing</hi> or <hi>being scandaled at the Cross,</hi> against <hi>idleness</hi> and <hi>carelesness,</hi> against <hi>fearfulness</hi> and <hi>softness,</hi> against <hi>self-love,</hi> against <hi>carnality,</hi> against <hi>sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. V. Of the Sanction of the foregoing Laws.</head>

                  <head>The CONTENTS. </head>
                  <p>Of the Sanction of all the forementioned particular Laws. That they are bound upon us by our hopes of Heaven, and our fears of Hell. Of the Sanction of all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular affirmative or commanding Laws.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOW it is upon our obedience of all those Laws which are mentioned in the foregoing Chapters, that all our well-grounded hope of pardon, and a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Sentence at the last Day depends. They are that Rule which God has fixt for the Proceedings at that Judgment whereby all of us will be doomed to live or dye eternally. There is not any one of them left naked
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:66440:100"/>
and unguarded for men to transgress at pleasure, and yet to go unpunished: but the performance of every one is made necessary unto life, and the unrepented transgression of it threatned with eternal damnation.</p>
               <p>And that it is so is plain from this, because almost the whole Body of them, <hi>viz.</hi> all those which are implyed in <hi>piety towards God,</hi> and in <hi>Justice, Charity</hi> and <hi>peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness towards men,</hi> are nothing else but instances and effects of <hi>Love,</hi> which is plainly <hi>necessary,</hi> and that in the <hi>greatest latitude.</hi> For the words of the Command are as comprehensive as can be. That thou mayest <hi>inherit eternal life, thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind</hi>; which plainly take in our whole affection towards God, and every part and expression of it: <hi>and</hi> thou shalt love <hi>thy Neighbour as thy self,</hi> which again implies all instances of love towards other men, seeing towards our own selves not any one is wanting: <hi>This do, and thou shalt live,</hi> Luke 10.25, 27, 28. So that in shewing of them all that they are <hi>natural effects</hi> of an <hi>universal love,</hi> I have shewn withal that they are <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary means</hi> of <hi>life</hi> and <hi>conditions</hi> of <hi>salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a plain mark, whereby it is obvious and easie for us all to understand what Laws are necessary terms of life. For every mans heart can inform him what are the <hi>natural effects of love,</hi> they being such things as the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est reason may discern, nay such as every mans affection will suggest to him. And because they are so, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles themselves when they set down Catalogues of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable Laws, never descend to reckon up all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: but having plainly declared the absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of an <hi>ample</hi> and <hi>universal love</hi> in the <hi>general,</hi> they content themselves with naming some few instances of it, and leave the rest, which are like unto them, to be suggested to us by our own minds. And the same
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:66440:101"/>
course they take in recounting those sins which are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to them, and which, without repentance, will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly destroy us. Thus, for instance, in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi>'s Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of damning sins, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. he doth not trouble himself to name all particulars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but having mentioned <hi>several</hi> of them he concludes with this <hi>general</hi> intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the rest — <hi>and such like,</hi> vers. 21.</p>
               <p>This way then of shewing the necessity of all the forementioned Laws, by shewing expresly that Love in the general is plainly necessary, and leaving it to mens own minds to collect of them all severally that they are natural effects of it; is sufficient in it self, and such as the Apostles of our Lord are wont to take up with: But because our belief of the necessity of our obedience in all the preceding particulars is of so great moment, and it is so infinitely our concern to be fixt and settled in it; I will here set down such express de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of it in every one of them as are to be met with in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>And to begin with the several <hi>Classes</hi> of them in the same order wherein they are laid down; for <hi>sobriety,</hi> and all the particular Laws comprehended under it, we have their sanction set down, and the necessity of our obedience to them to our life and pardon expressed in the following Scriptures.</p>
               <p>For the Law of <hi>humility</hi> and <hi>lowliness</hi> of mind, take these:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Put on as</hi> necessary qualifications of <hi>the elect of God, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and beloved,</hi>

                     <hi>Humility.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>humbleness of mind,</hi> Col. 3.12. It is this poverty and lowliness of Spirit which must prepare us for eternal happiness. <hi>Blessed are the poor in Spirit,</hi> Matth. 5.3. For, as our Saviour says, 'tis by <hi>learning of him who is meek and lowly that we shall find</hi> both here and hereafter <hi>rest to our souls,</hi> Matth. 11.29.</p>
               <p>And for all the rest, their Sanction is expressed in these ensuing places.</p>

And for the fuller proof of the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of this Sacrament, that is very remarkable, which, as some have observed, the Jewish Doctors have taken notice of, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>whereas God forbad</hi> twenty three things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>pain</hi> of <hi>being cut off from the people</hi> to them who <hi>committed</hi> them; yet in the whole <hi>Old Testament</hi> there are but <hi>two</hi> things <hi>commanded</hi> under <hi>that penalty</hi> to those who should <hi>neglect</hi> them; and they are <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> and the <hi>Passover,</hi> which are <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> of, and answer to our two Sacraments, <hi>Baptism</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> And for that necessity particularly of the <hi>Passover</hi> among the Jews, which answers to the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist</hi> among us Christians, where, as the Apostle says, <hi>Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. we have a plain Text at the institution of it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. <hi>Whosoever,</hi> in the Feast of the Passover, <hi>eateth leavened Bread from the first Day to the eleventh Day; that soul shall be cut off from Israel,</hi> ver. 15.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. Of the Sanction of all the forbidding Laws.</head>
               <argument>
                  <head>The CONTENTS. </head>
                  <p>Of the Sanction of all the negative or forbidding Laws par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly. The perfection of the Christian Law. How our Duty exceeds that of the Heathens under the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of Nature. And that of the Jews under the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional light of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS for all the Vices opposite to the several Vertues in the foregoing <hi>Chapter,</hi> which are the number of the <hi>negative</hi> or <hi>forbidding</hi> Laws; they must needs be under the same sanction, and our observance of them be bound upon us by the same necessity with our obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the former. For whatsoever any of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Laws <hi>commanding</hi> any <hi>Vertues</hi> threaten, they denounce against these opposite <hi>Vices,</hi> which are the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral transgressions of them. So that in shewing the <hi>severe sanction</hi> and necessity of the <hi>one,</hi> I have shown it sufficiently of the <hi>other</hi> also.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:66440:111"/>And this might very well excuse me all further trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in searching after an express sanction of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular forbidding Law.</p>
               <p>But on the other side I consider, that men are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely concerned to be fully convinced of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar necessity of abstaining from every Vice, as well as of performing every Vertue And that there is much more force to work this full Conviction in an express and particular proof, than there can be in a general and implicite intimation. And because I would shun no pains which may be likely to quicken the obedience, or secure the interests even of any one soul; I will not leave it to mens selves to collect and inferr this necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, although the meanest capacities may do it without any great difficulty, but proceed still to set down such sanctions of all the particular <hi>forbidding</hi> Laws, as I meet with in the Scriptures.</p>

               <p>Thus is our observation of these particular prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons plainly necessary unto life, and indispensably requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to mercy and salvation. And as for that small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of them which are not expresly insisted on in this proof, their necessity is sufficiently evidenced by the indispensableness of the opposite Commands, which in the proof of the <hi>affirmative</hi> Laws is shown expresly.</p>
               <p>As to all the particular Laws then recited in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Catalogues, whether they be <hi>affirmative</hi> or <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:66440:118"/>
Commands</hi> or <hi>Prohibitions</hi>; 'tis plain that they are all bound upon us by the severest sanction, no less than our <hi>fears of Hell</hi> and <hi>hopes of Heaven.</hi> They are the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aequate and compleat matter of that <hi>obedience</hi> which is to secure for us a happy Sentence. At the last Day we must all stand or fall by them; where they promise, God will bestow rewards; but if they threaten, he will eternally condemn us.</p>
               <p>And thus at length it plainly appears what those <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Laws</hi> are, which under the sanctions of Life or Death the Gospel indispensably binds us to obey. And upon the whole we see, That when we become Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans we are not turned loose and set at liberty to do what we list; but are put under a most strict Rule, and bound up by a most exalted purity, and a most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and perfect love. The height of our Duty is answerable to the greatness of our Priviledges and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; For as never any people had so much <note n="f" place="margin">Luke 12.48.</note> Grace given to them as we Christians have by the Gospel, so never was there of any so much Duty required.</p>
               <p>The poor <hi>Heathens,</hi> who knew nothing more, either of Gods Laws, or of his rewards and encouragements, than they could argue themselves into a belief of by the strength of their own wit and reason; knew nothing of, nor shall at the last Day be condemned for the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of several of those Commands which we shall dye for.

               <p>And since not only the poor and <hi>ignorant,</hi> but even the more <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>learned</hi> sort of Heathens were thus void of knowledge in the simplicity of their hearts, and did not discern several of those to be Laws of God, which every one of us may discern most clearly if we will: although we must stand or fall by them, yet they shall not; but when they are brought to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they shall go unpunished for their transgressions of them, because they did not know them. They shall not be condemned for acting against they knew not what, nor suffer for the breach of such Laws as were not sufficiently published and proclaimed to them. <hi>They that sinned without</hi> our <hi>Law, shall also perish,</hi> not by it, but <hi>without</hi> our <hi>Law,</hi> according to the Sentence of such other Laws as are, not ours but, their own; <hi>and</hi> it is only <hi>as many as have sinned in</hi> or under our <hi>Law, that shall be judged</hi> and condemned <hi>by the Law,</hi> Rom. 2.12.

               <p>These, and all the other instances set down in the foregoing Catalogues, which are too many to mention here, let us plainly see the height of that holiness, and the perfection of that love which we are to live or dye by. Our Law is the most perfect Rule that ever the World heard of; and, as ever we hope for mercy and bliss, ours is to be the most perfect obedience. For as all these Laws, which under the pains of Death we are bound to obey, are most Heavenly and Divine; so is that a most perfect obedience which is indispensably required to them.

               <p>But for a man to be <hi>sincere</hi> in Gods service, is the same as <hi>really to intend that obedience which he professes.</hi> It is inwardly and truly to will and do that for his sake, which in outward shew and appearance we would be thought to do. It is nothing else, as the Psalmist says, but <hi>truth in the inward parts,</hi> Psal. 51.6; the having our inward design and intention to agree with our outward profession; and being verily and indeed those obedient persons which we pretend to be.</p>
               <p>And as for this sincerity of our performance of what God requires, <hi>viz. our doing it for his sake, and because he commands it:</hi> it is altogether necessary to make such <hi>performance</hi> become <hi>obedience,</hi> and to qualifie us for the rewards of those that obey.

had no share in what we did, because it had been done although he had said nothing; so that in our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it we served not him, but our own selves. And what has God to thank us for, if we do nothing but our own pleasure? Wherein do we serve him, by act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only according to our own liking? That cannot be charged on him which is not designed for him; and if we do what he commands no otherwise than thus, it is all one as if we had done nothing.</p>
               <p>But if ever we expect that God should judge us at the last Day to have obeyed him, we must be <hi>sincere</hi> in our obedient performances. For <hi>the Lord looketh not on the</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 2.28, 29.</note> 
                  <hi>outward appearance</hi> and pretence, saith <hi>Samuel, but he looks on the</hi> inward intention and design, which is the <hi>heart,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7. <hi>He saves,</hi> as the Psalmist tells us, <hi>the upright in heart, Psal.</hi> 7.10. And again, <hi>As for the upright in heart, they,</hi> and they alone, <hi>shall glory, Psal.</hi> 64.10. For it is not from the bare outward appearance and profession, but <hi>from the heart,</hi> says <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> that proceed <hi>the issues of life, Prov.</hi> 4.23. And this is plainly declared in the express words of the Law it self. For it accepts not a heartless service, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it self <hi>obeyed</hi> by what was never <hi>intended</hi> for it. But thus it bespeaks us: <hi>The Lord thy God requires thee to serve him with all thy</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Matth. 22.36, 37, 38.</note> 
                  <hi>heart, and with all thy soul. For he is a great God, a mighty and a terrible</hi> to all that do otherwise, <hi>and who</hi> in his Judgement <hi>regardeth not persons, nor</hi> to corrupt him <hi>taketh rewards,</hi> Deut. 10.12, 17. And the Apostle tells the Philippians, that their <hi>being sincere</hi> is the way <hi>to be without offence till the Day of Christ,</hi> Phil. 1.10.</p>
               <p>And thus we see, that to render our obedience acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable at the last Day, it is absolutely necessary that it be sincere and unfeigned. We must do what Gods Laws prescribe, not only because our own credit or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:66440:123"/>
sometimes requires it, but because God has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it. In all our obedient performances our heart and design must go along with him, before ever he will recompence and reward us.</p>
               <p>So that 'tis plain we cannot obey God, either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our will and intention, or without them; seeing our wills and intentions themselves are the very life and soul of our obedience. The prime part of our Duty consists in the directing of our Design: for even that which is done agreeably to Gods Command must be aimed and intended for him, or else it will never be owned and approved by him.</p>
               <p>But that we may the better judge of this <hi>sincerity</hi> of our service which is measured by our <hi>intention</hi> and design; we must take notice of a two-fold intention. For it is either,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Actual</hi> and <hi>express.</hi> Or,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Habitual</hi> and <hi>implicite.</hi> Now it is this <hi>latter</hi> which is always and indispensably required to the sincerity of our service; but as for the <hi>former,</hi> it is not always ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, though oftentimes it be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Intention</hi> is the <hi>tendency of the soul towards some end which it likes, and which it thinks to compass and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after.</hi> And this is one prime requisite in the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, and that which distinguisheth our operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the actions of brute Beasts; for what they do, proceeds from the necessary force of <hi>uncontriving Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>instinct</hi>; but what we, from <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the cause of this difference is this, Because God has given the <hi>brute Beasts</hi> no higher Guide and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of their actions, than <hi>appetite</hi> and <hi>passion,</hi> whose motions are not <hi>chosen</hi> with freedom, and raised in them by <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>thought</hi>; but merely by the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitating force</hi> of <hi>outward objects</hi> themselves, and those
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:66440:124"/>
impressions which they make upon them. For they act altogether through <hi>love</hi> and <hi>hatred, hopes</hi> and <hi>fears</hi>; and they <hi>love</hi> and <hi>hate,</hi> not through <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>discourse,</hi> but through the <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>mechanical suitableness</hi> or <hi>offensiveness</hi> of those objects which they act for.</p>
               <p>But as for us <hi>men,</hi> he has put all our actions under the power and in the disposal, not of <hi>outward things,</hi> but of something within us, even our own <hi>free will.</hi> They are not imposed upon us by the force of any thing without us, but are freely chosen by us; we are not their Instruments, but their Authours; they flow from our own pleasure and undetermined choice.</p>
               <p>Now as our actions are at the disposal and command of our wills; so do our wills themselves command and dispose of them, not <hi>blindly</hi> and by <hi>chance,</hi> but always for some <hi>reason,</hi> and upon some <hi>design.</hi> For in <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> they are <hi>indifferent,</hi> to make us either <hi>omit</hi> or <hi>act, neglect</hi> or <hi>exert</hi> them. And therefore to determine our wills one way rather than the other, to act them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to let them alone, they must be moved and perswaded by such Arguments as are fit to win upon them. Now that which can move and gain upon our wills, is only <hi>goodness.</hi> We will and desire nothing but what we think is <hi>good</hi> for us, and which tends some way or other to better and advantage us. For what we believe is <hi>insignificant</hi> and <hi>useless,</hi> we <hi>contemn</hi>; and what is <hi>hurtful</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> from the first Principle of our Natures, <hi>self-love,</hi> we straightway entertain with <hi>hatred</hi> and <hi>avoidance,</hi> but never with <hi>love</hi> and <hi>good will.</hi> So that whensoever we will and chuse to act, rather than to sit still; it is always for some <hi>end</hi> which we propose to our selves, and by reason of some <hi>good</hi> or other which we expect to get by it. For no man will be at pains for nothing, or labour without aiming at any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence; but some <hi>end</hi> or <hi>goodness</hi> there must still
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:66440:124"/>
be, which is to move our wills, and make them choose <hi>rather</hi> to act, than to sit idle. All our Actions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are only as <hi>means,</hi> and there is alwayes some <hi>end</hi> or other of them which we propose to our selves to reap from them; something which we like, and which we think they tend to, that makes us employ our Powers in the production of them. And this <hi>eying</hi> or <hi>aiming</hi> at the <hi>End</hi> or <hi>Motive</hi> whereunto we see our Action <hi>tends,</hi> and for the <hi>sake whereof</hi> we <hi>set about it,</hi> is our <hi>Intention</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>Thus we see that all our Actions agree in this, that they are chosen for the sake of some end, and exerted upon some intention and design.</p>
               <p>But in the <hi>manner</hi> of this Intention there is some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: For sometimes in acting we actually and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly think of, and look up to that End or Good which we are moved by, and act for, and operate in direct order, and respect to it; which is an <hi>actual</hi> and <hi>express intention.</hi> But at other times we do not look expresly further than the act it self; but through a setled Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before made, and, as to its full force in determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our Wills towards that Good which we act for, yet continuing; we readily do what tends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, without ever expresly eying or designing of it. Our former Intention was so full and so effectual, that it has determined our choice of the action so far, as that our Wills need nothing more to make them command that it be done, than to be offer'd the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of doing it. They are sufficiently moved by the <hi>End</hi> for which the Action is to be undertaken, and their <hi>constant temper</hi> and <hi>inclination</hi> is to bend after it. So that when a particular Action occurs, which is to be chosen for the sake of it, they need not <hi>actually</hi> to think of it, and look up to it; but are sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to act in order to it, through their <hi>habitual ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:66440:125"/>
and propension towards it. And this being no <hi>express intuition,</hi> and <hi>particular designing</hi> of the end which we act for, but only a <hi>setled tendency</hi> and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the soul after it, which through long <hi>use</hi> and <hi>custome</hi> is become its <hi>constant temper</hi> and <hi>habitual</hi>; it may be called an <hi>habitual,</hi> or <hi>implicit intention.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now both these sorts of Intention have their place, as in all our <hi>other Actions,</hi> so particularly in those of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi> For sometimes our performances of those things which God requires are <hi>studied</hi> and <hi>delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>; we pause at them before we exert them, and think and perswade our selves into the production of them. And in regard the <hi>great motive</hi> or <hi>end</hi> of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting them, <hi>(viz.) Gods command and injunction of them,</hi> is the <hi>great Argument</hi> to win us over to them; when we take time and ponder so, we act through a <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>express intention.</hi> But then at other times we do what God enjoyns before we are <hi>aware</hi>; we need not deliberate about it, or argue our selves into the practice of it; but stand ready to perform it as soon as opportunity is offered. And here the will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already inclined of it self to exert the action, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God has commanded it, it needs no arguments to move, nor any express intuition of the end to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade it, but indeliberately chooses to obey out of its own <hi>habitual temper,</hi> and <hi>implicit intention.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for the <hi>cause</hi> of this difference of our <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in doing those things which God commands; it is plainly the <hi>different degrees and perfection of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> For when our Virtue and Obedience are of <hi>small strength,</hi> and in an <hi>imperfect degree</hi>; there our <hi>Lusts</hi> have a considerable <hi>Power</hi> with us, as well as our <hi>Religion</hi>; and although they have not force enough eventually to hinder, yet they have so much as will suffice them to contend with, and to oppose the doing
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:66440:125"/>
of our duty: So that even when we do obey in <hi>this state,</hi> and close with Gods command, it is by a <hi>strife</hi> and a <hi>war,</hi> by <hi>conflict</hi> and <hi>victory.</hi> Now here our wills are in doubt what way they shall determine their choice, for they are canvassed and beset on both sides, both by <hi>God</hi> and by our own <hi>Flesh,</hi> by our <hi>Duty</hi> and our <hi>Appetites.</hi> And to enable <hi>Religion</hi> to prevail with them in this conflict above our <hi>Passions,</hi> there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of representing all its force, and of setting all its motives before them, that thereby they may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to strike in with it, and to choose what it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth. But now as for the main <hi>end</hi> and <hi>motive</hi> of all our <hi>Religious Services,</hi> it is <hi>Gods having injoyned and commanded them.</hi> It is for <hi>his sake,</hi> that we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them; that we may <hi>endear our selves to him</hi> by <hi>doing of his pleasure.</hi> So that to enable us to choose obedience to Gods Laws, rather than to our own Lusts, we must set him and his command before us. They are the end for which we are to work, the motive and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that must bear us out, and make us effectually willing to do what we are required. In this state then of <hi>strong lusts</hi> and <hi>imperfect obedience,</hi> to enable us to choose to do what God injoyns, when our own Lusts do powerfully incline us to do the contrary; we have need of an actual thought and intuition of God and his command, which is the great end and motive that must determine us for him, and bear down all that opposition which our Lusts make against him: So that all the obedience which we perform here, is through a <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>express intention.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then on the other side, when our Virtue and Obedience is of full growth, and we are so accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do what God requires, that now we find no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance or opposition to it, but use has made it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, not so much our <hi>considerate choice,</hi> as our <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:66440:126"/>
and <hi>indeliberate performance</hi>; here our wills are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of themselves to embrace the instance wherein we are to obey as soon as it is offered: We need not to consider and think our selves into a choice and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of that which is commanded; for our natural bent and habitual tendency is towards it, and nothing more is wanting to our performance of it, than our being shew'd it. The Action of Obedience is chosen before it is offered, and all our Principles of working stand ready and prepared for it. For the intention of serving God is confirmed without all reserve; and the decree of our wills is past already to perform what we have intended; so that as soon as ever an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for obedience is presented, we have nothing left to deliberate and consider of, but without all doubtings or delay go on to work and practise it. And all this, as I said, is a genuine and direct effect of our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence having acquired <hi>great degrees of strength,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming <hi>customary</hi> and <hi>habitual.</hi> For <hi>Custome,</hi> as it is truly said, is a <hi>second Nature</hi>; such things as have been long <hi>used by us,</hi> stick as close to us, and flow as <hi>easily,</hi> as <hi>quickly,</hi> as <hi>indeliberately</hi> and <hi>naturally</hi> from us, as those things that are <hi>born with us.</hi> They do not stay for our particular contrivance and designation of them, but run before it. A man by long custome shall have his fingers move so fast upon a <hi>Lute,</hi> that thought it self shall not be able to keep time with them, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer every stop with a particular intention and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of it. An <hi>habitual Swearer,</hi> when occasion is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, or without any, will rap out Oaths when he is not aware; and so little many times was there of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual contrivance and express design in it, that when he hath done he doth not know it. And the case is the same in other <hi>habitual sinners,</hi> whose transgressions, proceeding not so much from a particular and express
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:66440:126"/>
choice, as from an habitual temper, and even natural inclination, are unconsidered and indeliberate. And therefore when our Obedience it self is become custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, and use has wrought it into our very Nature; we have no need, upon every return of opportunity, to eye Gods command which is the <hi>end,</hi> and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his service as a motive to our wills, to engage them to choose the Action before us which tends to it. We stay not to bethink our selves what it tends to, and who is to be served by it, and after that to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend expresly to serve him in it. No, all these were done to our hands before the time of obeying came, so that now when we have the opportunity, we do not busie our selves in exciting them, but in this habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual state of things, and perfection of obedience, act ordinarily in the force of them, which is obeying through an <hi>habitual</hi> and <hi>implicite intention.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now from what has been said of this <hi>Perfection, and customariness of our obedience,</hi> being the cause of our obeying only through an <hi>habitual intention</hi>; it plainly appears, that not the <hi>actual,</hi> but <hi>habitual</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of serving God, is that which is <hi>alwayes,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensably</hi> required to a <hi>sincere</hi> service of him. Indeed when we <hi>pause,</hi> and <hi>deliberate,</hi> and take several things into our <hi>consideration,</hi> a <hi>particular intention</hi> of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is necessary to make what we do upon such deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration an <hi>acceptable obedience:</hi> For if in the delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration our choice was doubtfull as to the <hi>event</hi>; such particularity of intention was necessary to make us choose the <hi>Action</hi> of obedience; and if it were doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as to the <hi>motive,</hi> when other things <hi>sufficient</hi> to make us act as we did, (as the service of our <hi>Lusts</hi> or <hi>Interests</hi>) concurr'd to it as well as <hi>Gods Command</hi>; then is it necessary to make us choose the <hi>acceptable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> of obedience. But for that intention, I say, which
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:66440:127"/>
is not only here in <hi>this</hi> case, or some <hi>others,</hi> but <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally,</hi> and in <hi>all,</hi> indispensably necessary to the <hi>since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of our obedience, it is an <hi>habitual intention.</hi> For the very reason why we do not intend his service <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly</hi> and <hi>expresly,</hi> but only <hi>habitually</hi> and <hi>implicite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> is because our obedience has arrived to good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and long use and custome has made it, not so much at every turn our considerate choice and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, as our unstudied inclination and very nature. Now this exaltation of <hi>Obedience</hi> into a natural <hi>temper</hi> is so far from rendring it <hi>unsincere,</hi> and making God look upon it as none at all; that in very deed it is the height and perfection of that which his Gospel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to aspire and aim at. For there our Duty is expressed by our <hi>being</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Joh. 3.3.</note> 
                  <hi>born again,</hi> by our becoming <note n="g" place="margin">Ephes. 4.24. Coloss. 3.10.</note>

               <p>So that in measuring the sincerity of our Obedience by the reality of our intention and design for Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, we see that we are not alwayes to exact of our selves a particular and express intention, because God requires it not; but may, and often must, when our Obedience becomes natural and habitual, take up with an intention that is so too.</p>
               <p>But for the fuller understanding of this condition of our Obedience, <hi>Sincerity,</hi> we must consider, not only the <hi>reality</hi> and <hi>undissembledness</hi> of our service and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, which have been discoursed of hitherto, but their <hi>uncorruptness,</hi> and <hi>unmixedness</hi> likewise.

                  <hi>Purity</hi> also, in opposition to <hi>mixture</hi> and <hi>alloy.</hi> And thus we read of the <hi>sincere milk of the Word, (i. e.)</hi> the pure and unmixed parts of it, or the Christian Doctrine as freed from all adulterate mixtures of <hi>Gnostick Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities</hi> and <hi>Jewish Observances,</hi> which were those compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, wherewith in the Apostles times so many went about to corrupt the Word of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2.</p>
               <p>So that to serve God <hi>sincerely</hi> in this sence, is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what he commands us <hi>for his sake,</hi> and with a <hi>design to please him,</hi> without mixing therewith any <hi>by-ends</hi> of our own, or <hi>intending</hi> our own <hi>self interests</hi> together with him.</p>
               <p>But this we are to understand with much restriction. For it is not all intention of <hi>Pleasure, Profit,</hi> or other <hi>Interest to our selves</hi> in the performance of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands which he has forbidden us: We may design to advantage our selves by our Obedience, and be sincere still; provided that this design be only upon those <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> and <hi>eternal advantages which God himself promises</hi> to the obedient; or upon <hi>temporal ones</hi> so far as they <hi>minister</hi> to Obedience, and are <hi>subordinate</hi> under it. But that <hi>mixture of intention</hi> only is <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>unsin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,</hi> when together with our intention of <hi>serving God,</hi> we joyn another intention of <hi>serving sin,</hi> or when we design some <hi>temporal ends</hi> as <hi>much,</hi> or <hi>more</hi> than we do <hi>Gods service,</hi> which makes our <hi>self interest,</hi> instead of being <hi>subservient</hi> to Obedience, to become fit to <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> and <hi>undermine</hi> it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> I say, <hi>God has not forbidden us all intention of our own advantage in the performance of his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> When he requires us to obey him, he doth not prohibit all Love of our own selves, and regard to our own self interests; which will appear from all these Reasons, both because <hi>some eye at our own good,</hi>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:66440:128"/>
and respect to our own advantage is of that <hi>nature that it cannot be forbidden us</hi>; because <hi>Gods Laws themselves have offered and proposed it to us</hi>; because <hi>the necessity of our faith to our obedience shews plainly that it cannot be denied us</hi>; and because <hi>the best men that ever were have not been able to obey without it, and yet their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience has been most graciously accepted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Some respect to our own good, and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to advantage our selves by our obedience is of <hi>that nature that it cannot be forbidden us.</hi> It cannot fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Law, or be a matter of a Commandment, because it can never be performed.</p>
               <p>As for any <hi>one particular</hi> advantage, and self-interest indeed, we may deny our selves in it, and therefore any Law may very well require it. For we have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular self-interests to serve, and they clash and interfere among themselves; and so long as we are in pursuit of any one, by virtue of it we are able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain and deny our selves in any other. And thus <hi>all men</hi> daily deny their <hi>Ease</hi> for their <hi>Interests,</hi> and their <hi>Gain</hi> for their <hi>Liberty,</hi> and their <hi>Liberty</hi> for their <hi>Lives.</hi> And <hi>all good men</hi> daily over-rule that Love which they have for their <hi>Bodies,</hi> by that higher and stronger love which they have for their <hi>Souls,</hi> and deny themselves in any <hi>Temporal</hi> Interests, to secure their <hi>Eternal.</hi> And because all men have this power of denying their own Self-love in small instances, to serve it in greater, and of parting with any goods and advantages of this world, to purchase to themselves incomparably better in the next; God has enacted the <hi>denial of our selves, in all such particular Interests as hinder our Obedience</hi> into a Religious Duty, and made it universally obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to all the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:66440:128"/>But as for the casting off this <hi>love of our selves,</hi> and <hi>respect to our own advantage,</hi> not only as to some <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> interests, whilst our eye is upon others, but as to <hi>all</hi> self-interests <hi>whatsoever</hi>; this in the matter of <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> no <hi>man</hi> can <hi>perform,</hi> and therefore no <hi>Law</hi> can <hi>command</hi> it. For in that Constitution of Nature, which God has given us, <hi>self-love</hi> is the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>over-ruling Principle.</hi> It has a share <hi>almost in all our actions,</hi> and influences <hi>all our faculties</hi>; so that in all that variety of operations which flow from us, there are very few wherein we have no eye at our own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p>In some actions, 'tis true, we are influenced chiefly, and <hi>almost</hi> wholly by our <hi>love of others,</hi> which is a <hi>noble</hi> and a <hi>generous Principle.</hi> For there are several good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices which we daily do to others, in doing whereof we no way prejudice our selves; and these our <hi>love of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> makes us perform, and our own <hi>self-love</hi> doth not withstand it; which is seen in all the Offices of <hi>humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>common courtesie.</hi> And other things again there are wherein we advantage them, though it be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to our own trouble, and our own hindrance: and here, although our own <hi>self-love oppose</hi> it self, yet our <hi>love of them prevails</hi> and <hi>over-rules</hi> it; as is daily shown in the Offices of <hi>Christian Charity</hi> and <hi>particular friendship.</hi> In these Cases our <hi>love of others</hi> and <hi>of our selves</hi> are <hi>separate</hi>; our <hi>kindness for them</hi> shews it self in such things, wherein our <hi>own self-love</hi> is either <hi>not concerned at all,</hi> or wherein it is <hi>opposed</hi> and <hi>over-power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> so that here we are <hi>not influenced</hi> and <hi>governed</hi> by it. And if <hi>this</hi> were the <hi>Case</hi> in all our <hi>obedient actions,</hi> there might be more pretence for <hi>performing</hi> them <hi>pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> out of <hi>love to God,</hi> without mixing therewith any <hi>love of our own selves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in <hi>them</hi> quite contrary our <hi>love of God</hi> and <hi>of our
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:66440:129"/>
selves</hi> are neither <hi>repugnant,</hi> nor so much as <hi>separate</hi>; but <hi>most closely conjoined.</hi> For God hath made the <hi>same things</hi> the matter both of our <hi>Duty</hi> and of our <hi>interest</hi>; so that in <hi>serving him</hi> we do in the highest measure <hi>serve our own selves</hi> too. And in this Case, where our own <hi>self-love</hi> is so <hi>much concerned,</hi> and has not the <hi>love of God</hi> to <hi>oppose</hi> and <hi>over-rule</hi> it, but to <hi>jump</hi> in and <hi>conspire</hi> with it; it is not possible but that we shall be <hi>influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi> and <hi>acted</hi> by it. For it <hi>naturally</hi> issues out upon our <hi>own good,</hi> and here it has an <hi>object</hi> in the <hi>highest ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement,</hi> and there is nothing to <hi>hinder</hi> or <hi>restrain</hi> it. So that whatsoever we may do through a <hi>bare abstracted love of others,</hi> without any <hi>regard to our own selves,</hi> in <hi>those Cases</hi> where our own <hi>self-love</hi> and <hi>it</hi> are <hi>separate,</hi> or <hi>repugnant</hi>: yet in the <hi>matter of obedience,</hi> where they are so <hi>close conjoined,</hi> and Gods service is so infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely our own interest; 'tis plain that we cannot be wholly free from it. For since in obeying we do that which we know is most highly advantageous to us, we are not able perfectly to abstract our thoughts, but we shall intend whether we will or no to be advantaged by it.</p>
               <p>And since no man can wholly abstain from intending his own advantage in Gods service, no Law can require it. It is no fit matter of a prohibition, nor capable of being retrenched by a Commandment; being it is at no mans choice whether or no he shall observe it. So that God must work a Change in his own Creation, and form us into something different from what we are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can in reason demand it of us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some respect to our own advantage in performing what God commands is lawful and allowable in us; because <hi>Gods Laws themselves do authorize and propose it to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God has not required us to serve him for nothing,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:66440:129"/>
but has offered us an abundant recompence for all our labour, and added such allurements to his Laws as infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely surpass all the difficulties of our Duty. He has proposed every thing to us that may any way work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our self-love, and care for our own advantage; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the <hi>promises of good</hi> to intice, or the threats of evil to affright us into obedience.</p>
               <p>For thus saith our Law, <hi>Verily, verily,</hi> (I double the Asseveration, that you may give the greater credit to it) <hi>I say unto you, He that keepeth my Sayings</hi> or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>shall never see death,</hi> John 8.51. <hi>To my Sheep</hi> that <hi>follow me,</hi> and <hi>hear</hi> or obey <hi>my voice, I will give e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life,</hi> John 10.27, 28. <hi>Blessed are they that do his Commandments, for they shall have right to the Tree of Life, and enter in through the Gate into the City,</hi> Rev. 22.14. But on the other side, <hi>The wrath of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the Children of disobedience,</hi> Col. 3.6. For at the Day of Judgment, <hi>when the Lord Jesus shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from Heaven with</hi> the Guards and Attendance of his <hi>mighty Angels</hi>; then will he <hi>in flaming fire take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on them that obey not the Gospel, who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>Thus have we in Christs Laws, to omit other things, a promise made to us of Heaven and endless joys to induce us to obedience; and a threatning of Hell and eternal miserie denounced to us, to make us afraid to disobey. And these make our obedience to become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely our greatest self-interest, and render it impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for us not to serve our own advantage in the highest measure, if we do obey at all.</p>
               <p>And since Gods Laws themselves propose such incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Arguments, to perswade us to obedience, they can never forbid us to have an eye to them, or to be excited to obedience by them. For the very end why
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:66440:130"/>
God annexes such allurements to his Commands, is, that they may be a <hi>motive</hi> to win our choice, and make us <hi>willing</hi> to obey them. But now our wills are moved by nothing further than they desire it, and intend to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase it. We cannot be drawn by it longer than we have an eye to it, nor can we endeavour after it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than we design to obtain it. For we must always design the end before we chuse the means, since it is only for the sake and hopes of that, that the trouble of these is undertaken. So that if any thing must be the final cause and encouragement of our endeavour, it must be the matter of our intention and design also. And therefore seeing God himself has placed such infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite advantages and self-interests at the end of our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to perswade and excite us to a willing performance of it; 'tis evident he designs first of all that we should have an eye to them in obeying, because otherwise it is not possible that we should be moved by them.</p>
               <p>Nay, so far is God from forbidding all respect to our own advantage, in our obedient performances of his Laws; that</p>
               <p n="3">3. In asserting so clearly as he has done the necessity of faith to our obedience, he plainly tells us that, If we must <hi>obey</hi> at all, it cannot <hi>be denied us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faith</hi> is a most necessary Principle of all <hi>natural</hi> as well as <hi>Gospel service.</hi> For <hi>without faith,</hi> saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, it is impossible</hi> for any man, whether he be Heathen or Christian, <hi>to please God</hi>; because <hi>he that cometh to God</hi> in whatsoever Religion, <hi>must believe</hi> thus much of him at least, <hi>that he is, and</hi> also <hi>that he is a rewarder of</hi> all <hi>them that seek him,</hi> without an eye whereat no man would ever be perswaded to seek after him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. And as for the <hi>belief of the Gospel</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, which is the <hi>faith</hi> of us <hi>Christians</hi>; so necessary is it to make us obey the Laws of Christ, that our <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:66440:130"/>
as being effected by it, is called the <hi>obedience of faith,</hi> Rom. 16.26; and <hi>disobedient men</hi> in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture language are ordinarily styled <hi>unbelievers</hi>; and <hi>disobedience, unbelief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now what is there in our faith so indispensably necessary to effect this obedience, but our belief, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> says, of <hi>Gods readiness to reward us,</hi> and of those <hi>advantageous promises</hi> which the Gospel proposes to us upon our performance of it? And how is it possible for our belief of them to carry us on to obey, further than we concern our selves for those things which are promised<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and intend by such obedience to procure them? The Gospel indeed has furnished us with all manner of <hi>Motives,</hi> if we will <hi>believe</hi> it, without which it is not <hi>possible</hi> that we should be moved by it. It tells us of a most <hi>surpassing love</hi> and infinite kindness, which God and Christ have shown to us; and if we believe this, it is fit to raise in us a most exalted <hi>love,</hi> which will make us <hi>perform</hi> any thing <hi>for their sakes</hi> out of very <hi>gratitude.</hi> Now this is a most <hi>noble</hi> and <hi>ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Principle</hi> of obedience, which although it have <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> has yet the <hi>least</hi> of <hi>self-love</hi> in it. But it is <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>insufficient,</hi> unable of <hi>it self</hi> to carry us far, and to bear us through our <hi>whole</hi> Duty. And therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides it, for a perfect supply of all our wants, we have in it moreover the <hi>greatest good</hi> things, and such as we are most in love with, <hi>promised</hi> to our obedience; and the <hi>greatest evils,</hi> such as we most fear, <hi>threatned</hi> if we disobey. And if we believe <hi>these,</hi> we must take obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to be our <hi>highest,</hi> not <hi>service</hi> only but, <hi>self-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest</hi>; and that no <hi>temptation</hi> can either <hi>promise</hi> or <hi>threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> so much to our own <hi>self-love,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> doth. And this indeed carries us through all, and makes us obey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely. It overcomes every difficulty, and overballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces all contrary inticements. But this it doth only so
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:66440:131"/>
                  <hi>far</hi> as we <hi>intend to purchase</hi> all those <hi>surpassing advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> by our <hi>obedience</hi> which infinitely exceed all those <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inticements</hi> that are <hi>attained</hi> by men who <hi>diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as this respect to our own advantage in our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient performances is nothing more than the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Nature absolutely requires, than the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Faith supposes, and than Gods Law it self offers and proposes to us; so neither is it any thing more</p>
               <p n="4">4. Than the best men have always used, who yet were graciously accepted upon such obedience. For just <hi>Noah</hi> obeyed Gods Law through the <hi>fear</hi> of that destruction which it threatned, and with a <hi>design</hi> of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaping it himself, when all the wicked of the World should be overwhelmed in it. <hi>Noah,</hi> saith the Text, <hi>was moved with fear to the preparing of his Ark,</hi> as God had commanded, <hi>and to the saving of his house</hi> thereby. And for that very reason, because he <hi>believed Gods threatning,</hi> and was <hi>effectually afraid</hi> of it, he is in that very place called an <hi>Heir of the righteousness which is by Faith,</hi> Heb. 11.7. The obedience of <hi>Moses</hi> is ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in plain words to his <hi>design</hi> upon those <hi>rewards</hi> which God had <hi>promised,</hi> and which he <hi>hoped</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass by it. For <hi>he had respect,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>to the recompence of reward,</hi> Heb. 11.26. And to put it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all doubt that this <hi>respect to our own advantage</hi> in our performance of Gods Laws, is not only the <hi>necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of <hi>some</hi> men, but, as I said before, the very <hi>frame</hi> and <hi>constitution</hi> of the <hi>humane nature</hi>: we are told that it was found in it in the <hi>highest advancement,</hi> which it either ever <hi>did</hi> or possibly <hi>can</hi> receive; I mean in our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> himself. For even of <hi>his obedience,</hi> and of the highest instance of it, <hi>his death</hi> it self; the Apostle assures us that it was performed
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:66440:131"/>
through a design upon <hi>his own advantage</hi> as well as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>that Glory</hi> which would thereby <hi>redound</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> It was, says he, <hi>for the</hi> sake of the <hi>joy that was set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him,</hi> that he <hi>endured the Cross, and despised the shame</hi> of it, Heb. 12.2.</p>
               <p>Thus upon all these accounts it appears, that <hi>the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving respect to our own advantage in our obedience to Gods Laws,</hi> is not only an <hi>innocent,</hi> but an <hi>absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi> thing. God can never be offended with it, because the <hi>necessity of our nature requires it,</hi> because <hi>his own Laws propose it,</hi> because <hi>our faith is made effectual by it, and</hi> lastly <hi>because the best men that ever lived have stood in need of it, and obeyed through it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And since some respect to our own good, and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our own advantage in Gods service is so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lawful; that surely must be such where the good things which we intend for our selves are only those spiritual and <hi>eternal advantages</hi> which his <hi>own Law</hi> has <hi>promised to the obedient,</hi> or other <hi>temporal</hi> ones, so far as they <hi>minister</hi> to <hi>obedience,</hi> and are <hi>subordinate</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>eternal advantages</hi> which we are to reap by our obedience, they are <hi>the forgiveness of our sins,</hi> the <hi>peace of Conscience,</hi> the <hi>assistance of the Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>joys of Heaven</hi>; together with deliverance from all the contrary evils of <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>Hell.</hi> And these God himself has <hi>expresly promised</hi> to us upon our obedience, to <hi>perswade</hi> us into a performance of it. He uses them as Arguments to us to gain our <hi>choice,</hi> which they must do by actuating our <hi>intention.</hi> He proposeth them to our <hi>aims,</hi> that they may enliven our endeavours; and annexes them to our obedience for this end, that we may be won to perform it for <hi>their sakes,</hi> when we should not barely for <hi>its own.</hi> So that it must needs be <hi>lawful</hi> for every man to <hi>intend</hi> these in Gods service,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:66440:132"/>
because God himself has <hi>proposed</hi> them <hi>expresly</hi> in his Laws to every mans <hi>intention.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for the temporal advantages which accrue to us from Gods service, they are <hi>length of days,</hi> and <hi>health of Body,</hi> and <hi>riches,</hi> and <hi>honour,</hi> or <hi>good reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; with a freedom from all the opposite <hi>evils</hi> of <hi>sickness</hi> and <hi>death</hi> and <hi>shame</hi> and <hi>poverty.</hi> And these al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so are <hi>promised</hi> to the <hi>obedient. Let thine heart keep my Commandments,</hi> saith Wisdom; <hi>for length of days, and long life, and peace shall they add unto thee,</hi> Prov. 3.1, 2. And as <hi>length of days is in her right hand,</hi> so <hi>in her left are riches and honour,</hi> ver. 16. <hi>The memory of the just shall be blessed,</hi> when <hi>the name of the wicked shall rot,</hi> Prov. 10.7. <hi>There</hi> neither <hi>is,</hi> nor shall be <hi>any want to them that fear the Lord.</hi> For though <hi>the Lions,</hi> that seem best able to get it, and are most careless how they come by it, <hi>do lack, and suffer hunger</hi>; yet <hi>they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing,</hi> Psal. 34.9, 10.</p>
               <p>But if there were no express promises of these tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral advantages proposed to us upon our obedience in <hi>God's Word</hi>; yet were it enough to warrant our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of them, that God has annexed them to it in the very <hi>order of things</hi> and <hi>course of Nature.</hi> For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ordinary course and constitution of the World, <hi>Sobriety, Justice, Peaceableness, Diligence,</hi> and other instances of Vertue and Obedience, are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fitted to bring down all these temporal advantages upon us. And this Course of Nature and Order of things is of Gods establishment. It is as much his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, as are the promises and revelations of his Gospel. For he is the Authour of the <hi>World,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Bible.</hi> He made the Frame and Order of it to be what now it is, and after he had formed it, <hi>he saw that all was very good,</hi> Gen. 1.31. His <hi>Word</hi> and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:66440:132"/>
                  <hi>Works</hi> are both his own, and the <hi>advantages</hi> of Vertue and Obedience in the <hi>one</hi> are as much of <hi>his appointment</hi> as in the <hi>other.</hi>

               <p>So that as for our <hi>temporal advantages</hi> also, which are much improved and ministred to by our obedience, they are such as God has given us for <hi>motives</hi> and <hi>encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements</hi> in his service. He has set before us things <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> as well as <hi>future,</hi> to quicken us in our performances of his Commandments, and has appointed us to intend both, because otherwise it is not possible that we should be quick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ned and excited by them.</p>
               <p>But the only thing which we are to take care of in this matter, is, that as these <hi>temporal advantages</hi> are <hi>established by God,</hi> whether in the <hi>course of Nature,</hi> or in the <hi>express revelations of his Word,</hi> as <hi>motives</hi> and <hi>inducements</hi> to <hi>Obedience:</hi> So we use them according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as <hi>helps</hi> and <hi>instruments</hi> to enable us to <hi>obey.</hi> We must make them <hi>assistant</hi> and <hi>subservient</hi> to those <hi>Laws</hi> which they are annexed to; they are to <hi>minister</hi> to them, but by no means to <hi>exalt</hi> themselves <hi>above</hi> them, or to make <hi>against</hi> them. For they are offered and authorized by God no further than they make for him; Obedience to his Laws is the chief thing which he intends; and these good fruits and advantageous effects of it, are laid only as baits and allurements to excite us on to it. But if once they <hi>lose</hi> this <hi>service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness</hi> and <hi>subordination</hi> to the <hi>doing</hi> of Gods will, they <hi>lose all</hi> that can <hi>warrant</hi> them, and all the place which he has assigned for them; and make our <hi>perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi> of Gods Commands to be <hi>no Obedience</hi> to him, nor to give right to any recompence or <hi>reward</hi> from him. For, as I said, then</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> our <hi>intention of our own advantage</hi> in Gods service is <hi>forbidden,</hi> and renders our <hi>obedient perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances corrupt</hi> and <hi>unsincere</hi>; when <hi>together with our
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:66440:133"/>
intention of serving God, we joyn another intention of serving sin</hi>; or when we <hi>design</hi> some <hi>temporal ends</hi> as <hi>much,</hi> or <hi>more</hi> than we <hi>design Gods service,</hi> which makes our <hi>self-interest,</hi> instead of being <hi>subservient</hi> to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to become fit to <hi>oppose</hi> and <hi>undermine</hi> it.</p>
               <p>Sometimes, I say, <hi>together with their intention of serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, men joyn another intention of serving sin.</hi> And this is done in these and the like cases; <hi>(viz.)</hi> If a man <hi>prosecutes a malefactor,</hi> which is an action agreeable to the command of Justice, out of the sinfull end of <hi>spite</hi> and <hi>revenge,</hi> as well as out of a purpose of <hi>Obedience.</hi> If a <hi>Priest</hi> shall <hi>take Confessions</hi> from women with a design of <hi>Lust,</hi> as well as of <hi>Religion.</hi> If a man shall be <hi>temperate</hi> and <hi>sober, chaste</hi> and <hi>industrious,</hi> out of a principle of <hi>covetousness,</hi> as much as out of <hi>Duty.</hi> If he do, as our Saviour tells us the Pharisees did, <hi>make long Prayers,</hi> and other <hi>professions of Religion,</hi> to enable him the better and without suspicion to <hi>devour widows houses,</hi> as well as to <hi>serve God.</hi> In <hi>these</hi> instances, and in all <hi>others</hi> that are <hi>like</hi> unto them, there is a mixture of <hi>light</hi> and <hi>darkness,</hi> of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil design.</hi> Men joyn <hi>God</hi> with <hi>Belial,</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> with something of a quite <hi>contrary nature, intending</hi> at once to serve both the <hi>Lord,</hi> and their <hi>Sins</hi> too.</p>
               <p>But as for their performances which flow from such a <hi>mixture of design</hi> as this, they will in no wise be owned as an <hi>obedient,</hi> but punished as a sinfull service. For that <hi>evil motive</hi> which is mixed with the <hi>good,</hi> is such as God has <hi>expresly threatned.</hi> He has plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that he will damn men eternally for <hi>Revenge,</hi> for <hi>Lust,</hi> for <hi>Covetousness</hi> and <hi>Rapine,</hi> and for all those <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> that proceed from them. So that as for such <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances</hi> as arise from such <hi>sinfull principles,</hi> they are <hi>judged</hi> already, and the dreadfull sentence is long agoe gone out against them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:66440:133"/>And then as for their <hi>mixing</hi> this <hi>damnable design of sin,</hi> with a <hi>design of obedience</hi> to God in the same acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; so far is that from <hi>lessening,</hi> that it is rather an <hi>ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation</hi> of their <hi>crime.</hi> For it adds to all that <hi>evil</hi> which it contains within it self, a <hi>prophanation</hi> also of what is <hi>holy,</hi> or an <hi>abuse</hi> of what is <hi>sacred</hi>; and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the <hi>service of the sin,</hi> joyns an <hi>immediate</hi> and <hi>direct affront of God</hi> too.</p>
               <p>At other times, I say, men <hi>design</hi> some <hi>temporal ends</hi> for themselves as <hi>much,</hi> or <hi>more</hi> than they <hi>design Gods service.</hi> And this also renders their performances <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sincere,</hi> and qualifies their own <hi>temporal self-interests,</hi> instead of being <hi>subservient</hi> to <hi>obedience,</hi> to <hi>oppose</hi> and <hi>undermine</hi> it.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>temporal advantages</hi> they intend sometimes as <hi>much</hi> as they do <hi>Gods service.</hi> They make them equal and co-ordinate, and are <hi>moved</hi> by the <hi>one</hi> as much as by the <hi>other.</hi> Their love for the world is as great as their love for God, and they are induced to perform what he commands them as much for its sake, as they are for his.</p>
               <p>Now this is an indignity which God will by no means endure. For it is plainly an <hi>intolerable degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of him, and a bringing him down to nothing more than an <hi>equal amiableness</hi> with those <hi>earthly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,</hi> and <hi>temporal interests,</hi> which we joyn in <hi>co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> with him. It is a setting up the world for his rival, and making the Creature equall in our estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him who is the Creator and Lord of all. But the peremptory words of his Law are,—<hi>Thou shalt have no other Gods before me,</hi> or in my presence, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.3. He will be served and respected <hi>above</hi> all; and to bring other things into competition with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he looks upon to be the same thing as to renounce him. For <hi>he</hi> is <hi>jealous</hi> of the <hi>preheminence</hi> of <hi>his service</hi> above
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:66440:134"/>
all <hi>other things,</hi> as a <hi>husband</hi> is of his <hi>wives love</hi> to him above <hi>all other</hi> men; <hi>I the Lord,</hi> saith he, <hi>am a jealous God,</hi> Exod. 20.5.</p>
               <p>And since <hi>this intending of our temporal advantages equally to Gods service,</hi> is looked upon to be so <hi>great</hi> an <hi>affront</hi> and <hi>degradation</hi> of him; the making them <hi>supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior</hi> to him, and being won <hi>more</hi> for <hi>their sakes</hi> than for <hi>his,</hi> must do so much rather. For this is a setting up other things <hi>above</hi> him, and is like <hi>making</hi> and <hi>serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of <hi>another God.</hi> Upon which account, as <hi>some</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it, <hi>Covetousness,</hi> which is a <hi>loving and serving of Riches more than God,</hi> is called <hi>Idolatry,</hi> Col. 3.5.</p>
               <p>And when any <hi>Temporal Interest</hi> of our own has got as <hi>great</hi> power over us, or <hi>greater</hi> than <hi>God</hi> himself has; as it makes <hi>for</hi> the performance of his Command at <hi>one</hi> time; so will it at <hi>another</hi> be as ready to make <hi>against</hi> it. For although our <hi>Duty</hi> and our <hi>Interest</hi> do <hi>ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily strike in</hi> together, yet always they do not; but are <hi>sometimes divided.</hi> And then this hank, which our own advantage has got over us, will not determine us for God, but contest with him. It will make us neglect his Service, that we may serve our selves; and carry us on to transgress his Commands, whensoever we may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by promote our own worldly interests.</p>
               <p>So that the intending to <hi>serve our sins</hi> together with our intending to <hi>serve God</hi>; or the intention of our <hi>own temporal interests</hi> in a <hi>degree</hi> either <hi>equal</hi> or <hi>superior</hi> to our intention of <hi>obedience</hi> to him; by both which ways all <hi>worldly advantages</hi> are qualified to <hi>oppose</hi> him: this <hi>mixture of intention,</hi> I say, makes our <hi>performance of his Commands</hi> to be no <hi>acceptable obedience,</hi> but an <hi>unsincere service,</hi> and a <hi>damning sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for that <hi>unmixedness of intention</hi> therefore which is implied in <hi>sincerity,</hi> and which is <hi>necessary to the acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance of our obedience</hi> of all the forementioned Laws;
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:66440:134"/>
it excludes not <hi>all intention</hi> of our <hi>own advantage</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Gods service.</hi> No, to have respect to the <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>eternal advantages</hi> which in Gods <hi>Laws</hi> themselves are expresly <hi>promised</hi> to our <hi>obedience,</hi> is <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways lawful</hi>: and to have an eye upon those <hi>temporal advantages</hi> which will accrue to us by obeying is <hi>lawful so far,</hi> as we intend them, not in a <hi>degree,</hi> either <hi>equal</hi> to <hi>Gods service,</hi> or <hi>superior</hi> to it, by both which ways they are <hi>empowered</hi> to <hi>undermine</hi> it. But then only our <hi>mixing a design of our own self-interest,</hi> together with our <hi>design of serving God,</hi> makes our service <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sincere</hi> and our <hi>damning sin,</hi> when together with our <hi>design of serving God we join a design of serving sin</hi>; or when we <hi>design some temporal ends of our own</hi> as <hi>much,</hi> or <hi>more</hi> than we <hi>design obedience</hi> unto him.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is a vain fear wherewith many good people are wont to perplex their souls, when they <hi>doubt</hi> of the <hi>sincerity of their obedience,</hi> because it was performed with an <hi>eye at their own advantage</hi>; through <hi>their fears of Hell,</hi> or <hi>their hopes of Heaven.</hi> For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever some, out of a <hi>mistaken zeal</hi> for <hi>God's honour,</hi> may have said to the contrary; this is not only <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> but, as I have shewn, plainly <hi>necessary.</hi> If they scruple at this, they must scruple eternally. For it is not their <hi>choice,</hi> but their very <hi>Nature</hi> to act <hi>thus,</hi> and they cannot help it. This, I say, is their very <hi>Nature,</hi> and they must <hi>leave off</hi> to be <hi>men</hi> before they can <hi>get quit</hi> of it. Men may <hi>speak loftily,</hi> and talk of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>purely for God's sake,</hi> without seeking any thing at all for <hi>themselves.</hi> But this is <hi>mere talk,</hi> and <hi>empty rant,</hi> that can never come <hi>beyond words,</hi> or <hi>appear in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> For they must be made something else than what they are, before they can <hi>practise</hi> it. If any man doubts then whether God will accept his obedience, because in obeying he had an eye at his own self interest; he
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:66440:135"/>
doubts whether God will accept him because he obeys as a man. <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> nay <hi>Christ</hi> himself might have doubted at this rate; for in their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience they all intended their <hi>own good</hi> as well as <hi>God's Glory,</hi> and had <hi>respect</hi> unto the <hi>recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> If this be a <hi>sufficient ground of scruple,</hi> every <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> man must of <hi>necessity scruple without end.</hi> For all our <hi>obedience</hi> is an obedience of <hi>Faith</hi>; and our faith or <hi>belief</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> makes us <hi>chuse</hi> to obey, in making us first to <hi>intend</hi> by such obedience to <hi>obtain</hi> the <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>escape</hi> the <hi>other.</hi> So that either our <hi>own nature,</hi> and <hi>Christ's Gospel</hi> must be <hi>changed</hi> into some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing different from what they are: or we must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that such <hi>honest intention</hi> of our own good, as I have mentioned, is <hi>lawful</hi> for us in <hi>God's service,</hi> since it is made so <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>unavoidable</hi> for us in the <hi>one,</hi> and so much <hi>encouraged</hi> by the <hi>other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus at last we see what is the first requisite to an acceptable obedience, <hi>viz. sincerity.</hi> And that it implies both the <hi>reality</hi> of our intention in Gods service or our performing it truly for Gods sake, as we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to do; and also the <hi>uncorruptness</hi> of it, or our performing it for his sake more than for any thing else whatsoever, and without regard to any other advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of our own, than such as are allowed by him, and are subordinate under him.</p>

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>all instances,</hi> cannot but serve him with both these <hi>ingredients</hi> of sincerity, <hi>viz. Truth</hi> and <hi>Preheminence.</hi> He must needs <hi>intend</hi> God's service <hi>really,</hi> and <hi>above all</hi>; who <hi>intends</hi> it so, as to <hi>serve</hi> him <hi>constantly,</hi> and <hi>universally.</hi> And the reason is this, Because although our <hi>temporal interest</hi> and present advantage be for <hi>the most part</hi> united with Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, yet <hi>always</hi> it is not; but <hi>sometimes</hi> in <hi>all instances</hi> of obedience, and at <hi>most times</hi> in <hi>some,</hi> it is <hi>separated</hi> and <hi>divided</hi> from it. So that as long as we are true to our own Principle of acting, which we may safely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude we always are, if we either design not God's ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice at all through <hi>hypocrisie,</hi> or design it not above all through a <hi>corrupt mixture of intention</hi>; at <hi>those times,</hi> when these instances happen, we shall not be <hi>acted</hi> by the <hi>Command</hi>; but through the <hi>love</hi> of our <hi>own interest,</hi> which we intend <hi>really,</hi> and design <hi>more,</hi> we shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>act against</hi> it. For our <hi>actions</hi> go where our <hi>wills</hi> lead them; and our <hi>wills</hi> always follow that which is the <hi>prevailing motive</hi> to them, and has most power with them. And therefore if we still chuse <hi>God's service</hi> in <hi>all</hi> its <hi>parts,</hi> and in <hi>all times,</hi> whether it make <hi>for</hi> our <hi>present advantage,</hi> or <hi>against</hi> it: we may be assured that we <hi>intend</hi> his service <hi>truly,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that we <hi>intend</hi> it <hi>most</hi>; since we <hi>serve him</hi> when no <hi>bye-interests</hi> of our own <hi>can</hi> be served, and <hi>disserve</hi> all <hi>other interests</hi> for <hi>his sake.</hi> He must needs be our <hi>highest aim</hi>; because, where we may <hi>please</hi> him, though no <hi>secular advantages</hi> concur, we chuse <hi>any thing</hi>; and where he would be <hi>offended,</hi> though <hi>all other advantages</hi> invite, we chuse <hi>nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that in the matter of <hi>obedience,</hi> our <hi>integrity</hi> is the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:66440:136"/>
                  <hi>great</hi> and <hi>last measure</hi> of our <hi>acceptance.</hi> And if upon examination we find that our obedience is <hi>intire,</hi> we need not doubt but that it is <hi>sincere</hi> also.</p>
               <p>And this is that very <hi>mark,</hi> from which, according to that version of the Psalms which is used in our Liturgy, the Psalmist himself concludes concerning the obedience of the Israelites. For he collects it to have been a <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled</hi> and <hi>unsincere,</hi> because it was not a <hi>whole</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire</hi> service. <hi>They did but flatter him with their mouth,</hi> saith he, <hi>and dissembled with him in their tongue; for their heart was not whole</hi> or intire <hi>with him,</hi> Psal. 78.36, 37.</p>
               <p>To clear up this enquiry then, <hi>What qualifications of our obedience</hi> to all the forementioned Laws of God, <hi>must render it acceptable to him, and available to our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation at the last day</hi>; I shall proceed to discourse of the <hi>second</hi> condition of all <hi>acceptable obedience,</hi> viz. <hi>integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>; of which in the <hi>next</hi> Chapter.</p>

How God is to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed with the first faculty, our minds or understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. God is to be obeyed with the second faculty, our

affections. This Question stated, How God and his Laws, which are spiritual things, are proportionate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for our love and affections, which are bodily facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Of the difference betwixt our love of God, and of the World: that this is more warm and sensible; that more lasting and powerful. An account of what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of obedience in our minds and affections, is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the acceptance of our service. That contrivances and consultations for evil things, and such mere appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions as are particularly forbidden, are deadly and damning: but that all other bare apprehensions; and that all our affections after good or evil things will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded or punished, not merely for themselves, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they are Causes and Principles of good or evil choice and practice. God to be obeyed with the third faculty, our wills. He cannot be served without them. Men are guilty of sin if they chuse it and consent to it, though they cannot act it. All this service of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward faculties is in order to our outward works and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations.</p>

               <p>And this in another word is ordinarily expressed in Scripture by <hi>uprightness.</hi> For in the most common Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor of the holy Books our <hi>course of life</hi> is called our <hi>way</hi>; our <hi>actions, steps</hi>; and our <hi>doing, walking.</hi> And, to carry on the Metaphor, our <hi>course of obedience</hi> is called our <hi>right</hi> or <hi>straight path</hi>; our <hi>course of sin and transgressions</hi> a <hi>crooked path</hi>; our <hi>committing sin, stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling</hi> and <hi>falling</hi>; and our <hi>doing our duty, walking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly.</hi>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:66440:137"/>
So that for a man to be <hi>upright in God's ways,</hi> is, not to <hi>stumble or fall by sin and disobedience; i. e.</hi> to be <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>intire,</hi> or <hi>wanting nothing in our obedient performances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this <hi>integrity</hi> or <hi>uprightness</hi> which is necessary to our <hi>obedience</hi> that it may stand us in stead at the last Day, is <hi>three-fold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. An integrity of our <hi>powers</hi> or <hi>faculties,</hi> which I call an <hi>integrity</hi> of the <hi>Subject.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. An integrity of <hi>seasons</hi> and <hi>opportunities,</hi> which is an <hi>integrity</hi> of <hi>Time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. An integrity of the <hi>particular Laws of Duty,</hi> and instances of obedience, which is an <hi>integrity</hi> of the <hi>Object.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And all these are necessary to render our perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God's Laws an acceptable service. For if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we expect that he should reward our obedience at the last Day, we must take care beforehand that it be the obedience of our <hi>whole man,</hi> in <hi>all times,</hi> to the <hi>whole Law</hi> of God. To begin with it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That our obedience of the forementioned Laws may avail us to life and pardon at the last Day, we must take care to obey with <hi>all our powers</hi> and <hi>faculties,</hi> which is an <hi>integrity</hi> of the <hi>Subject.</hi> And for this the very Letter of the Law is express. For when the Lawyer asks, <hi>What shall I do to inherit eternal life?</hi> Christ sends him to what is written in the Law, and repeats that to him for an Answer;<note place="margin">Mark 12.30.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou shalt love</hi> (and <hi>serve,</hi> as it is <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.13.) <hi>the Lord thy God with all thy heart</hi> or will, <hi>and with all thy soul</hi> or affections, <hi>and with all thy strength</hi> or executive and bodily pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>and with all thy mind</hi> or understanding, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.25, 26, 27, 28. Obedience with all these powers and with our whole Nature, is the means of life, and the indispensable condition of our eternal happiness.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:66440:137"/>First, We must keep all Gods Commandments with our <hi>minds</hi> or <hi>understandings.</hi> It is a dangerous conceit for any man to phansie that he may be as <hi>sinful</hi> as he will in his <hi>thoughts,</hi> so long as he only <hi>loves</hi> and <hi>chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> projects and contrives for the forbidden instance in his <hi>mind</hi>; but doth not proceed so far as to obey it in his <hi>outward practice.</hi> For at the last Day we must be called to account, and justified or condemned by the <hi>counsels</hi> and <hi>imaginations</hi> of our <hi>minds,</hi> as well as by the <hi>works</hi> of our <hi>lives.</hi> For not only the works and practice, but also <hi>the thoughts of the wicked,</hi> or of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, <hi>are an abomination to the Lord,</hi> Prov. 15.26. <hi>The thought of foolishness is sin,</hi> Prov. 24.9. And since God <hi>forbids</hi> and <hi>hates</hi> them; as ever we hope for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, we must <hi>repent</hi> of them and <hi>forsake</hi> them. <hi>Let the wicked man forsake his thoughts,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>and turn them</hi> from his sin <hi>unto the Lord; and</hi> then <hi>he will have mercy</hi> upon him, <hi>and abundantly pardon</hi> him, <hi>Isai.</hi> 55.7. For the <hi>warfare</hi> that God has set us, after which we are to attain the reward of eternal happiness, <hi>is a casting down imaginations,</hi> as the Apostle tells us, <hi>and bringing into captivity every</hi> rebellious <hi>thought to the obedience of Christ,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5.</p>
               <p>In particular, this obedience of our <hi>minds</hi> to the Law of God must be, as a doing what he enjoins, so likewise a keeping off from every thing which he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> In our <hi>imaginations.</hi> We must not <hi>phansie</hi> it in our minds with love and delight, nor indulge to any thoughts of it with such pleasure as may be a bait to our choice, and weaken our aversation and hatred of it, and thereby ensnare us into the practice of it. <hi>Our warfare,</hi> as we have heard from the Apostle, must not be against <hi>actions</hi> only, but against <hi>imaginations</hi> also, and <hi>insnaring phancies</hi> of evil; <hi>casting down</hi> rebellious
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:66440:138"/>
                  <hi>imaginations, and making every thought obedient to</hi> the Laws of <hi>Christ,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5. And in the <hi>old world,</hi> when <hi>the imaginations of mens thoughts were always evil, it repented the Lord that he had made man,</hi> insomuch as he resolved to destroy him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> In our <hi>counsels</hi> and <hi>contrivances.</hi> We must not study what <hi>means</hi> are <hi>fittest,</hi> what <hi>times</hi> are <hi>best,</hi> and what <hi>manner</hi> is <hi>most advantageous</hi> for the acting of our sins. They must no more have our <hi>care</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance,</hi> than our <hi>service</hi> and <hi>obedience.</hi> For if we cast about in our thoughts, and consult about the most commodious way of committing any sin; although all our designs be defeated before we come to any effect, yet shall we be damned for our <hi>contrivance,</hi> as well as we should for the <hi>compleat action.</hi> And this our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self has plainly determined in <hi>one</hi> instance, and the Case is the same in all the <hi>rest.</hi> For of the <hi>contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>machinations of murther</hi> he assures us, That they, as well as <hi>murther it self,</hi> are of the number of those things which <hi>pollute</hi> a man, and so utterly unfit him for Heaven, where nothing can ever enter that is <hi>polluted</hi> or <hi>unclean. Out of the heart,</hi> saith he, <hi>proceed evil thoughts</hi> or <note n="a" place="margin">

                  </note> murtherous machinations, and besides them, compleat <hi>murthers, adulteries,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file the man,</hi> Matth. 15 19.</p>
               <p>And as for that <hi>particular</hi> sort of contriving for sin, which is the height and perfection of villany; <hi>viz. the inventing of new,</hi> and before <hi>unknown ways of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing:</hi> it, of all others, is sure to meet with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest punishment, and to thrust men down into the deepest Abyss of Hell. Of this sort are all <hi>invention of new Oaths, new Nick-names</hi> or <hi>evil speakings, new frauds</hi> and <hi>methods of couzenage, new incentives of lust, new
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:66440:138"/>
modes of drinking, and arts of intemperance.</hi> But of <hi>these,</hi> and of all others that are like unto them, God will one day exact a most rigorous and terrible account: For <hi>he that deviseth to do evil,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon,</hi> although he himself doth not <hi>act,</hi> but only <hi>devise</hi> it, <hi>he shall be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and dealt with as a <hi>mischievous</hi> and wicked <hi>person,</hi> Prov. 24.8. And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Pauls</hi> words are full to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. For he tells us expresly, that in the <hi>judgment of God inventers of evil things</hi> shall be declared <hi>worthy of death,</hi> Rom. 1.30, 32.</p>
               <p>As for our <hi>minds</hi> or <hi>understandings</hi> then, they are one faculty which is plainly implied in the <hi>Integrity</hi> of our service, and without the obedience whereof at the last day God will not accept us.</p>
               <p>And another faculty implied in it likewise is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our <hi>Soul</hi> or <hi>Affections.</hi> It is a vain thing for any man to love and set his heart upon any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular sin, and yet for all that to expect that God should love and reward him. <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart,</hi> saith the Psalmist, <hi>the Lord will not hear me,</hi> Psal. 66.18. <hi>No man,</hi> as our Saviour sayes, <hi>can serve two masters, for if he love the one,</hi> for his sake, when their interests enterfere, <hi>he will hate the other</hi>; so that <hi>we cannot serve God,</hi> if with our affections we continue to <hi>serve sin,</hi> Mat. 6.24. To pretend obedience to God, and yet to love what he sorbids, to make a show of his service, and yet in our very hearts to hanker after his vilest enemies whom above all things his soul abhors: this surely is not <hi>honestly</hi> to <hi>serve,</hi> but <hi>grosly to collogue,</hi> and <hi>slatly to dissemble</hi> with him. For in very deed, if any man love sin, he sides with Gods enemy; but for the service and <hi>fear of the Lord, it is to hate evil,</hi> Prov. 8.13. If ever we expect that God should accept our works, we must offer up our affections with them. For if our hearts go along with our lusts, whilst our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:66440:139"/>
is against them; we serve God only against our wills; we submit to him as a <hi>slave</hi> doth to a <hi>tyrannous</hi> Lord, not through any kindness for him, but through a hatefull fear of him. We utterly dislike what he bids us, but yet we do it, only because we dare not do otherwise. But now this is such a way of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obedience, as God will never endure to accept of. For he scorns to be served by a slavish fear, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing mind; he will never look upon a heartless sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; but it is the affection that we do it with, which makes him set a price upon any thing that we do; and our love that he regards more than our performance. For this is that very thing which was thought fit to be mentioned in the command it self. <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy mind,</hi> Mat. 22.37.</p>
               <p>'Tis true indeed, we do not find our <hi>affection</hi> so <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>sensible</hi> for <hi>God</hi> and <hi>his Laws,</hi> as it uses to be for the <hi>things of the world,</hi> neither can we reasonably expect it should. For our affections are <hi>bodily powers,</hi> and it is their very nature, as <hi>Philosophy</hi> instructs us, to be a <hi>vehement sensation upon some certain commotions of our bodily spirits</hi>; so that <hi>God</hi> and <hi>his Laws,</hi> which are things <hi>immaterial</hi> and <hi>insensible,</hi> are no <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>proportionate object</hi> for them. For it is only <hi>matter</hi> that is able of it self to <hi>affect matter</hi>; and <hi>material</hi> and <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible objects,</hi> which can excite our <hi>material</hi> and <hi>sensitive passions</hi> and <hi>appetites. One</hi> bodily faculty is no more fit in its own nature to be moved by a spiritual object than <hi>another</hi>: and we may as well expect that our <hi>eye</hi> should <hi>see,</hi> or our <hi>fingers handle</hi> it; as that our <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> should of <hi>themselves</hi> issue out upon it, either to <hi>love,</hi> or <hi>desire,</hi> or <hi>delight</hi> in it.</p>
               <p>So that considering things barely in <hi>themselves,</hi> I say, and the <hi>natural agreeableness</hi> that is betwixt them, which
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:66440:139"/>
is the ground of their <hi>natural operations</hi>; it is only <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily pain</hi> or <hi>pleasure</hi> that is <hi>of it self</hi> fit to move our <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily passions.</hi> But as for <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>insensible objects,</hi> such as <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> are, whatever fitness to work upon our <hi>affections</hi> they may have upon <hi>other</hi> accounts, yet in themselves they have <hi>none. Virtue</hi> and <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> which are <hi>spiritual</hi> things, may gain upon our <hi>wills</hi> and <hi>understandings,</hi> which are <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>rational fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi>; but upon our <hi>bodily appetites</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> for their own sakes <hi>barely</hi> they never can.</p>
               <p>But that which makes our affections to issue out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> is not the spiritual nature of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> themselves; but those <hi>sensible</hi> and <hi>bodily</hi> things which <hi>flow</hi> from them, and are <hi>annexed</hi> to them. For although <hi>God</hi> be <hi>immaterial</hi> in <hi>himself,</hi> yet infinite are those <hi>material</hi> and <hi>bodily delights</hi> which we receive from him. And although <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> are in their own natures <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>insensible,</hi> yet exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great, and exceeding many are the <hi>sensible goods</hi> and pleasures that are <hi>annexed</hi> to them. For <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>eternal life,</hi> which are <hi>promised</hi> to our <hi>obedience,</hi> will give a <hi>full delight,</hi> not only to our <hi>souls</hi> and <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> but even to <hi>all</hi> our <hi>senses</hi> likewise. It will end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly entertain our <hi>eyes</hi> with most <hi>splendid sights</hi> and <hi>glorious objects</hi>; it will feast our <hi>ears</hi> with <hi>melodious songs,</hi> and <hi>most ravishing halelujahs,</hi> and refresh our <hi>whole bodies</hi> with a most <hi>exalted</hi> and <hi>everlasting ease</hi> and <hi>pleasure.</hi> As on the other side, <hi>hell</hi> and <hi>eternal misery,</hi> which are the <hi>established punishment</hi> of all <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,</hi> will bring not only upon our <hi>spirits,</hi> but upon our <hi>bodies</hi> too as full a scene of most <hi>exquisite pain</hi> and <hi>sorrow.</hi> For so violent and intolerable will the torments of our bodies there be, that God could find nothing too high to set them out by, but has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed them by one of the most raging and torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things in nature, <hi>eternal fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:66440:140"/>Now as for <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> they indeed are such things as can of <hi>themselves</hi> stir our <hi>affections</hi> and <hi>bodily passions</hi> with a witness. When they are set before us, they are able to make us <hi>love God</hi> and our <hi>Duty</hi> above all things else, and to <hi>hate</hi> nothing so much as <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Disobedience.</hi> For no <hi>Sin</hi> can promise us so much <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily delight,</hi> as is to be injoyed in <hi>Heaven</hi>; neither can <hi>Obedience</hi> in any <hi>possible</hi> instance expose us to so great <hi>bodily pains,</hi> as the damn'd for ever undergo in <hi>Hell.</hi> So that when once <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> are <hi>proposed</hi> to our <hi>affections,</hi> and act upon them, they will prevail with them more than any thing else can, and make nothing so <hi>dear</hi> to them as the <hi>performance of their duty,</hi> nor any thing so <hi>hatefull</hi> as the <hi>transgression</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>And thus may <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> become a fit object even of our <hi>bodily passions,</hi> and a most <hi>cogent</hi> matter of <hi>love, desire</hi> and <hi>joy</hi>; as on the contrary <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness</hi> are of <hi>sorrow, slight</hi> and <hi>hatred.</hi> They are most powerfull to excite all these <hi>affections,</hi> although not in their <hi>bare spiritual selves,</hi> yet in their <hi>bodily dependants,</hi> and <hi>annexed consequences.</hi> For the <hi>greatest bodily joys</hi> shall one day crown our <hi>Obedience,</hi> and the <hi>acutest bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily torments</hi> will certainly befall us if we <hi>disobey.</hi> And these, although as yet they are at a <hi>distance,</hi> and <hi>future</hi> to us, are most fit to work upon us, and most strongly to affect us. For we are Creatures endowed with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and have Reason given to us to set future things before us, and to think our selves into passions and affections, and not to be <hi>idle</hi> and altogether <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,</hi> like the brute and unreasonable Creatures, and suffer the bare force of <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>present</hi> objects to excite them in us: So that with our <hi>bodily affections</hi> we may <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> in <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> which are <hi>spiritual</hi> things, because of their <hi>bodily joys</hi> and <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendancies</hi>; and <hi>sensibly hate</hi> and <hi>grieve</hi> at our sins and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:66440:140"/>
disobedience, which are <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>immaterial</hi> evils; because of their <hi>sensible</hi> pains and punishment. And we may <hi>love</hi> the <hi>one</hi> and <hi>hate</hi> the <hi>other above</hi> all things else, because no <hi>bodily joys</hi> are in any the least comparison <hi>so</hi> great as those which are laid up for the <hi>good</hi> in <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> nor any <hi>bodily</hi> pains <hi>so</hi> tormenting, as those which are prepared for the damn'd in <hi>hell.</hi> And since God has given to our <hi>bodily affections</hi> even in their <hi>own way,</hi> the <hi>greatest motives</hi> to <hi>love him above all,</hi> and <hi>above</hi> all things to <hi>hate sin</hi>; it is the highest Reason that he should require it of us, and demand the <hi>preeminent service,</hi> not only of our <hi>spirits,</hi> but also of our <hi>lower soul</hi> or <hi>affections</hi> also.</p>
               <p>But although our <hi>bodily affections,</hi> when they are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> which are <hi>spiritual</hi> things, by reason of this <hi>supereminence</hi> of <hi>sensitive</hi> rewards in the <hi>one,</hi> and punishments in the <hi>other,</hi> be more <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>powerfull,</hi> yet are they not, as I said, so <hi>warm</hi> and <hi>sensible</hi> as they use to be, when they issue out upon <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> and <hi>bodily objects.</hi> We <hi>feel one</hi> in our own souls, and are affected in them much more violently, than we are in the <hi>other.</hi> And that it must needs be so is plain: For our affections for <hi>worldly</hi> things are raised in us by the <hi>things themselves,</hi> and by those impressions which they make upon us; and they act to the <hi>highest,</hi> and according to the <hi>utmost</hi> of their power. But our <hi>affections</hi> for <hi>spiritual</hi> things are to be raised in us by our own <hi>Reason,</hi> we are to argue and think our selves up to them, and our thoughts are <hi>free,</hi> and go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than we please to suffer them. And indeed we find so much difficulty in fixing them upon any thing, and there are so many other things obtruding daily upon them to divert and call them off from these; that we seldom stay so long upon them, or are so well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them, as to be wrought up into a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:66440:141"/>
                  <hi>warm</hi> and <hi>inflamed</hi> affection for them.</p>
               <p>Besides, what is the chief Reason of all, that <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> in <hi>worldly</hi> things which <hi>affects</hi> us is <hi>present</hi> with us, and therefore our passions <hi>for,</hi> or <hi>against</hi> them are raised in us by our <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>feeling.</hi> But as for <hi>spiritual</hi> things, and those <hi>bodily</hi> joys and sorrows that are <hi>annexed</hi> to them, for the <hi>sake</hi> whereof we are <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly affected</hi> with them; they are not <hi>present</hi> with us, but future and at a distance; and therefore our pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for them cannot be raised by our <hi>sense,</hi> whose ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject are only <hi>present</hi> things, but meerly by our <hi>fancy</hi> and <hi>imagination.</hi> But now as for the <hi>sensible warmth</hi> and violence of a <hi>passion,</hi> it is nothing near so <hi>quick</hi> when it is excited by <hi>fancy,</hi> as when it is produced by <hi>sense.</hi> For no man is so <hi>feelingly affected</hi> with <hi>hearing</hi> a sad story, as he would be by <hi>seeing</hi> of it. A man will be moved abundantly less by <hi>imagining</hi> a <hi>battle,</hi> a <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> or any other dreadfull thing, than by <hi>beholding</hi> it: And the reason is, because the impressions upon our <hi>sense</hi> are <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>violent,</hi> and their <hi>warmth</hi> is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to our <hi>affections</hi> which are raised by them: whereas our <hi>imaginations</hi> are <hi>calm</hi> and <hi>faint</hi> in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, and the <hi>passions</hi> which flow from them partake of their <hi>temper,</hi> and are more <hi>cold</hi> and less <hi>perceptible:</hi> So that our passions for <hi>worldly</hi> things being passions upon <hi>sense,</hi> and our passions for things <hi>spiritual</hi> with their <hi>bodily</hi> pain or pleasure annexed, being only upon <hi>fancy</hi> and <hi>imagination</hi>; we must needs be more <hi>warmly</hi> and <hi>sensibly,</hi> although not more <hi>powerfully</hi> affected with the things of <hi>this</hi> world, than of the <hi>other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that which is to distinguish our <hi>passion for God and Virtue above</hi> all things else, from our passion for <hi>worldly</hi> things, is not the <hi>warmth</hi> and <hi>sensibleness,</hi> but the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>continuance</hi> of it. For it must be a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent</hi> affection, which doth more service, although it
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:66440:141"/>
make less noise. It must be such a setled and <hi>overpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering</hi> Love, answerable to the <hi>prevailing strength,</hi> and <hi>surpassing greatness</hi> of its <hi>motive,</hi> as gets the <hi>upper hand</hi> in <hi>competition,</hi> and makes us, when we must <hi>despise</hi> one to disregard all things else, and to adhere to Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, what other things soever be lost by it: What it wants in <hi>warmth,</hi> it has in <hi>permanency</hi> and <hi>power</hi>; it sticks faster to us, and can do more with us than our love of any thing besides. For in our affections we must needs <hi>prefer God</hi> and <hi>his service before</hi> every other thing when they stand in competition; or we have none of that <hi>Love with the whole soul</hi> which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment requires of us; as will be shewn more fully <note n="b" place="margin">Chap. 8.</note> afterwards.</p>
               <p>And because our <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> have in them a great <hi>latitude,</hi> and in a matter of so high concern e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good soul will be inquisitive after some determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate accounts of that <hi>compass</hi> and <hi>degree</hi> of them which is necessary to our acceptance: before <hi>I</hi> conclude this Point, I will set down what measures of obedience in these two faculties, what <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>imaginations</hi> of our <hi>minds,</hi> and what <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> in our <hi>affections,</hi> shall be judged sufficient at the last Day to <hi>save</hi> or to <hi>destroy</hi> us.</p>
               <p>As for our <hi>thoughts,</hi> there is one more <hi>elaborate</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> sort of them, <hi>viz.</hi> our <hi>counsels</hi> and <hi>contrivances.</hi> And when they are employed about the compassing of forbidden things, they are our <hi>sin,</hi> and, without <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> will certainly prove our <hi>condemnation.</hi> For <hi>he that deviseth to do evil,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, he shall be called</hi> and dealt with as <hi>a mischievous person,</hi> Prov. 24.8. The <hi>machinations of murther</hi> are joined in <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> with <hi>murtherous</hi> actions themselves, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.19. And as for that particular sort of Contrivers, the <hi>inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of <hi>evil things,</hi> they are pronounced by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               <p>And as for other of our thoughts which are not come up to the height of a <hi>contrivance</hi> or <hi>consultation,</hi> but are only <hi>simple</hi> apprehensions; some of them also are <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi> and <hi>directly good</hi> or <hi>evil,</hi> and an <hi>Article</hi> of our <hi>life</hi> or <hi>death.</hi> God has imposed several Laws, which he has backed both with threats and promises, upon our very thoughts themselves. Of which sort there are some to be met with under all the three <hi>general</hi> Parts of Duty, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> our <hi>Neighbour,</hi> and our <hi>selves.</hi> For our thoughts of <hi>God</hi> are bound up by the Law of <hi>honour,</hi> which forbids us to lessen or prophane him by <hi>dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Notions</hi> and Opinions; our thoughts of our <hi>Neighbour</hi> by the Laws of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Candour,</hi> which suffer us not either to reproach or injure him by <hi>under-valuing Ideas,</hi> or <hi>groundless suspicions</hi>; and our thoughts of our own <hi>selves</hi> by the Law of <hi>humility,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits us to be exal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>As for these Instances then, of <hi>bare thought</hi> and <hi>naked apprehension,</hi> they are <hi>essential parts</hi> and <hi>necessary instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of an <hi>acceptable obedience</hi>; and the <hi>wilful transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of any one of them, without <hi>repentance,</hi> is <hi>dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> and <hi>damning.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:66440:142"/>So that as for all our <hi>perfected</hi> and <hi>studied thoughts of evil,</hi> viz. our <hi>counsels</hi> and <hi>contrivances</hi>; and as for all <hi>such simple thoughts</hi> and <hi>

                     </gap>ore apprehensions</hi> as have <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Laws</hi> imposed upon them; they are not only <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> but <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>instances</hi> of <hi>disobedience</hi>; and if we are <hi>guilty</hi> of them, unless we retract them by <hi>repentance,</hi> we shall be <hi>condemned</hi> for them.</p>
               <p>But then there are several other <hi>bare imaginations</hi> and <hi>simple apprehensions,</hi> which are not under any of <hi>these</hi> particular Laws, that are imposed upon our thoughts themselves, but are employed upon things commanded or forbidden by any of the other Laws forementioned. And as for all <hi>these</hi> apprehensions, in themselves they are neither <hi>sin</hi> nor <hi>Duty,</hi> nor a matter either of <hi>reward</hi> or <hi>punishment</hi>; but so far only as they are <hi>causes</hi> and <hi>principles</hi> either of a <hi>sinful</hi> or <hi>obedient choice and practice</hi> of those good or evil things, which they are employed upon.</p>
               <p>In <hi>themselves,</hi> I say, these <hi>mere apprehensions</hi> are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>sin</hi> nor <hi>Duty.</hi> We may <hi>perceive</hi> sin in our <hi>minds,</hi> and have it in a thought or notion, without ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty of it, or liable to answer for it. For the <hi>Sun shines</hi> upon a <hi>Dunghil</hi> without being <hi>defiled</hi> by it: and <hi>God sees</hi> all the <hi>wickedness</hi> in <hi>Hell,</hi> but is not <hi>taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> with it. And so long as we sojourn in a World of <hi>iniquity,</hi> every good man must needs know and behold all the vices of the Earth; but bare understanding of them doth not make him partake with them, or subject to be punished for them.</p>
               <p>But to make these <hi>meer apprehensions</hi> and <hi>imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> either of <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> an instance of <hi>obedience</hi> or <hi>disobedience</hi>; they must be <note n="c" place="margin">See this slated <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>causes</hi> and <hi>principles</hi> of an <hi>obedient</hi> or <hi>disobedient choice</hi> or <hi>practice.</hi> For our <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thoughts</hi> and <hi>imaginations</hi> are <hi>Springs</hi> and <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> both of our <hi>inward choice,</hi> and also of our <hi>outward
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:66440:143"/>
operations.</hi> And the service which God requires of them is the service of the <hi>principle.</hi> He demands the obedience of our <hi>minds</hi> as a <hi>means,</hi> and in order to a further obedience of our hearts and actions. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects that we should think so <hi>long</hi> and so <hi>often</hi> upon the <hi>absoluteness</hi> of his <hi>authority,</hi> the <hi>kindness</hi> of his <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> the <hi>reasonableness</hi> of his <hi>Commands,</hi> the <hi>glory</hi> of his <hi>rewards,</hi> and the <hi>terrour</hi> of his <hi>punishments</hi>; till in our hearts we <hi>chuse</hi> those things which he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and <hi>perform</hi> them in our <hi>works</hi> and <hi>practice.</hi> For our <hi>thoughts</hi> of <hi>him,</hi> and of his <hi>Laws,</hi> are not in <hi>themselves Obedience,</hi> but only a <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Principle</hi> of it, and a <hi>good step</hi> and <hi>degree</hi> towards it. Our <hi>knowledge</hi> shall be judged an acceptable service as it carries us on to <hi>performance,</hi> but no otherwise. For <hi>hereby alone,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John, we know that we know him</hi> with such knowledge as shall be accepted by him, <hi>if we keep his Commandments,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.3. And on the other side, our <hi>bare imaginations</hi> and <hi>apprehensions</hi> of some <hi>forbidden sin</hi> are then only <hi>disobedient,</hi> when they carry us on to <hi>chuse</hi> or <hi>practise</hi> those things that are <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> We must go on from <hi>thought</hi> to <hi>choice</hi> or <hi>practice</hi> before the <hi>vices thought</hi> of become our own, and our <hi>apprehensions</hi> of sin become themselves <hi>sinful.</hi> For the <hi>thoughts of sin</hi> have the <hi>sinfulness</hi> of <hi>means</hi> and <hi>causes</hi>; they are sinful so <hi>far</hi> as they help on either our <hi>consent</hi> or <hi>performance.</hi> So our Saviour has determined in <hi>one</hi> instance, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>lustful looks</hi> and <hi>apprehensions, Matth.</hi> 5. <hi>He that looks upon a woman</hi> so long as <hi>to lust after her</hi> or to consent in his heart to the enjoyment of her, <hi>he hath committed Adultery with her already in his heart,</hi> ver. 28.</p>
               <p>As for our <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>imaginations</hi> then, we see what <hi>obedience</hi> in them is required to our <hi>acceptance,</hi> and when they are <hi>disobedient</hi> and will <hi>destroy</hi> us. For
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:66440:143"/>
our <hi>counsels</hi> and <hi>contrivances of evil</hi> are <hi>always sinful</hi>; and so are all such <hi>simple thoughts</hi> and <hi>apprehensions</hi> as have <hi>particular</hi> Laws imposed upon them. And as for our <hi>imaginations</hi> and <hi>apprehensions</hi> of things <hi>command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> or <hi>forbidden</hi> by any <hi>other</hi> Laws; they are <hi>imperfect</hi> things, and not fully grown up to the <hi>perfect</hi> Stature ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>obedience</hi> or of <hi>disobedience</hi>; So that they are neither <hi>punished</hi> nor <hi>rewarded</hi> in <hi>themselves</hi>; but so far only as they are <hi>causes</hi> and <hi>principles</hi> of an <hi>obedient</hi> or <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient choice</hi> or <hi>actions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then as for our <hi>affections,</hi> their measures are the very same with those already mentioned of our <hi>bare imaginations</hi> and <hi>simple apprehensions.</hi> For their <hi>service</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> is that of the <hi>principle,</hi> and their Sentence shall be according to <hi>those effects,</hi> either in our <hi>wills</hi> or <hi>practice,</hi> which <hi>flow</hi> from it.</p>
               <p>If we <hi>love</hi> and <hi>desire obedience,</hi> so far as to <hi>chuse</hi> and <hi>act</hi> it; this <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>affection</hi> will gain us God's <hi>love</hi> and <hi>favour,</hi> and secure his <hi>rewards</hi>; but less than it no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall. <hi>He that keeps my Commandments,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>he it is that loveth me, and they</hi> only <hi>who</hi> so <hi>love me</hi> in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying me, <hi>shall be beloved</hi> again <hi>of my Father, and I will love them,</hi> John 14.15, 21.</p>
               <p>But if our love and desire of evil things carry us on to <note n="d" place="margin">See this stated Book 5. Chap. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>chuse</hi> or <hi>act</hi> any instance of <hi>disobedience,</hi> for the sake of that which is <hi>loved</hi> and <hi>desired</hi>; then are our <hi>affections sinful,</hi> and such as will <hi>destroy</hi> us. The <hi>desire</hi> of <hi>evil</hi> is not so truly the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>mortal sin,</hi> as of <hi>dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous temptation,</hi> it is not <hi>deadly</hi> in it <hi>self,</hi> but <hi>kills</hi> by <hi>carrying</hi> us on to a <hi>sinful</hi> and <hi>deadly choice</hi> and <hi>actions.</hi> For when once it has got to that <hi>degree,</hi> it is <hi>obnoxious</hi> to a <hi>dreadful Sentence.</hi> Whereof the Psalmist gives us one instance in the <hi>love of violence. Him that loveth vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, the soul of the Lord hateth,</hi> Psal. 11.5. And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John</hi> says the same of the <hi>love of lying,</hi> and the Case is
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:66440:144"/>
                  <hi>alike</hi> in every other sin. <hi>Without</hi> in outer darkness, <hi>are murtherers, and whatsoever loveth or maketh a lye,</hi> Rev. 22.15.</p>
               <p>And thus we see what <hi>measure</hi> of <hi>obedience</hi> is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in these <hi>two</hi> faculties, and what <hi>kinds</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> are to be <hi>used</hi> or <hi>restrained</hi> to make <hi>theirs</hi> an <hi>acceptable Service.</hi> For we must <hi>abstain</hi> from all <hi>evil counsels</hi> and <hi>contrivances</hi>; from all <hi>simple apprehensions</hi> which are <hi>particularly forbidden,</hi> and put in <hi>use</hi> all such as are <hi>particularly enjoined</hi>: and as for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our <hi>bare thoughts</hi> and <hi>imaginations,</hi> and all our <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> and <hi>desires,</hi> we must <hi>fix</hi> them upon our <hi>Duty</hi> so long, till they make us <hi>perform</hi> it; and never suffer them to issue out upon <hi>evil</hi> so <hi>far,</hi> till they carry us on either to <hi>chuse</hi> or <hi>practise</hi> it.</p>
               <p>But besides these <hi>two</hi> faculties, <hi>viz.</hi> our <hi>minds</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> there is yet another whose service is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to render ours an acceptable obedience; and that is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Our <hi>hearts</hi> or <hi>wills</hi> also.</p>
               <p>It is an absurd Dream for any man to think of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God without his <hi>will,</hi> because without that none of his actions can be called his own. For that only is imputed to us, which is chosen by us, and which it was in the power of our own wills either to promote or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; no man <hi>deserving praise</hi> or being <hi>liable to answer</hi> for what he could <hi>not</hi> help. But of all persons <hi>God</hi> most of all regards our hearts in all our performances. He perfectly <hi>discerns</hi> them, and he <hi>estimates</hi> our <hi>servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> according to them. So that it is not possible for any of us to obey him <hi>unwillingly,</hi> in regard the choice of our <hi>will</hi> and <hi>heart</hi> it self is that which renders any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>saving</hi> and <hi>acceptable obedience.</hi> For <hi>out of the heart,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>proceed the issues of life,</hi> Prov. 4.23.</p>
               <p>The <hi>choice</hi> then as well as the <hi>practice</hi> of our <hi>Duty</hi>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:66440:144"/>
is plainly necessary to render it <hi>available</hi> to our <hi>salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But on the other side if we <hi>chuse sin,</hi> although we miss of opportunity to <hi>act</hi> it, the bare <hi>choice,</hi> without the <hi>practice,</hi> is <hi>sufficient</hi> to our <hi>condemnation.</hi> For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>that,</hi> when we proceed no <hi>further,</hi> our <hi>heart</hi> has gone <hi>astray</hi> from God, and we are <hi>polluted</hi> by the sin which we resolve upon in our own <hi>choice</hi>; since <hi>out of the heart,</hi> as our Saviour tells us, <hi>proceeds the pollution of the man,</hi> Matth. 15.19, 20. We may <hi>commit</hi> all sort of transgressions, and <hi>incurr</hi> the punishment of them merely by <hi>consenting</hi> to them inwardly in our <hi>hearts,</hi> without ever compleating them in our <hi>outward operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> For our Lord himself has thus determined it in one instance, and the Case is the same in all the rest. <hi>Whosoever looks upon a woman to lust after her,</hi> or so long till his heart consent to commit lewdness with her if he could, <hi>he,</hi> though he never meet with an <note n="e" place="margin">

               <p>No man then may venture to <hi>will</hi> and <hi>chuse</hi> any <hi>one sin,</hi> and yet presume he is <hi>innocent.</hi> For if <hi>fear,</hi> or <hi>shame,</hi> or <hi>interest,</hi> or other <hi>bye-motive</hi> and <hi>worldly end,</hi> or <hi>want of opportunity,</hi> hinder him from the <hi>outward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting</hi> and <hi>compleating</hi> of his <hi>sin</hi>; yet if his <hi>heart</hi> stands for it, and all the while he <hi>wills</hi> and <hi>chuses</hi> it, he is <hi>guilty</hi> in the Accounts of God as if he had <hi>committed</hi> it. We disobey in <hi>willing</hi> as well as in <hi>doing,</hi> and shall suffer for a wicked <hi>choice,</hi> as well as for a wicked <hi>practice.</hi> So that as ever we hope to have our <hi>obedience</hi> to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Laws avail us unto <hi>life</hi> and <hi>pardon</hi> at the last Day, we must take care to perform it, as with our <hi>minds</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> so with our <hi>hearts</hi> or <hi>wills</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
               <p>As for these <hi>three</hi> faculties therefore, <hi>viz.</hi> our <hi>minds,</hi>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:66440:145"/>
our <hi>wills,</hi> and our <hi>affections</hi>; they must necessarily be devoted to God's service, to make up an <hi>intire</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. As ever we hope for <hi>Heaven,</hi> we must employ our minds upon <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Laws</hi> so far at least, till we <hi>love</hi> them in our <hi>souls,</hi> and <hi>chuse</hi> them in our <hi>hearts</hi> with full purpose and resolution of performing them.

And as ever we expect to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape the torments of <hi>Hell,</hi> we must take care that we entertain no <hi>thoughts</hi> or <hi>desires</hi> of any <hi>sin</hi> so <hi>long,</hi> till in our <hi>hearts</hi> we become <hi>concerned</hi> for it, and <hi>willing</hi> to fulfil it. But if we will <hi>look</hi> on it, it must be in order to <hi>loath</hi> and <hi>disdain</hi> it. We must consider how <hi>disingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> how <hi>shameful,</hi> and how <hi>mischievous</hi> a thing it is; and indulge to no apprehensions of it in our <hi>minds,</hi> that are like to insnare either our <hi>choice</hi> or <hi>practice</hi>; nor <hi>dwell upon</hi> any but those that are apt to kindle our <hi>indignation</hi> and <hi>zeal</hi> against it, and arm our <hi>wills</hi> with full <hi>purpose</hi> to overcome it.</p>
               <p>This must be the use and exercise of all our inward <hi>powers</hi> and <hi>principles</hi> of action.

                  <p>God is to be obeyed with the fourth faculty, <hi>viz.</hi> our exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive or bodily powers, and outward operations. The great difficulty of Obedience in this instance. Four false grounds whereupon men shift off the necessity of this service with their works and actions. First, A hope to be saved for a true belief or orthodox opinions. Mens confidence in this represented. The folly of it. Orthodox faith and professions no further available, than they produce obedient works and actions. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, A hope of salvation upon an obedience of idle desires and ineffective wishes. An opinion of some Casuists, That a desire of Grace is Grace, refuted. This stated, and a distinct explication of what is promised to the desire of Obedience, and what to Obedience it self. The pretence for this acceptance of idle desires from <hi>Gal. 5.17.</hi> considered. An account when the will and desire is taken for the deed and performance. That Text <hi>2 Cor. 8.11, 12.</hi> plainly vindicated. Thirdly, A hope of being saved notwithstanding they do sin, because they are insnared into it through the strength of temptations. The folly of this. Our own lusts make temptations strong. The Grace of the Gospel is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to overcome them. Fourthly, A hope of being excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed because they transgress with an unwilling mind. These mens state represented. Vnwillingness in sin a

mitigation, but no sufficient excuse. Some strugling in most actions both of good and bad men. The strife of the Flesh and Spirit. Two sorts of men feel nothing of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Saints in Heaven after the Resurrection, and some prostigate sinners here now on Earth. All good men, and the generality of evil are subject to it in this life. Mens peremptory will and last choice deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines their condition.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>A <hi>Fourth</hi> faculty that is indispensably necessary to the <hi>integrity</hi> of our Obedience, and which is the chief <hi>end</hi> and <hi>perfection,</hi> and gets acceptance for all the rest, is our <hi>strength,</hi> or <hi>bodily</hi> and <hi>executive powers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the completion and crown of all, we must <hi>do</hi> as well as <hi>think</hi> and <hi>desire,</hi> and our obedient <hi>choice</hi> must end in an obedient <hi>practice.</hi> For all our <hi>inward</hi> moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are in order to <hi>outward</hi> operations, they must go on to good effects, before they are fit for the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; we must <hi>work</hi> as well as <hi>desire,</hi> and not only <hi>will,</hi> but <hi>do</hi> our <hi>duty,</hi> because upon nothing less than that we shall at the last day be accepted.</p>
               <p>This indeed is the <hi>severe</hi> service, and the <hi>distastfull</hi> part of duty. It is a matter of much <hi>labour</hi> and <hi>pains,</hi> of much <hi>strife</hi> and <hi>contention.</hi> For <hi>the doing of our Duty</hi> is the <hi>top</hi> of all, every hinderance must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and every difficulty overcome before we can attain to it. Our <hi>scruples</hi> and <hi>gainsaying reasonings</hi> must be <hi>silenced,</hi> our <hi>discouraging fears</hi> quieted, and all our <hi>repugnant desires cooled</hi> or <hi>conquered:</hi> Every <hi>doubt</hi> of our <hi>minds</hi> must be <hi>solved,</hi> and every <hi>hostile lust sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued</hi> e're we can <hi>act</hi> what we are <hi>required.</hi> A <hi>secret wish,</hi> or a <hi>sudden desire</hi> of Obedience may start up in our souls <hi>unawares,</hi> and there is not much opposition made to it, because our lusts receive no great hurt from it. For the pleasure of our lusts lies in <hi>acting</hi> and <hi>fulfilling</hi>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:66440:147"/>
them, they are secure of their own delights, so long as they are of our practice. And therefore they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us to <hi>think</hi> of <hi>good,</hi> to spend a <hi>faint wish,</hi> a <hi>sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den inclination,</hi> or a <hi>fruitless desire</hi> upon it. But if once we would go on to <hi>do</hi> our <hi>Duty,</hi> and to <hi>work Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> then begins the conflict. Our Lusts then bestir themselves with <hi>might</hi> and <hi>main,</hi> and set every <hi>faculty</hi> awork to <hi>resist</hi> and <hi>defeat</hi> it. For our <hi>thoughts</hi> begin to <hi>argue,</hi> and to <hi>pick quarrels</hi> with our <hi>Duty.</hi> They sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest all its <hi>difficulties</hi> and <hi>dammages.</hi> They represent all the <hi>pains</hi> of the undertaking to <hi>cool</hi> our <hi>love</hi>; the <hi>appendant dangers</hi> to <hi>raise</hi> our <hi>fears</hi>; and the <hi>great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards</hi> to <hi>shake</hi> our <hi>hopes,</hi> and make us <hi>despair</hi> of <hi>success.</hi> For the <hi>sake</hi> of our <hi>sins</hi> we <hi>arm</hi> all <hi>discouraging passions,</hi> and quite <hi>stifle</hi> all the <hi>obedient suggestions</hi> of our <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.</hi> For either we <hi>soften</hi> our <hi>sin</hi> by <hi>excuses,</hi> or <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie</hi> it by <hi>arguments,</hi> or <hi>overlook</hi> it by <hi>ignorance, heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less inconsideration</hi> and <hi>forgetfulness.</hi> Either we will <hi>act</hi> it <hi>rashly</hi> through the power of a strong lust, and not <hi>consider</hi> it at all, or else <hi>think</hi> of it only to <hi>lessen</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend</hi> it. And when by the opposition of our <hi>Lusts</hi> to the <hi>perfecting</hi> and <hi>performing</hi> of our <hi>Duty,</hi> our <hi>spiritual strengths</hi> are thus <hi>weakned,</hi> and our <hi>lusts advanced,</hi> when our <hi>passions rise,</hi> and our <hi>minds plead</hi> against it; <hi>then</hi> is the <hi>strife,</hi> and <hi>there</hi>'s the <hi>toil</hi> and <hi>difficulty</hi> of <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And because in this <hi>obedience of our works and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> there is so much <hi>difficulty,</hi> therefore are most peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple so desirous to <hi>shift</hi> it off, and so forward to take up with any thing which will <hi>save</hi> them the <hi>labour</hi> of it. They perswade themselves that God will admit of easier <hi>terms,</hi> and build their <hi>hopes</hi> upon <hi>cheaper services</hi>; in particular upon these <hi>Four:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> A <hi>true belief,</hi> or <hi>orthodox opinions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> An obedience of <hi>idle desires,</hi> and <hi>ineffective wishes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:66440:148"/>And if for all these they continue still to <hi>do</hi> what <hi>God forbids,</hi> and to <hi>work</hi> disobedience; then their hope is to be saved notwithstanding it, because</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Their <hi>falling</hi> is through the power of a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>overpowering temptation,</hi> which they <hi>see</hi> and <hi>resist,</hi> but <hi>cannot prevail over.</hi> So that</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Their <hi>transgression</hi> is with <hi>reluctance</hi> and <hi>unwillingness,</hi> their <hi>service of Sin</hi> is an <hi>unwilling</hi> and a <hi>slavish service.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>first</hi> false ground whereby men elude all the necessity of serving God with their <hi>strength</hi> or <hi>executive powers</hi> in <hi>outward works</hi> and <hi>operations,</hi> is their confidence of being saved for a <hi>true belief,</hi> or a <hi>right knowledge in religious matters,</hi> and <hi>orthodox opinions.</hi> They turn all <hi>Religion</hi> into a matter of <hi>study</hi> and <hi>speculation,</hi> as if it required only a <hi>good head,</hi> and a <hi>discerning judgment.</hi> They make it a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>skill,</hi> but not of <hi>practice</hi>; an <hi>exercise</hi> of <hi>wit</hi> and <hi>parts,</hi> but not a <hi>rule</hi> of <hi>action.</hi> For the <hi>faith</hi> which they expect should <hi>save</hi> them, with some men goes no further than the <hi>mind,</hi> and consists barely in <hi>right no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>apprehensions.</hi> They take it to be nothing more but an <hi>understanding what Christ has said,</hi> a being able to <hi>reason upon it,</hi> and to <hi>argue for it,</hi> and in their own <hi>minds approving</hi> and <hi>consenting</hi> to it. And that not to all that Christ has revealed neither. For the <hi>Precepts</hi> or <hi>Commands</hi> it <hi>overlooks,</hi> and doth not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with; the <hi>threatnings</hi> it either <hi>considers not</hi> at all, or if it do, it takes them not to be due to that whereunto God has fixed them, <hi>(viz.) disobedience of practice,</hi> but only to <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>unbelief.</hi> But all that which their faith <hi>eyes,</hi> and which their minds <hi>solely,</hi> or at least <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally</hi> approve of, is the <hi>historical passages</hi> of <hi>Christs life and death,</hi> the <hi>doctrinal points</hi> which he has told us <hi>concerning God</hi> or <hi>himself,</hi> and the <hi>comfortable promises</hi>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:66440:148"/>
of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> They believe what <hi>Christ</hi> is, what he has <hi>done</hi> and <hi>suffered</hi> for us, and what he has <hi>promised</hi> to us: they <hi>think right</hi> in all the <hi>Religious Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies</hi> that are on foot in the world, <hi>joyning</hi> themselves with the <hi>Orthodox men,</hi> and <hi>siding,</hi> as they presume, with the true Opinion; they <hi>profess Christs Religion,</hi> and are <hi>Members</hi> of his <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>adhere</hi> to the <hi>right party</hi> of <hi>Christians,</hi> and to the <hi>purest Congregation,</hi> and that they conclude is enough to bring them to <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if any think, as God be praised, many do, that God requires more than the bare service of our <hi>minds</hi> and <hi>right apprehensions</hi>; yet even a great part of them fancy, that all which he requires besides is only the <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> of their <hi>tongues</hi> and <hi>discourses.</hi> If they <hi>believe</hi> with the <hi>mind,</hi> and <hi>confess</hi> with the <hi>mouth,</hi> although they are <hi>rebellious</hi> and <hi>reprobate in their practice,</hi> they are <hi>satisfied</hi> of their <hi>Godly estate,</hi> and presume that God is so too. Their Religion is made up of <hi>lip-service,</hi> for they think to content God by <hi>heavenly talk,</hi> and <hi>pious conference,</hi> by larding all their discourses with the <hi>Name of God,</hi> and <hi>shreds of Scripture</hi>; all their <hi>conversation</hi> is <hi>holy phrase,</hi> and <hi>sanctified form</hi> of speaking; and this they hope will attone for all the <hi>lewdness</hi> and <hi>disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> of their <hi>lives</hi> and <hi>actions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if they proceed yet further to a <hi>Faith</hi> that reacheth beyond the <hi>mind</hi> and the <hi>tongue,</hi> and think it necessary that it sink down from the <hi>head</hi> into the <hi>heart</hi>; yet there they will allow God to expect no great matters. They hope he will be well pleased, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it summon not up all our <hi>Affections</hi> for his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, if it produce in us these <hi>two easie</hi> passions, which are raised without much adoe, and may well be spared, <hi>(viz.)</hi> a <hi>strong confidence,</hi> and a <hi>warm zeal.</hi> If to make it <hi>saving</hi> it must imply a joynt concurrence of our <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:66440:149"/>
it shall be only of these <hi>two.</hi> It shall add <hi>hope</hi> to <hi>knowledge,</hi> and be a <hi>belief that God will save sinners,</hi> with a <hi>special hope,</hi> and <hi>fancifull confidence</hi> that he will in <hi>particular</hi> save them. It shall add <hi>Zeal</hi> to <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy,</hi> a warm heart to a sound head, and be no more but a <hi>maintaining</hi> of and <hi>stickling for right opinions,</hi> and <hi>against erroneous</hi> and <hi>false</hi> ones, with <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus do men delude themselves into great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and vain expectations from a <hi>faith</hi> that is <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fruit,</hi> from an <hi>orthodox,</hi> but <hi>empty knowledge,</hi> which is void of all <hi>obedient practice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But a <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>belief</hi> which is not more <hi>compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive</hi> in its <hi>nature,</hi> nor has other <hi>effects</hi> than these; they will find to their cost in the event of things, is miserably <hi>delusive</hi> and <hi>vain.</hi> It will serve to no other end but the <hi>heightning</hi> of their <hi>crimes,</hi> and the <hi>encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> of their <hi>condemnation.</hi> For do but consider:</p>
               <p>If we will <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>understand</hi> Christs <hi>Doctrines</hi> and his <hi>Promises,</hi> but <hi>overlook</hi> or <hi>deny</hi> his <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Precepts</hi>; what is this, but instead of <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> to <hi>affront</hi> and <hi>renounce</hi> him? By picking and choosing at this rate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we cast off his power of molding for us a Religion, and fixing the terms of his own mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and make to our selves a condition of our own sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. We follow him so far only as we please our selves, but no further. The compass of our belief it self is not bounded by his authority, or measured ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>his</hi> mind, but <hi>our own.</hi> For we understand and assent, not to every thing that <hi>he</hi> has <hi>said,</hi> but only to what <hi>we</hi> our selves <hi>like.</hi> We refuse to take every thing upon his word, and credit him in what he speaks no longer than it agrees with us. If we believe him, it is only where we matter not whether what he sayes be true or no; but we either give no heed to him, or
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:66440:149"/>
flatly disbelieve him where we have any temptation. His <hi>veracity</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> it self has no power over our very <hi>minds,</hi> beyond what our own <hi>lusts</hi> and <hi>beloved sins</hi> will <hi>suffer</hi> it: but the <hi>Devil</hi> and the <hi>World</hi> must be served in the <hi>first</hi> place by our <hi>Opinions,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> must be forced to take up with <hi>their</hi> leavings.</p>
               <p>Nay what is yet more, by such a <hi>partial</hi> and <hi>squeam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish belief</hi> as this, we do not only give or take at our <hi>own liking</hi> from that attribute of his, which in <hi>believing</hi> we would be thought to honour, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Truth:</hi> but even where we seem to <hi>submit</hi> to it, we <hi>wrong</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it. For we <hi>wrest</hi> his <hi>sense,</hi> and <hi>spoil</hi> his meaning, and <hi>undermine</hi> all that he <hi>intends:</hi> So that even that which we do believe is not <hi>his</hi> mind, but our <hi>own.</hi> For the true meaning of his <hi>Promises,</hi> which run all upon condition of our <hi>Obedience,</hi> we pervert; the force of all his <hi>threatnings,</hi> which denounce <hi>woes</hi> to <hi>every</hi> sin and transgression, we <hi>cancel.</hi> We do as much as in us lies, to <hi>corrupt</hi> his <hi>Word,</hi> and to <hi>belie</hi> his very <hi>Gospel.</hi> We make his whole Religion signifie another thing than what he intended. For we make it <hi>allow</hi> what he <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids,</hi> and <hi>encourage</hi> such as he <hi>threatens</hi>; and <hi>save</hi> those whom at the day of Judgment he will <hi>condemn.</hi> And since this <hi>perverse faith</hi> and <hi>knowledge,</hi> which <hi>believes</hi> what it <hi>likes,</hi> and is <hi>infidel</hi> to all the <hi>rest</hi>; which sets up <hi>one</hi> part of his Word against <hi>another,</hi> by making his <hi>Promises</hi> to undermine his <hi>Precepts,</hi> and the <hi>Truth</hi> of his <hi>Doctrines</hi> to render all his <hi>threatnings false</hi> and useless: I say, since such an untowardly <hi>partial,</hi> and <hi>gainsaying knowledge</hi> and <hi>belief</hi> as <hi>this,</hi> is in very deed so plain a <hi>Libel</hi> to his <hi>Person,</hi> so <hi>hateful</hi> a <hi>violence</hi> to his <hi>Truth,</hi> and such a <hi>contradicting</hi> piece of <hi>Infidelity</hi> to his <hi>Gospel,</hi> it can never be thought to be <hi>that Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> which he <hi>commands</hi> and <hi>encourages,</hi> but such a piece of <hi>contumelious flattery,</hi> and <hi>fawning disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:66440:150"/>
as he will most <hi>severely punish</hi> and <hi>condemn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if we believe his <hi>whole</hi> Gospel, and besides the faith of his <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Promises,</hi> take moreover all his <hi>Precepts</hi> to be such as <hi>he injoyns,</hi> and all his <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,</hi> in their <hi>true</hi> meaning, to be such as he will <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute</hi>; and yet, for all that, in our <hi>works</hi> and <hi>practice despise,</hi> and <hi>sin</hi> against them; then is <hi>such</hi> our faith and knowledge so far from rendring our condition <hi>safe</hi> and <hi>comfortable,</hi> that in very deed it makes it quite <hi>despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi> and utterly bereft of all <hi>colour</hi> and <hi>excuse.</hi> For it takes from us all <hi>plea</hi> for disobedience, and leaves us not <hi>so</hi> much as the <hi>common</hi> refuge of all misdoing, the pretence that <hi>we did offend but did not know it.</hi> It makes every sin which we commit to be acted with a <hi>high hand,</hi> and all our <hi>offences</hi> to become <hi>contempt,</hi> our <hi>disobedience, rebellion,</hi> and our <hi>transgressions, presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> For we sin then with <hi>open</hi> eyes, we know Gods Commands, but refuse to practise them; we discern our duty, but despise it.

We are condemn'd out of our own mouths if we commend Christs Religion, whilst we contemn and disobey it: Every word which we speak in its behalf, is a charge against our own selves, and every Plea which we make for <hi>it,</hi> is to <hi>us</hi> an accusation.

               </p>
               <p>It is a <hi>strange</hi> conceit which some people have been taught, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the desire of Grace is Grace,</hi> and that <hi>God will</hi> at the last Day <hi>judge men to have obeyed,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have not <hi>wrought,</hi> but only <hi>desired</hi> it.

O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is not desired so much as their ease; for they love it not so well, as to be at the necessary pains for it. It is a squeamish delicate desire; it would obey if that could be without trouble, but it will undergo nothing for obedience.</p>

A man doth not presently <hi>possess meat</hi> because he is <hi>hungry,</hi> or is <hi>Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of a <hi>great Estate</hi> because he is <hi>covetous</hi>; no, he must <hi>labour</hi> and <hi>seek,</hi> as well as <hi>desire,</hi> both for the <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>other,</hi> or else let him desire what he will, he shall <hi>get</hi> neither.</p>
               <p>'Tis true a <hi>desire of money</hi> is a great <hi>preparative</hi> to <hi>get money,</hi> and a <hi>desire of knowledg</hi> a good <hi>disposition</hi> to <hi>attain knowledg</hi>; because our <hi>appetites</hi> and <hi>desires</hi> are, of all the <hi>passions,</hi> the <hi>great</hi> and most <hi>immediate Spring</hi> of our <hi>outward works</hi> and <hi>operations.</hi> For <hi>delight</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>love</hi> ends in <hi>desire,</hi> and <hi>desire</hi> carries us on to <hi>work</hi> and <hi>labour</hi> for the thing desired. We seek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:66440:152"/>
a thing, because we long for it; and take pains a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, because we desire it. And thus our <hi>desires of Grace</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> are <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi> That is, Our <hi>desire of Grace</hi> is not <hi>Grace</hi> it self; nor our <hi>desire of Obedience, Obedience</hi>; but a <hi>good step</hi> and <hi>degree</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. It is so <hi>metonymically,</hi> it is the <hi>Principle</hi> and the <hi>Cause</hi> of it. For therefore we acquire Grace, and perform Obedience; because we desire them. We should take no pains about them, were it not for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of them; but because we have a mind to them, therefore we labour after them.</p>
               <p>But till our desires come on to <hi>this effect,</hi> they have no title to the rewards of <hi>it.</hi> Because although <hi>they</hi> are a <hi>gift</hi> of Gods Grace, 'tis true, as well as <hi>Obedience</hi> it self is; yet are they not <hi>that</hi> Grace which in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall <hi>entitle</hi> us to pardon and happiness. For the <hi>promise</hi> to the <hi>Desire of Obedience</hi> is <hi>one</hi>; but the <hi>promise</hi> to <hi>Obedience</hi> it self is <hi>another.</hi> If we <hi>sincerely desire</hi> to <hi>do Gods will, i. e.</hi> if we desire it so, as according to the best of our power to endeavour after it; the <hi>promise</hi> to that is, That <hi>we shall be inabled to do it.</hi> For one promise of the <hi>New Covenant</hi> is, That <hi>God will grant unto us to serve him in holiness and righteousness,</hi> Luke 1.74, 75; which he will <hi>then</hi> do, <hi>when</hi> we <hi>desire</hi> it of him, by <hi>giving his holy Spirit to them that ask him,</hi> Luke 11.13. But if we do <hi>indeed</hi> obey it, the promise to that is, That we shall be saved by it. For <hi>Christ is become the Authour of eternal salvation to them that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5.9. And it is said expresly of <hi>them</hi> that <hi>obey,</hi> That <hi>they shall have right to the tree of life,</hi> Rev. 22.14. So that to the <hi>honest desire</hi> of obedience, all that God <hi>promises</hi> is the <hi>power to perform</hi> and <hi>work obedience</hi>; but <hi>that</hi> whereunto <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>life</hi> is promised, is nothing less than <hi>obedience</hi> it self. For to <hi>the working out our salvation</hi> it is required, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> says, that we be
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:66440:152"/>
wrought upon, not only to <hi>will</hi> what God commands, but also to <hi>do</hi> it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13.</p>
               <p>The great pretence whereby men of idle, unworking desires would plead for their unfruitfulness, and support their hopes of a happy Sentence under a life of disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; is a mistaken sence of these words of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistle to the Galatians: <hi>The Flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the Flesh; so that ye cannot do the things that ye would,</hi> Gal. 5.17. Which words they interpret thus: The <hi>Spirit</hi> in all good men <hi>lusteth</hi> against the <hi>Flesh,</hi> but not so <hi>far</hi> as to <hi>prevail over</hi> it: for although they may <hi>will</hi> and <hi>desire</hi> with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> yet they cannot <hi>do</hi> those things which they <hi>would.</hi> And if this be so, 'tis plain that we have warrant enough to hope for mercy notwithstanding we only <hi>desire,</hi> but are not able to <hi>perform.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is a plain perverting of the Apostles words from the Apostles own meaning. For although he says that the <hi>lusting</hi> is on <hi>both</hi> sides, both of the <hi>Flesh</hi> against the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and of the <hi>Spirit</hi> against the <hi>Flesh</hi>; yet as for the <hi>ineffectiveness,</hi> or <hi>not doing what is willed and desired,</hi> that he charges only upon <hi>one.</hi> He leaves <hi>it</hi> purely and solely to the <hi>Fleshes</hi> share, which can indeed <hi>lust</hi> and <hi>desire</hi> evil things even in <hi>regenerate</hi> men, but is not able to prevail so far as to <hi>work</hi> and <hi>effect</hi> them, because the <hi>over-ruling</hi> will of the <hi>Spirit</hi> checks and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains it. Through the victorious <hi>lusting of the Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Flesh,</hi> saith he, it comes to pass that <hi>you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do</hi> or <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> do not <hi>those things which</hi> from the instigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your Flesh <hi>you desire</hi> and <hi>would</hi> do. And to shew this to be his sense, I need do no more than set down his words in that order wherein they stand; which is as follows: <hi>This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not</hi> work and <hi>fulfil the lusts of the Flesh.</hi> Not work and fulfil them, I say, notwithstanding you
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:66440:153"/>
will still feel an ineffective and unconquering stirring of them. <hi>For the Flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the Flesh, and these two are contrary one to the other. So that</hi> in walking or working, as I said, after the lustings and desires of the Spirit, you fulfil not the lusts of the Flesh which are contrary to it; <hi>ye cannot do,</hi> or you do not <hi>the things</hi> that your Flesh lusts after, which <hi>yet,</hi> through its lusting, <hi>ye would,</hi> ver. 16, 17. Whereas if this <hi>last</hi> Clause were expounded thus, <hi>Ye do not the things that your Spirit lusts after, which yet, through its lusting, ye would do</hi>; it would destroy that which the Apostle brings it to <hi>confirm, viz.</hi> their not <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> and <hi>desiring</hi> only, but <hi>doing</hi> or <hi>walking</hi> also <hi>after the Spirit,</hi> so as <hi>not to fulfil the works of the Flesh,</hi> ver. 16. Which in plain English is to make the Apostle in the same breath to <hi>say</hi> and <hi>unsay,</hi> to tell them of <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>not fulfilling the lusts of the Flesh</hi>; because they <hi>do not after the Spirit,</hi> but <hi>do fulfil the lusts of the Flesh.</hi> Which is flatly to make the Apostles proof to contradict the Apostles affirmation.</p>
               <p>If therefore we would approve our selves regenerate, and have a just hope of life and pardon at the last Day; we must not only <hi>wish</hi> and <hi>desire,</hi> but <hi>live</hi> and <hi>walk</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Spirit,</hi> The service of the <hi>Flesh</hi> indeed must go no further than <hi>desire</hi>; and although we shall all of us more or less have lustings from it, yet must we not <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 13.14.</note> fulfil them. But as for the service of <hi>God,</hi> it must have our <hi>hands</hi> as well as our <hi>hearts</hi>; for it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to <hi>will</hi> and <hi>desire</hi> what he commands, but we must moreover <hi>practise</hi> and <hi>perform</hi> it.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>affirmative</hi> Commands of God; it is not required that we perform every one of them at <hi>every time</hi>; for so our whole life would be taken up in the keeping of one Command, and we could never observe <hi>all,</hi> since we cannot do any <hi>two</hi> things, and much less
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:66440:153"/>
such a <hi>multitude</hi> at the same time. But all <hi>that</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which God requires of us to <hi>them,</hi> is that we act them as his <hi>Providence,</hi> and ordering of <hi>times</hi> and <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> gives us <hi>opportunity.</hi> Now although for the main Body and greatest Number of them, <hi>every man</hi> has op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities returning almost <hi>every day</hi>; yet for a <hi>perfect</hi> and compleat performance of some of them, <hi>some men</hi> have not opportunity at <hi>some times,</hi> nor <hi>others</hi> in <hi>all their lives.</hi> I instance in the affirmative Command of <hi>Alms-giving.</hi> A man that has <hi>but little,</hi> can give but little at any time; and a <hi>rich</hi> man, if he be in a strange place, and have no great stock about him, although he have a great Object of Charity, can yet make but small relief. So that in <hi>both</hi> these the <hi>work</hi> of Alms and <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward performance,</hi> must needs be very <hi>strait</hi>; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>both</hi> of them in their <hi>hearts</hi> and desires are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so <hi>liberal.</hi> They have not power and opportunity to <hi>act</hi> as they <hi>would</hi>; they would perform more if their circumstances would allow it. And now in this Case God doth not <hi>measure</hi> their <hi>obedience</hi> by the <hi>size</hi> of their <hi>outward performance</hi>; he looks not so much at what <hi>was done,</hi> as at what <hi>would have been done</hi> had they had ability. So that they shall be accepted according to the <hi>greatness</hi> of their <hi>will,</hi> and not according to the <hi>narrowness</hi> of their <hi>deed</hi>; and their reward shall be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to what was in their heart, and not that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in their action.</p>
               <p>And <hi>this</hi> very Case is expresly determined by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> in his <hi>second</hi> Epistle to the Corinthians. For exhorting <hi>them</hi> to contribute to the relief of the Saints in <hi>Judea,</hi> as the <hi>poor</hi> Christians in <hi>Macedonia</hi> had already done most <hi>liberally,</hi> he encourages them to give what they could out of their present livelihood, by telling them, that albeit it were not so much as they could wish, and were forward in their own hearts to give if they were
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:66440:154"/>
able; yet in Gods acceptance it should be estimated as if it were. For <hi>if there be first a willing mind,</hi> saith he, <hi>it is accepted according to what a man hath, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what he hath not,</hi> chap. 8. vers. 11, 12.</p>
               <p>This is the very case for which the Apostle layes down this rule, as any man may see who will be at the pains to peruse that Chapter. He speaks it upon no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occasion, but where our <hi>wills</hi> are really ready to perform farther than our <hi>outward fortune</hi> enables us. He gives it as an <hi>Axiome</hi> only where our inward reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions are larger than our possessions. For where our heart is indeed ready to do <hi>more,</hi> than in our neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitous circumstances we <hi>can</hi> do; there God looks upon the <hi>will,</hi> and not upon the <hi>work</hi>; and rewards us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>compass</hi> of our <hi>desires,</hi> but not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>scantiness</hi> of our <hi>performance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if any man shall conclude from hence, that when it is <hi>in his Power</hi> to do what is commanded, God will still accept of an <hi>idle desire</hi> without an <hi>active perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi>; he may use S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>words</hi> indeed, but he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts them wholly to his <hi>own meaning.</hi> For the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle spake them in <hi>one</hi> case, and there they are <hi>true</hi>; but he applies them to <hi>another,</hi> and there they will <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> him. Because the <hi>will</hi> is never accepted for the <hi>deed,</hi> when it is in our power to <hi>do</hi> as well as to <hi>will</hi>; and wheresoever we have opportunity to <hi>do</hi> what we <hi>desire,</hi> it is not the <hi>willing,</hi> but the <hi>doing</hi> that must <hi>save</hi> us; as the Apostle himself intimates in this very place, when he presses them to compleat their <hi>readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to will,</hi> by <hi>performing</hi> according as they were able, <hi>vers.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>So that this thinking to be saved by an <hi>idle desire,</hi> and an <hi>ineffective wish</hi> of obedience, without ever obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our <hi>works</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> is very whit as false and delusive as the <hi>former</hi> deceitfull ground was, of being
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:66440:154"/>
saved at the last day barely upon the account of an <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Faith</hi> and <hi>Opinions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Another false ground whereupon men hope to be saved, though they <hi>work</hi> disobedience, is because when they do so, it is through the <hi>violence</hi> of a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>overpowering temptation,</hi> which they <hi>see</hi> and <hi>resist,</hi> but cannot <hi>prevail over.</hi> They are drawn in by a <hi>great gain,</hi> or a <hi>great pleasure,</hi> the <hi>bait</hi> laid for them is <hi>very enticing,</hi> and there is <hi>no withstanding</hi> it.</p>
               <p>This indeed is a <hi>great</hi> and an <hi>usual</hi> pretence. For men would gladly shift off their sin, and charge it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any thing but their own selves. They would have the <hi>pleasures of their flesh,</hi> and the <hi>pride of their hearts</hi> both served at once, enjoy all the <hi>pleasures of sin,</hi> and yet have the <hi>praises of virtue.</hi>

                  <hi>It is ridiculous to think,</hi> sayes the same excellent Philosopher, <hi>that the pleasure of the sin which is without us, is the cause of our sinfull action; and not rather that we our selves are, who are so wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclined, as to be so easily taken by it.</hi> It is only the strength of our <hi>own sinfull lusts,</hi> that gives such an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistible strength to the <hi>outward temptation.</hi> A <hi>great offer of gain</hi> indeed cannot be withstood by a <hi>covetous heart</hi>; and an <hi>inviting beauty,</hi> and a <hi>fair opportunity</hi> are irresistible to a <hi>slave of lust,</hi> and a lascivious reigning inclination. But if the man is <hi>above the world,</hi> and his <hi>heart is chaste,</hi> they are of no <hi>force,</hi> nor can they offer <hi>any violence</hi> at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:66440:155"/>It is the <hi>wickedness of our own hearts lusts</hi> therefore, which are so deeply in love with them, and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridledly bend after them, that gives all the <hi>prevailing force,</hi> and <hi>overpowering strength</hi> to the <hi>outward tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But now this is our <hi>Sin,</hi> and so can by no means plead our <hi>excuse</hi>; it is our <hi>damnable disease,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can never prove our <hi>saving remedy.</hi> For this is that <hi>reigning power</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> which the <hi>Gospel</hi> has indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensably required us to <hi>mortifie,</hi> but not to <hi>submit</hi> to. It is only <hi>if you through the spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, that you shall live,</hi> Rom. 8.13. Col. 3.5.</p>
               <p>But if we are not under this <hi>damnable servitude</hi> to <hi>Sin,</hi> there are no <hi>temptations</hi> so <hi>strong,</hi> but that <hi>God</hi> has given us <hi>sufficient defensatives</hi> against them. For the present offer of a <hi>Gibbet</hi> would fright away the most <hi>endearing temptation</hi>; the near expectation of a <hi>great Estate,</hi> or of a <hi>Crown,</hi> would make us prevail over it. And what are <hi>these</hi> to <hi>hell fire,</hi> and an <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Crown of Glory? <hi>Heaven</hi> therefore and <hi>Hell,</hi> when they can be considered of, are an answer to all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the world; they will engage our hearts <hi>more</hi> than all the <hi>endearments</hi> of a lust, and infinitely <hi>out do</hi> all the <hi>baits</hi> and <hi>allurements</hi> of sin.</p>
               <p>If we commit sin then, it is no <hi>sufficient</hi> excuse to us that the <hi>temptation</hi> was <hi>strong,</hi> because it was only the <hi>strength</hi> of our own <hi>unmortified lusts</hi> that made it so. For we <hi>loved</hi> the <hi>sinfull pleasure</hi> too well, and that was the reason why it <hi>overpower'd</hi> us. And since the strength of temptation is owing only to the strength of sin, it can never excuse us from undergoing punishment. So that <hi>this</hi> must needs be a false hope, to think of being excused for our sin, because we acted it through the <hi>violence of a great temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:66440:155"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Another ground of false confidence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon men hope to be saved although they do not <hi>obey</hi> in their <hi>works</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> but are workers of sin and disobedience; is, because when they do <hi>transgress,</hi> it is with <hi>reluctance</hi> and <hi>unwillingness.</hi> Albeit in their <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> they do <hi>serve sin,</hi> yet in their <hi>minds</hi> they do not <hi>approve</hi> of it, their service of it is an <hi>unwilling</hi> and a <hi>slavish service.</hi> They cannot sin freely, and at their own ease, but with fearfulness and regret. For the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of their</hi> duty abides in their <hi>Consciences,</hi> the <hi>fear of hell torments</hi> sticks fast in their <hi>souls</hi>; they cannot shake off either their <hi>sense of duty,</hi> or their <hi>fears of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</hi> So that even when they do sin against God, it is with <hi>remorse</hi> of mind and <hi>fearfulness</hi> of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. They cannot embrace their sin with a <hi>full choice,</hi> because they know that it is not an <hi>unmixed</hi> pleasure. They believe and know it to be of a <hi>compound</hi> and <hi>mixt nature</hi>; to have some <hi>present pleasure</hi> which will delight, but withall much <hi>future punishment</hi> which will torment them. And since they know it to be a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi> of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>ill,</hi> they do not <hi>perfectly</hi> either <hi>love</hi> or <hi>hate, choose</hi> or <hi>refuse</hi> it. Their will is <hi>distracted</hi> by different motives in the same choice; for the <hi>future pains</hi> would draw them to <hi>reject,</hi> but the <hi>present joyes</hi> invite them to <hi>embrace</hi> it. So that in a different <hi>degree</hi> they both <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>nill</hi> the same thing; they would <hi>have</hi> it, and yet they would <hi>avoid</hi> it. For they would enjoy what they desire, but withall they would keep off from what they fear: they have a mind to commit the sin, because it will please them for the <hi>present</hi>; and yet they are afraid of it, because of that wrath which it treasures up for them against the time to come.</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding all this <hi>conflict</hi> in their own <hi>choice,</hi> yet at last their <hi>sin prevails,</hi> and they <hi>obey</hi> it. For they had <hi>rather</hi> hazard all its torments, than miss
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:66440:156"/>
of its delights; they are unwilling to venture upon those dangers which it brings, but yet they had rather venture on <hi>them</hi> than go without <hi>it.</hi> They sin <hi>unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly</hi> just as a <hi>labourer works,</hi> or as a <hi>soldier fights un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly</hi>; that is, they do not <hi>will</hi> it for <hi>it self,</hi> they would <hi>not do</hi> it unless they were <hi>hired</hi> to it. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering <hi>all</hi> things they will to act, and not to omit it; their will is against it indeed at the <hi>first</hi> sight, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>better</hi> consideration it resolves upon it, and all things laid together they choose to commit the sin rather than to forbear it.</p>
               <p>But now this is such a <hi>State</hi> as will never bring any man to <hi>Heaven:</hi> For whether he transgress <hi>willingly</hi> or with <hi>reluctancy,</hi> is not the question; but if he <hi>choose</hi> at last to <hi>disobey,</hi> when God comes to judgment he shall be sure to pronounce upon him that <hi>death</hi> which he has established for the punishment of disobedience. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause for all he <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>mistrusts, grumbles</hi> and <hi>repines</hi>; yet he <hi>serves</hi> and <hi>obeys</hi> his <hi>lusts</hi> all the while notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. He works at their will, and doth what they command him. He serves not with a full heart, or a fearless mind; but yet he is their servant still.</p>
               <p>'Tis true indeed, it is some <hi>mitigation</hi> of his sin that he doth it with <hi>regret,</hi> and the transgression is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the less for being acted not without reluctance and aversion. It shews that his <hi>sense of duty</hi> is not <hi>quite lost</hi>; his <hi>Conscience, wholly fear'd,</hi> or his <hi>fear</hi> of God <hi>utterly extinguished.</hi> It is some extenuation that he <hi>startles</hi> at the offence; for it argues that his soul is not <hi>wholly depraved,</hi> or his heart <hi>harden'd</hi> in disobedience. But although his sins be not of the <hi>highest</hi> rate, yet he is a <hi>lost</hi> sinner still. For so long as his <hi>lusts</hi> prevail, and he chooses at last to <hi>act</hi> and <hi>commit</hi> them, he <hi>serves</hi> and <hi>obeys</hi> them. It is his <hi>works</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> that must deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his <hi>service</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi>; so that if he <hi>commit</hi> sin,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:66440:156"/>
he is the <hi>servant</hi> of sin. <hi>Willing</hi> or <hi>unwilling</hi> may <hi>exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate</hi> or <hi>heighten</hi> his disobedience, but not utterly <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy</hi> or <hi>alter</hi> the <hi>nature</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>For indeed something of <hi>struggling</hi> and <hi>regret</hi> is to be found in the <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>disobedience</hi> of the greatest part of the world. There being <hi>few</hi> so good, as to obey without all <hi>reluctance</hi>; and <hi>few</hi> so wicked as to sin without all <hi>remorse.</hi> For as long as we are in <hi>this</hi> life, we are a <hi>mixt</hi> and <hi>compound</hi> substance of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body, Flesh</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi> Our <hi>carnal appetite</hi> draws us on to <hi>forbidden</hi> things, to transgress those restraints which Gods Law has set to it, and to <hi>sin.</hi> And our <hi>Conscience</hi> being enlightned with the <hi>knowledge</hi> of Gods Laws, and allured by his <hi>Promises,</hi> and affrighted with his <hi>threatnings</hi>; would perswade us to keep within <hi>his bounds,</hi> and to <hi>act obedience.</hi> Now these <hi>two contrary</hi> and <hi>gainsaying</hi> Principles <hi>distract</hi> our <hi>choice,</hi> and <hi>divide</hi> our wills; so that when we close with <hi>one</hi> of them, it is not without the grudging and reluctance of the <hi>other.</hi> We would, and we would not; one inclines us for a thing, and the other against it. <hi>The flesh,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary one to the other, so that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi> fulfill both their desires, and <hi>do</hi> each of <hi>the things that you would,</hi> Gal. 5.17. If we <hi>obey,</hi> it is through the <hi>repining</hi> of our <hi>appetites</hi>; and if we <hi>transgress,</hi> it is with the <hi>remorse</hi> and <hi>lashings</hi> of our <hi>Consciences:</hi> On <hi>both</hi> sides there is something that is evil, whereof we are <hi>afraid,</hi> and which we <hi>would not</hi>; our will is <hi>imperfect</hi> and with <hi>reluctance</hi>; and we <hi>will</hi> and <hi>choose</hi> in some measure <hi>unwillingly,</hi> whether it be to <hi>work obedience</hi> or <hi>sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Saints</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> indeed after the <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>; 'tis true that they shall have no <hi>gainsaying ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites.</hi> For their <hi>flesh</hi> will be in <hi>perfect</hi> subjection to
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:66440:157"/>
the <hi>spirit</hi>; their <hi>will</hi> shall have nothing to <hi>seduce</hi> it, but shall stand alwayes <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>entire</hi> for <hi>God</hi>; so that they shall obey without <hi>any thing</hi> of <hi>reluctance</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for <hi>some</hi> of the <hi>profligate</hi> and <hi>prophane sinners</hi> here on <hi>earth</hi>; they have <hi>now</hi> already so quite benum'd their <hi>Consciences,</hi> that they neither <hi>allure</hi> nor <hi>threaten, admonish</hi> nor <hi>accuse</hi> them. And they sin without all contention; they transgress, and do not dispute; their lusts hurry them without any opposition; so that they disobey most <hi>willingly,</hi> and free from all <hi>remorse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as for <hi>all</hi> the <hi>good,</hi> and the <hi>generality</hi> of the <hi>wicked</hi> here on <hi>earth,</hi> they are of a <hi>middle</hi> rate. They both of them act through strife and conquest; their consent is courted on <hi>both</hi> sides, and when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with <hi>one,</hi> they must refuse the <hi>other.</hi> Both <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> struggle in them, although at last but <hi>one</hi> prevails. For in the <hi>Regenerate</hi> good man, the flesh stirs, but it cannot conquer; they have bodies, and bodily appetites, but they subdue them, and as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>keep them under,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.27. So that all the while the Spirit <hi>rules</hi> in them, when the flesh doth but in <hi>vain solicite</hi>; this may <hi>tempt,</hi> but it cannot <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern</hi>; for the spirit gives them Laws, its pleasure they perform, and what it commands, that in their actions they obey: But in the <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>disobedient</hi> the case is quite opposite. For in <hi>them,</hi> although their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science smite</hi> them, yet can it not <hi>prevail</hi> with them; it suggests, but they will not hearken; it shews the way, but they will not follow it; in all things their Lusts are the governours of their lives and actions; so that although the lashes of their consciences may sharpen and embitter, yet are they not able to disappoint the service of their sin.</p>
               <p>In <hi>all</hi> the obedience therefore, and in the <hi>greatest
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:66440:157"/>
part</hi> of the transgressions here on <hi>Earth</hi>; there is still something of <hi>strugling</hi> and <hi>reluctance.</hi> Men act not by a <hi>will</hi> that is void of all <hi>restraint,</hi> or by a <hi>desire</hi> and <hi>choice</hi> that is <hi>free</hi> from all <hi>unwillingness</hi>; but there is a <hi>mixture</hi> of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>hatred,</hi> an <hi>unwilling will</hi> that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them on either to act obedience, or to disobey.</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding their <hi>ineffective wishes</hi> and <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect wouldings</hi> to the contrary; it is their <hi>peremptory will</hi> and <hi>last choice</hi> which shall <hi>determine</hi> their <hi>condition.</hi> For if they will and chuse to do what God commands, in spight of all the gainsaying wishes raised by their fleshly Appetites; they shall be pardoned and acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. When the good man overcomes the temptation, and prevails over his unwillingness, and triumphing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it goes on to practise and obey; he shall receive the reward of his obedience. But if they will and chuse to do what God forbids, in spight of all the contrary Admonitions and Threatnings of their Consciences; they shall dye in their disobedience. The Sinner who is carried on to do what he disallows, to work what he fears, and to commit what at first sight his will is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse to; he shall undergo the smart and punishment of his transgression.</p>
               <p>And the reason is plain; for he <hi>serves</hi> his <hi>sin,</hi> and <hi>fulfils</hi> his <hi>lust</hi>; and his <hi>thraldome</hi> to it is so <hi>absolute</hi> that no <hi>aids</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> nor any <hi>suggestions</hi> of his <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> can <hi>deliver</hi> him from it. <hi>He that committeth sin,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>is the servant of sin,</hi> John 8.34. So long as it <hi>conquers,</hi> it doth indeed <hi>inslave</hi> him; <hi>For of whom a man is overcome, of the same,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter, he is brought in bondage,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19. If we yield our selves up to <hi>serve</hi> it, we do indeed <hi>obey</hi> it; and must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that <hi>death</hi> which is denounced upon such obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Know you not,</hi> saith another Apostle, <hi>that to whom you yield your selves servants to obey, his servants
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:66440:158"/>
you are to whom you obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness,</hi> Rom. 6.16. If we are at the beck of our Lusts, and go where they send, and do what they command us, and acknowledge their pleasure in all things to be a Law to us; we are perfect Slaves to them, and liable to all that misery which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced upon them. We serve and obey them; and that shall surely bring us to suffer for them. For it is the <hi>fulfilling</hi> of our lusts, the <hi>doing</hi> or <hi>walking</hi> after them, and the <hi>obeying</hi> of our sin which Christs Gospel <hi>threatens</hi> so severely, whatever <hi>mind</hi> we do it with. <hi>If you live after the Flesh,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>you shall dye</hi>; and it is only <hi>if you through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the Body</hi> that <hi>you shall live,</hi> Rom. 8.13. When Christ comes to Judgment, the enquiry will not be, Whether we sinned with a <hi>full delight,</hi> or with <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>reluctance</hi>; but whether in very deed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>repenting</hi> of it afterwards, we sinned <hi>wilfully,</hi> or transgressed at all. For we have what shall be his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence at that Day, from his own mouth already, <hi>Depart from me ye that work iniquity,</hi> Matth. 7.23.</p>
               <p>So that it will be no sufficient Plea for any man at the last Day, who has disobeyed in <hi>deed</hi> and <hi>wrought</hi> wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, to say, That he did it with <hi>backwardness</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse.</hi> For that which God indispensably requires, is, that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>A further pursuit of this last ground of false confidence. The Plea for it from <hi>Rom. 7.</hi> represented. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed. A Metaschematism usual with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in an odious Topick. The Apostle shown not to speak of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in that Chapter, because of several things there spoken which are not truly applicable to him. This evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced in sundry instances. Nor to have spoken in the person of any regenerate man, which is proved by the same reason, and manifested in sundry Particulars. But to have personated a strugling, but as yet unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Jew, who had no further assistance against his lusts, but the weak and ineffective Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> This shown from the order and design of that Chapter. This whole matter represented in a Paraphrase upon the seventh Chapter, with part of the sixth and the eighth. Two Reasons of the inability of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law to make men wholly obedient; and the perfection, as to them, of the Law of Christ, <hi>viz. First,</hi> The promise of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The promise of the Spirit. Both these were wanting in the Law; and are most clearly supplied in the Gospel. The Jews had the assistance of the Spirit, not by virtue of any Article in their Law; but by the gracious Covenant of the Gospel, which has been confirmed with the world ever since <hi>Adam.</hi> The
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:66440:159"/>
Law mentioned in Scripture as a weak and mean instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the account of these defects. This weakness of the Law set off particularly in this seventh to the <hi>Romans.</hi> No hopes to any man who acts sin from this Chapter; but plain declarations of the necessity of a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obedience shown in several expressions of it to that purpose. A proof of the necessity of this fourth part of integrity, the obedience of our executive powers in our works and actions; and the insignificancy of all the rest when it is wanting.</p>

                  <hi>Paul</hi> himself speaks thus of <hi>sinning against his will,</hi> of doing what he disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and transgressing through the power of a ruling lust against his Conscience: it may well be thought reasonable for any <hi>other</hi> man to conclude himself in a safe condition although he do so likewise. For who would desire to be more perfect than S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul?</hi> Who would ever scruple to have the same Lot in the next World with an Apostle? If an unwillingness in sin, and transgressing with reluctance could bear him out not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he did against his Duty, and in works and actions disobeyed his Lord; who can ever questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but that it will be a sufficient Plea for us also?</p>
               <p>And indeed if S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> had spoken all that of <hi>himself,</hi> and meant it of his own Person; the Inference is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable, and it is not to be doubted but it would. But for a full Answer to this Allegation, it is plain that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> when he expresses all those things in the <hi>first per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> uses that merely out of <hi>modesty,</hi> but not out of <hi>truth.</hi> For he was upon an <hi>odious</hi> Topick, represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>unmortified</hi> state and <hi>sinful</hi> condition of <hi>those</hi> persons, who had no other help against their <hi>Lusts,</hi> but the <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Law of Moses.</hi> And because this was a <hi>Charge</hi> which they who were most guilty would not <hi>love</hi> to <hi>hear</hi> of, that he may <hi>soften</hi> the matter as much as may be, and discover things of so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach with the least offence; he wisely takes all the business, and fathers all the <hi>shameful Narrative</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>himself</hi>; and expresses it, not in <hi>theirs,</hi> to whom it <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> did belong but in his <hi>own person.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for this <hi>Metaschematism,</hi> or speaking things that are <hi>odious</hi> in his <hi>own name,</hi> when indeed they belong not to him, but to <hi>other</hi> men; it is very u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual with the Apostle. For in this Disguise he recites a
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:66440:160"/>
most blasphemous perversion which some men had made of his most pious Doctrine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>If the truth of God,</hi> or his faithfulness in performing his Covenant with us, <hi>hath more ahounded to his Glory through my lye</hi> or unfaithfulness in breaking my Covenant with him (which makes the most that can be for the honour of Gods faithfulness, since no perfidiousness of ours can weary or provoke him out of it) <hi>why yet am I,</hi> not I <hi>Paul,</hi> who could never act thus falsly, or argue thus prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but I blasphemous Objector <hi>judged as a Sinner?</hi> ver. 7. And the same way of speech he observes again, when he charges the wicked lives of those who have given up their names to Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not upon his Religion, but upon their own selves. <hi>If while we seek to be justified by Christ</hi> in the profession of his Religion and not of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>'s Law, <hi>we our selves are still found Sinners</hi> and as fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitious in our lives as ever, <hi>is therefore Christ the Minister of sin? God forbid. For if I build again the things which</hi> at my very Baptism into Christianity <hi>I destroyed,</hi> as 'tis plain all Christians do who after Baptism prove custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Sinners; it is no longer Christ who would rescue and free me from sin, but <hi>I</hi> my self, not I <hi>Paul,</hi> but I flagitious Christian that <hi>make my self a Transgressor,</hi> Gal. 2.17, 18. Thus also he speaks in his own person, when he only personates the <hi>strong</hi> but <hi>uncomplying</hi> Christian, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient,</hi> ver. 12. And when he perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates the <hi>uncharitable</hi> Christian, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>If I have all faith, and have no Charity, what doth it profit</hi> me? ver. 2. And the same inoffensive way he uses in noting faults in <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. ver. 22, 23. and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>And such an obliging disguise in reprehending and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the faults of others is most usual among our selves. Nothing being more common in our ordinary Discourse, than when we would be sharp in repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:66440:160"/>
and inveighing against any thing, by a most courteous Fiction to put it in our <hi>own</hi> Case, and to suppose that <hi>we</hi> our selves should do <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that.</hi> When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the mean time we are no further concerned in it, than to be able under this disguise with more success and less offence to disparage and chastise it.</p>
               <p>And this way of <hi>transferring odious things to our selves</hi> when we would describe and reprove them, which is so usual with all the <hi>world,</hi> and with S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> in other Cases, is particularly used by him in his Character of the ineffective Striver in this seventh <hi>Chapter</hi> of the Epistle to the <hi>Romans.</hi> He speaks not those things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove recited, of <hi>willing but not performing,</hi> &amp;c. in his own person, or in the person of any regenerated man; as will plainly appear from this reason.</p>
               <p>Because in that Chapter such things are said of the person there spoken of, as can by no means agree to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> or to any <hi>regenerate</hi> person; so that the Apostle must be made to falsifie, if he should be understood to speak so of them.</p>
               <p>Such things, I say, are there spoken, as can by no means agree to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

Heaven,</hi> and a <hi>subject of Hell.</hi> So that he cannot speak of himself in that <hi>seventh</hi> Chapter, and in the <hi>other</hi> places too; because then he would appear inconsistent with himself, and be found false in his own story. And therefore as sure as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>These,</hi> with <hi>others</hi> that might be mention'd, are the lines of difference, and the contrary characters of the <hi>person</hi> represented in the <hi>seventh</hi> Chapter to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and the <hi>regenerate man</hi> described by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

And that to give such an account of a <hi>regenerate</hi> man, as is there set down, would not in all appearance be the way to <hi>describe,</hi> but rather <hi>slanderously to libel</hi> and <hi>revile him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any therefore enquire now how I know that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

I know he <hi>doth</hi>

not mean so, because he <hi>cannot</hi> mean so, the things which he sayes not <hi>bearing</hi> to be so understood. For <hi>that meaning</hi> would make his speech to be no <hi>Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Truth,</hi> but an <hi>open falsehood</hi>; it would make S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul inconsistent</hi> with himself, and to <hi>unsay</hi> at <hi>one</hi> time, what he had <hi>said</hi> most <hi>peremptorily</hi> at <hi>another.</hi> It would make him flatly to gainsay all that he has taught elsewhere, yea, even what he had affirm'd almost in the same breath, in the <hi>foregoing</hi> and the <hi>following Chapters.</hi> So that he cannot be understood of himself, or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regenerate person, but must be allow'd, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his usual custome in such odious topicks as this was, to speak all in a borrowed disguise, and in <hi>the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a sinfull</hi> and a <hi>lost man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For indeed, to be yet more particular, all that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course in that <hi>seventh</hi> Chapter is not meant either of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> or of any other <hi>regenerate Christian</hi>; but of a <hi>struggling</hi> and <hi>contending,</hi> although yet <hi>unconquering</hi> and <hi>unregenerate Jew.</hi> For the Apostle is there describing the state, not of a <hi>perfect debauch,</hi> nor of a <hi>perfect Saint,</hi> but of a <hi>middle</hi> man. He is one whose <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> is awaken'd; for <hi>he delights in the Law of God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the inner man</hi> of his mind and reason, <hi>vers.</hi> 22. and when he <hi>doth evil, he doth not allow,</hi> but disapproves of it, <hi>vers.</hi> 15. but yet his <hi>practice</hi> is enslaved; for <hi>to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what is good he finds not,</hi> vers. 18. <hi>what</hi> in his mind <hi>he hates, that he doth,</hi> vers. 15. <hi>the law in his members bringing him into captivity to the law of sin,</hi> so that <hi>with his flesh,</hi> or in his bodily actions, <hi>he obeys the law of sin</hi> still, <hi>vers.</hi> 23, 25. He strives something indeed, but not enough; he is not far from the kingdom of heaven, but as yet he is short of it.

it lays hold of him, and keeps him under; he is in the rank of unwilling sinners, but he is a lost sinner still. He is something above the forelorn condition of meer <hi>Nature,</hi> and something below the more perfect institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Christ</hi>; he is in a middle state between both, under the discipline and assistance of the <hi>Jewish Law,</hi> or the <hi>Religion of Moses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that this is the person there characterized will appear, not only from the <hi>things themselves</hi> that are said of him, and which I have already noted, <hi>(viz.)</hi> his <hi>Conscience being awaken'd, but his practice still en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaved,</hi> which is the very state of <hi>midling sinners</hi>; but also from the whole <hi>order</hi> and <hi>design</hi> of that <hi>seventh</hi> Chapter.</p>
               <p>For the business which the Apostle drives at in the sixth, seventh and eighth Chapters, (to go no farther) of that Epistle, as any man that attentively peruses them may plainly see, is this; <hi>(viz.) To shew the Jews at</hi> Rome <hi>a double change, which they had come under by their becoming Christians. One</hi> was in their <hi>subjection,</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> in the consequent of that, their <hi>service</hi> and <hi>obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One change he tells them is in their <hi>subjection</hi>; for <hi>now they are not subject to, and under the law of Moses, but under the Grace and Gospel of Christ,</hi> chap. 6. vers. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>And upon that change in their <hi>subjection,</hi> there is likewise another change in their <hi>service.</hi> For <hi>now they serve not sin as they did formerly,</hi> but <hi>they serve and obey God,</hi> chap. 6. vers. 15, 16, 17, 18; and chap. 7. vers. 4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>And because this seems to be a great reflexion upon the <hi>Law of Moses,</hi> as if it <hi>encouraged them in their sins,</hi> and <hi>helped to make them sinners</hi>; this latter part, <hi>(viz.) their being wrought into this change of service by change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:66440:166"/>
their Master and Religion,</hi> he explains more fully.</p>
               <p>For to take off all reproach from the <hi>Law,</hi> under which he had affirmed they <hi>served sin</hi>; he shews that the reason why they sinned under it, was not the <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> it self, for <hi>it is holy, and commands holiness,</hi> chap. 7. vers. 12. but the <hi>power</hi> of their own <hi>sinfull lusts,</hi> which were too strong to be <hi>corrected</hi> and <hi>restrained</hi> by those aids which it offer'd towards it, <hi>vers.</hi> 11, 13,—23.</p>
               <p>In the management, and evident proof whereof he shews <hi>two</hi> things:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>One</hi> is the <hi>goodness</hi> and <hi>innocence of the Law,</hi> because, so far as they were influenced by it, they were for that which is <hi>good.</hi> For their <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>Conscience,</hi> wherein the Law was seated, did <hi>approve</hi> of it, and their <hi>heart desired</hi> it, <hi>chap.</hi> 7. <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16, 18, 22.</p>
               <p>The other is the <hi>weakness</hi> and <hi>inability</hi> of that Grace which was offered in the <hi>Law</hi> to work mens <hi>reformation,</hi> and to make this change in their service and obedience. For <hi>notwithstanding it, they served and obeyed sin still,</hi> chap. 7. ver. 15, 19, 21, 23, 25.</p>
               <p>Wherein yet to be more <hi>particular,</hi> he shows further that those <hi>good effects,</hi> which the <hi>Law</hi> was able to work in them, were only in their <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>conscience,</hi> chap. 7. ver. 15, 18, 22, 23. But that still the Law in the Members proved all the while too strong for it, and kept possession of their <hi>life</hi> and <hi>practice,</hi> ver. 15, 17, 18, 21, 23, 25.</p>
               <p>But then as for that <hi>change in their service,</hi> which the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> had not strength enough to work in them; he shows that the Gospel and Grace of Christ has wrought it effectually. For now, since they became <hi>subject to him, they had thrown off the service of sin,</hi> which the Law could not enable them to get quit of, and <hi>had begun to serve and obey him,</hi> chap. 7. ver. 25. and ch. 8. v. 1, 2, 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:66440:167"/>This is the Argument which the Apostle pursues, and the way wherein he manages it, as every man will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive who will be at the pains to peruse those three Chapters as I have pointed them out to him. So that as for all the <hi>ineffective striving</hi> and <hi>sinning, with regret,</hi> which is so often mentioned in the <hi>seventh</hi> Chapter; it belongs not to the <hi>Apostle himself,</hi> nor to any other <hi>regenerate Christian,</hi> but only to a <hi>midling Sinner</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> who is changed something by <hi>Moses</hi>'s <hi>Law,</hi> but not enough; and who is in a way to become a Child of Grace, although for the present he be a Son of Death and Hell.</p>
               <p>This, I say, will appear to be the person, whom S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> sets forth in that so much mistaken <hi>Chapter,</hi> to any man who shall fairly consider those three Chapters, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving that help for the understanding of them which I have already offered.</p>
               <p>But because this is a matter of highest importance, and I would not seem to shun any pains which may in probability make for the satisfaction of any, though but <hi>one</hi> single man, concerning this necessity of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive obedience; I will here set down what I verily take to be the sense of those <hi>three</hi> Chapters (or so much at least of the <hi>sixth</hi> and <hi>eighth</hi> as makes for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the seventh) in this ensuing Paraphrase. Which I hope will not be altogether unuseful for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Readers, because they will thereby see what, as I take it, is the Apostles meaning, in <hi>full</hi> and at <hi>length</hi> here, whenas they read it more <hi>contracted</hi> and <hi>involved</hi> in their <hi>Bibles.</hi>

                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:66440:167"/>But <hi>what then? Shall we</hi> serve <hi>sin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 6. Verse 15.</note> 
                  <hi>because we are not under the Law</hi> which condemns, though it cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer it; <hi>but under Grace,</hi> which pardons it? <hi>God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid</hi> that ever any of us, who are come now under the Gospel which proffers pardon for sins past, should think of refusing it all service for the time to come; and continue still to serve and obey sin, as much, or more than we did under the weak aids of the Law before it came. That we should continue to serve, by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to obey it, I say, For</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> whatever some licentious Renegado Christians may think of obeying, and so serving sin,<note place="margin">17.</note> after they have put themselves under subjection to Christ, who proffers to pardon it for the time <hi>past,</hi> only that he may thereby encourage them to leave it for the <hi>future</hi>: yet <hi>God be thanked that</hi> you for your parts have quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apprehensions.

likewise the <hi>servants of righteousness.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 6.</note> And for this change of your service, together with the change of your subjection, there is all the reason in the World.</p>
               <p>Whereof <hi>I</hi> will <hi>speak after the</hi> most moderate expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations,<note place="margin">Verse 19.</note> and equitable <hi>manner of men, because of the infirmities of your Flesh,</hi> whereby I know you are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled from making such high returns as the reason of the thing calls for. <hi>For</hi> this is the least that the mildest man would require in this Case, and yet it is all that God exacts of you; <hi>as ye have</hi> formerly, when you were subject to the Law, under which sin took so great advantage, <hi>yielded your members servants to uncleanness, and to iniquity, unto</hi> the bringing forth still of more <hi>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity; even so</hi> in the same manner <hi>now,</hi> since you are become subject unto Christ, give the same fruits there of your subjection, and <hi>yield your members servants to righteousness, unto</hi> the encrease of greater <hi>holiness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">20.</note>This, as I say, is no more than you did upon your subjection to the other. <hi>For when ye were the servants of sin,</hi> and under subjection to his Law, <hi>ye were free from</hi> all that service of <hi>righteousness,</hi> which God expects of you now upon your subjection to a better Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">21.</note>And as this change of your service, together with the change of your subjection, is most highly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable; so let me tell you withal it is most beneficial. For when ye were subject to the Law, and thereby ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants unto sin; <hi>what fruit had you then,</hi> either in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment or expectation, besides death and disgrace, <hi>in those things</hi> and services <hi>whereof you are</hi> most justly <hi>now ashamed?</hi> And not only so, <hi>for</hi> besides that one effect of shame, there is moreover another <hi>end of those things,</hi> and that <hi>is death</hi> too.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But now</hi> on the other side, <hi>being,</hi> by means of your subjection unto Christ,<note place="margin">22.</note> 
                  <hi>made free from</hi> the Law and Authority of <hi>sin, and become,</hi> as it is meet for Subjects,

                  <hi>servants unto God;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>you have your fruit</hi> at present <hi>unto holiness, and the end thereof</hi> at last <hi>everlasting life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This difference there is, I say again, between the fruits of your former subjection and service,<note place="margin">Verse 23.</note> and those at present. <hi>For the wages of sin</hi> to its Subjects and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants <hi>is death; but the gift of God</hi> to his <hi>is eternal life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this service of God, which gets you right to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, I must still tell you is owing to your being freed from subjection to the Law, under which you served sin; and to your becoming subject unto Christ.</p>
               <p>For in the first place,<note place="margin">Chap. 7. Verse 1.</note> as for your being freed from subjection to the Law, and being now no longer under it; that is very plain. For <hi>know you not,</hi> my <hi>Brethren, (for I speak to them that know the Law,</hi> or the nature and quality of those Laws which give one person in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest and power over another) <hi>how that the Law,</hi> when considered as a person that hath such power, <hi>hath domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over a man</hi> who is under it <hi>as long as he liveth</hi> indeed, or as it liveth in force to bind him, but no longer.</p>
               <p>A mans subjection to a Law,<note place="margin">2.</note> is just like that of a Woman to her Husband; where, as we all know, the subjection ceaseth, and all the Laws pertaining to it, when her Husband dyes whom she was subject to. <hi>For the woman which hath an Husband, is bound</hi> indeed <hi>by the Law</hi> of that subjection <hi>to her Husband as long as he liveth; but if the Husband be dead, she is</hi> then no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger subject, but <hi>loosed from the Law</hi> of wedlock made in favour <hi>of her Husband,</hi> as she is from that subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherein it was founded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So then if while her Husband liveth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note> during whose life all the Laws of Wedlock belonging to that subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are in force, <hi>she be married to another man; she shall be</hi> truly <hi>called an Adulteress; but</hi> on the other side, <hi>if her Husband be dead,</hi> that subjection, and all the Laws which could oblige her in it, are dead with him; and
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:66440:169"/>
                  <hi>she is free from</hi> the obligation of <hi>that Law</hi> which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid her to marry another upon pain of being accounted an Adulteress;<note place="margin">Chap. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>so that she is no Adulteress</hi> now, that Law being dead which made her so, <hi>though she be married to another man.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>But now,</hi> upon our becoming subject unto Christ, <hi>we are delivered from</hi> the subjection of <hi>the Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 6.</note> whose weakness gave sin so great advantage over us, <hi>that</hi> Law, I say, <hi>being</hi> now <hi>dead</hi> and abolished, <hi>wherein,</hi> whilst we so served sin, <hi>we were held</hi> in subjection; which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance is vouchsafed us, as I said, for this end, <hi>that</hi> being made, not the Laws, but Christs Subjects now, <hi>we should</hi> answerably to that <hi>serve in newness of Spirit,</hi> or in such sort as the new Spirit and Grace of his Religion enables us, <hi>and not</hi> as we served formerly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our subjection to the Law, <hi>in the oldness of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> or in those weak and ineffective degrees whereto the helpless letter of the old Law could assist us.</p>
               <p>But upon what I say of this change of service from sin to God (which we have all felt upon our becoming Christians) being an effect of this change of subjection from the Law to Christ;<note place="margin">7.</note> some of you 'tis like may think, that the Law, which I affirm we sinned under, is aspersed and reproached by me, and thus object: <hi>What</hi>

                  <hi>say we then? Is the Law,</hi> under which you say we sinned so much, and from which being now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, we have ceased to serve sin, the cause of <hi>sin</hi> to them who live under it? Now to this I must answer, <hi>God forbid</hi> that any man should either say or think so. No, we served sin under the Law, but yet the Law was no cause of sin. And both these all they who live under it feel in themselves, and must acknowledge. To avoid offence, suppose that I my self were this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Law now, as I was formerly; 'tis very true, as I have said, that I do serve sin under it; but is the Law the cause of it? By no means. <hi>Nay,</hi> so far is
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:66440:170"/>
the Law from causing or encouraging sin in me,<note place="margin">Chap. 7.</note> that, on the contrary, it points it out to me, and forbids it. <hi>I had not known</hi> what things are <hi>sin, but by</hi> the help of <hi>the Law</hi> which shews it; <hi>for I had not known lust</hi> or <hi>concupiscence</hi> for instance, which is only in the heart, and not in the outward action, to be a sin, <hi>except the Law</hi> of the tenth Commandment <hi>had said</hi> expresly, <hi>thou shalt not covet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 8.</note>
                  <hi>But</hi> for all the Law both shews and prohibits sin, and so can contribute nothing to produce, but rather to destroy it: yet I must truly tell you still, that whereas Sin has other causes more than enow that are sufficient to produce it; the Law is so weak and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, as not to be able to hinder it. For in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Concupiscence especially, whereto in the Law there is no express punishment threatned, the sinfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of our flesh, which are cause enough of all sin, grow bold, and, hearing of no express threatning from it, will not be restrained by it. And by this means the <hi>Sin</hi> of Concupiscence <hi>taking occasion</hi> from the impunity <hi>of the Commandment,</hi> instead of being restrained by it, took liberty and presumed upon it; and so without all fear <hi>wrought</hi> and accomplished, or brought on to <note n="c" place="margin">

For the less knowledge there is of the Law, the less is there of sin in transgressing it, and also the less sense of it. And therefore, as I say, as for this instance of Concupiscence, which I had not known to be a Sin unless the Law had told me so; without the Law I had neither offended
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:66440:170"/>

               </p>
               <p>And this was found by experience in the men of our Nation. <hi>For</hi> any one of them, who was alive at the promulgation of the Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> might say: <hi>I was alive</hi> to my thinking, and as to great degrees of that guilt which I contracted afterwards, <hi>without the Law once,</hi> or before such time as it was there proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us: for till then I knew not lust to be a sin, and so, by reason of my ignorance, neither sinn'd so much in it, nor was so sensible of it as now I am; <hi>but when the Commandment came,</hi> and was plainly made known to me by <hi>Moses; then Sin,</hi> I say, which was only shewn and forbid, but could not be restrained by it, <hi>revived</hi> and begun to have the fulness of guilt and terrour in it, <hi>and I,</hi> thenceforward, being warn'd against it, and not being able to keep back from it, became liable to that death which is the wages of it, and <hi>died</hi> by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> thus <hi>the</hi> Law or <hi>Commandment,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">10.</note> 
                  <hi>which was</hi> not only holy, and innocent in it self, but moreover in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by God for my good, and <hi>ordained to life</hi> which it promised could I have obeyed it; <hi>I</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>found to be unto death</hi> to me, because that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came my due when I sinn'd against it.</p>
               <p>Not as if the Law can be said to be the Author of death to me, more than it is of sin in me:<note place="margin">11.</note> For it was aim'd to destroy sin, which it shews and forbids; and to procure life, which it offers and promises. But the true cause of this effect so contrary to its intention, <hi>(viz.)</hi> its producing Sin and Death, whenas it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to Holiness and Life, is its being, as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, weak, and unable by all its aids to conquer fully, and restrain that Sin which brings Death upon us; for it cannot subdue, but only shew and forbid it. And therefore our habitual Lusts finding themselves too strong for it, burst through it, and, in spite of all its
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:66440:171"/>
restraint, make us commit the one, and so become li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the other.<note place="margin">Chap. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>For</hi> in very deed it is not the Law, which is the cause of Death to me, but <hi>Sin</hi> it self, which, <hi>taking occasion</hi> or advantage <hi>by the</hi> literal and fancied impunity of the tenth <hi>Commandment, deceived me</hi> through a false hope into the commission of it; and <hi>by it</hi> made me in reality liable to that Death which is truly the wages of it, or in a word, <hi>slew me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 12.</note>
                  <hi>Wherefore</hi> notwithstanding we sinn'd, yea, and died also during our subjection under the Law; yet for all that neither can our Sin, nor our Death be charged upon the Law it self; because, instead of contributing to them, it tends to destroy them, by expresly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the one, and offering to deliver us from the other. And therefore as for this difficulty that was made at the seventh verse against my saying, that we served Sin under the Law; <hi>(viz.)</hi> its following thence that the Law was the cause of our Sin and Death; this we see is quite taken off, and doth not follow at all. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we sinn'd, yea, and died too under the Law; yet was not the Law the cause of these, but the strength of our own Lusts. But <hi>the Law is holy</hi> still, and so no cause of sin; <hi>and the Commandment</hi> forbidding sin, and promising Life to the obedient, is not only <hi>holy, and just,</hi> but over <hi>and</hi> above that <hi>good</hi> too, and so no cause of death and suffering.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">13.</note>But upon this you will say how <hi>was</hi> it <hi>then,</hi> that <hi>that which is</hi> so <hi>good</hi> in it self, as you say the Law is, should be <hi>made</hi> the cause of the greatest evil, even of <hi>Death unto me?</hi> Could it prove so to me if it were not so in it self? And to this I answer with abhorrence, <hi>God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid</hi> that I should say the Law is Death. No, this Death as I have told you, is not the effect of the Law, for it was ordained to procure Life for me. <hi>But</hi> it was <hi>Sin,</hi> I say again, that was too strong for the Law, which could
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:66440:171"/>
only forbid,<note place="margin">Chap. 7.</note> but was not able by all its aids to restrain it; this Sin it was, <hi>that it might appear Sin</hi> indeed, that went on <hi>working</hi> transgression <hi>unto Death in me,</hi> by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage taken over <hi>that</hi> Law <hi>which is good,</hi> although not strong enough to overpower the setled habits of evil. And by this conquest of Sin over the good Law, which was set up as a bar against it, and should have destroy'd it, it appears to be most mischievous. For this comes of it, <hi>that Sin, by</hi> proving too hard for <hi>the Commandment, might</hi> by such prevailing over all that is set against it, be extremely heightned and aggravated, and <hi>become exceeding sinfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that the Law should thus be worsted by Sin is no wonder. <hi>For we know, that although the Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 14.</note> which commands, <hi>is spiritual,</hi> to shew and suggest better things; <hi>yet I,</hi> who am to obey, in that state of sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and sin, wherein the Law finds me, and out of which it is too weak to rescue me, <hi>am carnal</hi> so as to serve sin notwithstanding it. Which I am to such a degree, as if I were <hi>sold under sin,</hi> and my actions were as much at its command, as the actions of a slave bought with money are at the command of his master. So that although the Law shews me that which is good, and commands me to perform it; yet cannot I obey it, in regard I am under anothers power, under the beck of sin.</p>
               <p>And in very deed, to speak yet more particularly to this business, the good Law can,<note place="margin">15.</note> and doth produce good effects in the mind and conscience, which is the throne wherein it is seated; but still the law of sin, which is seated in the members or executive powers, prevails over it, and engrosseth all our actions: So that the utmost that it can ordinarily do with us, is to make us in our mind to disapprove sin; but when it hath done that, it cannot hinder us in our lives from pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:66440:172"/>
it.<note place="margin">Chap. 7.</note> And of this the complaints of those, who are subject to it, are a sufficient proof. <hi>For</hi> who is there among them for the most part, that is not ready to confess and cry out thus, <hi>that which</hi> through the prevailing power of my lusts <hi>I do</hi> in my practice; that, through the power of the Law, <hi>I allow not</hi> in my mind and conscience: <hi>for what,</hi> being excited by the Law, <hi>I would</hi> do; <hi>that,</hi> being hindred by sin, <hi>do I not; but what,</hi> from the Laws prohibiting, in my mind <hi>I hate</hi> and disapprove; <hi>that,</hi> from my own lusts forcing and overpowering me, in my actions still <hi>do I.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 16.</note>And this by the way, as it is an evident argument of the weakness and inability of the Law to restrain sin; is also a clear testimony to the holiness and goodness of the Law it self, which shews plainly that it is no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer, or author of Sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as was objected, <hi>vers.</hi> 7.

               <p>
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:66440:172"/>It must not be charged upon the Law in my mind,<note place="margin">Chap. 7.

But now as for that slavish service of sin, which a bare Jew, who has no other help against it but <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law, complains of, and longs to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from: that, as I told you at first, we Christians, through the surpassing Grace of Christs Gospel, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from already.

Jew as I have here personated,<note place="margin">Chap. 7.</note> I <hi>Paul</hi> an Apostle of Jesus Christ can readily make answer. Alter your sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and you shall alter your service too; for in becoming subject unto Christ instead of the Law, you shall become servants of God instead of serving sin. <hi>I thank God</hi> there is a way now in Christ for such deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, or, as it is read by some copies, <note n="f" place="margin">

               <p>But to return to what I said, <hi>vers.</hi> 5, 6. of the last Chapter,<note place="margin">Chap. 8. Verse 1.</note> from whence we have hitherto diverted to answer this objection. I say having by this passage from subjection to the Law, to subjection unto Christ upon the Laws being abolished, changed our service together with our subjection, and become servants now, not unto Sin, but unto Christ: All we Christians are safe from that <hi>Death</hi> which the <hi>Law of the members brought forth fruit</hi> to (<hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>vers.</hi> 5.) and have right to that <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> which as I said, is the gift of God to all his servants (<hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>vers.</hi> 22, 23.) So that what reason soever a poor Jew under the Law, who serves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys Sin, may have to cry out of the body of Death: yet we Christians, who began to serve God upon our
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:66440:174"/>
becoming subject unto Christ,<note place="margin">Chap. 8.</note> may comfort our selves to see that we are delivered from it. And <hi>therefore</hi> whatever there be to a striving, but yet unconquering Jew, <hi>there is now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus</hi>'s Religion, because they are such <hi>who</hi> have changed their service together with their subjection, and <hi>walk not</hi> now <hi>after the Flesh,</hi> as they did formerly whilst the Law held them in subjection, <hi>but after the Spirit.</hi>

               <p>Thus have I given a Paraphrase upon this <hi>involved,</hi> and so much <hi>mistaken</hi> Chapter. Wherein I have <hi>large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and, as I hope, <hi>truly</hi> represented the Apostles <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> his <hi>design</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of arguing in this place. In all which we see he intends not at all to give a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of <hi>himself,</hi> or of any other <hi>regenerate</hi> man, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a <hi>midling</hi> Sinner, who sins against his Conscience, and transgresses with reluctance. Which Transgressor of a middle rank he particularly represents under the person of an <hi>awaked,</hi> but as yet <hi>unregenerate Jew</hi>; who was one on whom the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> had wrought some change, but could not work enough; being able only to <hi>awaken</hi> his <hi>Conscience,</hi> but not to <hi>reform</hi> his <hi>practice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that all that is there said in that seventh Chapter of <hi>willing</hi> but not <hi>performing,</hi> &amp;c. only sets off the <hi>weakness</hi> and <hi>imperfection</hi> of the <hi>Law of Moses</hi> as to the making men <hi>compleatly obedient</hi>; and the <hi>perfection</hi> as to this particular of the Law of Christ.</p>
               <p>The Law of <hi>Moses</hi> was unable to work a general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation by reason of several defects, <hi>two</hi> whereof I shall particularly mention, which in the Religion of Christ are fully supplied; and they are the <hi>great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> to all <hi>obedience, eternal life</hi>; and the <hi>great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement</hi> of all <hi>endeavour, the promise of the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eternal life</hi> are words that are never heard of in all <hi>Moses's Law.</hi> Indeed the good people under it had all some rude thoughts and <hi>confused expectations</hi> of it; but the <hi>Law</hi> it self did no where <hi>clearly</hi> and <hi>expresly propose</hi> it. Whereof this may serve for a <hi>probable proof,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a <hi>whole Sect</hi> among them, the <hi>Sadducees</hi> I mean, did <hi>flatly deny</hi> it; and this for an <hi>undeniable Argument,</hi> because those <hi>very</hi>

                  <hi>places</hi> of the Law, which are
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:66440:175"/>
brought to <hi>confirm</hi> it by those Jewish Doctors that are most for it, are in all appearance so remote from it. Nay even our Saviour himself, when he goes to prove it against the Sadducees out of the Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> can find no other Testimonies for it, than such as are fetched about to speak it by art, and brought to it by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.37, 38. So that well might S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> say in triumph over all other Religions in the World, That <hi>life and immortality were brought to light by the Gospel,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. And in the comparison of that <hi>Covenant</hi> which came by <hi>Moses,</hi> with that <hi>other</hi> which came by <hi>Christ</hi>; to affirm that the <hi>Covenant which came by Christ</hi> was <hi>the bringing in of a better hope,</hi> Heb. 7.19; and a <hi>better Covenant,</hi> for this reason, because <hi>it was established upon better promises,</hi> Heb. 8.6.</p>
               <p>And then as for the <hi>promise of the Spirit</hi> to enable men to do what was required of them; of that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> made no mention. <hi>By this Law,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>was the knowledge of sin,</hi> Rom. 3.20. It shewed men what they should do, and denounced a <note n="‖" place="margin">Gal. 3.10.</note> Curse upon them if they failed to do it; but it stopt there, and went not on to promise any inward Grace and help that might enable them to be as good as it required them. No, the promise of <hi>that</hi> was reserved to another dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, and to be the <hi>hope</hi> of a <hi>better Covenant</hi>; it was not to come by <hi>Moses,</hi> but by <hi>Christ</hi>; nor to be an express Article of the <hi>Law,</hi> but of the <hi>Gospel. Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the Law,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>that</hi> now, being under the Gospel, <hi>we might receive the promise of the Spirit,</hi> which comes not by the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> but <hi>through</hi> the <hi>Faith</hi> of Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13, 14. The <hi>Law,</hi> by its prohibition, <hi>made</hi> several actions to be sinful, it <hi>shewed</hi> us what was sin, and it threatned the <hi>curse</hi> to it; but that was all that it did towards the extirpation of it; for, as for any <hi>inward
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:66440:175"/>
strength</hi> and ability to overcome it, it offered none, but left us there to our own selves. And because sin was too <hi>strong</hi> for us, and had got possession of our <hi>Bodies</hi> and <hi>executive Powers,</hi> insomuch that we were quite <hi>enslaved</hi> to it, and as it were <hi>sold under</hi> it: therefore the Law, by making <hi>more</hi> things sinful through its <hi>prohibition,</hi> and not <hi>strengthening us</hi> against sin through <hi>spiritual assistance,</hi> instead of <hi>lessening</hi> the Empire of sin, proved in the end to <hi>encrease</hi> it. For our lusts not being restrained by it, and more of them becoming sinful by being prohibited; <hi>when the Law entred,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>the offence did more abound,</hi> Rom. 5.20; and the Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, not the bane and overthrow of sin; but, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king its services more numerous, it was rather, as the same Apostle says, <hi>the strength of it,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56. And forasmuch as the Law did only thus outwardly shew and reveal sin to our eyes, but brought along with it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of inward Grace and assistance to help us against it; therefore is it called a <hi>Letter without us</hi>; opposite to the Grace of the Gospel, which is an <hi>enlivening Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> within. And since it did nothing more but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly shew and threaten sin, but did not inwardly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist and rescue us from it; it served only to condemn us for what we did, from the doing whereof it brought no inward Grace to hinder us; and so proved the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of death</hi> and <hi>condemnation,</hi> not of <hi>life</hi> and <hi>pardon.</hi> All which is plainly affirmed of it in the <hi>third</hi> Chapter of the second Epistle to the Corinthians. <hi>God,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:66440:176"/>
and thereby <hi>giveth</hi> right to <hi>life,</hi> which is the mercy that it promises. That was <hi>the ministration of condemnation</hi>; for it shewed men the curse which it did not enable them to shun: this is <hi>the ministration of</hi> ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification and <hi>righteousness,</hi> which it both promises and enables them to attain to, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>'Tis very true indeed, that several of the <hi>Jews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves under the <hi>Law of Moses,</hi> had really such assistan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Gods Spirit,</hi> as enabled them to <hi>do,</hi> as well as to <hi>know</hi> what was required of them. For <hi>David</hi> in all his life and behaviour was <hi>a man after Gods own heart,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.14. <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as to their <hi>walking in all the Commandments of the Lord, were blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,</hi> Luke 1.6. And the Case was the same with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>godly Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then this assistance which they enjoyed was no <hi>Article</hi> of their <hi>Law</hi>; although God afforded it, yet had their Law no where promised it, nor was he bound to it by the <hi>Mosaical Covenant.</hi> For in very truth all this <hi>inward Spirit</hi> which was vouchsafed to them, was reached out, not by virtue of the <hi>Covenant of the Law,</hi> but of the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> For the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> was not <hi>first</hi> made with the World when Christ came into it; but was established long before with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> Gen. 3.15; and after that confirmed again with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all his <hi>Seed</hi> after him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8, 17. So that under <hi>it,</hi> as well as under <hi>Moses,</hi> all the <hi>Jews</hi> lived; and by the <hi>gracious</hi> terms and assisting <hi>Spirit</hi> of it, all the righteous people, that have been since the beginning of the World, were justified. It being, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>by faith,</hi> which is the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the second Covenant, that <hi>the Elders</hi> who lived before the Law, <hi>obtained a good report,</hi> Heb. 11.2; and that the <hi>Jews,</hi> who lived under it, <hi>were</hi> delivered and <hi>justified from all things, from which they could</hi>

                  <hi>not be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:66440:176"/>
by</hi> any virtue of <hi>the Law of Moses,</hi> Acts 13.39. And therefore that which the Apostle affirms of the defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiveness of the Mosaick Law, <hi>viz. its having no promise of the Spirit to enable men to do what it commanded,</hi> is true still. For the Law did not promise it, although several both <hi>before</hi> and <hi>under</hi> the Law enjoyed it: but they who had the benefit of it, received it, not from the <hi>Covenant of the Law,</hi> but from the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> and <hi>the Gospel,</hi> which has been more or less on foot through all times ever since the World began.</p>
               <p>And in this <hi>Covenant,</hi> since Christ has given us the last Edition and perfection of it, <hi>both</hi> these great defects of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law, which rendered it so unable to work this intire reformation and obedience, are fully supplied. For in every Page of Christ's Gospel, what is so legible as the <hi>promise of eternal life?</hi> The joys of <hi>Heaven</hi> are as much insisted on by <hi>Christ,</hi> as the delights of <hi>Canaan</hi> were by <hi>Moses.</hi> And then as for the other <hi>promise,</hi> viz. that of <hi>the Spirit</hi>; it is now as plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed as words can make it. For we need not to <hi>guess</hi> at it by <hi>signs,</hi> or to <hi>presume</hi> it from <hi>probabilities,</hi> or to <hi>believe</hi> it upon <hi>Syllogism</hi> and <hi>consequence:</hi> but <hi>Christ</hi> has <hi>spoke</hi> out so as to be understood by every capacity, —<hi>God will give the holy Spirit to them that ask him,</hi> Luke 11.13.</p>
               <p>Now because the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> laboured under these <hi>two</hi> great defects, which are happily supplied by the Gospel of Christ, by reason whereof it was very una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to effect that reformation of the World which was necessary; therefore doth the Apostle in several places speak very meanly of it, as of a <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>ineffective</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument. He affirms plainly, and proves also, That it neither <hi>could</hi> nor <hi>did</hi> make men throughly good; and that therefore God was forced in the fulness of time to make <hi>known,</hi> and, in Christ's death, to <hi>establish</hi> a <hi>better.
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:66440:177"/>
If there had been a Law given</hi> by <hi>Moses which could have given life, then,</hi> saith he, <hi>verily righteousness should</hi> not have needed to be sought by another Covenant; but <hi>have been by the Law. But</hi> this we see it could not, for <hi>the Scripture hath concluded all</hi> those who lived under it <hi>to be</hi> still <hi>under</hi> the dominion of <hi>sin, that</hi> so, since the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> could not do it, <hi>the promise</hi> of eternal life, of the Spirit, and of other things which we have <hi>by</hi> the <hi>faith of Jesus Christ, might be given</hi> to work and effect it <hi>to those that believe,</hi> Gal. 3.21, 22. Something indeed the Law did towards it, for it armed their <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> against sin, so that they could not take their full swing, and transgress without all fear and remorse. And this was some restraint, and kept them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so ill by far as otherwise they would have been, although it was not able to make them so good as they should. And to lay this hank upon sin, and to check it in some measure, till such time as the Gospel should be more clearly revealed to subdue it perfectly, was that very end for which the Law was at first given, and whereto, so long as it was in force, it served. <hi>Wherefore,</hi> saith he, <hi>serveth the Law</hi> of <hi>Moses? It was added</hi> to the rude draught of the Gospel-Covenant made with <hi>Abraham, because of</hi> the <hi>transgressions</hi> of men which grew very high, that it might in some degree re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain them, <hi>till</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>the seed</hi> of <hi>Abraham should come, to whom,</hi> as to the head and in behalf of his Church, <hi>the promise</hi> of such Grace as would restrain it fully <hi>was made. And</hi> to fit it the more for imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an awe upon peoples Consciences, whereby it might lay this restraint upon sin, <hi>it was ordained</hi> at the first giving of it <hi>by</hi> terrible fire and thundrings made by the <hi>Angels,</hi> which were so dreadful, that the people desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of God that those formidable Angels might be no more employed in delivering it to them, but that it

might be put <hi>into the hands</hi> of <hi>another Mediator,</hi> (viz.) <hi>Moses,</hi> who was a man like unto themselves, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. But although this restraint upon Sin were something, yet was it far from sufficient; so that still it is true of <hi>the Law</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> that notwithstanding it could begin, yet it could finish and <hi>make nothing</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Galat. 4.9.</note> 
                  <hi>perfect; but</hi> that it was <hi>the bringing in of a better hope</hi> than was warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Law, which should <hi>do</hi> that, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.19. And as for this imperfection and faultiness, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle imputes to the <hi>first Covenant</hi> or <hi>Law of Moses</hi> in these and other places; it is nothing more, as he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, than God himself has charged upon it, when he speaks of establishing a better instead of it. <hi>For if the first Covenant</hi> by Moses <hi>had been faultless,</hi> and void of imperfection; <hi>then should no place have been sought for</hi> the introduction of <hi>the second,</hi> which it is plain there was. <hi>For finding fault with them</hi> for their breach of the first Covenant, <hi>he saith</hi> (in Jer. 31.31.) <hi>the dayes come when I will make a New Covenant with the house of Israel,</hi> such as shall make <hi>me</hi> to be for ever <hi>unto them a God</hi>; and enable <hi>them to be unto me</hi> an obedient <hi>People,</hi> Heb. 8.7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>Now this <hi>Inability</hi> of the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> to work a compleat conquest over sin, and a thorow reformation, which the Apostle affirms so clearly in these <hi>other</hi> places, he sets out more <hi>largely</hi> and <hi>particularly</hi> in that <hi>seventh</hi> Chapter to the <hi>Romans.</hi> For from the beginning of this Discourse, which I have taken at the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Verse</hi> of the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Chapter,</hi> to the end of it at the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>vers.</hi> of the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>; this weakness and inability of the Law is that still which is every where endeavour'd to be made out, and which returns upon us as the conclusion and inference from every argument. <hi>Sin must not have dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you,</hi> saith he, <hi>because you are not under the Law,</hi> where is the place of its reigning, <hi>but under</hi> the <hi>Grace</hi>
                  <pb n="320" facs="tcp:66440:178"/>
of Christ, at the 14. <hi>verse</hi> of the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Chapter.</hi> And in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> it is taken notice of at every turn. <hi>When you were in the flesh</hi> (or under the Law, which, from its consisting so much of <hi>Carnal Ordinances,</hi> and giving the <hi>flesh</hi> so much <hi>advantage,</hi> is called <hi>flesh,</hi> Galat. 3.3.) <hi>the motions of sin, which were</hi> encouraged <hi>by the</hi> weakness of the <hi>Law, brought forth fruit unto death: but now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delivered from the</hi> weak <hi>Law, you serve in newness of spirit, not</hi> as you did then, <hi>in the oldness of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> vers. 5, 6. <hi>Sin taking occasion</hi> or advantage over <hi>the</hi> weak <hi>Commandment, wrought in me all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence,</hi> vers. 8. <hi>When the</hi> weak <hi>Commandment came, sin revived, and I died,</hi> vers. 9. <hi>Sin taking occasion</hi> or advantage <hi>by the Commandment, slew me,</hi> vers. 11. by which prevailing over the Commandment it appears to be <hi>exceeding sinfull,</hi> vers. 13. And at the end of the discourse at the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Chapter,</hi> we are told again of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses being weak through</hi> the conquering power of <hi>the flesh,</hi> which made it necessary for <hi>God to send his own Son</hi> with a better Law, which was strong enough to rescue us not of the dominion of it, <hi>vers.</hi> 3, 4.</p>
               <p>So that upon the whole matter it plainly appears, that all that is said in that seventh <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>willing</hi> but <hi>not doing,</hi> of <hi>sinning against conscience,</hi> and <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing with regret</hi>; doth not at all set forth the <hi>sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble state</hi> of <hi>a true Christian</hi> under the <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>; but only the state of a <hi>midling sinner,</hi> of a <hi>lost Jew</hi> who only struggles but cannot conquer, being yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the weakness and imperfections of the <hi>Mosaick Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, I add further, So far is any man who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues <hi>to work</hi> and <hi>act his sin,</hi> from having any real grounds of <hi>hope</hi> and encouragement from <hi>this place</hi> in so doing: that in very deed, if he rightly consider it, it will possess him with the quite contrary. It holds
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:66440:178"/>
out to him a sentence of death, and shews him plainly the absolute necessity, not only of a <hi>willing,</hi> but also of a <hi>working</hi> obedience. For the man who <hi>disobeys</hi> thus <hi>unwillingly,</hi> and <hi>sins with regret,</hi> is so far from being in a state of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> notwithstanding his sins, that he is here expresly said to be <hi>undone</hi> and <hi>slain</hi> by them. <hi>The motions of sin under the law bring forth fruit unto death,</hi> vers. 5. <hi>when sin revived by the coming of the Commandment, I died,</hi> vers. 9. <hi>The Commandment which was ordained unto life,</hi> I on the contrary <hi>found to be unto death,</hi> vers. 10. <hi>Sin taking occasion</hi> and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage <hi>by the Commandment, slew me,</hi> vers. 11. <hi>Sin wrought death in me by that</hi> Law <hi>which is good,</hi> vers. 13. <hi>O! wretched man that I am</hi> by reason of this subjection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sin, <hi>who shall deliver me from this body of</hi> Sin and <hi>Death,</hi> vers. 24.</p>
               <p>But on the other side, if we would belong to Christ, and appear such Servants as he will own and reward at last; we are taught in this very place that we must <hi>not be worsted by sin,</hi> but <hi>overcome</hi> it; that we must <hi>not work evil,</hi> but <hi>righteousness</hi>; that we must not <hi>walk af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> those <hi>sinfull lusts</hi> which are seated <hi>in the flesh,</hi> but <hi>after the Law of God</hi> which is enthroned in the <hi>Spirit. Sin shall not have dominion over you if you are under Grace,</hi> Chapter 6.14. <hi>Now yield your members ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants unto righteousness,</hi> vers. 19. <hi>you are</hi> become sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and as it were <hi>married to Christ, that you should bring forth fruit to God,</hi> Chap. 7. vers. 4. <hi>Now being delivered from the Law, we must serve,</hi> not sin, as we did under it, but God <hi>in newness of spirit,</hi> vers. 6. <hi>The Grace of God through Jesus Christ</hi> hath delivered me <hi>from this body of death,</hi> vers. 24, 25. <hi>The Law of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life in Christ Jesus,</hi> when I became truly and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably Christian, <hi>hath made me free from the law of Sin and Death,</hi> Chap. 8. vers. 2. <hi>So that the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:66440:179"/>
of the Law,</hi> which it was not able to work in me, <hi>is</hi> now, by means of the Gospel, wrought and <hi>fulfilled in me</hi>; for since I came under it, I am one <hi>who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit,</hi> vers. 4.</p>
               <p>So that all the while we see, this is a Truth most sure and stedfast, which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> is so far from <hi>opposing</hi> in this <hi>seventh</hi> Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that in reality he <hi>avers</hi> and <hi>confirms</hi> it, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that <hi>if we do commit sin and work iniquity, it will not excuse us to say that we did it unwillingly.</hi> The <hi>regret</hi> in sinning may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as was shewn in the <hi>last</hi> Chapter, to <hi>lessen</hi> our <hi>crime,</hi> and thereby to abate our <hi>punishment</hi>; but that is all which it can do, for it cannot <hi>quite</hi> exempt us from it.</p>
               <p>And thus at last we see, that this <hi>fourth</hi> ground of shifting off the necessity of this <hi>service with our actions,</hi> (viz.) our <hi>hope of being saved at the last day, although we have not obeyed in our works, but have wrought dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, because when we did so, it was with reluctance and unwillingness</hi>; is no less delusive than are all the <hi>former.</hi> It will certainly fail any man who trusts to it, and, if he will not see it before, make him know the falseness of it, when it is too late to rectifie and amend it.</p>
               <p>As for all those foundations therefore whereupon men build their hopes of a happy sentence, without ever obeying with their <hi>strength</hi> or <hi>bodily powers,</hi> (viz.) the conceit of being saved for <hi>Orthodox Opinions,</hi> for <hi>ineffective desires,</hi> for <hi>never transgressing but through a strong temptation,</hi> or <hi>with an unwilling mind:</hi> they are all false grounds, snares of death, and inlets to damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But as ever we expect that our obedience should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail us unto <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> we must obey with our <hi>strength</hi> or <hi>bodily powers,</hi> as well as with our <hi>wills,</hi> our <hi>passions,</hi> and our <hi>understandings.</hi> If we would have
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:66440:179"/>
God at the last day to <hi>approve</hi> our <hi>service,</hi> and to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> and <hi>justifie</hi> our <hi>obedience, this,</hi> and nothing less than this must be done towards it. We must not only <hi>desire,</hi> but <hi>do</hi>; it is not enough to <hi>will</hi> and <hi>approve,</hi> but we must <hi>work</hi> and <hi>practise</hi> what is commanded us. We must not barely think right in our <hi>minds,</hi> or <hi>desire</hi> with our <hi>affections,</hi> or <hi>choose</hi> with our <hi>wills</hi>; but, as the <hi>Perfection</hi> and <hi>Crown</hi> of all, we must put to our <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>executive powers,</hi> and <hi>work</hi> the will of God in our lives and actions. Without this, if we have <hi>life</hi> and <hi>opportunity,</hi> all other things will signifie nothing. For <hi>it is he who doth good,</hi> saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John, who</hi> will be looked upon to be <hi>of God,</hi> 3 Joh. 11. <hi>Little children,</hi> saith the same Apostle, <hi>let no man deceive you,</hi> for it is only <hi>he who</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">1 Joh. 2.17.29.</note> 
                  <hi>doth righteousness,</hi> who in Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is <hi>righteous,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.7. It is this service of our <hi>strength</hi> or <hi>bodily powers,</hi> in our outward works and operations, which makes up our duty, and secures our reward: <hi>Blessed are they that do his Commandments,</hi> for they only <hi>have right to</hi> the great reward, <hi>the Tree of Life,</hi> Revel. 22.14.</p>
               <p>But on the other side, if we <hi>do evil,</hi> and <hi>work ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi>; no service of our other faculties can stand us in any stead, but in Gods account we shall be esteemed <hi>wicked wretches, children of wrath,</hi> and <hi>heirs of destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> For the words of our Saviour Christ himself, who is to judge of it, are <hi>vehement</hi> and <hi>plain. Verily, verily I say unto you, whosoever committeth sin is the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of sin,</hi> Joh. 8.34. <hi>He who commits sin is of the devil, for whosoever doth not righteousness is not of God, but a child of the devil,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.8, 10. And as this <hi>working wickedness,</hi> howsoever we are against it in our <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>desires,</hi> makes us, in Gods account, <hi>sons of sin</hi> and <hi>disobedience</hi>; so will it be sure to render us withall <hi>children of wrath</hi> and <hi>destruction. If you live
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:66440:180"/>
after the flesh,</hi> saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, you shall die,</hi> Rom. 8.13. And whatever men think in their <hi>minds,</hi> or desire in their <hi>hearts,</hi> or profess in their <hi>words</hi> to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; if for all that they have sinned impenitently in their actions, Christ has told them plainly that he will pronounce, when he comes to sit as their Judge, —<hi>Depart from me all ye that work iniquity,</hi> Mat. 7.23.</p>
               <p>As for this fourth faculty therefore, our <hi>strength</hi> or <hi>bodily powers</hi> in outward works and operations; it is one necessary ingredient of an <hi>entire</hi> obedience. The service of our works is indispensably required to our pardon and happiness, as well as the service of our minds, our wills, and our affections; so that as ever we hope to live, our obedient thoughts and desires must end in an obedient practice.</p>
               <p>And thus at last we see what those <hi>powers</hi> or <hi>facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> are, whose concurrence in Gods Service is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to make up an <hi>entire</hi> obedience. We must obey all the <hi>particular</hi> Laws that are recounted in the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> Book with our <hi>whole</hi> man, both with our <hi>minds,</hi> and <hi>souls,</hi> and <hi>hearts,</hi> and <hi>strength:</hi> all these several powers must unite in Gods Service, before it will be <hi>upright</hi> and <hi>compleat,</hi> such as at present his Law requires, and such as at the last day he will accept of.</p>

               <p>BUt besides the Integrity of our <hi>powers</hi> and <hi>facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> or the <hi>Integrity of the Subject,</hi> whereof I have discoursed hitherto; there is <hi>a second</hi> sort of Integrity which is plainly necessary to make our obedience avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our salvation at the last day; and that is an <hi>Integrity of seasons and opportunities,</hi> or our obeying the forementioned Laws, not <hi>now,</hi> and <hi>then,</hi> but at <hi>all times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We must not think to please God by an obedience that comes and goes by <hi>fits</hi>; or by serving him only at such times as we are in <hi>humour,</hi> or have no <hi>temptation</hi> to the contrary. But our service of him must be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> and <hi>uniform,</hi> we must obey him at <hi>all</hi> times, and <hi>wilfully</hi> transgress in <hi>none.</hi> For although all other things have their proper season, yet sin has not; it is <hi>alwayes</hi> forbidden, and <hi>alwayes</hi> threatned; so that <hi>when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever</hi> we commit it, it puts us under the curse, and makes us liable to death and hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:66440:181"/>Some indeed there are who <hi>parcel</hi> out their time, and divide it betwixt <hi>God</hi> and their <hi>sins.</hi> They ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a <hi>constant course</hi> of <hi>transgressing</hi> and <hi>repenting,</hi> of <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>sorrow.</hi> For they are alwayes won when they are tempted, and they are alwayes sorrowfull when they have done. They are all holy purpose and good resolution before they are tryed; but when the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation comes they can make but a poor resistance, for all their good thoughts quickly vanish, and they are taken. They are never constant either in pious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing, or in well-doing. Their actions are not all of a piece, but a medly of good and bad; for they still keep on in an uninterrupted vicissitude and succession of works of obedience and sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Others</hi> again there are who act more agreeably to themselves, and, whilst they are for God, are more <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> in their obedience; who yet <hi>fall</hi> off at <hi>last,</hi> and <hi>sin</hi> against him for <hi>altogether.</hi> For either they grow <hi>faint</hi> and <hi>weary</hi> by the <hi>tediousness</hi> and <hi>length</hi> of their <hi>journey</hi>; or they are turned out of the way by some great <hi>difficulties</hi>; or drawn aside by the <hi>importunate allurements</hi> of some temptation: and when once by <hi>any</hi> of these wayes they are put beside their duty, they turn their backs <hi>thenceforward</hi> upon God, and never more obey him. They are seduced by <hi>ill company,</hi> or drawn away by <hi>interest,</hi> or frighted by <hi>persecution</hi>; and from that time their care slackens, and their lusts encrease, and grow too hard for Grace and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. And thus, what from inducements from <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> and what from occasions from <hi>without,</hi> they are quite cut off from the service of God and Religion, and give themselves up to serve their lusts for altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to an uninterrupted obedience of sin.</p>
               <p>But now as for such a <hi>broken</hi> service and obedience as this; God will by no means accept of it, nor shall any
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:66440:181"/>
man be ever the better by it. For when Christ comes to Judgment, he will pass Sentence upon men according to what they are <hi>then,</hi> and not according to what they have been <hi>formerly. If the righteous man turn away from his righteousness,</hi> saith <hi>Ezekiel, and commit iniquity, and do according to all that the wicked man doth; shall he live?</hi> No, by no means. For <hi>all his righteousness that he hath done</hi> formerly <hi>shall not be mentioned,</hi> but <hi>in his trespass that he hath</hi> since <hi>trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned; in them shall he dye,</hi> Ezek. 18.24. It is only <hi>if you continue in my Word,</hi> saith our Saviour, that <hi>you are my Disciples indeed,</hi> John 8.31. You must perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in obedience if you expect to have the reward of it. For <hi>he</hi> only <hi>who endures to the end shall be saved,</hi> Matth. 10.22; and none but <hi>they, who by PATIENT CONTINVANCE in well doing seek for Glory and Immortality,</hi> shall inherit <hi>eternal life,</hi> Rom. 2.6, 7. Perseverance is the indispensable condition of bliss, we cannot have it cheaper; <hi>Be thou faithful unto death, and</hi> then, saith Christ, <hi>I will give thee a Crown of life,</hi> Rev. 2.10.</p>
               <p>But as for all those who fall off from a good course, and turn <hi>Apostates</hi> from obedience; their case is despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and their condition extreamly damnable. For they grow wicked to the highest degree, and their state is almost irrecoverable. They have, by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued rebellion and provocations in spite of all the suggestions of Gods Grace, and the checks of their own Conscience, not only <hi>grieved,</hi> but even <hi>quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> the Spirit of God. So that God, for the <hi>most</hi> part, leaves them to themselves, and seeks no further to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them. For if men are <hi>idle,</hi> and will <hi>not use</hi> it; and much more if they scornfully cast it from them, and <hi>reject</hi> it; Christ hath told us plainly that the <hi>Grace which</hi> any man <hi>hath shall be taken from him,</hi> Matth. 25.
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:66440:182"/>
29. And when once God and his good Spirit have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted them, they are under nothing but an unbridled lust, and run on, without all restraint, into an exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant pitch of wickedness.</p>
               <p>And this any man may easily observe in the world. For who is usually so <hi>evil</hi> as the <hi>backsliding</hi> Sinner? Who is ordinarily so <hi>irrecoverable</hi> as the <hi>Apostate</hi> Saint? They are quite lost to all goodness, and sin beyond all bounds and past all retrieve. No Creatures in the World were ever so much out of all capacity to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to Heaven, as those Angels that fell from it; and no men on Earth are so hardly reclaimed from a wicked to a holy life, as they who once knew what it was, and yet utterly renounced it. For <hi>God</hi> for the most part lets them alone to enjoy their own choice, and to go on in their own way; and the <hi>good Spirit,</hi> which has been almost quenched by them, contends no more with them, nor acts any more upon them. They have trampled already upon all spiritual aids, and benummed and silenced their own Consciences, and quite hardened themselves in their wickedness; so that now they have nothing to hinder them, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to work all manner of sin with greediness and wantonness, and thereby fall under the severest curse that can be met with in Hell and damnation.</p>
               <p>And as for this progress of all Renegado Saints and revolting Sinners, both in sin, and also in suffering; the Scripture is express and plain. <hi>When the unclean Spirit, which is</hi> once <hi>gone out of a man, returns into him again,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>he taketh unto himself seven other Spirits,</hi> which are <hi>more wicked than</hi> he <hi>himself</hi> is, <hi>and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is</hi> made <hi>worse</hi> in all respects by this means, <hi>than the first,</hi> Matth. 12.43, 44, 45. The man becomes a greater Sinner, and a greater Sufferer than otherwise
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:66440:182"/>
he ever would have been. <hi>For if after</hi> men <hi>have once escaped the pollution of the world, through the knowledg of Christ</hi>'s Gospel, <hi>they are again entangled therein, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome</hi> by it; then <hi>is the latter end worse with them than the beginning. For it had</hi> really <hi>been</hi> by much the <hi>better for them not to have known the way of righteousness</hi> at all; <hi>than after they have known</hi> and walked in <hi>it,</hi> to put such a slur upon it, and <hi>to</hi> revolt and <hi>turn from the holy Commandment,</hi> which was <hi>delivered unto them,</hi> and for some time embraced by them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21.</p>
               <p>As for an obedience then which goes but half way, and breaks off before it has got to the end: so far is it from availing us unto pardon and life, that in very deed it renders our present case more desperate, and our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture punishment more insupportable.</p>
               <p>But that obedience which God will accept, and in which alone we may safely place our confidence; must be, as of our <hi>whole man,</hi> so of our <hi>whole time</hi> likewise.

               <head>CHAP. VI. Of the third sort of integrity, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Object; or of obedience to all the particular Laws and parts of Duty.</head>
               <argument>
                  <head>The CONTENTS. </head>
                  <p>Of the partiality of mens obedience from their love of some particular sins. Three pretences whereby they justifie the allowed practice of some sins, whilst they are obedient in some other instances. The first pretence is the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their Religion and themselves in times of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution. A particular account of mens disobedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this pretence. The vanity of it shown from the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing considerations. Religion needs not to be rescued from persecution. The freedom of outward means of Religion is restrained by it, but the substance of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it self is not. It is extended in some parts, and ennobled in all by sufferings. Where it needs to be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, disobedience is no fit means to preserve it, because God cannot be honoured, nor Religion served by it. Religion and the love of God is only the colour; but the true and real cause of such disobedience is a want of Religion, and too great a love of mens own selves. Men are liable to be deceived by this pretence from a wrong Notion of Religion for religious opinions and professions. A true Notion of Religion for religious practice upon a religious belief, as it implies both faith and obedience. The danger of disobedience upon this pretence. The practice of all religious men in this case. Of Religion in the narrow acceptation, for religious professions and
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:66440:183"/>
opinions. The commendable way of mens preserving it. <hi>First,</hi> By acting within their own sphere. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By the use only of lawful means. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By a zeal in the first place for the practice of religious Laws, and next to that for the free profession of religious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUT to render our service perfectly <hi>intire</hi> and compleatly <hi>upright,</hi> it is not enough that there be an <hi>integrity of the Subject,</hi> by our obeying with all our powers; or an <hi>integrity of time,</hi> by our obeying in all Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; of which <hi>two</hi> I have discoursed hitherto: but it is further necessary that there be an <hi>integrity of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> also; or that what we do thus obey with our <hi>whole man,</hi> and our <hi>whole time,</hi> be nothing less than <hi>all the particular Laws of Duty and instances of Obedience</hi>; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing under the <hi>whole will of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We must not <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Neque est justa causatio cur prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferantur aliqua, ubi facienda sunt omnia.</hi> Sal. de Prov. l. 3. p. 80. Ed. Oxon.</note> pick and chuse in the doing of our Duty, for if we do not obey <hi>all,</hi> we obey not <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Si pro arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trio suo Servi Dominis obtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perant, ne in iis quidem, in quibus obtemperaverint, obsequuntur. Quando enim Servus ex Domini jussis ea facit tantummodo quae vult facere; jam non Dominicam implet voluntatem, sed suam.</hi> Id. p. 79.</note> right in any. Because <hi>all</hi> the Laws of God are bound upon us by the same power, and enjoyned by the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; so that if we fulfil any <hi>one</hi> upon this account of <hi>his having required it,</hi> the same reason holds for our fulfilling <hi>all</hi> the rest.</p>
               <p>This indeed is very hardly believed, because it is so hard to practise. For almost every man has some sin or other, which he can as well dye as part with: It has got his heart, and is become the Master of his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and since he loves it so dearly, he hopes that God will bear with it too. He will part with any thing else for Gods sake, he will not stick at any other ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, nor repine at any other imposition; all that he
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:66440:184"/>
craves is only to be tolerated in his Darling Lust, and to be allowed to serve him without <hi>cutting</hi> off what is as useful as his <hi>right hand,</hi> or <hi>pulling</hi> out what is as dear to him as his own <hi>right eye,</hi> to please him.</p>
               <p>And when men are thus desirous of reconciling the service of God with the service of their lusts; when they are resolved to hope, and yet resolved to sin: they have no other way but to perswade themselves that the keeping of <hi>some</hi> Precepts shall attone for the transgression of <hi>others,</hi> and to bear up themselves with the delusive hopes and false confidences of a <hi>partial</hi> and a <hi>half obedience.</hi> They presently forge new terms of life and pardon which God never made, and which he will never stand to: for finding that they do not perform all his Laws, and yet resolving that what they do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form shall be sufficient for them; they straightway fansie that if they do keep <hi>some,</hi> for the <hi>rest</hi> they shall have a Dispensation. It shall be enough for <hi>them</hi> to part with such lusts for Gods sake as they can best spare; but <hi>some</hi> they will keep, and <hi>them</hi> he must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; and so instead of a <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>intire,</hi> they put him off with a <hi>partial</hi> and a <hi>maimed</hi> service.</p>
               <p>Now this partiality of obedience is in so many kinds, as men have sins that are endeared to them, which they will not leave for God's sake, but join with him. For every beloved sin can make an interest and Party, and if it reign in us so far as to make us fulfil it, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey in it, our obedience in other things is all that we have to shew besides, and therefore it must be our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse for it.</p>
               <p>And this being an errour of such eternal moment, and a Rock whereupon all the souls, which miscarry under any appearances of piety, are split; I will be particular in recounting and evacuating those colours and <hi>pretences</hi> wherewith men deceive their own souls,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:66440:184"/>
and think that they justifie and defend it.</p>
               <p>Now as for those false grounds and pretensions, whereby men seek to shelter themselves under the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of such bosome-sins as they overlook, because they have no mind to leave them, hoping to be secured, whilst they continue in them, because of their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in other parts of Duty, which is a <hi>partial obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>: Those pretensions, I say, which are most plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in this matter, are these that follow, <hi>viz.</hi> because their indulgence of themselves in those instances wherein they disobey is either upon <hi>one</hi> or <hi>more</hi> of these accounts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For <hi>the preservation of their Religion and of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> in times <hi>of danger and persecution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. For <hi>the supply of their necessities,</hi> by <hi>sinful arts, compliances</hi> and <hi>services,</hi> in times of <hi>want</hi> and <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. For <hi>the satisfaction of their Flesh</hi> in sins of <hi>temper</hi> and <hi>complexion, age,</hi> or <hi>way of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>first</hi> pretence whereby men justifie to their own thoughts the indulged transgression of <hi>several</hi> Laws, whilst they obey in <hi>others</hi>; is because <hi>those transgressions,</hi> wherein they allow themselves, are <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the preservation of their Religion</hi> and <hi>of themselves in those times of danger</hi> and <hi>persecution, wherein Gods Providence has placed them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Religion</hi> is in <hi>danger,</hi> and like to be <hi>undermined</hi> by the <hi>close</hi> and <hi>subtle arts,</hi> or <hi>overborn</hi> by the more <hi>open</hi> and powerful violence of strong and witty Enemies. And this is <hi>Gods Cause,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours <hi>interest</hi>; so that whatever is done here, we think is in service of our Maker. If we <hi>fight,</hi> it is his <hi>bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles</hi>; if we <hi>spitefully persecute</hi> and devour, it is <hi>his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies</hi>; if we <hi>rob</hi> and <hi>spoil,</hi> it is to weaken <hi>his adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>; if we <hi>lye</hi> and <hi>dissemble,</hi> it is to defeat the designs
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:66440:185"/>
of such as he will call <hi>Rebels</hi>; if we transgress in <hi>all</hi> the instances, and use <hi>all</hi> the <hi>lawless liberties</hi> of <hi>war,</hi> it is because we are engaged in <hi>his quarrel.</hi> The Cause which we contend for, and have to manage, is <hi>sacred</hi>; and that we believe will justifie <hi>all</hi> means, and hallow any services <hi>whatsoever.</hi> So that our <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>fierceness, wrath</hi> and <hi>bitterness, envy</hi> and <hi>malice, revenge</hi> and <hi>cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, endless strife</hi> and <hi>ungovernable variance, spoils</hi> and <hi>rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries, seditions</hi> and <hi>murthers, wars</hi> and <hi>tumults:</hi> in a word, all the transports of <hi>passion</hi> and <hi>peevishness, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> and <hi>ill nature, rigour</hi> and <hi>revenge,</hi> are all <hi>sacred</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Cover; and pass for <hi>holy zeal</hi> and <hi>pious vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence,</hi> and <hi>religious concern</hi> for <hi>God</hi>; whenas, in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they are a most <hi>impious throwing</hi> off, and <hi>bursting</hi> through all the <hi>Tyes</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and Bonds of <hi>Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All these enormous effects and horrible instances of an indulged disobedience, are at this Day the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of this pretension.</p>
               <p>For some on one hand, who call us <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> to <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>holy Church,</hi> think no means <hi>sinful</hi> whereby they can <hi>weaken</hi> and <hi>divide, seduce, surprize,</hi> or any way <hi>destroy</hi> us. For they esteem it <hi>lawful</hi> to <hi>dissemble</hi> under all shapes to <hi>gain</hi> a <hi>Proselyte,</hi> or to <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affect</hi> a <hi>Party</hi> to our <hi>Communion</hi> and <hi>Government.</hi> They <hi>act</hi> a <hi>part</hi> and play the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> in all Disguises, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cover of all Trades, the better to insinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves among all sorts of men; they will <hi>affirm falshood,</hi> even of their <hi>own</hi> Church, when it serves their turn; and <hi>deny</hi> any <hi>Doctrines, Precepts,</hi> or <hi>Parts</hi> of it, when they are a <hi>scandal</hi> to the persons whom they would pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise upon, and make against them. They make no conscience of <hi>lyes</hi> and <hi>perjuries</hi> in conversation, when thereby they can promote the Churches interest. For they have found out ways to <hi>deceive</hi> without <hi>lying,</hi> and
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:66440:185"/>
to <hi>lye</hi> without <hi>sin,</hi> and to <hi>forswear</hi> without <hi>perjury,</hi> and to <hi>perjure</hi> themselves without <hi>danger</hi>; by their <hi>pious frauds,</hi> and <hi>religious arts</hi> of <hi>equivocations, mental reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, dispensations, pardons</hi> and <hi>indulgences.</hi> They can be <hi>treacherous</hi> and <hi>faithless</hi> without <hi>breach of faith,</hi> if it were made to <hi>Hereticks</hi>; they <hi>assassinate</hi> and <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Magistrates, embitter</hi> and <hi>embroil Subjects</hi> against their <hi>Governours,</hi> and against <hi>one another</hi>; they <hi>conspire</hi> the <hi>death of Kings,</hi> the <hi>confusion</hi> and <hi>fall of Kingdoms,</hi> the <hi>ruine</hi> of all that dare <hi>oppose</hi> them, yea even of all that <hi>differ</hi> from them. And all this they do for <hi>Christ's</hi> sake, in a <hi>zealous concern for God and Religion,</hi> and for the utter extirpation of all <hi>heresie</hi> and <hi>schism.</hi> It is <hi>this</hi> pretence which bears them out through all, and makes them believe that they are <hi>serving God,</hi> whilst after this extravagant rate they are overturning his whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</p>
               <p>And <hi>others</hi> again even of our <hi>own selves,</hi> who justly abhor these damnable instances of disobedience upon the pretence of preserving or propagating Religion in <hi>some furious</hi> and <hi>fiery spirited</hi> sort of <hi>Papists,</hi> (for God forbid that we should think them <hi>all</hi> to be of this temper) do yet run into the same extravagance, which upon so great reason they condemn in them.</p>
               <p>For if we look into our <hi>zeal</hi> for the <hi>common Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Protestants,</hi> we shall find that we transgress <hi>many,</hi> and those most <hi>material</hi> and <hi>weighty</hi> Laws of it, whilst we express our <hi>affection</hi> and <hi>concern</hi> to <hi>defend</hi> and <hi>preserve</hi> it.</p>
               <p>For doth not this <hi>pretence of preserving our Religion</hi> carry us beyond all the bounds of <hi>peaceableness,</hi> and <hi>good subjection?</hi> Our great fears about its defence make us daily to <hi>distrust our Governours,</hi> to <hi>think</hi> and <hi>speak irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently</hi> and <hi>reproachfully</hi> of their <hi>persons,</hi> to <hi>undervalue</hi> all their <hi>counsels,</hi> to <hi>misconstrue</hi> all their <hi>actions</hi> and
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:66440:186"/>
proceedings, and with much <hi>undutifull credulity</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian rashness</hi> to <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>spread</hi> abroad concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them most <hi>odious suspicions</hi> and <hi>invidious reports</hi>; they make us <hi>pragmatical</hi> and <hi>busie-bodies,</hi> to go out of our <hi>own sphere,</hi> and to <hi>usurp</hi> upon the <hi>Magistrates,</hi> in <hi>projecting means</hi> and expediencies, <hi>prejudging Criminals,</hi> and <hi>irreverent censuring, reproaching,</hi> yea, and oft-times <hi>slandering of our Governours,</hi> if they, either in <hi>Court</hi> or <hi>Council,</hi> at the <hi>Board</hi> or on the <hi>Bench,</hi> determine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our anticipations. They make us to <hi>disturb</hi> the <hi>quiet,</hi> and to <hi>unsettle</hi> the <hi>peace</hi> of our <hi>fellow-sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> in filling their minds with <hi>endless jealousies</hi> about their <hi>Princes care,</hi> and their <hi>own safety,</hi> and in posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them with <hi>discontents,</hi> and <hi>undutifull suspicions, words</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> to the great <hi>weakning of Government,</hi> and <hi>disturbance of the publick peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, I add further, these same fears for our endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered Religion transport us into the transgression of sundry weighty Laws, which oblige us towards our very <hi>enemies</hi> who have contrived to destroy us. For they have made us most partially <hi>backward to believe any thing that is good,</hi> and <hi>forward</hi> to <hi>catch at every thing that is spoken ill against them.</hi> They have made many of us <hi>fierce</hi> and <hi>implacable, malicious</hi> and <hi>revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi>; they have caused us to <hi>thirst</hi> after their <hi>blood,</hi> and to be in <hi>pain</hi> when they <hi>escape</hi>; to measure our <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>soundness of our piety,</hi> by a <hi>reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, spitefull,</hi> and <hi>implacable usage</hi> and <hi>behaviour</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. <hi>All</hi> which are <hi>tempers</hi> and <hi>practices</hi> most contrary to those Laws of <hi>forgiving injuries,</hi> of <hi>loving enemies,</hi> of <hi>praying for our persecutors,</hi> of <hi>returning good to all that have evilly entreated us,</hi> of <hi>meekness</hi> and <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, mercy</hi> and <hi>placableness</hi> towards the <hi>worst</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> yea, even the <hi>worst</hi> of <hi>enemies,</hi> which are so much the soul and spirit of that Religion, which we pretend to be so zealously concerned for.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:66440:186"/>And if we look into our <hi>Zeal</hi> for our <hi>several parties,</hi> how many other Laws shall we find to be daily trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed, I will not say for the <hi>preservation,</hi> but even, where that is sufficiently secured, for the higher <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement</hi> and <hi>encrease</hi> of them? For what <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>unmannerly, envious</hi> and <hi>ill-natured reflections</hi> are dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cast upon <hi>those persons,</hi> especially <hi>Ministers,</hi> and men of <hi>Note</hi> and <hi>Eminence,</hi> who <hi>differ</hi> from us? How forward are many among us to <hi>undervalue</hi> and <hi>dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,</hi> to <hi>contemn</hi> and <hi>affront</hi> them; to heap <hi>reproach</hi> and <hi>infamy</hi> upon them, thereby to render their <hi>persons ridiculous,</hi> and their <hi>pains useless?</hi> For are not several of us perpetually <hi>censuring</hi> and <hi>speaking evil</hi> of them, <hi>undervaluing</hi> all their <hi>real virtues, putting hard</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candid interpretations</hi> upon <hi>all</hi> their <hi>actions, prying di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently</hi> and <hi>maliciously</hi> into all their <hi>defects,</hi> and <hi>aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating</hi> all their <hi>faults</hi> or <hi>follies, raising</hi> continually, and <hi>spreading</hi> to their disparagement <hi>uncharitable</hi> and <hi>envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> yea, oft-times <hi>false</hi> and <hi>slanderous reports?</hi> We <hi>envy</hi> and <hi>hate, reproach</hi> and <hi>censure, revile</hi> and <hi>slander, bite</hi> and <hi>devour</hi> one another; and all this <hi>fierceness</hi> and <hi>uncharitableness</hi> we use for that <hi>meek,</hi> that <hi>charitable, gentle, quiet</hi> thing, <hi>Religion.</hi> For in <hi>its</hi> service we take our selves to be engaged, and so long we fancy that we have a <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>saying,</hi> or <hi>doing</hi> any thing.</p>
               <p>Thus full of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Disobedience</hi> is this <hi>sanctified pretence.</hi> It is the cover for every offence, and the common shelter for all transgressions; for we boggle not at any <hi>Sin</hi> so long as it tends to <hi>preserve us</hi> in the <hi>prosperous profession</hi> of our <hi>endangered</hi> or <hi>oppressed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if men would consider calmly, and have patience to look beyond the surface and bare outsides of things, they would soon discern the vanity of this pretence, and how far it will be from excusing any such sinfull
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:66440:187"/>
and disobedient practices as they seek to justifie and warrant by it.</p>
               <p>For as for <hi>true</hi> and <hi>substantial Religion,</hi> for protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on whereof they would be thought to venture upon all these transgressions, it stands in no <hi>need</hi> of their help to <hi>preserve it in persecuting times,</hi> although they should use <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>just means,</hi> not such as are <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> and <hi>disobedient.</hi> It would live then without their care, and whether they went about by any <hi>politick</hi> means to preserve it <hi>yea,</hi> or <hi>no.</hi> For <hi>Religion</hi> is not <hi>lost</hi> when <hi>Religious men</hi> are <hi>persecuted</hi>; it doth not <hi>suffer,</hi> when they do that profess it, seeing it is not one <hi>jot</hi> impaired when men are <hi>buffetted</hi> and <hi>imprison'd,</hi> nay, <hi>bleed</hi> and <hi>dye</hi> for it.</p>
               <p>Indeed as for the <hi>freedom</hi> of the <hi>outward means</hi> of Religion, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the <hi>publickness of preaching,</hi> the <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of prayers,</hi> the <hi>unrestrained use of Sacraments,</hi> and the like; they are much <hi>straitned</hi> by <hi>persecutions,</hi> and we must expect to feel either a <hi>great want,</hi> or at least a <hi>great difficulty</hi> in them when <hi>Times</hi> are <hi>troublesome.</hi> A persecuting Government can in great measure deprive us of them, when after our utmost use of all such means, as are no wayes <hi>undutifull</hi> or against any Law of Christ, we are not able longer to preserve them.</p>
               <p>But as for the <hi>substantial part</hi> and <hi>main body</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it self, which consists in <hi>sound faith,</hi> and <hi>upright obedience,</hi> and which those <hi>outward means</hi> are <hi>appointed to beget</hi> in us; no state of Times need make them want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

                  <hi>unparallel'd sufferings of its professors, were the true prolifick, cause of the vast encrease of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed what should hinder Religion from thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in <hi>evil times?</hi> For the same Religious Duties, which are practised with more <hi>ease</hi> in a prosperous, are exercised also, but with greater <hi>honour,</hi> in an afflicted state of things. To <hi>believe,</hi> and <hi>do well</hi>; to be <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>pure, chast</hi> and <hi>sober, just</hi> and <hi>charitable, meek</hi> and <hi>gentle, quiet</hi> and <hi>peaceable,</hi> with all other instances of a substantial and acceptable Religion, are indifferent and undetermined to any turns of Providence. They may be shewn under <hi>fines</hi> and <hi>imprisonments, axes</hi> and <hi>hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>; as <hi>well,</hi> and much <hi>more honourably,</hi> than in times of <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>softness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, some of its most <hi>eminent parts</hi> and <hi>noble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> are not capable of being exercised at other times. For the duties of <hi>patience,</hi> and <hi>taking up the cross,</hi> of <hi>forgiving injuries,</hi> and <hi>doing good to enemies,</hi> of <hi>praying for them that persecute us, and despitefully use us,</hi> which are the most <hi>exalted strains,</hi> and glorious heights of our Religion, are such, for which a <hi>peaceable</hi> and <hi>prosperous,</hi> a <hi>favourable</hi> and <hi>flourishing</hi> age affords no famous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities. For we must be in a state of <hi>suffering evil,</hi> and labouring under a load of persecution, before we can sufficiently evidence how <hi>readily,</hi> how <hi>magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously,</hi> how <hi>meekly,</hi> how <hi>charitably</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi>-like we can undergo it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:66440:188"/>So that as for <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Sufferings,</hi> they are at no such distance but that they may very easily be made to meet; they bear no such mutual opposition, but that they may very well <hi>consist</hi> together; nay, I add far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that they may <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>ennoble,</hi> and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny instances, <hi>enlarge</hi> and <hi>improve</hi> each other. And therefore Religion needs not to be preserved from suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, since it can not only live in them, but is also much extended, heightned, and advanced by them.</p>
               <p>But where Religion wants our help, and calls for our assistance; yet is it not possible for us to please <hi>God,</hi> or to secure <hi>it</hi> by <hi>sinfull</hi> means, but only by such as are either <hi>virtuous,</hi> or at least <hi>innocent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not possible for us, I say, to <hi>please God</hi> by <hi>sinfull means,</hi> although we intend them for his own service. For what is there in God that should be served by our sins? Is his <hi>Love</hi> for any thing greater than his <hi>hatred</hi> is for sin, so as the gratefulness of <hi>that</hi> should make <hi>this,</hi> otherwise most <hi>offensive,</hi> an <hi>acceptable service?</hi> Is any thing that we can offer to him so pleasing as our obedience? Is he more delighted when we follow our <hi>own</hi> counsel, than when we follow <hi>his</hi>; when we do our <hi>own,</hi> than when we do <hi>his</hi> pleasure? For all <hi>those</hi> Laws of the Gospel, and instances of obedience, which under this pretension we transgress, are wayes of <hi>Gods own appointment</hi>; they are a service of his own choosing, a Religion that is most agreeable to his mind, and fitted in all things according to his liking; a rule that he has thought most absolute to direct our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and most fit for us to walk by. If then we would exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

his <hi>own</hi> prescribing. Let us honour him in his own way, by <hi>doing our duty,</hi> and practising <hi>such</hi> things as he has made expressions of honour, by making them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of obedience. For <hi>disobedience</hi> can serve no <hi>interest of God,</hi> nothing that we can do being so effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual a reproach to <hi>all</hi> his <hi>Attributes,</hi> as to <hi>disobey</hi> him.</p>
               <p>Nor is the use of evil and <hi>unlawfull means</hi> in any wise a fitter expression of our <hi>care for Religion.</hi> For what is there in Religion, that can be honoured and advanced by disobedience? Is there any thing in <hi>it</hi> so <hi>sacred</hi> as the <hi>Divine Laws</hi>; and dare any man call that his <hi>care</hi> of them, when he <hi>lays wast,</hi> and plainly <hi>rejects</hi> them? It is gross impudence for any man to pretend <hi>Piety</hi> in the <hi>breach of Duty</hi>; and to cry up <hi>Religion</hi> whilst he is acting <hi>irreligiously</hi>; he prides himself in the <hi>empty name,</hi> when it is clear to all that he has lost the <hi>thing</hi>; for as for <hi>Piety</hi> it self, and <hi>true Religion,</hi> by transgressing and trampling upon the Divine Laws, he doth not <hi>further</hi> and <hi>defend,</hi> but <hi>impiously</hi> and <hi>irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously destroys</hi> it.</p>
               <p>It is not <hi>Religion</hi> then, whatever men may vainly pretend, that makes them run into the <hi>breach of Laws,</hi> and contempt of Duty lest they should <hi>suffer</hi> in the <hi>profession</hi> of it. For God and Religion owe them no thanks for such a course, because <hi>he</hi> is not <hi>honoured,</hi> nor <hi>it strengthned</hi> and <hi>preserved,</hi> but <hi>ruined</hi> and <hi>destroyed</hi> by it.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real cause</hi> of <hi>such disobedience,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> are only the <hi>colour</hi> and <hi>false pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</hi> is plainly a <hi>great want</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and of the <hi>love of God,</hi> and too <hi>great</hi> a <hi>love of the world,</hi> and of <hi>mens own selves.</hi> Men are hurried away by an <hi>unmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified</hi> love of <hi>pleasures, honours,</hi> and <hi>temporal interests</hi>; and they have not <hi>Religion</hi> enough to <hi>restrain</hi> and <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule</hi> them. For <hi>these</hi> it is, and not <hi>Religion,</hi> which <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings</hi>
                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:66440:189"/>
and <hi>persecuting times</hi> take from them: and an <hi>ungovernable desire</hi> to preserve <hi>these,</hi> which makes them so <hi>violent,</hi> as that, at <hi>such</hi> times, no <hi>Laws of Religion</hi> can <hi>hold</hi> them. When men <hi>set at nought</hi> and <hi>disparage Governours, disobey Laws, disturb</hi> the <hi>Publick Peace, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure</hi> their <hi>Fellow-subjects,</hi> and commit several other <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> acts and <hi>irreligious</hi> violations of the <hi>Laws of Christ,</hi> that they may <hi>keep off Persecution</hi> for the <hi>profession</hi> of the <hi>Christian Faith:</hi> they shew plainly that they will follow <hi>Christ</hi> only in a <hi>thriving,</hi> but not in a <hi>suffering Religion.</hi> They will serve him no longer than he sets them <hi>uppermost,</hi> and above their Brethren. For rather than <hi>suffer</hi> any <hi>loss,</hi> and <hi>fall</hi> into any <hi>dangers</hi> for their <hi>adherence</hi> to him; they will <hi>leave</hi> him and his Laws to fend for themselves, and flatly disobey him. But when they do so, it is <hi>shameless hypocrisie</hi> to pretend, that all their <hi>transgressions</hi> and <hi>disobedience</hi> is still upon the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> and from the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi>; since it is not <hi>Religion,</hi> but a <hi>resolution</hi> to be <hi>uppermost</hi>; not <hi>duty,</hi> but <hi>ambition, covetousness, sensuality, revenge,</hi> or a <hi>nest</hi> of some <hi>other unmortified</hi> and <hi>reigning vices</hi> of <hi>like</hi> nature, which makes them under <hi>pretence</hi> of a <hi>conscientious care</hi> for <hi>religious profession,</hi> to <hi>destroy all religious practice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, one would think, is <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>evident</hi> to any man who can have the patience to consider it; that <hi>True Religion can never be the cause of sin,</hi> or <hi>make men irreligious and disobedient. That</hi> must not for <hi>shame</hi> be called mens <hi>Religion,</hi> but their <hi>Lust</hi> which makes them <hi>wicked,</hi> and carries them on to <hi>transgress</hi> Gods <hi>Laws,</hi> that are the <hi>chief</hi> and <hi>sovereign</hi> part of his Religion, which, who so <hi>keeps,</hi> is a <hi>religious,</hi> as whosoever <hi>breaks</hi> them, is an <hi>ungodly</hi> and <hi>irreligious</hi> man.</p>
               <p>This indeed is clear Doctrine, and obvious to any <hi>common,</hi> if it be withall a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>considerate</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. And it were scarce possible that any men
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:66440:189"/>
should think otherwise, had they not either by <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, hast,</hi> or <hi>ill design,</hi> taken up an odd <hi>notion</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion altogether <hi>different</hi> from that which the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi> give, and which all <hi>considerately</hi> religious men have of it.</p>
               <p>For by <hi>Religion</hi> they mean only their <hi>adherence</hi> to the <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Opinions,</hi> but not to the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Precepts</hi> of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> And when they talk of <hi>defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and maintaining of <hi>Religion</hi>; they intend not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Laws,</hi> but of <hi>Notions</hi>; not a maintenance of the <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>Christian Precepts,</hi> but only of the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> of <hi>Christian Doctrines.</hi> They are of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Christ <hi>reveals,</hi> but not of that which he <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi>; they will <hi>know</hi> and <hi>believe</hi> what <hi>he</hi> pleases, but <hi>do</hi> what <hi>they</hi> please themselves. They are only for a Religion of <hi>Orthodox Tenets,</hi> but not of <hi>Vpright Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi>; and if <hi>thereby</hi> they can preserve men <hi>safe</hi> in <hi>thinking</hi> and <hi>professing well</hi>; they fancy that God will not be offended with their use of any <hi>means,</hi> though never so <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>disobedient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is a most <hi>gross mistake,</hi> and a most <hi>dangerous Notion</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> which is quite another thing than what this conceit doth represent it to be. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>prime part</hi> and matter of <hi>Religion</hi> is the <hi>practick part,</hi> (viz.) the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Precepts,</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> and <hi>Threatnings</hi> of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> And agreeably thereto the <hi>prime business</hi> of all <hi>Religious</hi> men is an <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient practice,</hi> and performance of them, or a <hi>virtuous discharge of duty</hi> and a <hi>holy life.</hi> This is that Religion whereby all of us must stand or fall, and that great <hi>condition,</hi> which, as I have shewn, we must for ever <hi>live</hi> or <hi>dye</hi> by. <hi>When Christ comes to judgement,</hi> sayes Saint <hi>Paul, he will render to every man according to his deeds,</hi> Rom. 2.6. And in that prospect of the last judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John</hi> tells us God vouchsafed him, <hi>men
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:66440:190"/>
were judged every one according to their works,</hi> Rev. 20.13. This Religion of <hi>Obedience</hi> and a <hi>good Life,</hi> is that which the <hi>Gospel</hi> is full of, wherein every <hi>Chapter,</hi> nay almost every <hi>verse</hi> of it <hi>instructs</hi> us, and some way or other <hi>directs, exhorts, encourages</hi> and <hi>excites</hi> to. And therefore, as ever we would pass for Religious men in the <hi>Scripture Notion,</hi> we must be carefull to live in all <hi>Piety towards God,</hi> by <hi>complying</hi> readily with all <hi>his Laws, depending</hi> upon his <hi>Providence,</hi> and <hi>resigning</hi> our selves up to his <hi>pleasure</hi>; in all <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>soberness,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing free from all <hi>lust</hi> and <hi>intemperance,</hi> all <hi>sinfull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,</hi> and <hi>covetous practices</hi>; in all <hi>justice</hi> and <hi>charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness, doing right,</hi> and <hi>keeping peace,</hi> and <hi>shewing mercy</hi> towards all men. <hi>This,</hi> sayes S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>James,</hi> will pass for <hi>pure and undefiled Religion before God and the Father</hi> at the last day, if in such instances as these we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, not our Opinions, but our Obedience; by <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siting the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and by keeping our selves unspotted from</hi> all filthiness and disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of <hi>the world.</hi> But <hi>if any man</hi> pretends to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, who is destitute of this obedience, <hi>that mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is vain,</hi> Jam. 1.26, 27.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another great <hi>part</hi> and <hi>object</hi> of Religion, is the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> And agreeably another act or instance of <hi>Religious Service,</hi> is <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Belief.</hi> And this is intended by God himself as a <hi>means</hi> to produce the former; Faith being the great <hi>instrument</hi> in working out our obedience. For <hi>this is that victory,</hi> sayes S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John,</hi> which makes us conquerors, and <hi>overcometh the world, even our Faith,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.4. An <hi>obedient practice</hi> is all that a <hi>righteous faith</hi> aims at; it is its <hi>end</hi> and <hi>perfection,</hi> that which consummates and compleats it. It being, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>James</hi> assures us, <hi>by works</hi> which <hi>faith</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>co-operates</hi> and concurs to, that <hi>faith is made perfect,</hi> Jam. 2.22. And this all the points of our
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:66440:190"/>
                  <hi>Christian Faith</hi> are most admirably fitted to effect in us. For in that <hi>epitome</hi> and compendious account of them, whereinto they were contracted by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and which is usually called the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> there is not any <hi>one</hi> purely <hi>speculative</hi> Article, or point of <hi>idle</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and <hi>meer belief.</hi> But every one is influential up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our <hi>practice,</hi> and helps on our obedience; as any man, of competent skill and abilities, may discern by running over the particulars.</p>
               <p>These <hi>two</hi> then, <hi>(viz.) Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> or <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> take in the compass, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate the nature of our <hi>Religion.</hi> Obedience is the <hi>chief</hi> thing, and <hi>first</hi> in Gods design; and Faith or Knowledge is the great <hi>means</hi> which God has prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed us, whereby to compass and effect it. So that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> in that sense wherein the <hi>Scriptures</hi> use, and God at the last day will <hi>reward</hi> it; is the same, as <hi>obedience to the Gospel proceeding from a belief of it,</hi> or, in Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s phrase, an <hi>Obedient Faith,</hi> or a <hi>Faith which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by Love,</hi> Gal. 5.6.</p>
               <p>And now let any man, who considers this, bethink himself, and tell me whether the <hi>transgression</hi> of <hi>Gods Laws</hi> can ever be called <hi>Religion</hi> in the <hi>Scripture-sense</hi>; or whether it be possible for men to evidence them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be <hi>Religious</hi> by their <hi>disobedience.</hi> For the making us obedient to Gods <hi>Laws</hi> is the great design, and <hi>ruling</hi> part of all true and acceptable Religion; and the belief and profession of Gods <hi>Truth</hi> is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise and instance of it that avails us only so far, as it concurs to, and effects this Religion of Obedience. So that Religion is not <hi>preserved,</hi> but <hi>lost</hi> by breach of Duty; it is never <hi>strengthned</hi> by <hi>disobedient</hi> and <hi>sinfull</hi> means, but is alwayes wasted and destroyed by them.</p>
               <p>Let no man therefore ever dare to make Religion a cover for unlawfull Lusts; or dream of protecting it
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:66440:191"/>
from sufferings and persecutions this way. For God will by no means endure such gross mockery and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical pretensions, as for men to <hi>feign</hi> piety in the breach of Duty; but if they wickedly transgress his Laws, and continue impenitently to disobey him, let their Forms and Professions of Religion be what they will, he will take severe and endless vengeance on them for their <hi>impious</hi> and <hi>irreligious disobedience.</hi> If they are <hi>scandalized</hi> at the <hi>Cross,</hi> that is, if they fall off from <hi>religious</hi> and <hi>obedient walking</hi> into <hi>irreligious transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi> to prevent those <hi>crosses</hi> that in persecuting times are annexed to a <hi>religious practice</hi> and <hi>profession</hi>; they are <hi>scandalized,</hi> or <note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 11.6.</note> 
                  <hi>offended</hi> in him. The Cross is to them a <note n="f" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.8. Galat. 5.11.</note> 
                  <hi>stumbling-block,</hi> and a <hi>rock of offence,</hi> it makes them trip, and turn out of their duty; because they will disown their Lord, and break all his Laws rather than undergo it. And this is a most provoking sin, and subjects men to a most dreadful punishment. For as God will abundantly recompence any losses which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall us through the exercise of an <hi>obedient</hi> Religion, and a pious conscience; so will he also inflict such torments, as infinitely surpass all those light and present advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, which we may at any time promise our selves from our <hi>politick disobedience. For whosoever,</hi> by sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full means, <hi>will seek</hi> in <hi>perillous</hi> and <hi>persecuting</hi> times, such as those were, <hi>to save his life</hi> in this world; <hi>he shall</hi> certainly <hi>lose it</hi> for ever in the next world: <hi>but whosoever shall lay down his life</hi> for Christs <hi>sake</hi> (in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up that cross which is laid upon a Christian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and a Christian practice) <hi>that same</hi> man <hi>shall save</hi> and encrease <hi>it</hi> eternally, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.23, 24. So that no dangers in obedience, can ever render it secure for any man to disobey. But that which God indispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly exacts of us in perillous cases is this. <hi>Fear not them which kill the body, but,</hi> after that is done, have nothing
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:66440:191"/>
more to fright you with, being utterly <hi>unable to kill,</hi> or so much as touch <hi>the soul; but fear him who</hi> exacts obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of you even at such times as your bodies are like to perish for it, for he, after he hath killed the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which is all that they can do, <hi>is able</hi> eternally <hi>to destroy both body and soul in hell,</hi> Mat. 10.28.</p>
               <p>No dangers then can make obedience cease to be our <hi>Duty,</hi> nor any sufferings make it cease to be our <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est:</hi> So that neither <hi>Religion,</hi> nor <hi>Prudence</hi> will ever allow of sinfull means; but every <hi>Religious,</hi> yea, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>wise</hi> man must take up the Cross, and patiently bear any sufferings that come upon him for Religion, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than use any breach of duty, or unlawfull wayes, either to prevent, or remove it.</p>
               <p>And this the <hi>Saints</hi> of God and <hi>Religious</hi> men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes did. For no dangers or hazards, no pains or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings in obedience could ever draw them to seek for shelter by disobeying. <hi>David</hi> was tryed with hazards and persecutions of all sorts, but neither <hi>sense</hi> of <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> nor fears of <hi>future</hi> evils could ever chase him from his duty, or make him seek relief from iniquity and sin. He could not be forced upon it by the most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent dangers even of the most affecting loss, the loss of <hi>life</hi> it self. <hi>The wicked,</hi> saith he, <hi>have laid a snare for me, yet I erred not from thy Precepts. My soul is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in my hand</hi> ready to be snatched out of it, <hi>yet do I not forget thy Law,</hi> Psal. 119.109, 110. He was not grieved, or frighted into it, either by the pressure of his pains, or by the number of his persecutors: <hi>They had almost consumed me upon earth, but I forsook not thy Commandments,</hi> vers. 87. <hi>and many</hi> now still <hi>are my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors</hi> and enemies, <hi>yet do I not decline from thy testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> vers. 157.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Holy Apostles</hi> of our Saviour conflicted with more difficulties and distress, persecutions, and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:66440:192"/>
for the Religion and Obedience of their Lord, than any men, I think, ever did, or it may be ever will do. <hi>I think,</hi> sayes S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, that God hath set forth us Apostles last, as it were men appointed to</hi> the bloodiest, which is usually the last, scene of all, even to <hi>death</hi> it self. <hi>For we are</hi> exposed to slaughter, as men were, in the tragical sports of that time, upon a publick theatre, being <hi>made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.</hi> From the first entrance on our office <hi>even to this present hour, we both hunger, and thirst, and are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and are buffetted, and have no certain dwelling place,</hi> being <hi>made as the</hi> very <hi>filth of the world, and the off-scouring of all things</hi> from the first <hi>to this day,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.9, 11, 13. If any straits could authorize an evil action, or if any pressures could justifie a disobedient escape, sure these would. But they knew too well the nature of their Religion ever to dream of a liberty to sin that they might avoid persecution; and they were too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely addicted to it ever to attempt it. For neither the <hi>extremity</hi> of their <hi>sufferings,</hi> nor <hi>the desperateness</hi> of their <hi>danger,</hi> could ever make them transgress their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or go beyond the Laws of their Religion to lessen or prevent them. But they obeyed <hi>bravely</hi> and <hi>entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> even in the <hi>highest strains,</hi> even in the most <hi>ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full instances,</hi> even in <hi>those</hi> matters, wherein, if any where, the <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>violence</hi> of their enemies would <hi>provoke,</hi> or rather <hi>force</hi> them to disobey. For in the midst of all these pressures, sayes S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, being reviled, we bless, being persecuted, we suffer it; being defamed, we do</hi> nothing worse than <hi>entreat</hi> and pray for our defamers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.12, 13. <hi>In patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, in stripes, in imprisonments, in</hi> popular <hi>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, in</hi> manual <hi>labours, in all</hi> these <hi>things,</hi> and in the throng and distraction of all our sorrows, <hi>we approve our selves as the</hi> true obedient Servants, and faithfull

                  <hi>Ministers of God</hi>; shewing that, not by any selfish, disobedient, politick shifts, but <hi>by pureness</hi> of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, <hi>by long-suffering, by kindness,</hi> even to our very enemies; in a word, <hi>by</hi> the most excellent of all gifts, and the Epitome of all Duty, Charity or <hi>love unfeigned,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Religion</hi> then can never give <hi>protection</hi> to any <hi>disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> nor our <hi>concern</hi> and <hi>zeal</hi> for God be pleaded with any shew of <hi>modesty</hi> or <hi>reason</hi> in vindication of our <hi>transgressions</hi> of any of his <hi>Laws</hi> or <hi>Precepts.</hi> For <hi>Religion needs no defence</hi> from <hi>times of suffering,</hi> it can <hi>live</hi> in them, it is <hi>improved</hi> by them, nay some of its most <hi>glorious</hi> parts and <hi>eminent</hi> instances are <hi>never</hi> shown in any <hi>lustre,</hi> but when we fall <hi>under</hi> them; and where it <hi>ought</hi> to be defended, the <hi>breach of Laws</hi> is in no wise a <hi>fit instrument</hi> for its <hi>advancement</hi> and <hi>protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> For <hi>God</hi> cannot be <hi>honoured,</hi> nor <hi>Religion advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi> by disobedience. <hi>Obedience</hi> is so <hi>essential</hi> and <hi>super-eminent</hi> a part of its Nature, and so preferable to any <hi>idle profession</hi> or <hi>ineffective belief</hi>; that to transgress <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Laws,</hi> for the maintenance of an <hi>undisturbed liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> in <hi>professing Christian opinions,</hi> were not to <hi>strengthen</hi> and <hi>preserve,</hi> but <hi>dangerously to wound,</hi> if not <hi>wholly</hi> to <hi>destroy</hi> it. This disobedience to <hi>Christian Laws</hi> that we may avoid suffering for the <hi>profession</hi> of <hi>Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,</hi> is such as the very <hi>temper</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> which is made up in great part of <hi>passive Precepts</hi> and a <hi>suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion,</hi> plainly <hi>contradicts</hi>; such as its <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Precepts</hi> strictly <hi>forbid</hi>; such as <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord and Judg will <hi>certainly</hi> and most <hi>severely punish</hi>; and such as the most <hi>persecuted religious men</hi> could never be <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked</hi> or <hi>forced</hi> into, either by the <hi>greatness of their fears,</hi> or by the <hi>violence</hi> of their <hi>pains,</hi> although the most exquisite that could be invented by the most <hi>searching wits</hi> and <hi>keenest malice</hi> in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:66440:193"/>So that whensoever men <hi>sin</hi> to avoid <hi>suffering,</hi> and disobey the <hi>Laws</hi> of Religion to preserve the <hi>profession</hi> of it from <hi>persecution</hi>; it is not <hi>Religion,</hi> but their <hi>Lusts,</hi> not their <hi>love of God,</hi> but their <hi>love of their own selves</hi> which makes them <hi>disobedient. Religion</hi> will upon no accounts justifie their transgressions, but utterly condemns them; and unless their repentance prevents it, God at the last Day will <hi>endlesly punish</hi> and avenge for them.</p>
               <p>But as for <hi>Religion</hi> in that <hi>narrow sense</hi> wherein some understand it, <hi>i. e. the use of religious Ordinances, and the profession and belief of religious Opinions</hi>; if men would shew their <hi>care</hi> and <hi>concern</hi> to preserve the free liberty and unpersecuted use of that, so as both <hi>God</hi> and all <hi>good men</hi> should honour and <hi>commend</hi> them; let them shew it in a <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>discreet</hi> management.

               <p n="1">1. In shewing their care to preserve the <hi>free liberty</hi> and <hi>unpersecuted use</hi> of <hi>religious Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> they must <hi>act within their own sphere.</hi> We <hi>private</hi> Christians must not prescribe methods of preserving it to <hi>publick</hi> Magistrates, or <hi>censure</hi> their <hi>proceedings,</hi> and <hi>speak irreverently</hi> of their <hi>persons</hi> and <hi>administrations,</hi> when they determine otherwise than we had thought <hi>fitting.</hi> We must not, without <hi>consent</hi> and <hi>approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Authority, combine</hi> in Bodies, and <hi>associate</hi> in <hi>solemn Leagues, Bonds,</hi> and <hi>Covenants,</hi> to be aiding and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to each other with our <hi>Persons, Armes,</hi> and <hi>Purses,</hi> to <hi>protect</hi> it against all Opposers. For these are such things as are no part of <hi>our</hi> business; but God has hedged them in, and entrusted them in <hi>other hands.</hi>
                  <pb n="351" facs="tcp:66440:193"/>
He has delegated that power to <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> to take care of the <hi>common good,</hi> and to judge of <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick expedience.</hi> He has put the <hi>sword</hi> into the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates</hi> hands, and has authorized him, and him <hi>only,</hi> to have power of life and death, and to decree and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>war.</hi> And if any man, without his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, shall take the Sword, and use it against his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he may read his Sentence which is writ in plain words already, <hi>They that take the sword,</hi> as every man doth when Authority doth not allow or reach it out to him, <hi>shall perish by the sword,</hi> Matth. 26.52.</p>
               <p>These means then, and any others which God has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the care, and entrusted in the hands of other men, can be no <hi>lawful</hi> expressions of our care, but an <hi>unlawful</hi> intruding into anothers Office; a <hi>sinful</hi> use of what is put out of <hi>ours,</hi> and committed to an <hi>others</hi> management.

               <p>But the endeavours which we are to use, and the means whereby we must try to secure to our selves an unpersecuted freedom in religious Ordinances and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions; must be such as are within the sphere of <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> men.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3.

                  <hi>Paul</hi> directs us to the <hi>great</hi> Object of all <hi>religious zeal,</hi> when he tells us that <hi>Christ came into the world to purchase to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good WORKS, Tit.</hi> 2.14.

has made them the measure of <hi>life</hi> or <hi>death,</hi> the Rule of our eternal <hi>absolution</hi> or <hi>condemnation.</hi> And as he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of them, so should we too. Our <hi>zeal</hi> for them must be <hi>more warm,</hi> and our <hi>care</hi> more <hi>watchful</hi> than for any other thing; because <hi>God</hi> himself is most espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially concerned <hi>for</hi> them, and all <hi>men</hi> are most highly concerned <hi>in</hi> them; they being that whereby all men must live or dye eternally. <hi>This I will,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

So that the <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>religious Laws</hi> must be the great point, wherein we are to be <hi>zealous</hi> and <hi>careful</hi> in the <hi>first</hi> place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next</hi> to which we must take care of those <hi>opinions</hi> which have a great <hi>influence</hi> upon, and are the great <hi>productive instruments</hi> of all <hi>obedient practice</hi>; such as are all opinions which are either <hi>motives</hi> or <hi>inducements, helps</hi> or <hi>encouragements</hi> to <hi>obedience.</hi> In which sort of opinions our Religion abounds, there being, as I said, no <hi>idle Article</hi> in the Christian Creed, but such <hi>Doctrins</hi> and <hi>Declarations</hi> concerning <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>our selves,</hi> and the <hi>other world,</hi> as are either <hi>absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,</hi> or <hi>very helpful</hi> to a <hi>holy life.</hi> All which, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their several proportions in promoting piety and obedience to Gods Laws, we are to be <hi>zealously</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for in the <hi>next</hi> place, as we are for that pious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience which is wrought by them in the <hi>first.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when we have shown our <hi>good affection</hi> to <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial piety</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> by a <hi>just zeal</hi> for <hi>obedience,</hi> and plainly <hi>practical opinions</hi>; then may it be very fit for us to shew our <hi>zeal</hi> for <hi>other true Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> likewise. For it is a great honour to <hi>God,</hi> and an ornament to <hi>Religion,</hi> that we have it <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,</hi> free from all things that are liable to just excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

and from all mixture of <hi>errour</hi> and <hi>falshood.</hi> And it is also a great happiness to <hi>men</hi> to have <hi>orthodox ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions</hi> in Religion, and to embrace nothing for <hi>Gospel</hi> truths, but what God has thereby declared to them. But it is a further happiness still, and such whereof men are the most sensible, to be free from the <hi>imperious imposition</hi> and <hi>tyranny</hi> of <hi>errour</hi>; so as neither to be forced upon the <hi>impossible belief</hi> of that, which in our own minds we see is <hi>false,</hi> and therefore cannot believe; nor upon the <hi>feigned</hi> and <hi>hypocritical profession</hi> of believing a thing, when <hi>really</hi> we do <hi>not</hi> believe it; <hi>one</hi> of which <hi>two</hi> is mens unhappiness, when their <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Religion</hi> falls under <hi>persecution.</hi> Now both these are <hi>severe</hi> and <hi>rigorous</hi> impositions. For the <hi>first</hi> is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly <hi>impossible</hi> to <hi>any,</hi> so long as it continues a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>impartial, head</hi>; as the <hi>latter</hi> is to <hi>any,</hi> whilst it remains an <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>obedient, heart.</hi> So that all men have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great reason, so far as they can by all <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest</hi> ways, to be <hi>zealous</hi> against them, and to use all the <hi>lawful</hi> care and caution that possibly they can, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void so powerful a <hi>motive,</hi> as a sharp <hi>persecution</hi> is, to tempt them to a thing so <hi>unreasonable</hi> as is the <hi>first,</hi> and so <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>sinful,</hi> as is the <hi>latter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So long then as men will moderate their <hi>zeal</hi> for the <hi>unpersecuted</hi> use of religious Ordinances, and profession of religious Opinions, with this discretion; let them be <hi>zealous</hi> and <hi>concerned</hi> for it in God's Name. For it is their Duty so to be; and <hi>God</hi> will <hi>reward,</hi> and all <hi>good</hi> men <hi>commend</hi> them for it. If they take care that their <hi>zeal transport</hi> them not beyond their <hi>own sphere,</hi> that it carry them not <hi>against</hi> their <hi>Duty,</hi> and that it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the <hi>first</hi> place for <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>practical opinions</hi>; they may allow it after that to spend it self upon other Points which have more of <hi>speculative truth,</hi> but less of <hi>practice.</hi> This zeal now is <hi>excellent,</hi> 'tis truly <hi>pious,</hi> 'tis <hi>religious.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>ANother</hi> pretence whereby men justifie to their own thoughts the <hi>allowed transgression</hi> of <hi>several</hi> Laws whilst they <hi>obey</hi> in <hi>others,</hi> is the <hi>serving of their necessities</hi>; because those instances of disobedience, wherein they indulge themselves, are only such <hi>sinful arts, compliances</hi> and <hi>services,</hi> as are <hi>necessary</hi> to <hi>relieve their want and indigence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are in great streights, and deep poverty; and since God has not provided <hi>conveniencies,</hi> nor it may be <hi>necessaries</hi> for them; they think that they may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be their own Guardians, and to use any means within their own compass whereby they can make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for their own selves. For they are born with the same <hi>appetites</hi> and <hi>indigencies</hi> as other men, and some way or other they must <hi>satisfie</hi> and <hi>supply</hi> them. And this they cannot do if in <hi>all</hi> things they must religious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obey, and keep themselves <hi>intirely</hi> innocent. They must <hi>lye</hi> and <hi>overreach, cheat</hi> and <hi>cozen,</hi> if not <hi>pilfer</hi> and <hi>steal,</hi> to get <hi>maintenance.</hi> And they must also use <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed arts</hi> and <hi>sinful compliances</hi> to get <hi>favour.</hi> For not having of their <hi>own</hi> wherewith to <hi>relieve the wants,</hi> to <hi>comfort</hi> the <hi>weaknesses,</hi> and to <hi>appease</hi> the <hi>cravings</hi> of their <hi>natures</hi>; they must be beholden, and cannot help it, to the <hi>good will</hi> and <hi>kind charity</hi> of <hi>others.</hi> And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men are <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>humorous,</hi> acted by <hi>self-will</hi> and <hi>vicious interests</hi>; and will therefore reach out no help to them unless they please them, and do <hi>any,</hi> or <hi>all</hi> such things as they would have them do. They must <hi>lye</hi> and <hi>dissemble, fawn</hi> and <hi>flatter, drink</hi> and <hi>swear,</hi> bear them <hi>company</hi> in their <hi>sins,</hi> and <hi>serve</hi> their <hi>vicious
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:66440:196"/>
interests,</hi> and <hi>boggle</hi> at no <hi>sort</hi> of <hi>sinful arts</hi> and <hi>disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent compliances</hi>; or else they are not for their turn, nor must expect to feel any effects of their kindness.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>hard fate,</hi> and the <hi>great temptation</hi> of a <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>indigent</hi> condition. They who labour under it, are brought thus into a <hi>seeming</hi> necessity of many sins, because they cannot otherwise provide for their own <hi>maintenance</hi> and <hi>appetites.</hi> For God has made their nature <hi>subject</hi> to <hi>several wants</hi>; and he has made their condition <hi>low,</hi> so that they are unable to relieve themselves in any comfortable degree, but must depend, as for that, either upon the <hi>fraud</hi> and <hi>overreaching cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of their <hi>own wits,</hi> or upon the <hi>good will</hi> of <hi>others</hi>: and his Providence has placed them among such <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi> whose <hi>kindness</hi> and good will they cannot pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase, but at the <hi>cost</hi> of their <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi> And therefore if in this hard Case they disobey, they hope that he will excuse it. Their necessity they think will bear them out, so long as all their transgressions are only to provide for themselves, and for the competent satisfaction of their own appetites where his Providence has left them unprovided.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>wicked arguing</hi> and <hi>disobedient practice</hi> of men of a <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>delicate Religion.</hi> They will obey God in any thing, where they must not disoblige their appetites; but no further than they will suffer them. They are Servants of their own <hi>Bellies</hi> in the first place, and God shall have just so much, but no more, than they can spare him. For they will live easily, and want for nothing in <hi>this</hi> world, as well as be for ever happy in the <hi>next:</hi> and if God will allow them <hi>both</hi> these, then they are for him; but otherwise they have nothing to say either to him or his Religion. For they will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to <hi>serve</hi> a <hi>man of sorrows,</hi> to <hi>follow Christ in wants,</hi> to <hi>be subjects</hi> to that <hi>Sovereign</hi> who has no <hi>temporal</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:66440:197"/>
wherewith, even in <hi>this</hi> life, to <hi>recompence</hi> their <hi>service.</hi> They will serve God just so long as he will suffer them to serve themselves and their own appetites; but if his service doth not provide them all supplies, or cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the satisfaction of these, they beg of him that he would excuse them. In other things they will serve him, if that will content him; but here charity must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at home, and if they disobey, he must give them a dispensation.</p>
               <p>But God will not endure to be thus undervalued, and served in the <hi>second</hi> place. He can in no wise bear to have the world and our fleshly appetites set above him; to see them served, and himself sleighted: because by this means we do not honour, but debase; not serve, but renounce him. For he can be no faithfull servant of God, who loves any thing better than his master; nor is he truly united unto Christ, who can be drawn to disobey him by any temptation. If we love any thing in the world then, though never so dear to us, better than him, we are utterly unworthy of him, and must never hope to be the better by him. For <hi>he that loveth father or mother, son, or daughter, more than me,</hi> saith he, <hi>is not worthy of me,</hi> Mat. 10.37. Nay, he that hateth not these, and all things else when they stand in competition with my service; <hi>that hateth not,</hi> I say not barely his worldly goods, and rich neighbours, but even his <hi>father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be my disciple,</hi> Luk. 14.26.</p>
               <p>If any cravings of our own flesh then cannot be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied without disobedience, we must not seek to <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> but <hi>subdue</hi>; nor endeavour to <hi>fulfill,</hi> but to <hi>deny</hi> them. And if any wants or losses are brought so close to us, that we cannot avoid them without <hi>breach of duty</hi>; they are the burden of the <hi>Cross</hi> imposed upon
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:66440:197"/>
us, and, unless we would cast off all relation to Christ, we must not shun them. For <hi>whosoever doth not bear his Cross,</hi> sayes our Saviour, when Gods Providence layes it upon his shoulders, <hi>and come after me</hi> even then when he must suffer under it; <hi>he cannot be my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> Luk. 14.27.</p>
               <p>This God peremptorily and indispensably exacts of us; and there is all the reason in the world why he should. For he will infinitely recompence in the <hi>next</hi> world, either the <hi>want,</hi> or loss of all those things which for his sake, we are content to be without in <hi>this. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> and <hi>eternal life</hi> will be an abundant, and incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably surpassing compensation; all <hi>the</hi> wants and <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of this present time being,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> sayes, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>unworthy to be compared with that Glory, which shall</hi> then <hi>be revealed in us,</hi> Rom. 8.18.</p>
               <p>Let no man therefore disobey Gods Laws for the love of the world, for the supplying of his wants, and the satisfaction of his appetites; and yet for all that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade himself that God will own him, and connive at his disobedience. For in doing so, he plainly <hi>renounces God,</hi> and sets the <hi>World above</hi> him; he makes his <hi>Duty</hi> truckle to his <hi>Interest</hi>; he slights <hi>obedience,</hi> and submits to a <hi>temptation.</hi> He does the <hi>work</hi> of <hi>sin</hi> for the <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi> which <hi>tempts</hi> to it; and that will certainly bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him that <hi>death,</hi> which God has established for the wages of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A third pretence whereby men justifie to their own souls the indulged transgression of <hi>several</hi> Laws whilst they obey in <hi>others</hi>; is, because those trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions wherein they allow themselves, are only such as are sins of <hi>temper</hi> and <hi>complexion, age,</hi> or <hi>way of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes mens <hi>place</hi> and <hi>way of life</hi> is a continual <hi>temptation</hi> to some <hi>particular</hi> sin; and if they may but have leave to indulge <hi>that,</hi> they will abandon every
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:66440:198"/>
                  <hi>other.</hi> The <hi>Courtier</hi> takes himself obliged by the fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his place to <hi>lies</hi> and <hi>dissimulation, ostentation</hi> and <hi>vanity,</hi> to <hi>sinfull compliances,</hi> and <hi>faithless engagements,</hi> to <hi>promise all,</hi> but to <hi>perform nothing.</hi> The <hi>Merchant</hi> in pursute of his <hi>gain,</hi> serves the end of his <hi>trade</hi> by <hi>fraud</hi> and <hi>dishonesty.</hi> He accounts it a piece of his <hi>Art</hi> to <hi>over-reach,</hi> to <hi>defraud customes,</hi> to <hi>vend false wares,</hi> and <hi>set exacting prices.</hi> The <hi>Lawyer</hi> thinks it a part of his <hi>profession</hi> to encourage <hi>strife,</hi> and foment <hi>difference</hi>; the <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>revenge,</hi> the <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>bitterness,</hi> the <hi>slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and <hi>evil-speakings,</hi> the <hi>strife</hi> and <hi>contentions</hi> which are <hi>other</hi> mens <hi>sins,</hi> are <hi>his livelihood.</hi> These sins, being ever before them, are alwayes a snare to them; for they are continually importuned by them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it must be a toilsome pains, and an uninterrupted watchfulness which can preserve them from being either won, or wearied into the commission of them. And since obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in these instances is a thing which they can so very hardly spare; they hope that God in mercy will not exact it; but will graciously accept them upon their service in other particulars, although here they continue to disobey him.</p>
               <p>Other sins men are invited and importunately tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to by their <hi>age</hi> and <hi>condition,</hi> their <hi>particular temper,</hi> and <hi>complexion. Lust</hi> and <hi>rashness</hi> are the vices of <hi>youth,</hi> as <hi>craft</hi> and <hi>covetousness</hi> are of the <hi>gray</hi> hairs. Some sins are rooted in mens very <hi>natures</hi>; for some are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclined to be <hi>passionate</hi> and <hi>hasty,</hi> some to be <hi>pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish,</hi> and others to be <hi>malicious</hi> and <hi>revengefull.</hi> The <hi>temper</hi> of their <hi>bodies</hi> hurries on some to <hi>lust</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance,</hi> some to <hi>turbulency</hi> and <hi>fierceness,</hi> and others to <hi>slavish fears,</hi> and <hi>sinfull compliances.</hi> Nay, a <hi>sharp</hi> and <hi>long affliction</hi> will sometimes <hi>embitter</hi> even a <hi>good nature,</hi> and make it <hi>habitually sowr</hi> and <hi>fretfull, peevish</hi> and <hi>morose.</hi> So that mens very <hi>natural temper,</hi> their <hi>age,</hi>
                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:66440:198"/>
and <hi>condition</hi> prove many times an uninterrupted solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation to <hi>some</hi> sin or <hi>other,</hi> and they alwayes fall, by being alwayes under the power of their temptation.</p>
               <p>Now when men find that some sins have got thus near to them, and have taken such deep root in their <hi>way of life,</hi> nay, in their <hi>very natures</hi>; since they will not be at the pains to reform and amend, they expect that God should be so gracious as to dispense with them. As for all the instances of this kind, he must a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate them, seeing they will not perform them; his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning goodness must supply all the defects of their sloth. For God and they must still be agreed, and therefore because they cannot well abandon some of their darling lusts, and bosom sins for his sake; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance must fall on his side, and he must desert and cancel all those severe and grating Laws to serve and pleasure them. They will obey him most willingly in all <hi>other</hi> things; only in these they beg that he would excuse them: they will do any thing else for his sake, which doth not contradict their beloved sin, and never displease him, but when they cannot otherwise fulfill and pleasure it.</p>
               <p>Thus, for instance, the <hi>Covetous</hi> man will obey in keeping back from <hi>drunkenness</hi> and <hi>whoredom,</hi> from <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,</hi> and <hi>profuseness,</hi> and all other sins which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive: But as for those other duties of <hi>suffering loss our selves</hi> rather than <hi>defrauding</hi> and <hi>over-reaching o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> of a <hi>contented mind,</hi> and <hi>contempt of the world,</hi> of <hi>alms</hi> and <hi>beneficence,</hi> and all the <hi>chargeable</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of an <hi>active love,</hi> and an <hi>operative charity:</hi> here he stands upon his points, and chooses to <hi>dispute</hi> rather than to <hi>perform</hi>; to <hi>article</hi> rather than to <hi>obey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>peevish</hi> and <hi>angry</hi> man will readily keep the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Temperance</hi>; he will neither <hi>spoil</hi> his neighbours <hi>Goods,</hi> nor <hi>wrong</hi> his <hi>Bed,</hi> nor <hi>pamper</hi>
                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:66440:199"/>
and <hi>defile</hi> his own body; he will do any thing, which either <hi>ministers</hi> to his <hi>reigning</hi> lust, or which doth not <hi>contradict</hi> and make against it. But then as for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of <hi>meekness</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> of <hi>long-suffering</hi> and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness,</hi> of <hi>speaking well,</hi> and <hi>doing good to enemies,</hi> of <hi>passing over provocations</hi> and <hi>peaceableness,</hi> and all other instances of <hi>pardoning,</hi> and <hi>forgetting injuries</hi>; in these God must excuse him, for his dear lust opposes them, and he <hi>can</hi> not, he <hi>will</hi> not serve him in the practice of them.</p>
               <p>Some who are of a <hi>tractable</hi> and <hi>submissive,</hi> of a <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>governable</hi> temper, will observe readily all <hi>those</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which their <hi>constitution</hi> has made easie, and which their natural genius enclines them to. They will be constant performers of all the <hi>cheap,</hi> because <hi>agreeable</hi> duties of <hi>submission</hi> to <hi>Governours,</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> to <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Constitutions,</hi> of <hi>uniformity</hi> in <hi>worship,</hi> of <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>observance</hi> of the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>establishments,</hi> and of all things belonging to the <hi>Churches Vnity</hi> and <hi>outward peace.</hi> But as for the <hi>severities</hi> of an <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>hearty</hi> Religion, in <hi>mortification</hi> and <hi>self-denial,</hi> in <hi>paring</hi> off all <hi>sinfull lusts,</hi> and <hi>exorbitant desires,</hi> in <hi>patience,</hi> and <hi>taking up the Cross,</hi> and in all other <hi>hard</hi> instances of <hi>duty</hi> and a <hi>holy life:</hi> here they withdraw their service, because they must contradict their <hi>natures,</hi> and go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their <hi>ease</hi>; and set themselves, not to <hi>obey</hi> these Laws, but to <hi>evacuate</hi> or <hi>evade</hi> them.</p>
               <p>Whereas <hi>others,</hi> who are of a <hi>temper</hi> more <hi>severe,</hi> but withall of a <hi>querulous</hi> and <hi>restless,</hi> a <hi>busie,</hi> and <hi>ungovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able spirit,</hi> will keep off from <hi>atheism</hi> and <hi>prophaneness,</hi> from <hi>idolatry</hi> and <hi>witchcraft,</hi> and <hi>other heinous impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>; from <hi>drunkenness</hi> and <hi>revellings,</hi> from <hi>fornication</hi> and <hi>adultery,</hi> from <hi>oppression,</hi> and <hi>fraud,</hi> and other alike <hi>gross</hi> and <hi>notorious</hi> instances of <hi>injustice</hi> and <hi>immorality.</hi> For all these their strict temper can easily avoid; they
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:66440:199"/>
have no great temptation to them, and are therefore able without much pains to abstain from them. But then as for those <hi>other</hi> sins, which agree with the <hi>bent</hi> and inclination of their <hi>busie</hi> and <hi>ungovernable</hi> humour; they will still indulge themselves in the practice of them, for all they are of an <hi>equal guilt,</hi> although indeed of a more <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>refined nature.</hi> For they will strive to <hi>weary laws,</hi> to <hi>vilifie</hi> and <hi>contemn,</hi> to <hi>undervalue</hi> and <hi>disparage Governours</hi>; they will permit themselves to be overswayed by <hi>spite</hi> and <hi>malice,</hi> by <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness,</hi> by <hi>envy</hi> and <hi>emulation,</hi> by <hi>strife</hi> and <hi>sidings</hi>; to be drawn aside into <hi>censoriousness,</hi> and <hi>evil-speakings,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>raising</hi> and <hi>spreading</hi> of <hi>uncharitable,</hi> and <hi>envious,</hi> yea, <hi>false,</hi> and <hi>slanderous reports:</hi> they will be <hi>forward</hi> to <hi>magnifie</hi> themselves, to <hi>publish</hi> their <hi>own praise,</hi> and to <hi>boast</hi> of their <hi>own actions</hi> and <hi>attainments</hi>; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to <hi>detract</hi> and <hi>lessen,</hi> to <hi>shame</hi> and <hi>disparage others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus will even these men, who make the fairest ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of abominating all <hi>impious</hi> and <hi>ungodly,</hi> all <hi>immoral</hi> and <hi>debauched</hi> actions, <hi>halt</hi> still in their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and think to please God, not by a <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,</hi> but a <hi>partial</hi> and a <hi>maimed service.</hi> For their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version</hi> goes but <hi>half</hi> way, not from <hi>sin</hi> to <hi>righteousness,</hi> but from <hi>some sorts</hi> of sin to <hi>some others.</hi> All the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that their Religion has wrought in them, is not a <hi>forsaking</hi> of sin, but an <hi>exchange</hi> of it; a turn from what is more <hi>easily</hi> left, to a more <hi>liberal</hi> practice of that which they find it <hi>hard</hi> to part with; a <hi>remove</hi> from <hi>grosser,</hi> and more <hi>scandalously fleshly</hi> sins, to other more <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>refined,</hi> but still as <hi>deadly</hi> and <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable transgressions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus by all these instances it appears, that when men have got some sins that are <hi>close</hi> and <hi>pleasing,</hi> such as their <hi>temper</hi> and <hi>complexion,</hi> their <hi>age,</hi> or <hi>condition,</hi> or <hi>way of life,</hi> has <hi>endear'd</hi> to them so <hi>far,</hi> as that even
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:66440:200"/>
for <hi>Gods</hi> sake they will not <hi>part</hi> with them; their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is presently to some more <hi>cheap</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> instances of <hi>obedience,</hi> that they may <hi>attone</hi> for them. And the same might be shewn in all other instances of a <hi>partial</hi> and a <hi>maimed service.</hi> In all things they will obey God no further than their beloved sins will suffer them, but as <hi>they</hi> yield to the <hi>Law</hi> in <hi>other</hi> things, so must the <hi>Law</hi> yield to <hi>them</hi> in these; for neither God nor their <hi>Sin</hi> shall rule alone, but the service shall be shared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and both shall enjoy a <hi>divided</hi> empire.</p>
               <p>But this is a most <hi>damnably delusive,</hi> and a <hi>desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly false pretence.</hi> For whatsoever fond conceits men who <hi>Love,</hi> and are resolved not to <hi>let go</hi> their sins, may please themselves withall: yet God, when he comes to judge us, will accept of nothing less than an <hi>entire</hi> obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. All his Laws are established under the pains of death, and he will exact all that he has required, whatever, at that day, be our concern in it. For he comes not then, as a <hi>corrupted party,</hi> to judge <hi>for us,</hi> to make his own Laws bend and bow to serve our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, and to cancel and disanull all such among them as make against us. No, he comes, as an <hi>upright</hi> and <hi>even Judge,</hi> to execute all his Laws, but not to destroy any; he comes to inflict what his Gospel threatens, and his sentence will then be what <hi>it</hi> sayes, not what <hi>we</hi> can bear. So that if we have <hi>wilfully disobeyed,</hi> and have not <hi>repented,</hi> whether in <hi>one</hi> instance or in <hi>many</hi>; we must undergo the <hi>punishment</hi> of our disobedience. For God is a <hi>friend</hi> to <hi>no</hi> Vice, neither one nor other, but he alwayes <hi>forbids,</hi> and he will most severely <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish every</hi> one. And as for all these <hi>pretences,</hi> whether that of our <hi>age,</hi> or our <hi>way of life</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or of our very <hi>natural temper</hi> and <hi>inclination</hi> it self; there will be no <hi>shelter</hi> or <hi>excuse</hi> in any of them to bear us out in <hi>any.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:66440:200"/>There is no protection to any sin from our <hi>Age</hi>; for no <hi>young</hi> man may pursue <hi>lusts</hi> because they are <hi>youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> but is bound to <hi>fly</hi> and avoid them, as those things <hi>which war against,</hi> and would destroy <hi>his soul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.22.

               </p>
               <p>Nay so far is any thing in the world from sheltring us under the service of any <hi>one</hi> sin, that <hi>even</hi> that, which may have the highest pretence to it of all things <hi>else</hi> whatsoever, <hi>viz.</hi> our very <hi>natural temper</hi> and <hi>inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> is no <hi>excuse</hi> to us if it makes us continue in any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. If any thing in the world could be a just defence for the practice of any sin, surely this must. For our Nature is not of our own chusing; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its effects ought least of all to be charged on us, seeing they least of all proceed from us, but are in great degrees determined to our hands before we have any power either to <hi>will,</hi> or to <hi>refuse</hi> them. But such is the <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>strictness</hi> of <hi>Christ's Gospel,</hi> that it indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensably requires us to conquer sin, not only where it makes no <hi>opposition,</hi> but even where it has the <hi>greatest strength,</hi> and the <hi>highest force</hi> of all. For if our very <hi>Nature</hi> draw us on to <hi>disobey,</hi> it <hi>enjoins</hi> us under all our <hi>hopes of Heaven</hi> not to <hi>submit</hi> to it, but to <note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 18.22, 23.</note>

               <p>Thus vain and helpless are all <hi>these</hi> excuses and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions, under which men endeavour to shelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the indulged transgression of some Laws, whilst they obey in others. For whether their pretence be the <hi>saving of their Religion from times of persecution,</hi> or the <hi>serving of their necessities in times of want,</hi> or the <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of their own natural temper and inclination</hi>; we see that none of them can justifie their indulged allowance of any <hi>one</hi> sin, nor serve any other turn than to delude them to their own destruction.</p>
               <p>But whosoever would obey to his own salvation, must obey in <hi>every</hi> instance, and continue wilfully to transgress in <hi>none.</hi> He must never hope to please God by performing nothing but what he lists himself. No, every <hi>particular</hi> Law of God, as we saw above, is bound upon us by all our <hi>hopes of Heaven,</hi> and under the <hi>pains of Hell</hi>; so that we cannot transgress in any, and yet be safe: but that obedience which can secure us, is nothing less than performing in every instance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="367" facs="tcp:66440:201"/>For this <hi>third</hi> sort of integrity, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> or performing <hi>all</hi> and <hi>every</hi> of those Laws which God has given us, both <hi>is,</hi> and <hi>always was,</hi> indispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly required to <hi>life</hi> and <hi>pardon</hi> since the world began.</p>

                  <hi>Thee have I seen righteous before me,</hi> said God to <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> because <hi>Noah did according to ALL that the Lord commanded him,</hi> Gen. 7.1, 5.

                  <hi>all my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments always, that it might be well with them for ever,</hi> ver. 29. It is nothing less than our obeying in <hi>all,</hi> which God declares that he will accept; and upon nothing less than their <hi>performing all,</hi> that good men have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to be accepted. <hi>Then shall I not be ashamed,</hi> saith the Psalmist, <hi>when I have respect unto</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Psal. 119.2, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>all thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> Psal. 119.6, 7. Those persons to whom the <hi>Lord doth good</hi> and shews kindness, are only <hi>the upright in heart.</hi> But as for them, who although they are right as to the main, do yet <hi>turn aside</hi> in some things <hi>to their crooked ways, he will lead them forth with the workers of iniquity,</hi> Psal. 125.4, 5.</p>
               <p>And as this integrity in <hi>doing the whole will of God,</hi> was required of <hi>Noah</hi> before the <hi>Law,</hi> and of the <hi>Jews under</hi> it; so is it likewise exacted every whit as strictly of us <hi>Christians</hi> under the <hi>Gospel.</hi> For the obedience of that <hi>Covenant,</hi> whereinto <hi>Christ</hi> commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions his <hi>Apostles</hi> to <hi>baptize Converts,</hi> is nothing below an <hi>intire</hi> obedience. <hi>Go,</hi> says he, <hi>and baptize all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you</hi> Matth. 28.19, 20. And this is no more than what he himself had preached before, in his own Sermon upon the Mount. For of the <hi>Moral Law</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> (which he came to <hi>confirm</hi> and <hi>esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish</hi>) and also of his <hi>own Law,</hi> (which he came then to <hi>publish</hi> and <hi>proclaim</hi>) he affirms plainly, That the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:66440:202"/>
observance of it in <hi>every particular</hi> is necessary to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of <hi>God's favour</hi> and <hi>eternal life. He that breaks the</hi> very <hi>least of these Commandments, shall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led least</hi> (or shall <hi>be</hi> least, or none at all, which is the sense of the Hebrew Phrase) <hi>in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> Matth. 5.17, 18, 19. And agreeably to this <hi>Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,</hi> and this <hi>Commission,</hi> the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves, when they came afterwards to discharge their Office, did most strictly require it, and most severely threaten all those in whom it was wanting. <hi>Let us cleanse our selves,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, from all filthiness of Flesh and Spirit, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holiness in the fear of the Lord,</hi> as we hope to attain those good things which he has <hi>promised,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. There is no remedy, but we must either do this or dye. <hi>For the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against,</hi> not only some, but <hi>all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men,</hi> Rom. 1.18. The Curse takes place upon the transgression in any instance. For the threatning is not barely to some <hi>one,</hi> or to some <hi>few</hi> Laws; but to the <hi>whole Code</hi> which comprehends them all: so that if we transgress any <hi>one,</hi> the Covenant is broken, and the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty takes place. For <hi>whosoever shall keep the whole Law</hi> besides, saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>James, and yet offend in one Point,</hi> that subjects him to all the evil, and <hi>he is guilty of,</hi> or obnoxious to that punishment which is appointed for the wages of <hi>all,</hi> James 2.10.</p>
               <p>As for this <hi>integrity of the object</hi> therefore, or mens obedience to the <hi>whole will</hi> of God; we see that in all <hi>times</hi> and <hi>ages</hi> it was <hi>necessary</hi> unto <hi>life,</hi> and indispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly required to <hi>salvation.</hi> For neither the Sons of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> nor the Subjects of <hi>Moses,</hi> nor the Servants of <hi>Christ</hi>; no Professors of any <hi>true Religion</hi> in the World were ever accepted upon any service less than <hi>intire,</hi> upon any obedience that was <hi>maimed</hi> and <hi>defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive.</hi> But so much as he thought fit to enjoin, God always
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:66440:202"/>
exacted of men that they should perform; so that if they did not obey in <hi>all,</hi> they should certainly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as if they had done <hi>nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that as for this <hi>third</hi> sort of <hi>integrity,</hi> viz. our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the <hi>whole will</hi> of God, or to all the <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> Laws forementioned, which is the <hi>integrity of the Object; it,</hi> as well as both the <hi>former,</hi> is plainly <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to our acceptance, and to render our <hi>obedience avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> to our <hi>salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus at <hi>last</hi> it appears what that <hi>integrity</hi> is, which will render our obedience to all the <hi>particular</hi> Laws of God above recounted acceptable in God's sight. For it is nothing less than an obedience of the <hi>whole man,</hi> to the <hi>whole Law,</hi> and that not for some <hi>short,</hi> but for our <hi>whole</hi> time, and to the <hi>end</hi> of our lives. He who thus <hi>intirely</hi> obeys, cannot, as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore observed, be other than <hi>sincere</hi>; and he who obeys <hi>sincerely</hi> and <hi>uprightly</hi> has all that God requires of him, enough to support his hopes, and to secure his happiness. <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>uprightness</hi> is neither more nor less than is exacted of us; without them we shall surely dye, but through them we cannot miss of being happy eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>

                  <p>Of obeying God with all the heart, and with all the strength, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It includes not all desire and endeavour after other things, but it implies, <hi>First,</hi> Sincerity. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> Fervency. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Integrity, or obeying, not some but, all the Laws of God. These three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all that is contained in it; which is shown from their obedience, who are said in Scripture to have fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it. Integrity implies sincerity and fervency, and Love with all the heart is explained in the places where it is mentioned, by loving him entirely. Sincerity and uprightness the Conditions of an acceptable Obedience. This a hard Condition in the degeneracy of our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; but that is our own fault. It was easie and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally performed by the primitive Christians. This shown from the Characters of the Apostles, and of the Primitive Writers. Hence it was that they could despise Death, and even provoke Martyrdom. Some Pleas from our impotence against the strictness of this obedience, which are considered in the next Book.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOW as for this <hi>intire</hi> obedience of the <hi>whole man,</hi> at <hi>all times,</hi> to the <hi>whole will</hi> of God, whereof I have hitherto discoursed in the foregoing <hi>Chapters</hi>; it is that <hi>very</hi> obedience <hi>with all the heart, and with all the soul, and with all the mind, and with all the strength,</hi> which is so expresly called for in the words
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:66440:203"/>
of the Commandment, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.27. <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.13.</p>
               <p>It is not to be expected that <hi>all our heart,</hi> and <hi>all our mind,</hi> and <hi>all our soul,</hi> and <hi>all our strength</hi> should be so <hi>wholly</hi> devoted to God, as that we should never either <hi>will,</hi> or <hi>think,</hi> or <hi>desire,</hi> or <hi>do</hi> any <hi>other</hi> thing than what he has <hi>commanded</hi> us. No, that is a Dream of utter <hi>absurdities</hi> and <hi>impossibilities.</hi> For God has not only <hi>allowed</hi> us, but he has made it plainly <hi>necessary</hi> for us to employ our <hi>thoughts,</hi> and <hi>desires,</hi> and <hi>endeavours,</hi> upon several other things besides <hi>himself</hi> and his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi> Because we cannot live without <hi>meat</hi> and other <hi>necessaries,</hi> and these we cannot <hi>get</hi> without <hi>seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> nor <hi>seek</hi> without <hi>desiring,</hi> nor <hi>desire</hi> without <hi>think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> on them. All the <hi>innocent enjoyments of Nature,</hi> and all the <hi>necessaries of life,</hi> all the <hi>laudable advantages of converse,</hi> and all the <hi>lawful benefits of trade</hi> and <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,</hi> require our <hi>minds,</hi> and <hi>hearts,</hi> and <hi>souls,</hi> and <hi>strength,</hi> as well as <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>Duty</hi>; all our Powers not only <hi>may</hi> be exercised about them, but they needs <hi>must.</hi> For God himself has so ordained it, it being a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of his own making; so that we must employ our endeavours about them, and we cannot do otherwise. And therefore when the Commandment calls for <hi>all our hearts</hi> and <hi>all our strength,</hi> &amp;c. it is utterly <hi>absurd</hi> and <hi>unreasonable</hi> to understand it of such an <hi>all,</hi> as excludes the exercise of these faculties upon any thing besides. It doth not ingross all our power to God's use <hi>alone,</hi> and shut out all other things from any place in them; but <hi>may</hi> and <hi>must</hi> be understood so as to leave room for them likewise.</p>
               <p>But all that is included in the <hi>latitude</hi> of that expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>with all thy heart,</hi> &amp;c. is set out, agreeably to the use of the Phrase at other times, in these <hi>three</hi> Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It notes the <hi>sincerity</hi> and <hi>undissembledness</hi> of our
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:66440:204"/>
faculties; so as the Phrase, <hi>with all the heart,</hi> signifies the same as in <hi>simplicity</hi> and <hi>honesty,</hi> without <hi>guile</hi> or a <hi>double heart.</hi> For a dissembling hypocritical man has <hi>one</hi> heart in <hi>shew,</hi> and <hi>another</hi> in <hi>reality.</hi> His heart is not <hi>one intire</hi> thing, but <hi>double</hi> and <hi>divided.</hi> He appears to <hi>will</hi> what indeed he doth <hi>not will,</hi> and to <hi>desire</hi> what in truth he doth <hi>not desire</hi>; so that his whole heart doth not go together, that which he <hi>outwardly</hi> professes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>one,</hi> but that which he <hi>inwardly</hi> intends <hi>another.</hi> And this <hi>simplicity</hi> and <hi>sincere</hi> honesty of intention, is expressed in the course of our common speech by this Phrase, <hi>all the heart</hi>; nothing being more usual in our daily converse than to give assurances of our sincerity in any thing which we do, by saying it is with <hi>all our heart.</hi> And as <hi>sincerity</hi> is expressed by <hi>all the heart,</hi> so is <hi>dissimulation</hi> and <hi>hypocrisie</hi> on the contrary set out by a <hi>double heart.</hi> And thus the <hi>men of war</hi> who were <hi>faithful to David,</hi> and <hi>undissembled</hi> in their service of him, are said <hi>not to have been of a double heart,</hi> Psal. 12.2. Which sence the word <hi>double</hi> has, not only when it is applyed to this <hi>particular</hi> faculty, <hi>viz.</hi> our <hi>wills</hi> and <hi>hearts,</hi> but also when it is attributed to any <hi>other.</hi> And thus we read of a <hi>double,</hi> that is, of a <hi>dissembling tongue,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This Phrase, <hi>all the heart,</hi> &amp;c. implies the <hi>fervency</hi> and <hi>concernedness of our faculties.</hi> And thus the Latines use the word <hi>whole,</hi> when they express their being <hi>very busie,</hi> or <hi>industriously intent</hi> upon a thing, by saying they are <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Totus in hoc sum.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>whole upon it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as this Phrase, <hi>all the heart,</hi> &amp;c. in respect of our <hi>faculties</hi> themselves, denotes these <hi>two</hi> things, <hi>viz. since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and <hi>fervency</hi>; so likewise in respect of their <hi>object,</hi> or that <hi>will of God</hi> which they are to be employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, doth it imply</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Integrity,</hi> so as that this <hi>fervency</hi> and <hi>sincerity</hi> be
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:66440:204"/>
shown in obeying, not <hi>some,</hi> but <hi>all</hi> the Commandments; not <hi>part,</hi> but the <hi>whole will</hi> of God. For our <hi>heart,</hi> and <hi>soul,</hi> and <hi>strength</hi> must be <hi>all</hi> or <hi>whole</hi> for God; that is, they must be <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>uniform,</hi> not <hi>various</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,</hi> being sometimes <hi>for</hi> him, and at other times <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> him. They must be for <hi>all</hi> things which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and for <hi>nothing</hi> that he forbids; for we must neither <hi>think,</hi> nor <hi>desire,</hi> nor <hi>do</hi> any thing against him. And in this sense the word <hi>all</hi> or <hi>whole</hi> is opposed to <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided</hi>; and expresses thus much, that our faculties do not stand <hi>for</hi> some commands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>against</hi> others; that they do not <hi>divide</hi> and <hi>parcel, pick</hi> and <hi>choose</hi> with <hi>Gods Laws</hi>; but that they obey <hi>wholly</hi> and <hi>universally,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving <hi>all</hi> and every <hi>one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now these <hi>three,</hi> (viz.) the <hi>sincerity</hi> and <hi>fervency</hi> of our <hi>faculties,</hi> and the <hi>integrity</hi> of our <hi>obedience,</hi> which are conveniently expressed by the word <hi>all</hi> or <hi>whole,</hi> are all indispensably required of us; as appears plainly from what has been above discoursed upon this subject. So that they are <hi>all</hi> implied in the latitude of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment: <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy mind,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But besides them nothing else is. For if we should extend that precept further, and make it include all that the largest compass of those words would compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend; we should give it a sence which is, as I said, <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd,</hi> and utterly <hi>impossible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to clear this a little more, wherewith so many good souls are oft-times perplexed, we may further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that those very men who <hi>will'd,</hi> and <hi>thought,</hi> and <hi>desired,</hi> and <hi>acted other</hi> things, as well as Gods <hi>Laws</hi>; are yet in the Scriptures expresly recorded to have <hi>performed</hi> all that is meant in this Commandment, because they served God in the <hi>particulars</hi> which I have mention'd, <hi>(viz.) sincerely, fervently</hi> and <hi>entirely.</hi> For

                  <note n="b" place="margin">Numb. 14.24. Deut. 1.36.</note> 
                  <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joshua</hi> are said to have <hi>followed the Lord wholly,</hi> Numb. 32.12. <hi>David kept my Commandments,</hi> saith God, <hi>and followed me with all his heart,</hi> 1 King. 14.8. <hi>Josiah did what was right in the sight of the Lord,</hi> 2 Kings 22.2. Now these persons were men, not only of as great <hi>necessities</hi> as others, but also of <hi>far higher place,</hi> and <hi>greater business</hi> in the world. For their sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion required them to be much employed about it, and to spend <hi>frequent thoughts,</hi> and <hi>many desires,</hi> and <hi>great pains</hi> upon it.

The <hi>sincerity, fervency</hi> and <hi>integrity</hi> of their service was all which they had to shew in answer to this Commandment; and upon the account of them God did accept them, and has left it on record to all the world that they have <hi>fulfilled</hi> it.</p>
               <p>As for the last of these, <hi>(viz.) Integrity,</hi> it indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in it all the <hi>rest.</hi> For it is the greatest warranty and effect of <hi>fervency,</hi> and the best evidence of the <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity</hi> of our service. Because this, as I said before, is the great <hi>measure</hi> of <hi>acceptance</hi> in our <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> (viz.) <hi>that they carry us on to acceptable works and actions.</hi> And this is the great Rule whereby to judge of a <hi>sincere service,</hi> (viz.) <hi>that men be universal and entire in their obedience.</hi> So that if once we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form <hi>all</hi> that God requires of us; there is no further question to be made but that we perform it <hi>honestly,</hi> and with that <hi>fervency</hi> and concernedness which is <hi>sufficient</hi> to our <hi>acceptance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this <hi>integrity</hi> of obedience including <hi>both</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is that very thing which is meant by the service with <hi>all the heart,</hi> and with <hi>all the soul,</hi> which is exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:66440:205"/>
of us in the Commandment. Whereof we have still a further argument, because in almost all the places where any man is said to fulfill <hi>this,</hi> we find <hi>that</hi> annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as its explication: Which is a plain interpretation of the Scripture to it self, that <hi>to obey with all our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> in its sence is nothing else, but to be <hi>uniform, undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,</hi> and <hi>entire</hi> in our obedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David,</hi> sayes God, <hi>followed me with all his heart</hi>; which appears in this, because he followed me so as to fulfill all my will, and to act nothing against it, but <hi>to do that only which is right in mine eyes,</hi> 1 Kings 14.8. <hi>Caleb and Joshua followed the Lord wholly</hi>; which was seen in that their obedience was entire to him, and they did not transgress in those particular Laws of Duty, by the breach whereof others provoked him, <hi>Numb.</hi> 32.10, 11, 12. And of <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Luke</hi> sayes that they were <hi>blameless,</hi> because <hi>they walked,</hi> not in some, but <hi>in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord,</hi> Luk. 1.6. But on the other side, as for all such as were <hi>partial</hi> in their obedience to God, and kept some instances of duty, but transgressed others ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they themselves listed; they are said <hi>not to be whole</hi> in their <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>other faculties</hi> towards him. <hi>Jehu,</hi> sayes the text, <hi>took no heed to walk in the Law of the God of Israel with all his heart,</hi> for of this there is a clear proof, in that his heart run after some sins as well as some duties, because <hi>he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam,</hi> although he did from others, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.31. <hi>If you return unto the Lord with all your heart,</hi> sayes <hi>Samuel, then put away</hi> that particular sin which you still adhere to, <hi>your strange Gods, and serve him only,</hi> 1 Sam. 7.3. And that this is true in every mans case, as well as it was in theirs, the Psalmist plainly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures us, when he layes it down for an universal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime, that <hi>they seek the Lord with their whole heart, who do no iniquity,</hi> Psal. 119.2, 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:66440:206"/>And thus upon all these accounts it appears, that <hi>to serve the Lord with all our heart, and with all our soul, and with all our mind, and with all our strength,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>tenour of the Commandment</hi>; is neither <hi>more</hi> nor <hi>less</hi> than to serve him <hi>universally</hi> and <hi>entirely.</hi> For it <hi>can</hi> bear no other sense, because upon <hi>no greater</hi> or <hi>better service than this, God himself has declared that men have served him with all their heart</hi> according to the Commandment; and more cannot be <hi>required</hi> when this <hi>fulfills</hi> it. It can mean no <hi>more,</hi> because that <hi>all which it should mean further is impossible in the present conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of humane nature,</hi> and therefore is no fit matter of a Law, nor subject to a Commandment. And lastly, it <hi>doth</hi> mean no more, because the <hi>Scriptures themselves, where they set it down, are wont to annex this interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and thus explain it.</p>
               <p>And thus at last we have seen what <hi>degrees</hi> and <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of obedience</hi> to all the Laws recounted in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Book, is necessary to our acceptance. For we must obey <hi>sincerely</hi> and <hi>entirely,</hi> if ever we expect to reap the rewards of obedience. We must keep <hi>every particular Law</hi> of God, and that through our <hi>whole lives:</hi> we must <hi>think</hi> on them in our <hi>minds,</hi> and <hi>pursue</hi> them with our <hi>affections,</hi> and <hi>choose</hi> them with our <hi>wills</hi> so <hi>far,</hi> till we <hi>perform</hi> them with our <hi>strength,</hi> in <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily operation.</hi> This <hi>uprightness</hi> of obedience, which is a certain evidence of its <hi>sincerity,</hi> is all that Gods Law requires of us; and it will infallibly save us at the last day, although less than it nothing in the world will.</p>
               <p>As for that condition of life and pardon then which the Gospel indispensably exacts of us, we now see plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what it is. For it is <hi>nothing else but our obedience to all the forementioned Laws of God</hi> in <hi>sincerity</hi> and <hi>upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> It is by this that all the world must stand or fall at the last day; according to their performance or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:66440:206"/>
whereof they shall then be judged either to live or die eternally.</p>
               <p>This indeed, though it be a very <hi>great,</hi> will seem a very <hi>uncouth</hi> and <hi>severe</hi> truth in the degeneracy of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and loose lives of our times. But if it do, that is wholly our own fault, and can be no prejudice at all to the declarations of Christs Gospel. For our Lord has proclaimed it to us plainly enough, and if our own wicked hearts make us shut our eyes, and willing to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlook it; for that we must blame our selves, but can never hope thereby to evacuate his sentence. This in very deed is the Gospel that he has published, and these are the terms of mercy which he has procured for us: So that if we live up to them, we shall be saved by him; but if we fail to perform these gracious demands, we have no benefit at all by his death, nor any ground of hope from his Gospel. All that can be said is, that he offered us Grace and Pardon upon most fair and easie terms, but that we would not accept them. But we preferred the pleasure of our sins before all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his rewards, and chose to hazard all those evils which he threatned, rather than to be at the pains to perform that condition which he peremptorily injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>But although by our wicked lives we in these dayes cast off the <hi>light</hi> yoke of Christ as <hi>over-burdensome,</hi> and make the Covenant of <hi>Grace</hi> it self to become a <hi>rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> condition: yet once the case was otherwise, and the world was more <hi>Christian.</hi> For they who professed Christs Religion then, performed all that he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and practised all that, which, as we have seen, his Gospel doth injoyn. And to go no further for an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this, we will take those accounts of the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Christians in the first times, which the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> themselves give us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="378" facs="tcp:66440:207"/>
                  <hi>You,</hi> sayes the Apostle to the <hi>Colossians, that were sometimes,</hi> in your Gentile State, <hi>alienated</hi> from God, <hi>and enemies in your minds by</hi> means of your <hi>wicked works; yet now,</hi> since you become Christians, <hi>hath he reconciled in his death, to present you holy, and unblameable, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reproveable,</hi> according to the terms of the Gospel, <hi>in his sight,</hi> Col. 1.21, 22. And to the same purpose he speaks of the <hi>Ephesians</hi> yet more fully. <hi>You,</hi> saith he, <hi>hath God quickned</hi> by the preaching of the Gospel, <hi>who,</hi> before you heard of that, <hi>were dead in trespasses and sins, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, in times past</hi> of Gentilism, <hi>ye walked,</hi> as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>according to the</hi> wicked <hi>course of this world, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to</hi> the instigation of <hi>the Prince of the powers in the air,</hi> who is <hi>the spirit that</hi> both aforetime, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>now worketh in the children of disobedience. Among whom also we all,</hi> as I say, <hi>had our conversation in times past,</hi> living, just as they did, <hi>in the lusts of our flesh, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling</hi> and performing <hi>the desires of our flesh, and were</hi> thereby <hi>the children of wrath as well as others. But God, even when we were thus dead in sins, hath,</hi> upon our em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of Christs Religion, <hi>quickned us together with Christ,</hi> by that same spirit whereby he raised up him, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. But the character which he gives of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> is more particular and compleat still. <hi>No unrighteous,</hi> saith he, of one sort or other <hi>shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the kingdom of heaven.</hi> For <hi>neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor revilers, nor drunkards, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such</hi> indeed as these <hi>were some of you</hi> once, (<hi>viz.</hi> in your Gentilism;) <hi>but</hi> since you were Christned I bear you record, that <hi>you are washed</hi> from those impurities, that <hi>you are sanctified</hi> from those wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesses, and that <hi>you are justified</hi> from the condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing force of all these Commandments <hi>in the name of the
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:66440:207"/>
Lord Jesus, and by</hi> the help of <hi>the</hi> enlivening and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting <hi>spirit of our God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.9, 10, 11. These places are very full and particular for the <hi>power of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi> and the <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>entire obedience</hi> of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in <hi>those dayes.</hi> And yet there is one testimony more of this Apostle, which I must not omit, because it is so very comprehensive; and that is the account which he gives us of the Reformation which the Gospel wrought among the <hi>Romans.</hi> For before it was preached among them, they were <hi>strangely debauched,</hi> and <hi>unaccountably wicked</hi>; as we may be fully informed, were there no other register of their vices, from that prodigious Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of their sins, which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> himself has given us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Vers. 25.26.</note> For <hi>they worshipped and served the Creature more than the Creator.</hi> Their very <hi>women</hi> were so unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural in their lusts, as to <hi>change their natural use, into that which is against nature.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">27.</note> And <hi>the men leaving the natural use of the women, burned in their lusts towards one another, men with men working that which is unseem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. They were filled with all unrighteousness, fornication,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">29.</note> 
                  <hi>wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; being full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, back-biters,</hi>

                  <hi>haters of God, despitefull, proud, boasters, inventers of evil things, disobedient to parents, without understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, covenant-breakers, without natural affection,</hi>

                  <hi>impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, unmercifull.</hi> Thus had they degenerated from all sense of <hi>common honesty</hi> and <hi>honour</hi>; and fallen into the <hi>vilest sink</hi> of <hi>vices.</hi> But when once Christianity took place among them, it quickly turned them from a most <hi>impious</hi> and <hi>monstrously unclean,</hi> into a most <hi>religious</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> people. For so S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> himself bears witness to them. <hi>You were,</hi> sayes he, in your time of Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism, <hi>the servants,</hi> nay, the rankest slaves <hi>of sin, but God be thanked that ye have</hi> now, since you became Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, <hi>obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine, which
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:66440:208"/>
was</hi> by us Apostles <hi>delivered to you.</hi> For <hi>being made free from</hi> that strange inventory of <hi>sins, ye became the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of righteousness,</hi> Rom. 6.17, 18. And what S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> tells us of <hi>these particular</hi> Churches under his care; S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> will also inform us was true of <hi>all</hi> the Churches in <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi> with whom he was concerned, and to whom he directed his <hi>first</hi> Epistle. <hi>The time past of our life may suffice us,</hi> saith he, <hi>to have wrought the will of the Gentiles; when we walked</hi> with them <hi>in lascivious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquettings, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable idolatries.</hi> Yea, indeed this doth suffice us. For since we became Christians we have left off to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them in these vices, for which they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stranged to us, and revile us. For <hi>they think it strange that we run not with them to the same excess of riot</hi> as we used formerly, <hi>speaking evil of us</hi> for abstaining from them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.3, 4.</p>
               <p>Thus honest was the service, and thus entire was the obedience of Christians in the Apostles dayes. And when <hi>they</hi> had finished their course, and were called out of the world, Christs Gospel had still the same effects, and his subjects continued to pay him the same ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. <note n="b" place="margin">

               <p>And now if we fall short of that obedience that God requires, and which was performed by former Ages; whose fault is that, or who must in reason suffer for it? For Christ's Gospel is the very same that it was <hi>sixteen</hi> hundred years ago, the Precepts are still unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and the penalty altogether unaltered. It always was, and always will be the same Rule of Faith, and the same measure of mercy or damnation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we lose what it promises, we may thank our selves for neglecting what it enjoyns. For the same terms of life have stood fixt hitherto, and shall stand through all Ages; the <hi>primitive</hi> Christians kept, and were saved by them, and if we break them, we shall certainly be condemned for them.</p>
               <p>How small soever therefore that be which in these loose times <hi>men perform</hi>; yet an intire obedience is that which <hi>God</hi> indispensably <hi>enjoins.</hi> It is the perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory Demand of his Gospel, and will at the last Day be the inviolable Rule of his Judgment. It saved the <hi>antient Christians,</hi> and less than it nothing in the World will save <hi>us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this, some will be ready to say, instead of a <hi>graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and <hi>merciful,</hi> is a very <hi>rigorous</hi> and <hi>severe</hi> Condition. It binds us to more than is in our power, and threatens us for what we cannot help, and is a task too heavy for
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:66440:209"/>
any <hi>mere man,</hi> and proportioned only to the strength of an <hi>Angel.</hi> For to obey <hi>all God's Laws,</hi> and that <hi>at all times,</hi> who is sufficient? God's Laws themselves are not Rules so general as to admit of no exception. For we are commanded, for instance, to live in <hi>peace</hi>; but yet sometimes we <hi>may,</hi> and <hi>must</hi> be engaged in <hi>striving</hi> and <hi>contention.</hi> And as it is in <hi>this,</hi> so it is in <hi>other</hi> parts of Duty; the Commandment holds not in every Case, but some are excepted. And who now is of an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing so discerning and sagacious, as to see in all things where he is fast and where he is loose, and never to mistake that for his liberty, which is indeed his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? To be infallible in judgment, and to think right in all things, is the property of a God, not of a man; And if through this weakness of understanding, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all mankind are subject, we are <hi>ignorant</hi> at any time and do not see, or <hi>erroneous</hi> and mistake our Duty; how is it possible that we should in <hi>all instances,</hi> and at all times <hi>perform</hi> and <hi>fulfil</hi> it.</p>
               <p>But even where we do know God's Law, yet neither there can we always observe it. For since we have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other thing to do besides our Duty, and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for action call frequently upon the sudden; we are oft-times drawn to act before we have <hi>time</hi> to think, and so although we know what we should do in the <hi>general,</hi> yet in this <hi>particular</hi> Case we have not leisure to <hi>attend</hi> to it. We are surprized into action e're we are aware, and perform before we can consider; and therefore, as the chance happens, many times do ill, because we have not time to look about us, and to see what is well doing.</p>
               <p>But if an opportunity for some sin happen when we are at leisure to consider of it, and to avoid it; yet many times, although for the <hi>present</hi> it doth not, <hi>after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> it shall win upon us. For all temptations do not
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:66440:210"/>
come upon us suddenly, and pass away as suddenly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; but some <hi>stay long</hi> with us, and persist to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude themselves upon us. And although we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider for a while, and watch well, and resist long: yet such is the imperfection of our very faculties, that they cannot be held long at stretch, but they will at last grow <hi>weary.</hi> They will be tired out by continuing so strict a Guard, and begin at last to remit of their care, and to slacken their diligence: and when they unbend, the temptation encreases, and our lusts take advantage; so that albeit we were not surprized at first, yet we shall at last, and be tired and wearied into a transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p>And since all these, with others, are infirmities not only <hi>incident</hi> to, but <hi>inseparable</hi> from our Natures, and such as we cannot throw off till we shake off our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and all converse with the tempting world: how can it be thus exacted of us, who cannot always stand upright, that we should never fall, but obey God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, in <hi>all things,</hi> and at <hi>all times?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to give a clear Answer to these difficulties, which are here with great truth objected; having shown that <hi>Obedience is the Condition which is indispensably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us,</hi> and <hi>what those particular Laws are which we are to obey,</hi> and <hi>what degrees and measures of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is required to them:</hi> I shall now proceed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into that which I promised in the next place, <hi>viz.

                  <p>Some failings consistent with a state of Grace. This shewn in the general; <hi>First,</hi> From the necessity of humane Nature, which cannot live without them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> From sundry examples of pious men, who had right to life whilst they lived in them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THAT measure of life or death which Christ has indispensably fixed for all his Servants, is not a <hi>perfectly intire,</hi> and <hi>absolutely unerring</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. No, it makes <hi>allowances</hi> for the <hi>unconquera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble frailties,</hi> and <hi>unavoidable infirmities</hi> of our Natures. It considers that we are but men, and exacts no more of us than a humane service. That integrity which, as we have seen, it requires of us, is an intire obedience only of our <hi>free</hi> works, and <hi>deliberate, chosen</hi> actions. For then we are <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>intire</hi> in God's account,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:66440:211"/>
when we have done all that was in our power, and have no wilful stain upon us; when we have no other ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish, than what the unwill'd weakness of our Nature, and the very frame and circumstances of our Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have made necessary. And therefore every trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression whatsoever, whether <hi>with</hi> our wills, or <hi>without</hi> and <hi>beside</hi> them, doth not presently blot us out of the Book of life, and put us out of a state of Grace and Salvation. No, some defects there are which do not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow, but consist with it.</p>
               <p>To give a clear account of this, I will shew these <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the <hi>general,</hi> that <hi>some slips</hi> and <hi>transgressions</hi> are <hi>consistent with a state of salvation,</hi> and <hi>dispensed</hi> with by the <hi>Gospel-Covenant</hi>; so that although a man dye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he has amended them, and is reformed from them, yet he shall not at the Day of Judgment be condemned for them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. More <hi>particularly, what,</hi> and of <hi>what nature</hi> those consistent slips and transgressions are.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I say in the <hi>general,</hi> that <hi>some slips and transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are consistent with a state of salvation, and are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally threatned, but graciously tolerated and dispensed with by the Covenant of the Gospel.</hi> And therefore if a man dye in them before he has perfectly amended them, he shall not be condemned for them.</p>
               <p>Now as for this, the absolute <hi>necessity</hi> of <hi>humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> makes it evident. For such a state of unerring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and impeccability cannot here be performed by any man, whether <hi>Heathen, Jew,</hi> or <hi>Christian</hi>; and therefore it cannot be required of him. No man of any Religion whatsoever can do it; and so God cannot, he will not exact it.</p>
               <p>For of this all men may be fully satisfied from that assurance of <hi>God's goodness,</hi> which is common to all
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:66440:211"/>
Religions in the World, that he never commands im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities, or enjoins men to do that which is not to be done. He doth not require a Beast to be as perfect as a man; or lay that load upon a man which is fit on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the strength of an Angel. For to do thus were to act the part of a severe Taskmaster, and a cruel im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poser; but by no means to use the Authority of a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and a gracious Lord. It were indeed to reap where he has not sown, and to call for that which he has never given; and to command and order, reward or punish; not to promote obedience, but only to shew power; not according to mens deserts, but only according to his own will. For if he should bind im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities upon us by a Law, and establish it with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties; he could not be thought to prescribe a Rule of action, since no man can act after it; nor to fix a measure of Judgment, since it being in no mans choice to break or to perform, no man can justly be judged by it; but only to seek a palpable pretence of unjust force and arbitrary cruelty. Because it is all one to torment and punish a man without any Law, as to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish him for the breach of that which it was never pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for him to perform. For there can be no fault where there is no ability; and a <hi>Tree</hi> is as much in fault for not walking when it is bidden, or a <hi>Stone</hi> for not discoursing; as a man is for not doing that which it is above his power to do. So that whatsoever a man in such case is punished for, will fall at length upon God himself; because whatsoever he suffers, it is not for that he <hi>would</hi> not, but for that he <hi>could</hi> not help it; which in very deed is to suffer punishment for being no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or abler than God was pleased to make him.</p>
               <p>Whatsoever therefore no man can <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Quis peccat in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="388" facs="tcp:66440:212"/>
own workmanship, since that were in reality and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be angry at himself.</p>
               <p>And thus much, I say, <hi>all the world</hi> may be convinced of in this matter, from that common assurance which all men either have, or may have of <hi>Gods Justice</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Goodness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then as for us <hi>Christians,</hi> we are assured that God cannot injoyn impossibilities, or make that an indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable condition of his Covenant which the best of us all is not able to come up to; because such dealing would not only contradict the <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Justice of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> which is enough to make any honest <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> to abhor the thoughts of it, but would moreover thwart and destroy all the ends of the Gospel, and the declarations of Grace. For if the Covenant of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, or of Grace it self, should exact that which no Christian can perform, and damn them for what they cannot help; it were no Covenant of Grace and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, nor any favour at all to men, seeing it would leave them just where it found them, and not put them into one <hi>jot</hi> the better case than they were in before it came.

To make such offers of Grace, as none were able to accept of, had not been to relieve our necessities, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride them; and that which in the Apostles judgement is a most gross <hi>absurdity,</hi> would have been in reality a most certain truth; <hi>(viz.)</hi> that <hi>all their preaching was vain,</hi> and <hi>our faith is vain also,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.14, 17.</p>
               <p>As for us <hi>Christians</hi> therefore who are under the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Covenant and Gospel of Christ, we are assured that nothing is under the pains of hell and misery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us, which cannot be performed by us, not only from that <hi>common natural knowledge</hi> which we, as well as others, have of Gods <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi>; but also from all those particular Revelations which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, above other men, in the Gospel of Grace. Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities can be no condition of our happiness, because as Gods nature cannot bear, so neither can Christs Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel consist with it.</p>
               <p>Nay, I add further, so far are all the Laws of Christ from being an <hi>impossible</hi> task, that to us <hi>Christians,</hi> who are strengthned by those assistances which <hi>Christ</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords, and his <hi>Gospel</hi> Promises, they are neither <hi>grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous</hi> nor <hi>extream difficult,</hi> but a burthen <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> to be born. <hi>His Commandments,</hi> saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John, are not grievous,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.3. And our Lord himself, who best knew the measures, both of <hi>our Natures,</hi> and of his <hi>own Grace,</hi> declares expresly that <hi>his Yoke</hi> of Precepts is <hi>easie</hi> or <note n="h" place="margin">

               <p>This then all Religions in the world, and we Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians above any, either are, or may be undoubtedly
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:66440:213"/>
assured of, that no man is indispensably bound to do, what no man can do; and that those things cannot be injoyn'd, which can never be performed.</p>
               <p>But now to live wholly without sin, in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peccable and unerring obedience; to go on exactly streight in Gods way without the least wandring, and to tread always firm in the paths of righteousness with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever slipping: to walk so uprightly as never to fall, neither by security or rashness, inadvertency or weakness, surprize or weariness, is more than humane nature can do, and is a task, not for a Man, but an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.</p>
               <p>And that some slips and transgressions of this nature are such as <hi>no</hi> man of what Religion soever, whether <hi>Gentile, Jew,</hi> or <hi>Christian,</hi> can avoid; is plain, because no meer man ever yet <hi>did</hi> avoid them.</p>
               <p>It was an undeniable Argument of <hi>Atticus</hi> in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  <hi>Give an instance of some man that did it; or else confess that no meer man yet ever could do it.</hi> For since there is both an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter necessity, and a severe Commandment requiring it; it cannot be but that some of all mankind, when they had so much reason, and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite inducement, should have endeavoured to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, and have done it, if the doing of it had been within the power of humane nature. So that if it be a failing inseparable from the practice of every man, we must conclude it to be unconquerable by the humane nature also.</p>
               <p>But now as for this inability of performing in every instance, and transgressing at no time; it has been the complaint of <hi>all persons,</hi> in <hi>all Religions,</hi> throughout <hi>all ages</hi> of the world.</p>

               <p>Nay, even the <hi>Disciples of Christ</hi> themselves, who
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:66440:214"/>
have the noblest encouragements, and the greatest as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances for a most compleat and entire obedience of any men whatsoever; could never yet attain to such a state as to obey universally without ever slipping. The <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> in the <hi>African Councils</hi> felt this by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and were so deeply sensible of it from their own experience, and from what they heard and presumed of others; that they condemned it as a <hi>proud</hi> errour for any man to think or speak otherwise. <note n="m" place="margin">

                  <hi>To say that our Nature is as perfect as ever</hi> Adams <hi>was, and that any man now may live, if he will, all his life long without sin, and has the same free liberty that</hi> Adam <hi>had in Paradise never to do amiss</hi>; is an errour <hi>that stands condemned by the Holy Councils.</hi> And what these good men thus ingenuously confessed, all others have constantly complained of; there being none among them who was ever able to live up so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to the Precepts of the Gospel, as not to do against them in any instance. No, that was the sole Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the man Christ Jesus, who in that respect had no other man to whom he could be likened. For he was made like unto us in all other things indeed, save only in sin, which we all had more or less, but <hi>he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> Heb. 2.17. and chap. 7.26.</p>
               <p>And since this state of <hi>unerring Obedience</hi> is such as in this life no man <hi>can,</hi> because no meer man ever yet <hi>did</hi> attain unto; we may be sure that God doth not indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensably require it. But some infirmities the Gospel must of necessity dispense with, because according to the present circumstances of Humane Nature we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help all; some must be pardoned, since all cannot be escaped.</p>
               <p>But besides all that has been already said to shew the
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:66440:214"/>
consistence of some failings with a state of salvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the unavoidable weakness of Humane Nature which cannot perfectly get quit of them: we may add this further, which will evidence it beyond all excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the <hi>best Saints</hi> of God, and the unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able heirs of happiness have alwayes lived subject to them. Those very men, who are most certainly gone to Heaven, went thither with some of these slips and infirmities about them. They could not plead an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring obedience; but yet notwithstanding all their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours they had right to all the Promises of the Gospel. They died happily, although they could not live wholly without offence. So that some sins do not in any wise destroy a <hi>Saint,</hi> or subvert the hopes and happiness of a good man, but can and do consist with them.</p>
               <p>And in the proof of this the Scriptures are many, and plain. <hi>Holy Job,</hi> who maintained his own Integrity to be such as God would accept and approve of more stoutly, it may be, than any man ever did; confesses notwithstanding a number of sins, for which, although God of his abundant Grace and Mercy <hi>would</hi> not, yet if he would he <hi>might</hi> contend with him. <hi>How shall man,</hi> sayes he, <hi>be just with God? If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him</hi> so much as <hi>one of a thousand. If I justifie</hi> my self in the unerringness of my obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>my own mouth shall condemn me; if I say</hi> before him that <hi>I am perfect</hi> and have sinned in nothing, <hi>it should also,</hi> by such confessions as he would extort from me, <hi>prove me perverse,</hi> Job 9.2, 3, 20. And <hi>David,</hi> a man after Gods own heart, acknowledges freely that he is guilty, not only of several sins which he remembers, but also of many more which he doth not know of: <hi>Who can understand his errours? cleanse thou me from my secret faults,</hi> Psal. 19.12. Nay, even <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Apostle,</hi> who at that time was a most undoubted heir of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:66440:215"/>
doth yet own freely that as <hi>yet</hi> he had <hi>not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to perfection, but only endeavoured after it,</hi> Phil. 3.12, 13. But although he were not so perfect as to obey without all errour, and to offend in no instance; yet had he as much perfection as the Gospel exacts, and such as the best men on earth attain to. For at the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verse, he calls upon <hi>as many as be perfect</hi> in such measure as the Gospel accepts of, <hi>to be thus minded</hi> as he was, <hi>and forgetting those things</hi> whereto they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready attained, <hi>which were</hi> now <hi>behind; to press on</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that higher perfection <hi>which was</hi> yet wanting in them and <hi>before</hi> them, as he told them he himself did, <hi>vers.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>And since men of this full growth and high pitch in goodness, could never yet get free of these unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able infirmities; it cannot be expected that others, who are endowed with a more imperfect Grace and a lower Virtue, should ever live entirely above them. No, alas! God himself declares plainly by the mouth of his inspired Servants, that no man yet ever did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain so far. <hi>There is no man,</hi> sayes <hi>Solomon, that sins not,</hi> 1 Kings 8.46. He challenges any person, how good and holy soever, to say that he is wholly blameless, and has no stain at all upon him. <hi>Who can say I have made my heart clean, I am wholly pure from my sin?</hi> Prov. 20.9. No man certainly, not the most nobly good and eminently virtuous themselves. For <hi>there is not a just man upon earth that doth good, and sinneth not,</hi> Eccles. 7.20. The blessed Saints who are now in heaven, could never get perfectly free from sin till they got thither. For it is only in heaven, <hi>the New Jerusalem, where the spirits of just men are made perfect,</hi> Heb. 12.23. But so long as we continue here on earth, let us aspire after that pitch of Righteousness never so much, yet, such is the inseparable infirmity of our nature, we shall still fall
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:66440:215"/>
short of it. Be favourable in censuring one anothers faults, sayes S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>James,</hi> because every man will need that favour from others towards his own faults more or less; <hi>for in many things we offend all,</hi> Jam. 3.1, 2. whatever some may falsly pretend, yet in reality no man lives en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely innocent. For <hi>if we say that we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.8. we are never able to show this height of obedience, nor doth Christs Gospel exact it of us. For even there we are taught in our <hi>daily</hi> prayers to confess our <hi>daily tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes</hi>; and yet notwithstanding that, we are allow'd, nay, commanded in the same breath to call God <hi>our Father</hi> still, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.9, 12.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>some slips</hi> and <hi>transgressions</hi> therefore, we see plainly that they are consistent with a state of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and are not eternally threatned, but dispensed with by the Covenant of the Gospel. For the <hi>infirmity of our Nature is such, that we never can</hi>; and <hi>Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is so great, that he never will require us to be entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly free from them. The very best men,</hi> and <hi>those very Saints who are now in bliss, have lived subject to them, and fallen under them; but yet they made no blot in their character, nor robbed them of Gods favour,</hi> and <hi>that life and pardon which is promised in the Gospel.</hi> And that we may be certain is consistent, which, as we plainly see, not only <hi>needs must,</hi> but indeed <hi>alwayes has</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted with a state of Mercy and Regeneration. For the terms of the Gospel are the same to all times, and what they bear with in <hi>one,</hi> they do likewise in <hi>another.</hi> God is no <hi>respecter of persons,</hi> nor can ever render <hi>different</hi> judgement to them who have done the <hi>same</hi> things. So that as for some sins, we are fully assured from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going considerations that they are not eternally threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but dispensed with by the Covenant of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel; and that so long as we are free from others, if
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:66440:216"/>
we die in them without amending them, we shall not at the last day be condemned for them.</p>
               <p>Thus then in the <hi>General</hi> it appears, that some slips are consistent with a state of Grace, God under the Gospel-Covenant doth not punish them, but bear with them; so that although we die unreformed from them, we shall yet be saved notwithstanding them.</p>
               <p>But to clear up this business more fully, I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed now to what I undertook in the <hi>second</hi> place; namely, to shew <hi>more particularly what,</hi> and of <hi>what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture those allowed slips</hi> and <hi>transgressions are</hi>; whereof I shall discourse in the <hi>ensuing</hi> Chapters.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. Of the Nature of these consistent slips more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.</head>
               <argument>
                  <head>The CONTENTS.</head>
                  <p> Our unchosen sins are consistent with a state of Grace, but our wilfull and chosen ones destroy it. All things are made Good or Evil, a matter of reward or punishment, by a Law. Laws are given for the guidance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward only of our voluntary and chosen actions. This proved, first from the clear reason of the thing. Where it is inferred from the Nature of Laws, which is to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige; from that way that all Laws have of obliging, which is not by forcing, but perswading men; from the dueness of rewards and punishments, commendations and reproofs; from the applause or accusations of mens
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:66440:216"/>
own consciences upon their obedience or transgressions. Secondly, From the express declarations of Scripture.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF any man should ask which of all Christs Laws those are which he may <hi>keep</hi> or <hi>break</hi> at his own pleasure, and yet go <hi>unpunished</hi>; I must tell him, none at all. For there are no failings and transgressions in a mans life allowed of for this reason, because disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is warranted to some Laws, although it be not to others. No, in our whole Religion there is no one Law that is left so naked. For God has not given any Commandments with that indifference to them, as if he cared not what became of them, or were unconcern'd whether men kept or broke them; but he has establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them all under the same penalty, so that <hi>he who breaks</hi> any <hi>one, is guilty,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>James</hi> sayes, and obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the punishment <hi>of all,</hi> Jam. 2.10. It is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the transgression of some Laws which shall be born with, but not of others; for that which gets an allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the breach of one, would procure a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able sentence for the like violation of all the rest.</p>
               <p>That then which makes the difference of <hi>punishable</hi> and <hi>unpunishable</hi> in mens failings, is not to be sought for in <hi>Christs Laws,</hi> seeing the punishment of every one of them is the same; but in their <hi>own actions.</hi> For some sins shall be born with, not for that they are against a Law whereto no penalty is annexed, there being none such in all Christs Gospel; but for that they are such imperfect actions as the punishing Law, which they are against, will not take hold of. Every Law of Christ threatens death, but these allowed offences are not of the number of those actions which are threatned by it.</p>
               <p>For we must take notice that those works of ours whereon Christ's Laws lay restraint, and whereto they,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:66440:217"/>
as all other just Laws in the World, threaten punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are our <hi>voluntary</hi> and <hi>chosen</hi> actions. They bind us up in all those performances which are placed in our own free power, and come from the choice of our own will; and they denounce woes to us if in them we go beyond those bounds which they have set us. So that in all our free and chosen actions we must take care to do what the Law requires, and to keep back from what it forbids; and we are sure to suffer if we neglect it. For it is among these actions of choice where the Law reigns, on which it lays Commands, and whereto it threatens punishment. If we chuse and do what is commanded, then have we a right to the promised re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and if we chuse to do what is forbidden, then are we guilty, and obnoxious to the punishment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced. But as for other actions which flow not from our own choice, of which sort are all our pardonable and allow'd infirmities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they fall not under the <hi>strict</hi> force of the Law, either in the guidance of its <hi>Command,</hi> or in the sting of its <hi>punishment</hi>; so that at the last Day it will not be judged to have been either broken or kept by them.</p>
               <p>That I may fully clear up this, whereupon so much of that which I shall say under this <hi>Head</hi> depends, I will show concerning it these <hi>two</hi> things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>all things whatsoever, which are either good or evil, and a fit matter of reward or punishment, are made such by a Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That all our <hi>actions are not governed by God's Laws, so as to be strictly and directly either enjoined or prohibited, punished or rewarded by them; but only those among them which are voluntary and chosen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I say, <hi>All things whatsoever, which are either good or evil, rewardable or punishable, are made so by some Law.</hi> For <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil, vertue</hi> and <hi>vice, obedience</hi> and <hi>sin,</hi>
                  <pb n="399" facs="tcp:66440:217"/>
which are only so many different Names for the same thing, have all relation to a <hi>Commandment. Vertue</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> is the <hi>performance,</hi> as <hi>vice</hi> and <hi>sin</hi> is the <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression</hi> of it. <hi>Where there is no Law,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>there is no transgression,</hi> Rom. 4.15. And <hi>no man sins,</hi> as saith another Apostle, but <hi>he that transgresseth the Law; for sin is the transgression of the Law,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.4. And as <hi>Law</hi> is the measure of <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>Duty,</hi> so is it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of <hi>reward</hi> and <hi>punishment.</hi> For God never afflicts and torments the Children of men out of the <hi>inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of his <hi>Nature,</hi> but only out of the <hi>necessity</hi> of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> He is the Ruler of the World, and the Lord of men; and therefore he must maintain his own Laws, and punish the evil Doers. But no man is ever punished without an offence, and he must do evil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he suffer it. He undergoes nothing but that which is his own choice; for he chose rather to incurr the penalty, than to perform the Commandment. He feels no more than the Law denounced, for God the Judg executes nothing but what the Law threatens; he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes according to it, but not without it. The Law doth always make a penalty due to an Offender, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he either <hi>can,</hi> or <hi>doth</hi> exact it.</p>
               <p>Thus are all things, which are either <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardable</hi> or <hi>punishable, made such by a Law.</hi> But then</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for <hi>our actions, all of them are not governed by God's Law, so as to be strictly either enjoined or prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, punished or rewarded by them, but only those among them which are voluntary and chosen.</hi> And this being a a Point whereof I shall make so much use in all that follows, I will spend the more time in clearing of it up, as I hope, beyond all question, by showing the truth of it,

                  <pb n="400" facs="tcp:66440:218"/>1. I say, That <hi>only our voluntary and chosen actions are under the restraint of Laws,</hi> and <hi>either enjoined or prohibited, punished or rewarded by them; is plain from the great and convincing reason of the thing it self.</hi> For let us consider,</p>
               <p>First, The very <hi>nature of a Law,</hi> and we shall find that in all those actions whereon it is imposed, it sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses them who exert them to have a <hi>power of choice,</hi> and a free liberty of making them either a piece of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to it, or a transgression of it. For all Law is a <hi>Bond</hi> or a <hi>Tye,</hi> which lays restraint upon us, and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>Obligation.</hi> So that in all those actions whereupon the restraint is laid, we are necessarily supposed to be free before it comes. For it is an utter absurdity to bind any thing by a Law, which is before necessitated by its very Nature. Who would ever be so vain and foolish as to give a Law to a <hi>Stone,</hi> that it should not speak? or to a <hi>Tree,</hi> that it should not walk? or to the <hi>Fire,</hi> that it should not chill and freeze him? There can be no place for, nor need of an Obligation, where there is no choice and liberty. For it is only where things have a power to act on <hi>both</hi> sides, that there is room for a Law to oblige and tye them up to <hi>one.</hi> And for this reason it is, that among all that variety of Creatures which inhabit in this lower World, <hi>men</hi> alone are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Laws, because no Creature besides is endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with freedom of will and liberty of choice, which is to be bound up and restrained by them.</p>
               <p>Nay, even in men themselves, those actions and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers which are not subject to their own <hi>choice,</hi> nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of their own <hi>wills,</hi> are no fit matter of a Law, nor fall under the force of a Commandment. For who can ever be so unreasonable and void of all sence, as to command a man that he should not be born <hi>rich</hi> or <hi>poor, base</hi> or <hi>noble</hi>; that he should not be <hi>sick</hi>
                  <pb n="401" facs="tcp:66440:218"/>
and <hi>weak, hungry</hi> and <hi>thirsty, sleepy</hi> or <hi>weary?</hi> No, since none of these instances is in his own choice, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the free disposal of his own will, in none of them is he capable of an Obligation.</p>
               <p>Seeing then that it is of the nature of every Law, to be given as a Bond and Obligation to us in such A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, to which otherwise our will is free, and able ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to chuse or refuse them; it is plain that Laws are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for a restraint upon us only in our voluntary and chosen actions. For there are none else wherein we are free, and therefore none besides wherein they should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to bind us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That only our voluntary and chosen acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are under the restraint and punishment of Laws, is plain from <hi>that way which all Laws have of obliging men.</hi> The Law is no <hi>Law</hi> further than it <hi>obligeth</hi>; and all its <hi>obligation</hi> is only upon our <hi>chosen actions.</hi> For all the force which it can possibly have upon us to bind us to the performance of any thing, is only so far as it can make us will and chuse it. And therefore as for all unchosen actions, they are not within the reach of Law, because they are not subject to the force of Obligation.</p>
               <p>Now that this is the only way which all Laws have of obliging us to a thing, <hi>viz. their engaging us to will and chuse it,</hi> so that the force of obligation can fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no action which is <hi>unchosen,</hi> is evident. For that <hi>whereto</hi> they would oblige us, is such actions as they injoyn or forbid; and that <hi>power</hi> or <hi>faculty in us</hi> which they would oblige to it, is <hi>our wills.</hi> For our wills are the Disposers of our actions, seeing we work at our own choice, and do what we will and like our selves. But now as for all the obligation which any thing can possibly lay upon our wills, it is not by way of <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitating, compulsive force,</hi> but only of <hi>moving</hi> and <hi>exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:66440:219"/>
Arguments.</hi> Because from the very constitution of our nature, our will cannot be forced by any Bond, but only moved of it self to chuse that which it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be bound to; so that in its nature it is capable of being obliged to nothing which is unchosen. For the will of man is not a Subject capable of natural force or bodily violence; a man may as soon hope to grasp a shadow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to lay violent hands upon an Angel, as to engage it that way. No, it is no Body, nor bodily faculty; so that it is not subject to any <hi>physical force,</hi> to be bound hand and foot by a Law as a Thief is by a Chain: but the only possible way whereby to work upon it, is to win it by <hi>Arguments.</hi> It must determine its own choice, since other things cannot determine it; and therefore such things must be suggested and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to it as can perswade, but nothing that can force and compel it.</p>
               <p>For this indeed is all the hold that any Law can have upon the will of man; <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> naturally wills and chuses what is good, and hates and refuses what is evil.</hi> And this gives a Law some power over it, in binding it to chuse what the Lawgiver has a mind it should, if he first make it <hi>desirable.</hi> He may win it in its own way, <hi>viz. If he make obedience to become its interest,</hi> and shew it plainly that it can be no gainer by disobedience, but that it is by far the better for it to <hi>chuse</hi> what he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins, than to <hi>refuse</hi> it. For the wills own proper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and natural way of working carries it on to desire and chuse that which appears to be good, and to fly and refuse that which is known to be evil. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the things proposed in the Law have a most desirable good annexed to the performance, and a most hateful evil joined with the transgression of them; this is an engagement and tye upon it indeed to chuse the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the goodness sake, and to avoid the sin for the evil
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:66440:219"/>
that accompanies it. It binds it so far as its own desires and inclinations can bind it: it tyes it up as much as can be by its own hopes and fears: it lays obedience in the way to that which it loves and longs after; so that if it would come at that, there is no other means, but this must be the way to it.</p>
               <p>And this is the way whereby all Laws oblige us. For they are backed with such rewards and punishments as make it every mans advantage to do what they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join him. The evil of disobedience is always infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly greater than the evil of obeying; so that if the wills of men chuse in their own way, and will be wrought upon by their own motive, they must deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themselves to that whereto the Laws would bind them. And this securing of that which is commanded, by making it far worse for any man to break than to fulfil it, is absolutely necessary and naturally insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from all Laws. For a frightful penalty is either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly mentioned, or, if not, it is always implyed. If the punishment is set down, then they who transgress must suffer what the Law threatens; but if it be not, they must undergo what the Legislator pleases. So that <hi>punishment</hi> can never be pulled away from <hi>Law,</hi> but if there be a Command given which makes no penalty due, nor creates a right of inflicting any; it has only the <hi>name</hi> of a Law or Commandment, but that is all, for it contradicts its <hi>nature.</hi> A <hi>request</hi> or <hi>entreaty</hi> it may be, a <hi>counsel</hi> or <hi>advice</hi>; but a <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Command</hi> it never is.</p>
               <p>And seeing all obligation to action, is only such a motive and convincing reason to our wills, as makes them chuse to act, rather than to omit what the Law intends to oblige them to; 'tis plain that where there is no room for choice, there is none likewise for Law and Obligation. For we cannot be <hi>moved</hi> to <hi>chuse</hi> those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:66440:220"/>
which are <hi>unchosen,</hi> and therefore we cannot be <hi>obliged</hi> to them. But all obligation being only a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing motive to our choice, we cannot be capable of being obliged by Laws in any other than our <hi>volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and <hi>chosen</hi> actions.</p>
               <p>And thus it appears both from the <hi>nature of Law,</hi> and from the <hi>force of obligation,</hi> both which are <hi>antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently</hi> necessary to make up the nature of <hi>sin</hi> or <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> that all the <hi>restraint</hi> which is laid, and all the <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments</hi> which are inflicted by Laws, are only upon our <hi>voluntary</hi> and <hi>chosen</hi> actions.</p>
               <p>And this will yet further appear if we consider some other things which are <hi>consequent</hi> to sin or obedience, and ensue upon the working or commission of them; as are,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>punishments, commendation</hi> and <hi>reproof.</hi> Every <hi>Lawgiver</hi> commends and rewards those who keep his Laws, and punishes and reproves all such as break and transgress them. But now all this can have place only upon their voluntary actions, which were at their own choice, and in their own liberty, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have exerted, or omitted. For no actions can be imputed to a man, either for him or against him, further than they depended on him. Because there is no thanks at all due to him for doing that which he could not avoid; nor any charge at all capable to be brought against him for failing to do what he could not do. Who would ever be so absurd as to reprove and punish a man for being <hi>low of Stature,</hi> or <hi>weak of Body,</hi> for being <hi>born of mean persons,</hi> or to a <hi>small Fortune?</hi> These, and all other things of like nature, which a man could never help, may be his <hi>misfortune,</hi> but not his <hi>fault</hi>; and whatsoever he suffers upon the account of them, may be, and often is, his <hi>calamity,</hi> but by no means his <hi>punishment.</hi> No man can justly be charged
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:66440:220"/>
with that which was never subject to his own choice; but if any imputation is laid upon <hi>him</hi> for its sake, it rests not <hi>there,</hi> but falls all upon <hi>that Cause,</hi> whose free pleasure it was so to order him. Agreeably whereunto the <hi>Wise man</hi> tells us, That <hi>whosoever mocketh the poor, reproacheth</hi> not him, who cannot help his poverty, but <hi>his Maker,</hi> whose pleasure it was to dispose of him in that condition, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.5. And as a man can bear no <hi>just blame</hi> for that which it never was in his power to hinder; so neither can he undergo any <hi>just punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Barbarous cruelty</hi> indeed he may fall under, which would have taken place without a Law as well as with it; but <hi>legal</hi> and <hi>just penalties</hi> he never can.</p>
               <p>And seeing no action is <hi>punishable</hi> but what is <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,</hi> it is plain that the Laws of God impose restraint, and threaten punishment, only to our <hi>voluntary</hi> actions.</p>
               <p>Which will still further appear from another effect of every <hi>sinful</hi> and <hi>punishable</hi> action; namely this,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That it is such for which our own <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences will blame and condemn us,</hi> and which we shall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>remorse.</hi> One great part even of <hi>Hell torments</hi> is this <hi>remorse</hi> and <hi>worm of Conscience.</hi> For there is no action for which we shall there be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, but when it is too late, we shall endlesly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of it. <hi>Their worm</hi> there, as our Saviour saith, <hi>dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not,</hi> Mark 9.44. But now it is an utter absurdity and downright madness for any man to be angry at himself for that which he could never help, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent that ever he committed that which it was not in his power to hinder. For doth it ever repent any man that he is not <hi>tall of Stature,</hi> that he was not born as <hi>strong as Samson,</hi> or made <hi>immortal as an Angel?</hi> Was any man ever touched with remorse, because he breathes, and sleeps, and thirsts, and hungers? No man ever is, or ever can be angry at himself, but when
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:66440:221"/>
he sees that he has been wanting to himself; when he has done that which it was in his own choice to have done otherwise. For all remorse is for a willing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: a man chuses it when he commits it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when afterwards he sees his errour, he condemns himself for it.</p>
               <p>And since a mans own Conscience condemns him for all those things for which God's Law will punish him, and no man can condemn himself for doing any thing but what he chose to do: neither his own Conscience can condemn, nor the Law punish him for any, but his voluntary and chosen actions.</p>
               <p>And thus upon all these reasons we see, That it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our voluntary and chosen actions whereupon God's Laws lay restraint, and wherefore, at the last Day, he will inflict punishment; so that no sin is damning which is not chosen. This is a very clear and well-grounded truth. For the <hi>nature of Law</hi> which makes good and evil, of <hi>obligation</hi> which enforceth it, of <hi>rewards</hi> and <hi>punishments from God,</hi> of <hi>acquiescence</hi> and <hi>remorse from our own Conscience,</hi> which ensue upon it; all these evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently evince and prove it. For not any one of them is concerned about any actions, but those which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from choice, nor have to do with any works but what are wilful. So that every action whereto there is <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>obligation, exhortation</hi> and <hi>admonition, reward</hi> or <hi>punishment, commendation</hi> or <hi>reproof, acquiescence</hi> or <hi>remorse,</hi> as there are for all those which the Laws of God will sentence; every such action, I say, is an effect of our own will, or a <hi>voluntary chosen</hi> action.</p>
               <p>Thus is it clear from the <hi>reason</hi> of the <hi>thing it self,</hi> that <hi>all our actions are not governed by God's Laws,</hi> so as to be strictly either enjoined or prohibited, punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or rewarded by them; but only <hi>those among them which are voluntary and chosen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

               <p>And therefore although there be no <hi>Law</hi> of Christ which gives men <hi>leave to sin</hi> without <hi>fear of punishment</hi>; yet some actions there may be against <hi>many,</hi> or <hi>most</hi> of Christ's Laws, which shall not be judged to be <hi>punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able transgressions</hi> of them; as are all our <hi>involuntary</hi> and <hi>unchosen</hi> actions.

For it is our involuntary failings which are our unavoidable ones, because we have no power to avoid where we have no liberty to will and chuse; and since they are such as we cannot help, they are such likewise as God pities, and such as the Gospel doth not punish, but graciously pardon and dispense with.</p>

                  <p>The nature of a wilfill and a deliberate sin. Why it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a despising of Gods Law, a sinning presumptuously, and with a high hand. Wilfull sins of two sorts, <hi>(viz.)</hi> some chosen directly and expresly, others only indirectly and by interpretation. Of direct and interpretative vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition. Things chosen in the latter way justly imputable. Of the voluntary causes of inconsideration in sins of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, which are drunkenness, an indulged passion, or a habit of sin. Of the power of these to make men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate. The cause of inconsideration in sins of omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Neglect of the means of acquiring virtue. Of the voluntariness of all these causes. Of the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tariness of drunkenness; when it may be looked upon as involuntary. Of the voluntariness of an indulged pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; mens great errour lies in indulging the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of sin. Of the voluntariness and crying guilt of a habit of sin. Of the voluntariness of mens neglect of the means of virtue. No wilfull sin is consistent with a state of Grace, but all are damning. A distinct ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the effect of wilfull sins, <hi>(viz.)</hi> when they only destroy our acceptance for the present, and when more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over they greatly wound and endanger that habitual virtue which is the foundation of it, and which should again restore us to it for the time to come. These last are particularly taken notice of in the accounts of God.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <pb n="410" facs="tcp:66440:223"/>HAving thus clearly shown in the <hi>General</hi> that all the <hi>dispensation,</hi> and <hi>allowance for our consistent slips under the Gospel,</hi> comes not from the <hi>nakedness</hi> and <hi>want of penalty in any of Christs Laws,</hi> but only from the <hi>imperfection</hi> and <hi>involuntariness of our own actions:</hi> I will descend now to consider <hi>particularly what those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent slips and transgressions are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the management whereof, I shall shew these <hi>two</hi> things:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That our <hi>voluntary and chosen sins and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions of any of Christs Laws, are not consistent with a state of Grace and Salvation, but are deadly and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That our <hi>involuntary and unchosen slips are consistent, and such as Christs Gospel doth not eternally threaten, but graciously bear and dispense with.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> I say, <hi>No voluntary sin, or chosen transgression of any of Christs Laws is consistent with a state of Grace and Salvation, but is deadly and damning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To make this out, it will be very requisite to show,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>What sinfull actions are voluntary and chosen:</hi> And,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That none of them is consistent with a state of Grace, but deadly and damning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>What sins and transgressions are voluntary and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then we commit a <hi>wilfull chosen sin,</hi> when we <hi>see and consider of the sinfulness of any action</hi> which we are tempted to, <hi>and after that choose to act and perform it.</hi> Every <hi>chosen</hi> sin is a sin against <hi>Knowledge,</hi> for the will is a blind faculty, and can choose nothing till our mind proposeth it. All choice is an act of <note n="a" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>That which suggests the sinfulness of any action to us, and sets the evil of it before us when we are about to choose it, is our <hi>Conscience.</hi> For God has placed this Monitor of every mans Duty in every mans breast, to tell him upon every occasion what he requires from him. And till such time as men have debauched their understandings into a gross mistake of their Duty, so as to call <hi>Evil Good,</hi> and <hi>Good Evil</hi>; and God in his just anger has given them up to a <hi>reprobate mind,</hi> or a mind <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, Rom. 1.28.</note> void of judgment; their own consciences will keep them in mind of Gods Laws, and not suffer them to transgress without reproof. So that every <hi>wilfull sin,</hi> is a <hi>sin against a mans own mind or conscience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay further, so long as mens hearts are soft, and their consciences are tender, and before such time as they are wholly enslaved to their appetites, and quite hardened in sin; their consciences, especially in some great and <hi>frightfull</hi> instances, will not only <hi>suggest</hi> and <hi>represent</hi> their Duty, but <hi>argue</hi> also and debate against their lusts for the practice and performance of it. And then men are not won at the first offer, nor consent to fulfill the sin upon the first assault of the temptation; but are drawn in after a long deliberation and debate, and dispute the matter with themselves before they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it. For when mens consciences do not nakedly suggest, but moreover plead the cause, and urge the observance of their Duty; there are arguments on both sides to render the choice at first somewhat doubtfull. The Law of God promises an <hi>infinite reward</hi> to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of obedience, and threatens an <hi>endless punishment</hi> if we disobey; both which are <hi>future,</hi> and to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in the next world. And the temptation indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:66440:224"/>
us to sin presents us with a fair shew of <hi>sensitiv pleasure, profit</hi> or <hi>honour</hi> if we practise, and threatens us with all the <hi>contrary evils</hi> if we neglect it: both which it sets before us as things <hi>present,</hi> to be felt and enjoy'd by us even now whilst we are here in this world. Now these are great motives on both sides, each of them bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding fair for our consent. Our <hi>minds</hi> or <hi>consciences</hi> suggest the <hi>first,</hi> and our <hi>fleshly appetites</hi> and <hi>carnal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> represent the <hi>latter</hi>; and for a good while these two advocates solicite the cause on both sides, and distract and divide our wills between them. So that when at last the temptation doth overcome, and the Law of Lust in the members prevails over the Law of God in the mind; yet is that after a strife and a war, after a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous toyle and much contention. And these wilfull sins, because we underwent a great <hi>conflict</hi> in our own minds about them, and past through a long <hi>deliberation,</hi> in an alternate succession of desires and aversations, hopes and fears, imperfect choices and refusals, e're the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of our wills was gain'd over to the commission of them, are call'd <hi>deliberate</hi> sins.</p>
               <p>Every <hi>wilfull chosen</hi> sin then is a sin against <hi>knowledge</hi> and against <hi>conscience,</hi> when our own heart rebukes and checks us at the time of sinning, telling us that God hath forbidden that which we are about to do, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding which we presume to do it. And if it happen to be in an instance that is <hi>greatly criminal,</hi> and <hi>frightfull</hi> unto <hi>Conscience,</hi> which therefore puts us upon <hi>demurs,</hi> and creates <hi>dispute</hi> and <hi>arguing</hi>; then is it not only a <hi>known,</hi> but a <hi>deliberate</hi> sin also.</p>
               <p>Nay, where we have <hi>time,</hi> and there is a sufficient space to consider in between the opportunity and the action; if we know that the action is sinfull, and are not in ignorance about it, by having either never heard of it, or quite forgot it; we sin wilfully whether our
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:66440:224"/>
conscience check us for it, and we consider of it or no. For wheresoever we <hi>can consider</hi> we <hi>can choose,</hi> there being motives on <hi>both</hi> sides sufficient to determine our choice on <hi>either.</hi> And as for all those sins which we know, whensoever we have <hi>time,</hi> we can think and consider of them. For all thought is free, and if we have leisure we may employ it according to our own liking. We cannot think, 'tis true, of many things at once, but we can consider of any one, and employ our minds upon it <hi>when,</hi> and <hi>how long</hi> we please. So that in all such leisurely transgressions, if we acted inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately, our inconsideration was our own fault, and entred only because we suffered it, and had a mind to it.</p>
               <p>In all such actions therefore as we know are sinfull, every transgression with <hi>time</hi> and <hi>leisure</hi> is voluntary and chosen. For either we saw and considered it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ventured on it, or we might have seen it if we would. Our thoughts indeed are our own, so that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at such times as we have leisure to consider, we may still, if we please, transgress without all considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But if we do, that is not our mishap but our fault, and we must answer for it. For where God has given us both <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Time</hi> wherein to see and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider; he most justly expects, and will certainly exact at our hands an account of what is done as of a known and considerate action. So that not only our conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and <hi>deliberate</hi> transgressions; but such others like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise as are <hi>unconsidered</hi> shall be judged <hi>wilfull</hi> sins, if they are acted <hi>leisurely,</hi> and are in such instances as we <hi>know are sinfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These sins of <hi>time</hi> and <hi>leisure,</hi> of <hi>knowledge,</hi> and of <hi>deliberation,</hi> are our <hi>voluntary wilfull sins.</hi> And as for them, they are all of a heinous guilt, and a crying na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, every commission of them is a <hi>despising of Gods
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:66440:225"/>
Law.</hi> For when we sin wilfully, both our duty and our sin being set before us, and both being compared and thought of by us, we <hi>despise</hi> and <hi>reject</hi> obedience to the Law, and willingly and advisedly, whilst we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider both, prefer the obedience of our sin before it. Upon which account our sinning wilfully is called a <hi>despising of the Law,</hi> Hebr. 10.28. And forasmuch as such <hi>despising of the Law,</hi> (which is nothing less than the will of Almighty God, who is most extreamly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by it, and can most severely punish it) is an act of the greatest <hi>boldness</hi> and <hi>presumption:</hi> therefore are our wilfull and chosen sins stiled, in another word, <note n="d" place="margin">Deut. 17.12. <hi>Will do presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuously,</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by <hi>will not hearken.</hi>

               <p>But now as for these sins, which, being thus consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and deliberate, are voluntary and chosen; they are not all either <hi>considered</hi> or <hi>deliberated</hi> of, <hi>willed</hi> or <hi>chosen</hi> in the same way. For even among our wilfull sins we must observe this difference.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Some of them are <hi>chosen expresly</hi> and <hi>direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Others are chosen only <hi>indirectly</hi> and by <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Some sins are chosen expresly and directly.</hi> And such are all those sinfull actions whereto the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and thoughts of our minds are particularly direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which we eye and view before we choose and
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:66440:225"/>
act them. They are such sins whereat we deliberate and pause, doubt and demur; when we have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict and dispute in our own minds whether we should commit or keep off from them. And such direct choice and express volition happens when men sin with some tenderness, and sense of conscience. They cannot choose the sin as soon as it is offered, but they undergo a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of fears and desires. For the <hi>temptation</hi> solicites them to work the sin, and their <hi>conscience</hi> being awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened by Gods Law would deter them from it; so that they have a particular and express consideration of <hi>both</hi> sides, before they act <hi>either.</hi> As for this way of sinning therefore by <hi>express choice</hi> and <hi>direct volition,</hi> it is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ordinarily, not to all sinners whatsoever, but only to those of a <hi>middle rate,</hi> whose consciences being not quite hardened as yet, make them transgress with <hi>relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctance</hi> and <hi>remorse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But besides these there are,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Other sinfull actions which are not chosen <hi>direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>expresly,</hi> but only <hi>indirectly</hi> and by <hi>interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By an <hi>indirect</hi> and <hi>interpretative</hi> choice, I mean an express choice of such a <hi>state of things,</hi> as makes some sinfull actions after that to be no longer a matter of free choice, but almost necessary and unavoidable. For some things are in our power at <hi>first</hi> either to do, or omit them; but by some free actions of our own we can, if we will, put that power out of our own hands, so as afterwards we cannot, if we would, keep off from them. Thus a <hi>servant,</hi> for instance, who is <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>healthy,</hi> can, if he please, perform his masters will, and do what he requires of him. But if he choose either to <hi>maim his body,</hi> or to <hi>impair his health</hi>; he has part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his own ability, and his omission of the things enjoyned him after that is no longer a matter of <hi>choice,</hi>
                  <pb n="416" facs="tcp:66440:226"/>
but of <hi>necessity.</hi> A <hi>wealthy man</hi> can easily, if he will, give <hi>every man his own,</hi> and honestly discharge those debts wherein he may stand ingaged to other men: But if he choose to <hi>waste his estate,</hi> and to <hi>throw away his riches</hi>; he is no longer able to do what he should, but detains the goods of other men thenceforward, not because he <hi>will</hi> not, but for that he <hi>cannot</hi> help it. Now these omissions of the <hi>lame sick servant,</hi> and this <hi>disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty of the impoverished man,</hi> in this necessitous state of things, whereinto they have thrown themselves, are no matter of <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>express choice,</hi> because, as the case stands, it is not in their power to refuse them. But yet they were chosen by them <hi>indirectly</hi> and in the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> when they chose to put themselves into this <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitous state,</hi> wherein being once placed, they should not have the power thenceforward to avoid them. So that <hi>indirectly</hi> and <hi>implicitely</hi> they have chosen to do that, which <hi>particularly</hi> and <hi>directly</hi> it is not at their choice to avoid. And because that which they do now under this necessity of their own making, is <hi>interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> to them, and charged upon them by virtue of their former choice, as if now in every particular, they did expresly choose it: therefore do I say it is chosen by <hi>Interpretation; (i. e.)</hi> it is <hi>imputed to them,</hi> and <hi>may be exacted of them, as if they had chosen it expresly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This then is an <hi>indirect</hi> and <hi>interpretative</hi> choice, even in actions which in the <hi>particulars</hi> are <hi>necessary,</hi> (viz.) <hi>when that was deliberated of and chosen which made them so.</hi> All our actions in a necessitous state are indirectly and interpretatively voluntary and chosen, when the necessity it self is of our own choosing. In the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, 'tis true, we are not free to refuse them, but the reason why we are not, is, because we our selves chuse to be so. For although our present actions are <hi>necessary,</hi> yet once it was in our power to have kept them <hi>free:</hi>
                  <pb n="417" facs="tcp:66440:226"/>
and that which causes us now to act indeliberately and without consideration, was it self once freely delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated of and chosen. So that all those actions, which are now necessary in the <hi>particulars,</hi> were, as the <hi>Schools</hi> speak, <hi>voluntary in the cause</hi>; which is an <hi>indirect choice,</hi> and <hi>interpretative volition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for those actions which are chosen only <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly</hi> and <hi>implicitely,</hi> (viz.) <hi>in the free choice of that cause which made them afterwards to be all necessary</hi>; they may very fairly be <hi>imputed</hi> to us, and <hi>interpreted</hi> to be our own. For in all reason the natural and immediate effects of a mans own free and deliberate choice may be charged upon him, and if he chooses his necessity, it is fit that he should answer for it, and bear the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those sins which he commits under it. What is a matter of any mans choice, may be an article of his accusation, and a matter of his punishment also. But now as for this <hi>necessity of sinning,</hi> it is a <hi>necessity of mens own choosing.</hi> For they wilfully threw themselves into it in choosing the cause of it; and so may very justly be made to answer for all that which they commit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. All the effects of their present necessity, if they are traced up, will terminate upon their own will; for they hang upon that file of actions, which had begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from their own choice; and being thus chosen by them, they may justly be charged upon them.</p>
               <p>As for such effects indeed as are so <hi>remote,</hi> that a mans understanding, in the honest and sincere use of it, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see them; although he do choose the cause, yet neither <hi>God</hi> nor <hi>men</hi> will look upon him to have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen them. For there can be no choice where there is no knowledge, because a man must see a thing before he will and choose it. But when effects lye <hi>near,</hi> and obvious to any ordinary capacity if it do but use an honest diligence, as most mens necessity of sinning doth
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:66440:227"/>
to those free actions which produce it; there it is only mens <hi>sloth</hi> and <hi>negligence</hi> if they do not discern it; and if they chuse blindfold, when, if they would open their eyes, they might see, it is all one in God's account as if they did see it. For it is against all reason in the world that the sinful neglects of men should take away <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> rights of God. He has given them faculties wherewith to see things before they chuse them, and he requires that they should. And if they will not use them, that is their own fault; but what he requires of them he will still exact, and punish them for what is done as for a chosen action.</p>
               <p>So that as for those sins which men have chosen in their <hi>next</hi> and <hi>discernable Cause,</hi> although they are not free to chuse or refuse them in the <hi>Particulars</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they are a part of their account at the last Judgment. What is chosen <hi>indirectly</hi> and by <hi>interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> is looked on as their own, and, if it be evil, will be imputed to them for their condemnation.</p>
               <p>But now several of mens sins are of this last sort. For as we saw of some particular actions, that they are chosen in the <hi>Particulars directly</hi> and <hi>expresly:</hi> so are there likewise several others, which in the Particulars cannot be refused, but were chosen in the <hi>general,</hi> in the free choice of that <hi>Cause</hi> which has made them all afterwards necessary, so that they are <hi>voluntary</hi> only <hi>indirectly,</hi> and <hi>chosen by interpretation.</hi> For there is nothing so common in the World as for men by their free choice of some sins to bring themselves into a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of others: they freely will and chuse some, which necessarily cause and effect more.</p>
               <p>Now those things which may bring men into this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, are <hi>such,</hi> and so <hi>many,</hi> as make them <hi>inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> and <hi>hasty.</hi> For therefore it is that in the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars we cannot expresly chuse or refuse several sins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:66440:227"/>
we cannot stay particularly and expresly to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of them. We have brought our selves to such a pass, that they slip from us without reasoning and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring about them. For either our understanding is diverted that it cannot, or so well acquainted with them that it need not look upon them to observe and consider them. And since we do not particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of them when they come, we cannot expresly will and chuse them: but forasmuch as we chose the cause of this inconsideration, we are said to chuse them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly and by interpretation.</p>
               <p>And as for the wilful and chosen Causes of such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consideration, I shall discourse of them under these <hi>two</hi> sorts, <hi>viz.</hi> as causing such inconsideration in sins, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<list>
                     <item>1. Of <hi>commission,</hi> or <hi>doing what is forbidden.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. Of <hi>omission,</hi> or <hi>neglecting to do what is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For those causes of inconsideration in our sins of <hi>commission,</hi> which make us venture on them without all doubt or disquisition, they are these:
<list>
                     <item>First, <hi>Drunkenness.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>Secondly, <hi>Some indulged passion.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>Thirdly, <hi>Habit or custom of sinning.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>For all these, when once we have consented to them, take away either <hi>wholly</hi> or in <hi>great,</hi> measure all further freedom, and make us will and chuse what is evil inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately, and without consideration.</p>
               <p>First, As for <hi>Drunkenness</hi>; we find daily in those persons who are subject to it, that it so disorders and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settles all the intellectual powers, that they have scarce any use of them at all. For their memory fails, and their judgment forsakes them. They have no thoughts for that present time of good or evil, of expedient or inexpedient. Their <hi>reason</hi> is overwhelmed and quite
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:66440:228"/>
asleep, and there is nothing that is awake and active in them, but their <hi>bodily lusts</hi> and <hi>sensual passions,</hi> which then hurry them on to any thing that falls in their way without the least opposition. So that they are wholly governed by their <hi>appetites,</hi> and, for that time, <hi>unbridled passions</hi> of <hi>lust,</hi> or <hi>cruelty,</hi> or <hi>envy,</hi> or <hi>revenge.</hi> They <hi>blab</hi> out that which in their right wits they would <hi>conceal,</hi> and do what in a <hi>sober mode</hi> they would <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn.</hi> And so little is there of that reason and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in all their speeches and behaviour, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in them when the drunken fit is over, that any man may plainly see how, for that present, it is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from them. So that they act rashly and irrational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, more like <hi>brute Beasts</hi> than <hi>men,</hi> committing <hi>rapes,</hi> or <hi>robberies,</hi> or <hi>bloodshed,</hi> or any other mad frolicks and sinful extravagancies without any deliberation or consideration at all. And,</p>
               <p>Secondly, As for an <hi>indulged passion,</hi> we daily find that when it is permitted to <hi>grow high,</hi> it has the same effect in making a man act inconsiderately as <hi>Wine</hi> it self has. For a man may be <hi>drunk</hi> and <hi>infatuated</hi> with a <hi>violent anger,</hi> an <hi>impetuous lust,</hi> an <hi>overpowering fear,</hi> as well as with <hi>wine.</hi> It shall make him quite forget all Rules of decency and Vertue, and attend no more to them at that time, than if he had never known them. Of <hi>anger</hi> it is affirmed to a <hi>Proverb,</hi> that it is a <note n="f" place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>short fit of madness.</hi> And the Case is the same in other passions when they are suffered to go on to amazing and stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying degrees. How many things are acted in the heat of <hi>lust,</hi> of <hi>fear,</hi> of <hi>anger,</hi> &amp;c. which the men in their sober wits condemn so perfectly, that they would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count themselves to be very much injured, if any man should say that they might be insnared into them, and fall under them? Of so great power are mens passions in clouding, nay for a time quite overwhelming their
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:66440:228"/>
reason and understanding. For such is the condition of the <hi>reasonable soul,</hi> that during its being here united to the <hi>body,</hi> it is subject to all its <hi>alterations,</hi> and liable, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in its most <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>spiritual operations</hi> of <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>knowledg,</hi> to be either <hi>improved,</hi> or <hi>hindred,</hi> or <hi>quite taken away</hi> by those <hi>changes</hi> which befal it. In a <hi>sound body,</hi> it is <hi>free</hi> and <hi>active</hi>; but if the bodily Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which are those great instruments that it makes use of, are <hi>ruffled</hi> and <hi>disordered</hi>; if they are either <hi>confused</hi> and <hi>overcharged</hi> by <hi>strong drink</hi> or a <hi>strong pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; blended</hi> and <hi>displaced</hi> by a <hi>phrensie; blasted</hi> by an <hi>apoplexy</hi>; or otherwise <hi>mixed</hi> and <hi>disordered, quenched</hi> or <hi>oppressed</hi> by any other violent Disease: all use of <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>consideration</hi> is strangely <hi>hindred,</hi> if not for a while perfectly <hi>eclipsed.</hi> And this all men are so sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of, that every one is apt to plead this in his own behalf for those faults which he commits in the height of passion; and others are as ready to admit of it. For their great excuse is, That their passion made them almost mad, and spurr'd them on to act they knew not what, without all sober thought and consideration.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As for the <hi>habit</hi> or <hi>custom of chusing sinful actions</hi>; it brings our wills to such an acquaintance with them, and to such an unstudied forwardness in embracing of them, that when an opportunity is offered for them we cannot refrain from them if we would, or stand to deliberate whether we should chuse them or no. For <hi>custome,</hi> as we daily see, in all sorts of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons begets such a <hi>promptness</hi> and <hi>easiness</hi> in performing those things which we are accustomed to, that we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily act them upon the next occasion without staying to think and consider of them. <hi>Vse,</hi> as was observed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, is a <hi>second Nature</hi>; and what we have been wont to do by long practice, we do as <hi>easily,</hi> as <hi>quickly,</hi> and as <hi>indeliberately,</hi> as we do those things which flow from
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:66440:229"/>
the necessity of our very Nature it self. And as it is in all our other actions, so it is likewise in our works of sin and disobedience. By a long acquaintance with them, and practice of them, we learn at last to chuse them whensoever we meet with them, without all thought and examination. For all the little doubts and exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions of our <hi>minds</hi> against them, all tormenting fears and checks of Conscience have been so often silenced, that now they are heard no more to make any delay in our embracing of them. And our <hi>wills</hi> have been so accustomed to strike in with them, and to chuse the sinful action upon every return of the temptation, that now they do not need to pause, but act of hand, and sin without enquiry. And our <hi>bodily powers</hi> are so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally disposed to spring out into the commission of them upon occasion, that they hardly stay for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but are as quick and hasty in the dispatch, as our wills were in their indeliberate chusing of them. So that our willing of them after a long use is not a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of arguing and discourse, of weighing and consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but a sudden, inconsiderate motion. It is rather turned into an act of <hi>nature</hi> than of <hi>choice,</hi> and has more in it of indeliberate necessity, than of conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate liberty. And as such the Scripture is wont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present it. For when sin is once grown into a <hi>confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed habit,</hi> we are told that it is not so truly an <hi>inviting temptation,</hi> as a <hi>binding Law,</hi> Rom. 7.25. It doth not then so truly <hi>perswade,</hi> as <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>command</hi> us. For we are <hi>led Captives by it,</hi> ver. 23; and <hi>sold under it,</hi> ver. 14. We submit to it out of necessity, and not out of choice; because we do not chuse where we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not refuse, and here we must be under it, and cannot help it. For it is now become our very nature, and it is almost as much out of our power to alter it, as it is for a thing to cast off what is most natural to it. <hi>Can the
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:66440:229"/>
Ethiopian</hi> Blackamore <hi>change his skin, or the Leopard his spots?</hi> When they can do that, then, saith <hi>Jeremy, may you also do good who are accustomed to do evil,</hi> Jer. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.23. If men are so pleased, they may chuse to sin themselves out of their liberty, till they can no longer chuse whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they shall sin any more or no. A <hi>compleat habit,</hi> and a <hi>perfect custome</hi> shall make them sin beyond all <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> because they will sin without all deliberation; and then they are got up to that pitch whereof S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> speaks, <hi>Of them who cannot cease from sin,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14.</p>
               <p>In sins of <hi>commission</hi> then, or <hi>doing those things which are forbidden,</hi> the causes of indeliberateness and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration are most usually these <hi>three,</hi> viz. A <hi>drunken fit,</hi> a <hi>high passion,</hi> or a <hi>confirmed habit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then,</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for the other Branch of <hi>sins,</hi> viz. those of <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,</hi> or <hi>neglecting to do what we are commanded</hi>; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these <hi>three</hi> already mentioned, which have their evil influence upon sins of that kind also, there is <hi>one great</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> Cause which takes away our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of choice in them, and that is a <hi>neglect of those means which are necessary to the performance of the omitted Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> For as it is in all our other actions, so is it also in those of obedience, they hang in a <hi>chain of dependance,</hi> and are <hi>helped</hi> on or <hi>hindred</hi> by several others, which, further than they influence them, are not <hi>religious</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor make up any <hi>part</hi> of <hi>obedience.</hi> There is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the <hi>means,</hi> as well as of the <hi>end</hi>; and some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are <hi>helps</hi> and <hi>preparatives</hi> to a <hi>religious Duty,</hi> but otherwise they are no <hi>Duty</hi> in <hi>themselves.</hi> Thus the not <hi>staying to look upon a woman,</hi> or to gaze upon her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is one means whereto our Saviour directs a man, that he may be preserved from <hi>coveting</hi> and <hi>lusting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her,</hi> Matth. 5.28. So <hi>fasting</hi> is a furtherance to <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>repentance,</hi> and several other instances of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:66440:230"/>
And the Case is the same in several other things. For <hi>meekness,</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> and <hi>contentedness,</hi> and <hi>forgiveness,</hi> and every other Vertue, has some <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular helps</hi> and <hi>furtherances,</hi> some things that promote it and dispose us for it, and others that obstruct and hinder it.</p>
               <p>Now as there is this order in the things themselves so must there be likewise in our endeavours after them. We must take them as they lye, and use the <hi>means</hi> that we may attain the <hi>Vertue.</hi> For <hi>meekness, humility, contentedness,</hi> and the like, are not so perfectly under the power of our wills, as that they can be exerted through their <hi>bare Decree</hi> and peremptory Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But if we would attain them, besides this imperiousness of Command, we must further use all those <hi>means</hi> and <hi>helps</hi> which fit and prepare for them. In <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of the mind</hi> men are sufficiently convinced of this. For it is not every one that wills <hi>prudence,</hi> who is a <hi>wise</hi>; or that wills <hi>learning,</hi> who is presently a <hi>learned</hi> man. But he who would be so, besides his <hi>willing</hi> and <hi>desiring</hi> it, must <hi>read,</hi> and <hi>study,</hi> and <hi>observe,</hi> and <hi>seek instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>: he must use all those means which lye in the way to knowledge, and those instruments which prepare for it, and are necessary to introduce it, before he can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to it. And the Case is the same in all <hi>vertuous</hi> and <hi>moral habits,</hi> which are seated in the <hi>will</hi> likewise. For we must use those instruments which facilitate and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose us for the Vertue, before the Vertue will become our own; and we must put in practice all the means and preservatives against any Vice, before we can in reason hope to conquer and avoid it. If we would not be <hi>proud</hi> or <hi>peevish,</hi> we must abstain from all the <hi>inlets</hi> to <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>peevishness.</hi> And if we would be <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>humble,</hi> we must not <hi>neglect</hi> the helps and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments promoting <hi>meekness</hi> and <hi>humility.</hi> For the
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:66440:230"/>
helps and the vertue must both go together; so that if we neglect the one, we shall certainly miss of the other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. When once we have neglected the means of any Vertue therefore, we have parted with our power of obtaining it. We have thrown away our liberty in losing of our opportunity; so that now our missing of it is not so much a matter of choice, as of necessity. We omit it and cannot help it, because we neglected to use those means whereby we should have attain'd it. And in sins of <hi>omission</hi> this is the great and special Cause which puts them without our power; for we neglect the means of doing what we should, and after that it is not so truly our free choice, as our necessity that we omit it.</p>
               <p>These then are the causes of our want of choice in the particular instances of sins, whether of <hi>commission,</hi> or of <hi>omission.</hi> We do not chuse that <hi>evil which we commit</hi> for want of <hi>considerateness</hi> and <hi>deliberation,</hi> the freedom whereof is taken away from us by <hi>drunkenness, passionateness,</hi> and a <hi>habit</hi> or <hi>custome</hi> of committing it. And we do not chuse the <hi>omission of some Duty which we neglect,</hi> for want of <hi>power,</hi> whereof we have depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved our selves through the <hi>neglect of those means</hi> which are necessary to the performance of it. So that both in <hi>doing what is forbidden,</hi> and in <hi>neglecting what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> upon these Causes, we do what for that present we cannot help. For we do not chuse because we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not refuse it; and therefore it is not so much through choice, as through necessity that we are involved in the transgression.</p>
               <p>But although these sins are thus undeliberated in <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> and thus unchosen in their <hi>own Particulars</hi>; yet shall we be punish'd for them as surely, as if we had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly chosen them, because they were all chosen in their <hi>Causes.</hi> For we freely and deliberately chose that
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:66440:231"/>
which made them necessary, and that is enough to make us answer for all those things which we acted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that necessity.</p>
               <p>For as for <hi>drunkenness,</hi> which is one of those Causes that deprives us of all liberty by taking away all considerateness and deliberation; 'tis plain that it either is, or may be deliberately considered of and chosen. For drunkenness is a sin which requires time in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry acting of it. It is not entred on in a moment, or dispatched before a man can have time to bethink him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; for he may pause and deliberate at every Glass, and is free all along to chuse the sin before the Wine inflames him. It has nothing in it of <hi>suddenness</hi> or <hi>sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,</hi> and therefore nothing of indeliberation. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause where a man has time, he may deliberate if he will; and if he will not, that is his own fault, and he must an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for it, and is punishable in all reason as if he did.</p>
               <p>'Tis true indeed, to a man who has never <hi>tried,</hi> and is <hi>ignorant of the force of Wine,</hi> or of any other into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xicating Liquor, and of its sudden way of discompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his Spirits and dethroning his Reason: Drunkenness at the <hi>first</hi> time may be a sin of surprize, and an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate action. Because he suspects not that a free Draught which he takes down now, should a while hence work so great an alteration: he is unacquainted yet with the strength of it, and knows not that it will have such effects upon him. And so long as he doth not see that intoxication is at the end of his present draught, he cannot be said to deliberate of, or considerately to chuse it. It happens to him besides his expectation, and is not an effect of choice, but of surprize. And thus it was with <hi>righteous Noah,</hi> Gen. 9.20, 21. And this being <hi>unforeseen</hi> and indeliberate, what a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits under it is the more excusable, as was the <hi>incest of Lot,</hi> Gen. 19.33. But after a man has felt by himself,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:66440:231"/>
or learned from others what the power of Wine, or other intoxicating Drink is, it is generally after his own fault, and his own choice if he be overcome by it. For either he doth, or may see the ill effects of it; and if for all that he chuse to go on in it, it is at his own pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril: because if he chuses drunkenness, he shall be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted to chuse all those sinful effects whereto he may see, if he will, that Drunkenness exposes men. So that as for this Cause of indeliberate sins, <hi>viz. drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>; it we see is in it self deliberated of, and freely chosen.</p>
               <p>And as for the <hi>second</hi> cause of indeliberate sins, <hi>viz. some indulged passions, which grow to such a height as to</hi> drive us on furiously into the fulfilling of them without suffering us to deliberate about them; they also are a Cause of our own free choice and deliberation. For it is in our power at <hi>first</hi> either to give way to a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning passion, or to repress it. We can check it as we please whilst it is low, because then its strength is very weak, and our own consideration and command is the greatest. But if we slacken the Reins, and give it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; then it knows no bounds, but proves too strong for us, and hurries us on whether we will or no. For in every step which the passion makes, it doth still the more disturb our Spirits, and thereby disable all the power of our reason and consideration. So that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably as it encreases, our consideration, and, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with that, our choice and liberty is lessened and impaired. But at the first, whilst it is young and of small strength, it is in the power of our own wills ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to indulge it, or to stop and repress it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if it get ground upon us, it is by our own liking, because either we expresly chuse to stay upon it, and thereby to feed and foment it, or wilfully neglect to use that power which we have over it, in curbing and
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:66440:232"/>
straining it. And when once we have of our own choice permitted it to go too far, then is it got with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our reach, and goes on further without asking our leave, whether we will or no.</p>
               <p>And herein lyes the great errour of men, <hi>viz. in that they freely and deliberately consent to the first beginnings of sin, and by their own voluntary yielding too far, they make all that follows to be plainly necessary.</hi> For the <hi>lustful</hi> man deliberately and wilfully permits his wanton fancy to sport it self with impure thoughts, and lascivious i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations; till by degrees his passion gathers strength, and his lusts grow so high, that all his powers of reason and Religion are scattered and clouded, and rendred wholly unable to subdue it. The <hi>angry</hi> man freely and deliberately <hi>hearkens</hi> to <hi>exasperating suggestions,</hi> and <hi>cherisheth discontents</hi> so long, till at last his passion is got beyond his reach, and flies out into all the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered instances of <hi>rage</hi> and <hi>fury.</hi> And the Case is the same in <hi>fear,</hi> in <hi>envy,</hi> in <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>hatred,</hi> and other passions. Men first consent to the <hi>first steps</hi> and <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> of a sinful lust, and when they have deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yielded to it a little way, they begin by <hi>degrees</hi> to be <hi>forced</hi> and <hi>driven</hi> by it. For all progress in a vicious lust is like a motion down hill; men may begin it where they please, but if once they are entred, they cannot stop where they please. All vice stands upon a <note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Omne in prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiti vitium. Stat.</hi> Juv. Sat. 1.</note> Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice, and therefore although we may stay our selves at the first setting out, yet we cannot in the middle. But although when once we have gone too far, it be not at our own choice whether or no we shall go further; yet was it in the free power of our own wills not to have gone so far as we did. The entring so far into the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was an effect of our own will and free deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and if this make that necessary which is done af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, that is a necessity of our own chusing. So
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:66440:232"/>
that whatsoever our after actions are, this cause of them is a matter of our own will, and freely chosen.</p>
               <p>And then as for the <hi>third</hi> cause of indeliberate sins, <hi>(viz.)</hi> a <hi>custome and habit of sinning</hi>; that is plainly a matter of our own free choosing. For it is frequent acts that make a habit; and they are all free and at our own disposal. Because the necessity arises from the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and doth not go before it; so that all those acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which preceded and were the causes of it, were free and undetermined. Wherefore as for that indeliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in sinning which ariseth from an <hi>habit</hi> and <hi>custome of sin</hi>; it doth not in any wise <hi>lessen</hi> or <hi>excuse</hi> a sinfull action. Nay, instead of that, it <hi>aggravates</hi> and <hi>aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> it. For this is sin improved up to the height, and become, not so much a matter of <hi>choice,</hi> as of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> And to sin thus, is to sin as the <hi>Devils</hi> themselves do, from a natural Spring and Principle, without the help of thinking and disputing. Upon which accounts, as it is the most advanced state of sin, so must it be of suffering likewise; this state of <hi>reigning,</hi> and <hi>prevailing habits of sin</hi> being, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, <hi>a body of death, Rom.</hi> 7.23, 24. All which aggravation both of sin and suffering it has, because it is an aggregate and collected body of many wilfull and presumptuous sins. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men come so far, they have deliberately chosen, and willfully neglected to refrain from all those prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent actions which have advanced the strength of sin to that pitch, and have made it to be not so much a <hi>temptation</hi> or a <hi>refusable motive,</hi> as a <hi>binding</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7.23.</note> 
                  <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>necessitating nature.</hi> So that although those sinfull acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which flow from us after that we are come to a habit of sin, are indeliberate and unchosen: Yet as for our evil habit it self, which is the cause of them, it was produced by a combination of wilfull sins, and was in all the antecedent degrees a matter of choice and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="430" facs="tcp:66440:233"/>And lastly, as for the cause of our <hi>involuntary omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi> (viz.) <hi>our neglect of those means which are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our performance of those things which are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>; this is clearly our own fault, and comes to pass only because we choose it and have a mind to it. For the reason why we neglect the means, is, because we will not use them. We have time enough wherein to deliberate and consider of them, and thereby to choose and practise them; but we will not use it to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. The means and helps to <hi>chastity,</hi> to <hi>meekness,</hi> to <hi>contentedness,</hi> and other virtues, are all before us, and we have power to put them in practice if we think fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. For it is just the same for that matter with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments of our <hi>wills,</hi> as with those of our <hi>minds</hi> and <hi>bodies.</hi> We can see and consider of the means of beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>learning in our minds</hi>; and of those receits and rules which are to promote the <hi>health of our bodies</hi>; and upon such consideration we not only <hi>can,</hi> but ordinarily <hi>do</hi> make <hi>choice</hi> of them, and put them in <hi>practice.</hi> And although it happen much otherwise with those wise directions, and helpfull rules that are given for the <hi>attainment</hi> of <hi>virtue,</hi> which are read ordinarily only to be <hi>known</hi> but not to be <hi>practised</hi>; yet is it in the choice of our own wills to make use of <hi>them</hi> if we please, as well as of the <hi>other.</hi> The neglect of them is a wilfull neglect, for therefore we do not use them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we choose to omit them. So that although when once we neglect the means, it be not at our choice af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that to attain the virtue; yet that neglect it self was. The omissions in themselves it may be are not chosen, because they cannot be refused: but that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, which is the cause of their being so, is plainly an effect of our own choice and deliberation.</p>
               <p>Thus then it plainly appears, that our sinfull <hi>commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> upon <hi>drunkenness, passionateness,</hi> and <hi>custome</hi> of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:66440:233"/>
and our sinfull <hi>omissions</hi> upon our <hi>neglect of the means</hi> and <hi>instruments of virtue,</hi> all which are <hi>indelibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> and <hi>unchosen</hi> in <hi>themselves,</hi> were yet deliberately chosen in their <hi>causes.</hi> So that all our necessity in them is a necessity of our own making, seeing it was at our own choice whether ever we should have come under it; although, when once we are subject to it, it be no longer at our liberty whether or no we shall be acted by it.</p>
               <p>And since all these sins which are thus indeliberate in themselves, were yet so freely chosen and deliberated in their causes, they are all imputable to us, and fit to be charged upon us. They were chosen <hi>indirectly</hi> and <hi>interpretatively</hi> in the choice of that <hi>cause</hi> which made them all afterwards to be <hi>almost,</hi> if not <hi>wholly necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> For either we did deliberate, or, which is all one, we had time enough to have deliberated as we ought, before we chose our own necessity. So that these sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full actions which are <hi>unchosen</hi> and <hi>unconsidered</hi> in <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> are yet imputable to us, and fit to be charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us as our own, because we chose them by an <hi>indirect</hi> and <hi>interpretative volition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As therefore there are some sins, which are expresly will'd in the particulars by an express choice and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; so likewise are there several others, which are expresly and deliberately willed only in their cause, but in their own particulars are not chosen otherwise than indirectly and by interpretation.</p>
               <p>And <hi>both</hi> these together take up the compass of our <hi>wilfull</hi> and <hi>chosen sins.</hi> For either we expresly think, and deliberately consider of the sinfull action when we commit it; or we expresly and deliberately thought upon that cause, when we chose it, which makes us now to sin without thinking and deliberation.</p>
               <p>And by all this it appears now at length how consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derateness
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:66440:234"/>
and deliberation is implyed in every wilfull sin. For the sinfull action is seen and considered, (or it is our faults if it be not, since we had both time and powers for such consideration) either in <hi>it self,</hi> or in its <hi>cause</hi>; and being it is thus a matter of our considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is likewise a matter of our choice, and a wilfull action.</p>
               <p>And thus having shewn what sinfull actions are vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary and chosen; I proceed now to shew,</p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>none of them is consistent with a state of grace, but deadly and damning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for our <hi>wilfull sins,</hi> they are all, as we have seen, of a most <hi>heinous nature</hi>; being indeed nothing less than a <hi>contempt of Gods Authority,</hi> a <hi>sinning presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,</hi> and <hi>with a high hand.</hi> They are a plain disavow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods will, and renouncing of his Soveraignty; they are acted in a way of defiance, and are not the unavoidable slips of an honest and well-meaning ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, but the high affronts of an open <note n="i" place="margin">

               <p>Thus severe was the sentence, and thus unavoidable was the penalty of all wilfull sins under the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> And by how much the ministration of <hi>Christ</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler than the ministration of <hi>Moses</hi> was, by so much shall the punishment of all wilfull and contemptuous sins against the Law of Christ be more severe, than it was for those against the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> And this is the Apostles own argument. <hi>For if that word</hi> of the Law threatning death, which was <hi>spoken</hi> unto <hi>Moses</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinai by</hi> the mediation only of <hi>Angels, was sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast, and every transgression</hi> of it <hi>received the just recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence</hi> of that death which it threatned, such persons dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without mercy: <hi>How shall we</hi> Christians hope to <hi>escape</hi> it, <hi>if we</hi> wilfully <hi>neglect</hi> and contemn those Laws which are published to us by <hi>so great</hi> a means of <hi>salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> as the Gospel is; <hi>which was</hi> at <hi>first spoken</hi> to us, not by Angels, but <hi>by the Lord</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>himself,</hi> who is far above all Angels, being indeed the Son of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.2, 3. Surely, as the Apostle argues in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, <hi>if he who despised</hi> even <hi>Moses</hi>'s <hi>Law died without mercy</hi> for that contempt; we ought to think with our selves, not of how much less, but <hi>of how much sorer punishment he shall be judged worthy, who,</hi> by wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sinning and despising of his Laws, doth in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>tread under foot,</hi> not <hi>Moses,</hi> but <hi>the Son of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> Hebr. 10.28, 29.

               <p>As for our <hi>voluntary</hi> and <hi>chosen</hi> sins then, whether they are chosen <hi>directly,</hi> or only by <hi>interpretation,</hi> we see plainly that they are <hi>not consistent</hi> with a <hi>state of Grace</hi> and <hi>Salvation.</hi> For they subject us to all that death which the Law threatens, and deprive us of all that life and happiness which it proposes to us, which, beside all the evidence which the Scripture gives us of it, is plainly demonstrable from the very reason of the thing it self. For certainly if Christs Laws will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us for any actions whatsoever, it must be for those, which, being voluntary, may justly be charged upon us, and looked upon to be our own. It must be our willing what sin enjoyns, which can make us Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of it, and subject us to that death, which God has appointed for its wages: So that both from <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> and <hi>Scripture</hi> it evidently appears, that every <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sin</hi> is certainly a <hi>deadly one,</hi> and puts the sinner out of a state of Gods favour and salvation.</p>
               <p>'Tis true indeed that every wilfull sin doth not rob us of Gods favour in such measure, as to <hi>incapacitate us for regaining of it ever after.</hi> But its effect is this, before such time as we have repented of it and amended it, we are under all the threatnings of the Law, and subject, if we die in that instant, to that death which is ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the wages of it. We are out of Gods favour for the <hi>present,</hi> and the <hi>state of friendship</hi> betwixt him and us is interruped; and till we <hi>repent,</hi> we shall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <hi>restored</hi> to it. As for the <hi>state of acceptance</hi> and <hi>salvation</hi> it is <hi>broken,</hi> and <hi>destroyed</hi> for the present; for we are put under the punishing part of Gods Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and are made subject to his vengeance by being sinners against his Law. But as for the <hi>foundation of that acceptance,</hi> (viz.) that <hi>habit of virtue and obedience,</hi>
                  <pb n="436" facs="tcp:66440:236"/>
which, in the wilfull action, we sinn'd against; it is not <hi>quite destroyed,</hi> but only <hi>wounded</hi> and <hi>impaired</hi> in us. For <hi>habits</hi> are neither won nor lost by <hi>one</hi> action, but by <hi>many.</hi> It is frequency and repetition that must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther produce, or destroy them. If therefore a good man is careless in some instance, and loses his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and is vanquished into a wilfull sin; yet is not the <hi>habitual inclination</hi> of his soul towards that instance of obedience, against which he offended, <hi>quite extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished</hi> in him, but only somewhat <hi>weakned</hi> and <hi>abated.</hi> Thus, for instance, a <hi>sober</hi> man, if he consent once to be <hi>drunk,</hi> doth not thereby wholly lose his <hi>sober inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But when the temptation is past, his habitual tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which was foil'd and over-born, revives again, and he abhors his sin, and confirms his resolution, and so is ready at the next return of the temptation to wash off the stain of his former offence by an opposite instance of new obedience. And the case is the same in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full commissions of any other sin. For although any one wilfull act be a damnable transgression, and put the sinner into a damnable condition for the present; yet doth it not destroy, but only wound and weaken that habitual temper of virtue, which, if God spare him life, may enable him with ease to act otherwise for the time to come.</p>
               <p>Although indeed <hi>some</hi> wilfull sins have such a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of evil</hi> in them, and are carried on against so many <hi>suggestions of the spirit,</hi> and <hi>checks of conscience,</hi> and are brought to effect through so <hi>many thoughts,</hi> and so <hi>long contrivance</hi>; that they <hi>destroy,</hi> not only that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence</hi> which is the <hi>condition of our state of Grace</hi>; but also that <hi>habitual temper and inclination,</hi> which is the <hi>principle</hi> and <hi>foundation of it</hi> too. They unravel all, and set us to begin again the work of reformation anew. Of which sort are <hi>Idolatry, Witchcraft, Perjury, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:66440:236"/>
Murder, Adultery, Robbery, Oppression, entring into the fields of the fatherless and widow,</hi> and such like. For these sins do not only <hi>destroy a mans acceptance with God for the present</hi>; but moreover they <hi>lay waste his conscience,</hi> and <hi>spoil all his virtuous temper</hi> and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby he should recover himself afterwards; whence they are call'd <note n="p" place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>wounding,</hi> and <hi>wasting sins.</hi> And this effect they have, because in the very acting of them there is usually so much <hi>time</hi> and <hi>deliberation,</hi> and a succession of so many <hi>desires</hi> and <hi>aversations, hopes</hi> and <hi>fears, chusings</hi> and <hi>refusals</hi>; that the sin has had a great many imperfect consents before it come to have that which is last and prevailing. Our wills, by a number of <hi>imperfect wouldings,</hi> are in great part accustomed, and have almost wholly learned to <hi>unwill</hi> all that good, which they <hi>willed</hi> before; so that there is an <hi>imperfect habit</hi> contained in the <hi>very action.</hi> Besides, what is most of all considerable, these being such sins as are made up of several <hi>combined</hi> together, before we can bring our selves to act them, our <hi>conscience of their guiltiness</hi> must be in great part <hi>extinguished,</hi> and the <hi>good spirit of God</hi> exceedingly <hi>grieved,</hi> if not wholly <hi>quenched.</hi> For <hi>Adultery</hi> implies <hi>fornication</hi> and <hi>injustice; Sacriledge</hi> contains <hi>theft</hi> and <hi>impiety; Perjury</hi> includes <hi>lying</hi> and <hi>prophaneness</hi>; and so for all the rest. Now these being <hi>complicated sins,</hi> and crimes of an <hi>accumulated wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>; mens <hi>Consciences</hi> are more than ordinarily <hi>afraid</hi> of them, and the <hi>good spirit of God</hi> extraordinarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to keep them from them. They suggest and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the greatness of the sin, and the greatness of the danger. Which they do with such constancy and importunity, that before men have silenced the one, and extreamly grieved, if not wholly quenched the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they cannot overcome their own fears, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon the commission of them. And here now is
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:66440:237"/>
the danger lest their own <hi>Conscience</hi> be laid asleep, and <hi>Gods holy spirit</hi> leave them. For <hi>he will not alwayes strive with man,</hi> Gen. 6.3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and <hi>from him that hath not</hi>; that is, hath not used that talent of Grace which was granted to him, as the wicked Servant had not done who had hid it, <hi>vers.</hi> 25, <hi>shall be taken even that,</hi> sayes our Saviour, <hi>which he hath,</hi> Mat. 25.29. And when men resist the motions of the Holy Ghost to such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as this, and after all the repeated suggestions, and obedient inclinations which he threw into their souls during all that time wherein the sin was under delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, resolve still to venture on it: no wonder if, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus grieved and rejected, he withdraw himself, for some time at least, if not for altogether.</p>
               <p>And of all this we have a clear instance in holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> upon that wasting sin of his in <hi>murdering Vriah,</hi> and <hi>adulterating his wife.</hi> For upon that he felt both these losses which I have mention'd, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the <hi>laying waste of the virtuous temper of his own spirit,</hi> and <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of the good spirit of God.</hi> For this sin being so long in acting (as it must needs be, since it required such a train of wicked plots and contrivances to the consummation of it) he must needs feel all the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition that could be made from the checks of his <hi>own Conscience,</hi> and from the restraints of the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi> And when he had born down both for the satisfaction of his lust, and trampled them under foot for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation of his sin; then doth he begin to feel the want, and to be all in fear of <hi>losing the habitual recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his own spirit,</hi> (which, by so many contrary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions implyed in that one great one, he had almost quite destroyed) and of <hi>suffering the desertion of Gods spirit,</hi> which by his continued provocations contained in it likewise, he had well nigh abandon'd. For to this purpose we find him complaining and crying out in his
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:66440:237"/>
                  <hi>Psalm</hi> of repentance for that great transgression, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, at the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>verse,</hi> he makes express mention. <hi>Create,</hi> or new make <hi>in me a clean heart, O God,</hi> sayes he, <hi>and renew a right spirit within me.</hi> And besides that, <hi>cast me not away</hi> neither <hi>from thy presence, nor take thy holy spirit from me,</hi> Psal. 51.10, 11.</p>
               <p>So that as for the effect of wilfull sins, it is plainly this. All <hi>wilfull sins whatsoever destroy our state of acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance with God,</hi> and <hi>put us into a state of enmity and death for the present.</hi> But as for <hi>those</hi> among them which <hi>lay waste the Conscience,</hi> they effect not <hi>that</hi> only, but moreover they <hi>destroy that virtuous habit,</hi> and <hi>grieve,</hi> nay, sometimes <hi>drive away that good spirit,</hi> whereby we should restore our selves to it for the <hi>time to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And because this <hi>latter</hi> sort have the mischievous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, in making our return thus <hi>dubious</hi> and <hi>difficult</hi>; they are particularly taken notice of in the accounts of God. Thus, for instance, <hi>David</hi> had committed seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>deadly sins,</hi> for some whereof he had undergone se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere punishment; as particularly for that proud pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous offence of his in <hi>numbring of the people,</hi> 2 Sam. 24.1, 10, 13, &amp;c. But these made no notable decay or devastation in the virtuous temper of his soul; for his own heart admonished him of the evil which he had done, and he <hi>repented quickly,</hi> and rose again without delay, and so was presently restored to what he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But as for his sin in the matter of <hi>Vriah,</hi> it was a <note n="q" place="margin">2 Sam. 11.4, 5, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>lasting work,</hi> and took up a <hi>long</hi> 
                  <note n="r" place="margin">vers. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>deliberation</hi> and <hi>contrivance.</hi> It made his <hi>Conscience hard</hi> and <hi>insensible</hi>; for his own heart did not smite him into a change, nor enable him to <hi>repent</hi> without a <note n="s" place="margin">Chap. 12. vers. 1, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>monitor.</hi> So that his stay in this crying sin was <hi>long,</hi> and his return both <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult</hi> and <hi>dangerous.</hi> And therefore in that character which is given of him by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> when all the rest are buried in silence, <hi>this</hi> sin particularly is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:66440:238"/>
specified. <hi>David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and turned not from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Vriah the Hittite,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.5.</p>
               <p>Thus then, as for this <hi>first</hi> part of our enquiry, we see plainly of all our <hi>wilful sins</hi> that they are <hi>not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with a state of Grace and salvation,</hi> but that they <hi>are all deadly and damning for the present, if we dye under them without repenting of them</hi>; and as for the <hi>future,</hi> that they <hi>do all of them wound and weaken,</hi> but <hi>some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most quite destroy that habitual, inherent Grace, whereby we should recover our selves to the state of pardon for the time to come.</hi>

               <p>THE <hi>second</hi> sort of sins are such as are <hi>involuntary</hi> and <hi>unchosen</hi>; and <hi>these are consistent with a state of salvation, and such as Christ's Gospel doth not eternally threaten, but graciously bears, and in great mercy dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth with.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>involuntariness</hi> of mens actions, that which produces and effects it, is not any <hi>force from without upon our will</hi> it self. All the things in the <hi>material</hi> world can never bind and compel the will of man, seeing it is no <hi>physical, bodily thing,</hi> so as that any <hi>bodily force</hi> might act upon it. Nothing in the world can make us will and like that which we do not like; the will of man is liable to no <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Voluntas non potest cogi.</hi> Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oma Scholast.</note> 
                  <hi>compulsion,</hi> it has this priviledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other things on the Earth, that nothing about it can force or constrain it, but that still it wills and chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses as it self pleaseth.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>actions</hi> of men indeed, they are <hi>mixt</hi> things. Because they flow from the <hi>whole man,</hi> both <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi>; and <hi>beginning</hi> in the <hi>mind</hi> or <hi>will within,</hi> are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate</hi> in our <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>bodily operation.</hi> And as for the <hi>last</hi> of these, <hi>viz.</hi> our <hi>bodily operation,</hi> it may be <hi>forced,</hi> forasmuch as one Body is liable to the force and compulsion of another. Thus, for instance, a <hi>chast</hi> Matrons Body may be <hi>violently ravished.</hi> A <hi>peaceable</hi> mans hand may, by the overpowering strength of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, be made the <hi>forced instrument</hi> of anothers <hi>murther.</hi> The bodily work and operation can be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:66440:239"/>
seeing other Bodies more powerful than it self can compel it. And in this sence the <hi>Schools</hi> understand the word <hi>action, viz.</hi> only for the <hi>action of the Body,</hi> when they make one <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>involuntary</hi> actions to be involuntary by <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Invitae per vim.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>violence</hi> or <hi>compulsion</hi>; that being a thing whereto not the will it self, but the body only can be liable.</p>
               <p>But now these forced actions of the Body, although in <hi>Nature</hi> they be looked upon as actions, yet in <hi>morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> they are esteemed as none at all. That is, <hi>Laws,</hi> which are the Rules of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> and the measure of mens <hi>manners,</hi> take no notice of them, nor look upon themselves to be either broken or kept by them; because it is not the Body and <hi>Carkass,</hi> but the <hi>whole man,</hi> consisting of Soul as well as Body, which Laws are given as a Guide to. So that a <hi>ravished Matron,</hi> if only her Body suffered, and there was no concurrence of her own consent to it, is as <hi>chast</hi> and <hi>unpolluted</hi> in God's account and in the censure of the Law, as is the <hi>purest Virgin.</hi> And therefore it was a great truth whereby <hi>Collatinus</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> went about to comfort the poor <hi>destowred Lucretia</hi> in <note n="c" place="margin">

So that what was done by us is not our own, but his who was pleased so to make use of us. In him therefore the unlawful action, being willed and chosen, is really a sin and transgression. But in us, since it was not our own, it is looked upon as none. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing charged upon our account for it, more than if it had never been done; because we did not act, but suffer; it had nothing of our own will, and therefore it can be no Article of our condemnation.</p>
               <p>So much of any action therefore as is forced, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>outward, bodily operation,</hi> in the estimate of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> of <hi>vice</hi> and <hi>vertue,</hi> is of no account to <hi>us</hi> whatever it be to <hi>others</hi>; because it is not our <hi>own.</hi> For to make any action <hi>ours,</hi> it must proceed, not from our <hi>Bodies,</hi> but from our <hi>selves,</hi> who have <hi>Souls</hi> as well as <hi>Bodies:</hi> it must come from the will within, as well as from the body without; and as for our <hi>will it self,</hi> 'tis plain that it can never be made to chuse <hi>involuntarily by force,</hi> since it is not subject to any <hi>forcible violence</hi> and <hi>compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But although those actions which we exert our <hi>selves,</hi> and wherein we are not merely passive instruments in the hands of others, cannot be made involuntary by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny force from <hi>without</hi> upon the will it self: yet may they become so from something else <hi>within</hi> us. For our wills are not the <hi>only internal Principle</hi> of humane actions, but <hi>several others</hi> concur with them, whereby their choice it self is influenced. Our <hi>wills</hi> indeed <hi>chuse</hi> and <hi>command our actions</hi>; but then our <hi>passions
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:66440:240"/>
move,</hi> and our <hi>understandings direct</hi> and carry away our very wills themselves. So that they are set in a middle Station, being subject to be acted upon and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away by some; as well as they are impowered to command, and govern others.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Mens wills are subject to be violently acted by their <hi>passions,</hi> which hurry them on to consent to those things which are both <hi>without</hi> and <hi>against</hi> their <hi>habitual liking</hi> and <hi>inclination.</hi> When any passion is grown too strong for them, although they are afraid to act that sin which it hales them to, yet can they not withstand it. For the <hi>Law of sin in the Members</hi> is of more force with them, and prevails more over them, than the <hi>Law of God in the mind.</hi> So that although they have several exceptions against it, they are not for all that able to refuse it; but they are overcome by it, and yield at last to act it, though unwillingly, and to fulfil it though with trouble and regret.</p>
               <p>Now here is an unwillingness, 'tis true, and things are done, which otherwise would not be done, because the power of mens <hi>lusts</hi> and <hi>passions</hi> is so strong that their <hi>wills</hi> cannot restrain them. For all the interest, which the contrary motives of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> can make against them, is not able to contend with them. They <hi>can</hi> and <hi>do</hi> effect <hi>something</hi> indeed, so as that the will, when it doth consent to them, doth it not <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>freely,</hi> with perfect ease and pleasure; but <hi>unwillingly,</hi> with fear and reluctance. But yet that which they do is not <hi>enough,</hi> for the other side prevails, and the will is not able to hold out, but yields at last to fulfil the lust, and to act the sin still.</p>
               <p>But now although this be <hi>some sort</hi> of involuntariness, yet is it not <hi>that</hi> which will excuse our transgressions, and make all those sins which we commit under it, to be esteemed consistent slips and pardonable infirmities.

For this state of <hi>unwilling Sinners,</hi> as we heard <note n="d" place="margin">Book 3. Ch. 4.</note> above, is no state of <hi>mercy,</hi> but a state of <hi>death.</hi> It is the state which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> describes in the <hi>seventh Chapter</hi> of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the Romans, <hi>viz.</hi> a state of <hi>captivity</hi> and <hi>slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry under sin,</hi> ver. 14, 23; and thereupon a state of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery and <hi>death,</hi> ver. 24. All the <hi>Grace</hi> which Christs Gospel allows to it, is a Grace of <hi>deliverance</hi>; a Grace that shall help us out of it, and rescue us from it. In this state of <hi>weakness</hi> and <hi>infirmity</hi> Christ found us. For <hi>whilst we were yet without strength to help our selves,</hi> saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, Christ dyed for us,</hi> Rom. 5.6. But now since he has dyed for us, he will not leave us in it, but rescue and deliver us out of it. For <hi>now he having dyed for us, we are likewise to reckon our selves to be dead indeed unto sin for him; that it should no longer</hi> master and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over us to <hi>reign in our mortal bodies</hi> so far, as <hi>that we should fulfil the lusts thereof,</hi> Rom. 6.11, 12. And as for our bodily <hi>members,</hi> which are the Stage whereon our <hi>lusts</hi> and <hi>passions</hi> reign, we are to <hi>yield them up</hi> now, <hi>not</hi> any longer <hi>instruments of unrighteousness unto</hi> the service of <hi>sin, but instruments of righteousness unto the service of God,</hi> ver. 13.</p>
               <p>If therefore we are truly <hi>Christians,</hi> and such as Christ came to make us, upon our becoming which he has procured Grace and pardon for us, we are not <hi>enslaved</hi> and <hi>led Captives</hi> by our <hi>passions,</hi> but have <hi>conquered</hi> and <hi>subdued</hi> them. This S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               <p>As for the <hi>will</hi> of man, it is a <hi>blind</hi> faculty, it can chuse nothing till the understanding shows it.

               <p>And this now is the Case of all our <hi>slips</hi> and <hi>transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> of the Law of God, which are <hi>consistent with a state of Grace and salvation.</hi> We act them without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding or considering of them, and so they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary and unchosen. For in some of them we do not <hi>think</hi> or <hi>consider</hi> of what we do at all; and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, although we know the action, yet are we igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the <hi>sinfulness</hi> of it; so that even in the choice of that this still remains unchosen.</p>
               <p>For <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> is not <hi>all</hi> acting of a thing, but an acting of it with <hi>certain ends</hi> and <hi>designs.</hi> If we would be thought to obey Gods Law, we must do it because he requires it; and if we be judged to have sinned against it, it will be for doing something when we saw that he had forbidden it. For that service which God requires is not a heartless service, but a service of the will and choice. So that we must do what he enjoins for his sake, and because his Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires

it, if we expect that he should take himself to be obeyed in it: and we must chuse to do wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Obedience then and disobedience, besides the action, require likewise the eye and intention; <hi>viz.</hi> the chusing of what we do because his Law commands it, or the chusing it when we know that his Law has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden it. But if this knowledge of his Law be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, although we chuse the evil action, yet do we not chuse the sin, because we do not see that it is sinful. For we would not chuse it if we knew that he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it, so that in our hearts there is no contempt of him, or disobedience at all.</p>
               <p>When therefore at any time we <hi>knowingly</hi> and <hi>delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately</hi> chuse an action which we do not know to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, except that ignorance be our own fault, whatever the action be as to <hi>it self,</hi> yet as to its <hi>relation to the Law,</hi> viz. its <hi>sinfulness</hi> and <hi>disobedience,</hi> it is not <hi>will'd</hi> and <hi>chosen.</hi> For since we did not see its sinfulness, we could not chuse and consent to it. So that there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in our <hi>wills,</hi> whatsoever there may seem to be in our <hi>action</hi>; but they may notwithstanding it be still intirely subject unto God, and ready to obey him in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing wherein they see he has laid his Commands upon them.</p>
               <p>As some of our <hi>consistent</hi> slips and transgressions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not <hi>thought</hi> of, or <hi>considered at all</hi>; so others, although they are known and considered in <hi>themselves,</hi> are yet unknown under that <hi>relation</hi> of <hi>sinful actions</hi>; so that the <hi>sin</hi> is all the while unseen, and therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary and unchosen.</p>
               <p>Now as for these slips and transgressions which are thus unknown, and thereby involuntary; they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with a state of Grace, and such as Christs Gospel
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:66440:242"/>
doth not eternally threaten, but in great mercy bear, and graciously dispense with.</p>
               <p>To convince us of the truth whereof, besides all that has been above discoursed upon this Argument, it is <hi>first</hi> considerable that all these <hi>involuntary failings</hi> upon <hi>ignorance</hi> or <hi>want of knowledge,</hi> are <hi>unavoidable,</hi> and God, we know, will never damn any man for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which could not be avoided. For no man can chuse to shun that which he doth not see, but his understanding must first discern and apprehend a thing, before his will is in any capacity to refuse it. And foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as these slips are no matter of our sight and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, they can be none of our refusal and avoidance.</p>
               <p>Indeed if a man should <hi>pause</hi> and <hi>deliberate, watch</hi> and <hi>examine</hi> at <hi>all times</hi>; albeit he might still be subject to <hi>one</hi> sort of <hi>involuntary</hi> actions, <hi>viz.</hi> that which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses from his <hi>ignorance of his Duty</hi>; yet would he not be liable to the <hi>other</hi> which results from this <hi>inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</hi> For where a man has time, and his Powers are awake, so that he is fit to look about him; his thoughts are his own, and he may fix them upon the consideration of what he pleases. And where he has the power to consider of any action, he has the power likewise to avoid it. And this is that which is pleaded in behalf of <hi>mens ability to keep all Gods Commands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely,</hi> and to <hi>live wholly without sin,</hi> by <hi>Atticus</hi> in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  <hi>Thus much we say, That a man may live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all sin if he will, for such time and place as his mind is intent, and his care is at stretch, and his bodily infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities will suffer him to continue so.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as for this power of avoiding all involuntary sins which arise from inconsideration, it is no power at all. For herein we must know lyes every mans <hi>unavoidable
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:66440:242"/>
weakness</hi> and <hi>infirmity,</hi> that whereas our obedience is required at <hi>all times,</hi> this fitness is only in some <hi>certain time</hi> and <hi>place.</hi> For no man is always in that good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to be <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>well-disposed, watchful</hi> and <hi>stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his Guard.</hi> But he <hi>forgets</hi> when he should <hi>remember,</hi> and his faculties are <hi>asleep</hi> when they should be <hi>awake,</hi> and he is <hi>diverted by other business,</hi> and <hi>hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by intervening accidents.</hi> So that sometimes either he has not <hi>leisure</hi> to consider in, or his faculties are not <hi>well disposed,</hi> and his thoughts free and at his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, so as, when he has time, duly to consider in it.</p>
               <p>And this evil state, which thus unfits a man for consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, is not always in his own power, and at his own choice whether he shall fall under it or no. For as for the <hi>want of time,</hi> a man in this world is placed in a <hi>crowd of business,</hi> and whilst his thoughts are hot in the pursuit of one, another many times waits for him.</p>
               <p>And because opportunities do not stay till we are at leisure, we must take them when we find them; so that we act oftentimes without considering, since, if we should stay to think, we should stay beyond that time which we are to act in, if we do act at all. Besides, our <hi>powers of action,</hi> especially where there is any strong temptation of <hi>pleasure</hi> or <hi>profit</hi> to act for, are <hi>forward of themselves,</hi> and ready to spring out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the first occasion. As soon as the temptation is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our thoughts, our wills indeliberately approve, and all our bodily and active powers, by an unconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red emanation, start up to pursue and endeavour after it; whence thinking and considering is necessary, not to raise, but to stop and restrain them. And then if either our thoughts have been otherwise engaged, and so cannot readily withdraw themselves to consider of a new object; or if our thinking powers themselves are
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:66440:243"/>
dull and heavy, and thereby unfit to consider of it: we presently and indeliberately go on to act the thing without all pausing and due consideration.</p>
               <p>For this other reason of inconsideration also, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>want of power,</hi> or <hi>indisposition of our thinking facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it self,</hi> is not a thing wholly subject to our own will, to chuse <hi>whether,</hi> or <hi>when</hi> we shall fall under it. Because in this state of our souls, during their being here united to our Bodies, they make use of our bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly powers in their use of reason, and in the very exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of thought and consideration; and therefore even in <hi>them</hi> they are liable to be changed and altered, just as our Bodies are. For in a <hi>brisk</hi> and <hi>healthy</hi> Body, our <hi>thoughts</hi> are <hi>free,</hi> and <hi>quick,</hi> and <hi>easie</hi>; but if our <hi>Bodies</hi> are <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>indisposed,</hi> our <hi>minds</hi> are so too. A <hi>heaviness in our heads,</hi> will make us <hi>heavy in our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions</hi>; and a discomposure in our Spirits, whether through the strength of <hi>Wine,</hi> or of a <hi>violent passion</hi>; will make us discomposed and incoherent in our thoughts also. And if there be an utter <hi>perverting,</hi> or <hi>blasting</hi> of our <hi>bodily powers,</hi> as is often seen in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Diseases of <hi>Epilepsies, Phrensies, Apoplexies,</hi> and the like; there will be the same <hi>perversion,</hi> or <hi>utter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction</hi> of our <hi>conceptions</hi> likewise. But now these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispositions of our Bodies, which thus unfit our very souls for thought and due consideration, are not in our power to order <hi>when</hi> and <hi>where</hi> they shall seize upon us. For our Bodies are liable to be thus acted upon by any other Bodies of the world, whether we will or no. A <hi>heavy air,</hi> or an <hi>indisposing accident</hi> will work a change in our bodily temper without our leave; and when once that is indisposed, we cannot hinder our thoughts themselves from being indisposed too.</p>
               <p>And since it is not in our power at all times to chuse whether or no we will pause and consider; although we
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:66440:243"/>
can avoid offending in those Cases wherein we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of it, yet is it manifest that we cannot avoid of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in all.</p>
               <p>Indeed if we take any <hi>particular action,</hi> and in our own thoughts <hi>separate</hi> it from any <hi>particular time,</hi> and from the <hi>Chain</hi> of <hi>other particular actions</hi> amongst which it lyes; we shall be apt to affirm that it is such whereof we can think and consider. For take any action by it self, and being aware of it, we can let other things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and watch for it particularly; and when we do so, we are sure to find one time or other when our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings are disposed for a due deliberation, and fit and able to consider of it. But then we must take notice that this supposed state of an action, as <hi>separate from the Crowd of other actions,</hi> and <hi>determined to no time,</hi> is only <hi>imaginary</hi> and in <hi>speculation.</hi> For when we come to practise them, though in some we have <hi>time</hi> and <hi>power</hi> enough, yet in others we find that we have not. Because either they come in the <hi>throng of other business,</hi> and then our thoughts, being hotly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed upon other things, cannot so easily be drawn from them upon the sudden to consider of them: or if they call upon us when we have time to consider in, yet it happens that our <hi>faculties are heavy</hi> and <hi>indisposed,</hi> and so we exert them still without due consideration. When we think of any particular action <hi>by it self</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we take it out of the <hi>throng of business</hi> wherein it is involved, and out of that <hi>time wherein we are indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>; and then we are bold to conclude that we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of it. But when <hi>we come to practise it,</hi> we find that our former speculation supposed false, and that it comes <hi>mixt</hi> with a <hi>crowd of other things,</hi> or in a <hi>time when we have troubled</hi> and <hi>discomposed thoughts:</hi> So that how subject soever it was to our consideration in that <hi>separate state</hi> wherein we <hi>imagined</hi> it, yet have we no
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:66440:244"/>
power to consider of it in that <hi>throng of business</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition of faculties</hi> wherein we <hi>find</hi> it.</p>
               <p>And this is verily the Case of several of our slips and transgressions. For look upon any of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars by it self, and take it asunder from the rest; and then we shall be confident that we may bethink our selves and consider of it. But take it, as indeed it lyes, among the mixt Crowd of other actions, or as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to our indisposed understandings; and then we shall find that it slips from us without all considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

or consider of it: Nor do we chuse the inconsiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because it is not left to our liberty whether in some of our actions we should be inconsiderate or no.</p>
               <p>And since our slips and failings which are thus invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary by ignorance, cannot be chosen or refused, 'tis plain that they cannot be avoided.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God</hi> is the most <hi>Gracious, Loving,</hi> and <hi>good natured Being</hi> in the whole world. For all the love and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that appears among us men proceeds from him, and makes us to resemble him, and to be like unto him. Nay, he is not only <hi>Loving,</hi> but even <hi>Love</hi> it self. For <hi>God,</hi> sayes S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John, is Love, and he who dwells in love dwells in God, and God in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.16. And if we will take that character which he gives of himself, it is wholly made up of the <hi>various</hi> instances of <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Goodness. The Lord,</hi> sayes he to <hi>Moses, the Lord God mercifull and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth; keeping mercy for thousands, forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iniquity, transgression and sin,</hi> Exod. 34.6, 7. All his delight is in exercising Love, and showing kindness. For he swears to us as he <hi>lives,</hi> that <hi>he has no delight</hi> at all
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:66440:245"/>
                  <hi>in the death of a sinner, but had rather that</hi> every <hi>wicked man should turn from his wickedness, and live,</hi> Ezech. 33.11. He is by no means <hi>forward to espie faults,</hi> or <hi>mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to misconstrue actions,</hi> or <hi>prone to admit of provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or <hi>implacably angry when he is once provoked,</hi> or <hi>cruelly vindictive when once he is angred. The Lord,</hi> saith the Psalmist, <hi>is mercifull, and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. He will not alwayes chide</hi> when he has just reason for it, <hi>nor keepeth he his anger for ever,</hi> Psal. 103.8, 9. He is not at all of the humour of <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere masters,</hi> who are prone to take offence; but like a most <hi>tender father</hi> he is all benignity and goodness. For if any thing be pitiable, he pities it; if any thing is done amiss, he is slow to wrath, and easie to forgive it. <hi>Like as a father pitieth his own children,</hi> even <hi>so the Lord pitieth them that fear him,</hi> Psal. 103.13. Nay, take this Love and Pity of a <hi>Parent</hi> where it is at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est pitch of all, <hi>(viz.)</hi> in <hi>mothers towards their most helpless,</hi> and so <hi>most pitiable infants</hi>; and yet this ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness of God doth infinitely exceed it. <hi>Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget,</hi> sayes God by his Prophet <hi>Isaiah, but I will not forget thee,</hi> Isa. 49.15.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Loving, Pitiful,</hi> and <hi>Benign a Nature</hi> do the <hi>Scriptures</hi> represent <hi>God</hi> to be. And what they <hi>declare</hi> of him, all the world have <hi>experienced,</hi> and found by him. For every <hi>impenitent sinner</hi> is a lasting monument of his <hi>long-suffering</hi> and <hi>forbearance</hi>; and every <hi>prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous event,</hi> and deliverance in the world, is an effect of his <hi>boundless love</hi> and <hi>kindness.</hi> He is infinitely good beyond all <hi>desert,</hi> nay, in spite of all <hi>provocation.</hi> For <hi>he is loving</hi> even <hi>unto the unthankfull and the evil, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his sun to shine, and his rain to fall,</hi> and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="455" facs="tcp:66440:245"/>
upon <hi>the just,</hi> upon them who contemn, as well as on them who obey him; as our Saviour observed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.45. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.35. And this he is to such an astonishing degree, as to bestow upon them, not only the blessings of his <hi>substance,</hi> of his <hi>protection,</hi> and of his <hi>kind provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:</hi> but also, what is a wonder to conceive, for their sakes to part with his own <hi>well-beloved,</hi> and so much the more beloved, because his <hi>only begotten Son. For God,</hi> as saith the Apostle, <hi>hath recommended his love to us, in that whil'st we were</hi> sinners and <hi>enemies, Christ</hi> his Son came from him, and <hi>died for us,</hi> Rom. 5.8.</p>
               <p>Thus wondrously pitiful, obliging, and good natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red then is God, according to that account which both the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>Experience</hi> of the whole world give of him.</p>
               <p>And now let any man think with himself how so <hi>surpassing kind,</hi> and <hi>infinitely gracious</hi> a nature as this, is like to be affected with the <hi>ignorant,</hi> or <hi>inconsiderate slips</hi> and <hi>errours</hi> of his <hi>Servants?</hi> Will he be utterly offended with them, so as quite to cast them off, and for ever to condemn them? No certainly, but in great mercy he will pity and bear with them. For these slips, where we do not <hi>consider,</hi> or where we <hi>err</hi> and do <hi>not understand</hi> our duty, are such instances of disobedience as imply nothing of <hi>contempt</hi> or of a <hi>rebellious heart,</hi> nor have any thing of our <hi>will</hi> in them. They are clearly involuntary, so that whatsoever the <hi>action</hi> may appear to be, the <hi>will</hi> it <hi>self</hi> is innocent. For the disobedience cannot be chosen, since it is not understood; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in the notion and interpretation of Gods Law, makes it not to be that sin and disobedience which is threatned, but something else: for that sin, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John</hi> tells us, is a <hi>rejecting</hi> or a <hi>renouncing of the Law,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in these slips where we do not see it, 'tis plain that we cannot renounce it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="456" facs="tcp:66440:246"/>And since they have nothing in them of a disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent will, or of a rebellous heart; can any man think that so gracious and pitifull a nature should be so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoked with them, as for ever to condemn his own <hi>honest servants,</hi> and <hi>otherwise obedient children</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of them? Whosoever thou art, who art inclined to think thus, let me advise thee to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a little what <hi>Love</hi> is, and whether it can possibly be guilty of such hard usage. If thou hast any compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent degrees of that Love and Pity in thine own heart, which are so infinite in God, bethink thy self whether <hi>thou</hi> could'st do it, for that is the way, and thence take thy measures in judging whether or no God can. Doth any <hi>gracious master</hi> use that severity towards the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sights and indiscretions of his <hi>honest servant?</hi> or, to rise yet higher, can any <hi>tender Parent</hi> show that rigour upon every errour and inconsideration of his <hi>heartily obedient child?</hi> Is not <hi>every good man</hi> prone to pass by such offences as are committed unwillingly against him; and the more he has of goodness, is he not still more forward to pardon and bear with them? There is no Nature upon Earth that is kind and pitifull, but will make allowances for those things which proceed from want of understanding, and will pass over those mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages which imply nothing of ill will or ill intention. Every good man will overlook and connive at them when they are committed by a perfect stranger; but then most of all when they are incurr'd by his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate and dear <hi>acquaintance</hi> or <hi>relations,</hi> by his own <hi>servant,</hi> or his own <hi>child.</hi> This, I say, every good and loving man doth, and the more he has of love and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the proner still he is to do it. For it is a natural and inseparable effect of charity, so that in what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion it increases, in the same must this increase like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. <hi>Charity,</hi> sayes S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, suffereth long, and is kind,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:66440:246"/>
charity is not easily provoked, charity thinketh no evil, charity beareth all things, and endureth all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.4, 5, 7. The more therefore that any man has of charity, the more will he be sure to show of sufferance, of pity, of endurance of such slips and oversights as are consistent with an honest, and otherwise obedient heart.</p>
               <p>And now since those <hi>imperfect</hi> measures and degrees of Love which are found in the hearts of all good men, are of force more than sufficient to make them pity and bear with these slips of honest ignorance and inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: that <hi>infinite height</hi> of Love which dwells in God Almighty, must needs make him bear with them much rather. For the most loving man upon earth hath not the thousandth part of his affection; the more lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any men are indeed the more still they are <hi>like</hi> him, but when they are arrived to the highest pitch of what <hi>humanity</hi> can bear, it is not possible, that they should in any measure <hi>equal</hi> him. And since Gods Love is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more, his pity and forbearance towards such pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable oversights, which is a most natural and necessary effect of it, cannot possibly be less than ours is. No, if no kind-hearted loving man would, it must needs be the greatest injury to an infinitely loving God to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that ever he should be severe in punishing us for them.</p>
               <p>If we <hi>ask Gods Pardon</hi> then for all our <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>inconsiderate</hi> slips and failings; he is as ready to <hi>give</hi> as we are to <hi>desire</hi> it. And this we are assured of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is no more than we daily experience at the hands of every <hi>loving</hi> and <hi>good natured man.</hi> For since God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>equalled,</hi> and much less <hi>out-done</hi> by the very best of us in kindness; what the weak Love of a man doth every day effect, that certainly the infinite Love of God will effect more abundantly. And as for this way
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:66440:247"/>
of arguing, it is no more than our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself uses in another case, when he shows that <hi>God will give good gifts unto his children</hi> at their request, because all <hi>earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Parents</hi> do it unto theirs daily; whenas yet their Love, which makes them grant the good things asked so readily, is infinitely exceeded by the Love of God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.13.</p>
               <p>Thus from the consideration of <hi>Gods Nature</hi> it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears, that those slips and transgressions which are committed <hi>involuntarily</hi> and <hi>unavoidably,</hi> because <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly</hi> and <hi>inconsiderately,</hi> do not put us out of a <hi>state of Grace,</hi> but <hi>consist</hi> with it.</p>
               <p>Which will appear yet further, if we consider,</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Nature, and plain declarations of the Gospel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Nature of the Gospel,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> affirms plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it is of such a <hi>temper</hi> and <hi>genius</hi> as tends to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate in the professors of it, not a <hi>spirit of fear and slavery,</hi> which they are possessed with who serve a <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous</hi> and <hi>austere Lord</hi>; but a <hi>spirit of chearfulness and free confidence,</hi> such as they enjoy who serve a <hi>gracious and a loving Father.</hi> For he tells the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> that in <hi>embracing of Christs Gospel</hi> they <hi>had not receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> again <hi>the spirit of bondage, unto</hi> the possessing of their hearts with <hi>fears</hi> and scruples; <hi>but the spirit of adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby</hi> they were emboldened with the chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and confidence of sons to <hi>cry</hi> unto God, <hi>Abba, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Rom. 8.15. But now if the condition of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel it self were so severe, as that, according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of it, these unavoidable slips of inconsideration and ignorance should set God and us at enmity; no Christian man could ever look upon God as upon his tender Father, with this spirit of filial freedom; but must needs fear and dread him as his angry and aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Lord. And the Gospel requiring more of us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:66440:247"/>
the forfeiture of Gods favour, than any man among us is able to perform; it could not minister to ingene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in us a spirit of chearfull confidence towards him, but quite contrary to that, to fill us with inextricable doubts and fears of him. As for these slips of ignorance then which cannot be avoided, we may be assured that according to the Gospel they never can be punish'd; for the New Covenant must bear with them, because it cannot ingender in us this spirit of adoption, and filial confidence without such forbearance.</p>
               <p>And then as for the <hi>Declarations of the Gospel,</hi> in this matter they are very clear also. For besides those places that are mentioned above, which show clearly that <hi>no involuntary sins are damning,</hi> and then certainly that our slips of <hi>ignorance</hi> are not, seeing they have the greatest plea to involuntariness of any: I say, besides those, this consistence of our unknown and unconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered slips will be evident from other places also.</p>
               <p>And for this, to seek no further, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>James</hi>'s Rule is full and plain. <hi>To him that knoweth,</hi> or, which comes to the same thing, if he will may know how <hi>to do good,</hi> and <hi>doth it not, to him it is sin,</hi> Jam. 4.17. If then we have no other sins to answer for, but only these of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consideration and ignorance, we are guilty of none wherefore we shall be condemned, these unknown sins not being of that number.</p>
               <p>And indeed S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>James</hi>'s Rule is verified by <hi>Scripture instances.</hi> For holy <hi>David</hi> fell through <hi>inconsideration</hi> and <hi>unadvisedness</hi> in <hi>sundry</hi> things; as particularly in an inconsiderate <hi>despairing of Gods mercy,</hi> Psal. 31.22. and in an <hi>excessive sorrow for his Son Absolom,</hi> 2 Sam. 18.33. and ch. 19.4. But notwithstanding these, and all other his unadvised slips, he was all the while, a <hi>man after Gods own heart,</hi> a person <hi>upright</hi> and <hi>acceptably obedient still.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="460" facs="tcp:66440:248"/>
                  <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were surprized no question, as well as other people are, into several slips and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate follies. For <hi>one</hi> we have mention'd, even in that <hi>short</hi> account which the Scriptures have given us of them, and that is this; <hi>viz.</hi> that at the first hearing of the joyful message of the Angel, he is <hi>incredulous,</hi> and is punished with dumbness for his <hi>unbelief,</hi> Luk. 1.18, 20. But yet this, and his other involuntary failings of like nature, come not into the account of his sins and disobedience when God speaks of him; for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing these their infirmities, of both of them we are told, that <hi>they were righteous,</hi> and that <hi>before God, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all the Commandments of the Lord blameless,</hi> Luk. 1.6.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>this sort</hi> of slips and transgressions therefore, <hi>(viz.)</hi> our <hi>sins of ignorance</hi> and <hi>inconsideration</hi>; we see plainly that they never will be <hi>charged upon us to our condemnation.</hi> They do not destroy a <hi>Saint,</hi> or put us out of a state of Grace and Salvation, but consist with it. This must needs be true, for <hi>they must be pardoned, because they cannot be avoided.</hi> Besides, <hi>the love and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulness of Gods Nature infers,</hi> and the very <hi>temper and genius of his Gospel supposes it; the Apostle plainly and fully declares it</hi>; and <hi>from Gods own mouth we are told of several of his dearest Saints who have experienced the truth of it.</hi> By all which it appears, that so long as we are guilty of no other slips but such as these, we are safe in Gods favour, and secure of his promises; we shall be accepted by him, although we live and dye in them.</p>
               <p>And thus at length it appears what sins are <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>innocently involuntary</hi>; (viz.) <hi>those which are acted igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly and unwittingly:</hi> and that they do not <hi>unsaint</hi> a man, or destroy his state of Grace and Salvation, but consist with it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>A twofold knowledge necessary to choice, <hi>(viz.)</hi> a general understanding, and particular consideration. Consistent sins are either sins of ignorance, or of inconsideration. Of sins involuntary through ignorance of the general Law which makes a duty. How there is still room for it in the world. Of crying sins, which are against Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conscience, no man can be innocently ignorant. Of what others he may. This ignorance is necessary to all men for some time, and to some for all their lives. Mens sins upon it are not damning. Of sins involuntary through our ignorance of the present actions being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the known Law, and meant by it. The causes of this ignorance. <hi>First,</hi> The difference between Good and Evil in some actions being not in kind, but only in degree. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The limitedness of most Laws, which admit of exceptions. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The indirect obligations which pass upon several indifferent actions. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The clashing of several Laws, whence one is transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in pursute of another; the great errour upon this score is in the case of zeal. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The clashing of Laws with opinions or prejudices.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt in regard this <hi>consistence</hi> of our <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>unconsidered</hi> slips, is a matter of so great account
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:66440:249"/>
in the <hi>quieting</hi> and <hi>comforting</hi> of <hi>troubled</hi> and <hi>fearfull Consciences</hi>; I will yet proceed to enquire of it more <hi>distinctly,</hi> and to shew what <hi>particular ignorances</hi> those are which will cause that innocent involuntariness, which Christs Gospel doth not punish, as has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready shewn, but graciously dispense with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To him that knows to do good,</hi> saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>James, and doth it not; to him 'tis sin,</hi> Jam. 4.17. And the reason why it is so is this, because that sin which a man knows and sees, he wills and chooses; but if he commit sin, when he sees it not, it is not imputed to him for a sin, because it is not chosen by him.</p>
               <p>That we may clearly understand then <hi>what ignorance renders any sin involuntary,</hi> and therefore <hi>unpunishable,</hi> it is very proper to enquire what <hi>knowledge is necessary unto choice,</hi> and fit to make any sin to be esteemed <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary</hi> and <hi>chosen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to our <hi>choice</hi> of any sin, there is a <hi>two-fold knowledge</hi> necessary.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>An habitual</hi> and <hi>general knowledge that the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is sinfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>An actual use and exercise of that knowledge in a particular animadvertence, and express thinking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what we know</hi>; which is <hi>consideration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both these are necessary to a <hi>chosen sin</hi>; for we must both <hi>know</hi> an action to be a sin, and also actually <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think</hi> our selves, and <hi>consider</hi> of its sinfulness, before we can be said to <hi>chuse</hi> the sin, and <hi>wilfully</hi> to disobey in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Before we can be said to <hi>chuse</hi> the sinfulness of any action, it is necessary that we <hi>know habitually</hi> and in the <hi>general,</hi> that the action, whensoever it is committed, is <hi>sinfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I call that an <hi>habitual</hi> and <hi>general knowledge,</hi> when <hi>we are not to learn of any sinfull action that there is a Law
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:66440:249"/>
that forbids it, nor are in any doubts or darkness in our own thoughts whether it be a sin, or no.</hi> But if it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to our minds, they are already resolved about it, and need not further to enquire of it; they know and judge it to be a sin when they are asked the question, and that is their standing opinion and fixt perswasion. And this <hi>knowledge,</hi> because it is no more of <hi>one</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular action than of <hi>another,</hi> I call <hi>general</hi>; and because it is <hi>fixt</hi> and <hi>permanent,</hi> having grown into a lasting impression and habitual judgment of the mind, I call an <hi>habitual knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that we may be said to chuse to sin and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey in any particular action, it is necessary that we have this general and habitual knowledge of its sinfulness. For if we do not understand that, although we do chuse the <hi>action,</hi> yet we cannot be esteemed to chuse the <hi>sin,</hi> since our will may be all the while innocent and obedient, and ready to refuse the action if it were made to see that it is sinful. We can have no choice of that whereof we have no apprehension; for the will, as it is truly said, is a blind faculty, and can chuse nothing till it be represented and proposed to it by the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. So that if our minds are in darkness about any action, and have no knowledge of its being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden; our wills can have no share in chusing of the sin; but since it was unknown, it must be also invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary and unchosen.</p>
               <p>But besides this <hi>general</hi> and <hi>habitual knowledge</hi> of the sinfulness of any action; there is moreover necessarily required to our choice of it,</p>
               <p n="2">2. An <hi>actual use</hi> and <hi>exercise of that knowledge</hi> in a <hi>particular animadvertence,</hi> and <hi>express thinking upon what we know,</hi> which is <hi>consideration.</hi> For there is no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that directs and influences our choice, further than we actually attend to it, and consider of it; but
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:66440:250"/>
if at any time we did not think of it, it is all one as if we did not know it. Nothing is a motive to our will, further than it is heeded and attended to at the time of willing; and unless we see and consider of it <hi>then,</hi> when we are to chuse upon it. For in this Case the <hi>Civilians</hi> Maxim is very true, <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Non apparentis, &amp; non existen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, eadem est ratio.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>That which doth not appear to be, is of no more account than if really it were not at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That any sin then may be said to be willed and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen by us, it is necessary that it occur to our thoughts, and be present to our minds at the time of chusing of it. For if we transgress when we do not think of it, our heart may be innocent all the while, and our will incur no disobedience at all, since if we did but consider of the sin, we would by no means embrace, but utterly refuse it. So that all that can be charged upon us in such Cases is only the <hi>hast</hi> and <hi>errour</hi> of our <hi>understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> but not any <hi>rebellion</hi> in our <hi>wills</hi>; for our heart is good, although the outward action appear to be evil.</p>
               <p>Now since both a <hi>general knowledge,</hi> and a <hi>particular consideration</hi> are necessary in every <hi>wilful</hi> and <hi>chosen sin</hi>; the involuntariness of any transgressions may arise from the want of <hi>either</hi> of them. So that those sins are just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reputed to be involuntary and unchosen which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the <hi>want of the general knowledge,</hi> as in all sins of <hi>ignorance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. From the <hi>want of particular animadvertence,</hi> as in all sins of <hi>inconsideration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The first Cause of an <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>pardonable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntariness,</hi> is <hi>ignorance of our Duty</hi>; when we venture to do what God forbids, because we do not know that he has forbidden it.</p>
               <p>And this ignorance may enter upon two accounts, either,</p>
               <p>First, From our <hi>ignorance,</hi> or <hi>mistake of the Law it
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:66440:250"/>
self,</hi> when we know not that God has made any such Law as our present action is a transgression of. Or,</p>
               <p>Secondly, From our <hi>ignorance,</hi> or <hi>mistake of the thing it self, which the Law enjoins or forbids,</hi> when we know not that our present action comes under that which in the known Law is enjoined or forbidden.</p>
               <p>Thus, for instance, a man may sin by <hi>backbiting, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soriousness,</hi> &amp;c. either because he knows not that back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting and censoriousness are <hi>things prohibited,</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he knows not that <hi>what he doth</hi> is censuring and backbiting. And either way the errour may be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his understanding, and the transgression be no where else but in his mind, but may not reach his heart or will at all. For he would neither utter the <hi>backbiting</hi> nor <hi>censorious</hi> word, if he knew that it were against God's will; but for this very reason he ventures on them, because he knows not that <hi>actions of that kind are forbidden,</hi> or that <hi>his is of that forbidden kind of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>first</hi> sort of <hi>ignorance,</hi> which can effect an <hi>innocent involuntariness,</hi> is <hi>our ignorance of the general Law which makes a Duty,</hi> when we know not that God has given any such Commandment as our present action is a transgression of.</p>
               <p>All the Laws of Christ are not known by every man, but some are ignorant of one or other of them. Nay there is no man, how perfect soever his knowledg of them be at present, but at some time he did not know them. He had a time of learning before he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to a compleat understanding of them. For our knowledge of them, as of all things else, is <hi>gradual</hi>; it goes on by steps, and from the notice of one proceeds to the notice of another. So that even the <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>learned</hi> themselves do not at all times see all those things which Christ has required of them, but pass through
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:66440:251"/>
a long time of ignorance before they arrive at that pitch of compleat knowledge.</p>
               <p>But then there are others who have neither <hi>abilities</hi> nor <hi>opportunities</hi> to know every particular Law of Christ in a longer time, nor some, it may be, in their whole lives. For how many men are there in the world whose understanding is slow, and who come to apprehend things with great difficulty? And as their faculties are narrow, so are their opportunies very small. For although they are most heartily willing and desirous to see all that God has required of them, that they may keep and practise it; yet their <hi>education</hi> has been so poor, that they cannot read it; the <hi>place</hi> which Gods Providence has allotted for them is so destitute, that they are far from them who should instruct them in it; their <hi>condition</hi> in the world is so subject and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant, that they have little time and leisure of their own wherein to seek instruction; and their <hi>apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> are so slow, and their <hi>memories</hi> so frail, that it is not much of it at a time which they can retain when they have got the freedome of it. They are <hi>servants,</hi> or <hi>poor men,</hi> and must be working for their bodily main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, when they should be in search of spiritual Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>Indeed through the infinite goodness and gracious Providence of God, it seldome happens, if at all, that they who have <hi>honest hearts,</hi> which stand ready and prepared to obey his Laws, in <hi>Christian Countries</hi> live long without the means of understanding them. For although they themselves cannot read; yet, if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire it, and seek after it, they cannot miss of <hi>Christian people,</hi> and of <hi>Christian Guides</hi> who will be most ready and willing to instruct them. So that no man amongst them, whose heart is first desirous of it, can ever be supposed to want all opportunities of coming to the knowledg of his Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="467" facs="tcp:66440:251"/>But then we must consider, that <hi>knowledge of our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> is a word of a <hi>great latitude,</hi> and has many <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> in it. For our Duty takes up a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, no less than all the <hi>particular Laws,</hi> which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under the <hi>general Precepts</hi> of <hi>Piety, Sobriety, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, Charity, Peaceableness.</hi> And although every mans opportunities will serve him to know <hi>some,</hi> and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the most <hi>general</hi> and <hi>comprehensive</hi>; yet will they not enable him to understand <hi>all.</hi> Our whole Duty, 'tis true, both towards <hi>God</hi> and <hi>men,</hi> is comprehended in that <hi>one</hi> Law of <hi>Love,</hi> which, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> says, is the <hi>fulfilling of the Law,</hi> Rom. 13.10. So that if every man had but the <hi>wit</hi> and <hi>parts,</hi> the <hi>time</hi> and <hi>leisure</hi> to make deductions, and to run this general Law into as many particular instances and expressions as it would reach to, in the knowledge of that one Law, which is soon learned, he might have it within his own power when he would to understand all the rest, which are contained within the compass of those <hi>two</hi> great Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and general Heads of Duty. But alas! it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>common head,</hi> no nor very <hi>many</hi> even of the <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>learned,</hi> who are so <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>ready,</hi> so <hi>full</hi> and <hi>comprehensive,</hi> in making inferences. But they have need to be showed the particulars, and are not able of themselves to collect them by a tedious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive train of consequences. So that even when they have learned their obligation to the most <hi>material</hi> and <hi>general</hi> Precepts of the Gospel; yet may there be seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Particular ones still remaining, which not only the poor and ignorant, but they also who think themselves to be more wise and learned, do not see, and take themselves to be obliged by.</p>
               <p>As for the crying sins of <hi>Perjury, Adultery, Murther, Theft, Oppression, Lying, Slander,</hi> and the like, which even <hi>natural Conscience,</hi> without the assistance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:66440:252"/>
of <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Gospel,</hi> would be afraid of; these, 'tis true, no man, who is grown up to years of <hi>common reason</hi> and <hi>discretion,</hi> can be ignorant of, and yet be innocent. But then besides <hi>these,</hi> there are many other sins which are not of so <hi>black</hi> a <hi>Die,</hi> or of so <hi>mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous</hi> a <hi>Nature,</hi> which many of them who profess the Gospel, through the <hi>littleness of their abilities,</hi> their <hi>lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> or <hi>opportunities,</hi> do not understand to be sinful. Their Consciences are not afraid of them, nor check them either before, or after they have committed them. For how many are there of the Professors of Christ's Religion, who never think of being called to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for <hi>lasciviousness</hi> and <hi>uncleanness,</hi> for <hi>passionateness</hi> and <hi>uncourteousness,</hi> for <hi>backbiting</hi> and <hi>censoriousness,</hi> for <hi>disturbing the publick peace,</hi> and <hi>speaking evil of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> for <hi>not speaking well of an enemy,</hi> or <hi>not praying for him,</hi> or for the like Breaches of several other particular Laws of Christ's Gospel, whereby at the last Day we must all be judged? Alas! they know not of any such Laws, nor ever think of being tryed by them. In the Gospel, 'tis very true, they are all <hi>recorded,</hi> and by Christs <hi>Ministers</hi> at one time or other they are all <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed,</hi> and by <hi>some exemplary good men,</hi> although God knows they are very few, in one place or other they are duly <hi>practised</hi>; but yet for all this a great many Christian men are ignorant of some or other of them. For either they cannot read the Scriptures where they are mentioned, or they have not opportunity to hear the Preacher when every one of them particularly is taught, or they are not in sight and observation of those patterns of piety by whom they are practised; so that still they do not understand them. Or if at last they do come to know them, yet is it some time first, and they acted several times against them, before they saw that they were bound by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="469" facs="tcp:66440:252"/>So that still we see there is room in the World for <hi>sins of ignorance,</hi> from mens <hi>not knowing of the Law</hi> which they sin against. <hi>Several</hi> particular Laws, which lye more <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,</hi> and are not so <hi>plainly</hi> of <hi>natural</hi> obligation, nor startled at by <hi>natural</hi> Conscience, are <hi>oftentimes,</hi> and by <hi>many persons</hi> transgressed, because they do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themselves to be bound by them.</p>
               <p>And as for this ignorance of one Branch or other of their Duty, it is some mens <hi>unhappiness</hi> rather than their <hi>fault</hi>; they do not so truly chuse it, as through an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chosen necessity fall under it. For it is necessary to <hi>all</hi> people whether they will or no for <hi>some</hi> time; and to <hi>some</hi> for <hi>all their lives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is necessary, I say, to <hi>all people</hi> whether they will or no for <hi>some time.</hi> For by the very constitution of our Nature, which is before any thing of our own chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, we are born ignorant: the mind of man being, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> compares it, like a <hi>blank paper,</hi> wherein is nothing written. No man ever since <hi>Adam</hi> came into the World in the free exercise of his understanding, and with his perfect wits about him. And when after some time we do <hi>begin</hi> to know, yet even then is all our knowledg <hi>gradual,</hi> and by little and little. For we first learn one thing, and then another, and so by several steps attain at last to a competent pitch of knowledge. When therefore any man doth begin to know Gods will, and to discern his Laws; yet is it not possible that he should understand them all at once: but some of them every man must needs be ignorant of, till he has had time to learn and know them all.</p>
               <p>To <hi>some</hi> people, I say, it is necessary for their <hi>whole lives,</hi> to their dying Day they do not arrive to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of some things which God has required of them. And that because they wanted either <hi>abilities,</hi> or <hi>opportunities,</hi> neither of which is of their own chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:66440:253"/>
They are of a <hi>slow understanding,</hi> and have not those <hi>means of instruction,</hi> or that <hi>time</hi> and <hi>leisure</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon it, which others have. And that by reason of their <hi>place</hi> and <hi>low condition</hi> in the world, wherein it was Gods pleasure, and not their own, to dispose of them.</p>
               <p>But now this ignorance of some or other of Christ's Laws, being thus <hi>involuntary,</hi> it must likewise be <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</hi> For there is no damning sin and disobedience but in our own choice; so that as long as the heart is true to God, he will not be at enmity for any thing else which may seem to be against him.</p>
               <p>And since our <hi>ignorance</hi> it self is <hi>innocent,</hi> the <hi>sinning</hi> upon it will never be <hi>rebellious</hi> and <hi>damning.</hi> For the disobedience is not any way chosen, neither in it self, nor in its Cause; we do not chuse the sin, because we do not see that the action is sinful, nor do we chuse not to see it, because we cannot help it. But where there is no choice, there will be there no condemnation. So that the action which is done against the Law, shall not be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by the Law, if we were thus innocently ignorant of the Law whereof it was a transgression.</p>
               <p>And that it will not, is plain. For God never did, nor ever will condemn any man for the transgression of a particular Law, before he has had all due means and necessary opportunities, such as may be <hi>sufficient</hi> to any <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>willing</hi> heart, to understand it. The <hi>Jewish</hi> Law obliged none but those whom it was proclaimed to, who had the advantages of being instructed out of it. It is <hi>they</hi> only, says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, who have sinned in</hi> or under <hi>the Law, who shall be judged by the Law,</hi> Rom. 2.12. The <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> did not bind men until they had <hi>sufficient means</hi> and <hi>opportunities</hi> of knowing it,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.13.</note> and being convinced by it. <hi>If ye were blind,</hi> or wanted abilities, says our Saviour to the Pharisees, <hi>you should
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:66440:253"/>
have no sin,</hi> John 9.41. And again, <hi>if I had not</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them sufficient opportunities of knowing, <hi>come, and spoken unto them, they had not had sin; but now</hi> since I have, <hi>they have no cloak,</hi> or no <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>These slips of honest ignorance of our Duty are no more punished under the <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> than they were under the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses.</hi> For <hi>Christ</hi> our <hi>High Priest</hi> doth attone for them by virtue of his <hi>Sacrifice of himself,</hi> as well as the <hi>Aaronical Priest</hi> in behalf of the ignorantly offending Jews, made an attonement for them by his <hi>sin-offering,</hi> Levit. 4.2, 3, &amp;c. This S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> tells us in his comparison of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Priesthood with that of the <hi>line of Aaron.</hi> In his <hi>interceding to God,</hi> and <hi>offering Sacrifice for sins, he can have compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the ignorant,</hi> Heb. 5.2.</p>
               <p>Ignorance therefore of the <hi>general Law</hi> which makes any thing a Duty, so long as it is not <hi>wilful</hi> and <hi>affected</hi> by us, through the <hi>merits</hi> of <hi>Christ's Sacrifice,</hi> and the <hi>Grace</hi> of his <hi>Gospel,</hi> renders those offences, which we commit under it, pardonable transgressions; such as do not destroy a state of Grace, but consist with it.</p>
               <p>And this is the very determination which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> gives in the Case of <hi>transgressing our Lords institution,</hi> in the participation of the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> For some <hi>Churches</hi> in those Days were wont to make use of <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> instead of <hi>Wine,</hi> in which way of communicating several of them had been educated and brought up, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received it <hi>ignorantly</hi> and in the <hi>simplicity</hi> of their hearts, as they had done other things of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, from the <hi>practice</hi> and <hi>tradition</hi> of their <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers.</hi>

               <p>Gods Laws, as all others, run in <hi>general terms,</hi> and never go to reckon up all particular actions which are with them or against them, but leave the judging and discerning of that to our own selves.

                  <hi>in the application of the acknowledged notion or law to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular things or actions is the cause of all our evils; here the great scene of ignorance in morals, the field of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dispute lies.</hi> The great controversies which men have either in their <hi>own thoughts,</hi> or with <hi>Gods mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> is not so much whether <hi>evil-speaking, back-biting, censoriousness, unpeaceableness, drunkenness, sensuality,</hi> or any such prohibited vice be a sin. For as to that the Law is express, the very word is mentioned in it, and he that reads or hears the Law, if he attend to what he reads or hears, cannot but observe and understand it. But the great doubt is, whether <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> particular action, which they are about to commit, be indeed a
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:66440:255"/>
                  <hi>censorious,</hi> an <hi>unpeaceable,</hi> a <hi>sensual,</hi> or a <hi>drunken</hi> action.</p>
               <p>And the Reasons of this are several. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In some actions, although we know the <hi>general Law,</hi> yet we know not whether the <hi>particular</hi> action be comprehended under it; because <hi>what is forbidden in the Law differs from what is innocent, not in kind, but only in degree.</hi> For a great part of our <hi>appetites</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> are neither determined to good nor ill in their <hi>whole nature,</hi> but only as they are in <hi>certain measures.</hi> The use of <hi>meats</hi> and <hi>drinks</hi> within due bounds is <hi>harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,</hi> but beyond that 'tis <hi>intemperance</hi>; the desire and search of <hi>money</hi> in a moderate degree is <hi>lawfull,</hi> but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that 'tis <hi>Covetousness</hi>; the modest pursute of <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and <hi>promotion</hi> is <hi>innocent,</hi> but when it exceeds it is <hi>ambition</hi>; to have <hi>just</hi> thoughts of a mans self is <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable,</hi> but to be puffed up with over-high conceits is <hi>pride</hi>; and so it is in several other instances. A great many <hi>passions</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> are not alwayes sinful, but so far only as they are <hi>deficient</hi> or <hi>exceed.</hi> Which hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true of several virtues and vices, made <hi>Aristotle</hi> lay it down as a part of the nature of virtue in general, that it is something <hi>consisting in</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">

                  <hi>mediocrity</hi>; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably that vice is something consisting in <hi>defective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> or <hi>excess.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the actions which are prohibited by several Laws, not coming under the compass of the Laws in their whole natures, but only when they are arrived to certain measures and degrees; herein, after we have known the general Law, lies the difficulty and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvedness, whether or no the present action falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. For it is a very <hi>hard</hi> thing, and, it may be, <hi>impossible</hi> to any humane understanding, to fix the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act bounds and utmost limits of virtue and vice, to draw a line precisely between them, and tell to a tittle how many degrees are innocent, and the just place
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:66440:255"/>
where the excess begins. Here the <hi>Wise</hi> and <hi>Learned</hi> themselves are at a loss, and much more the <hi>rude</hi> and ignorant; so that in Laws of this nature they may ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times mistake their sin for their liberty and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and go beyond the innocent degree, when they do not know it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In other actions, although we do know the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Law, yet many times we are ignorant of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent actions being comprehended under it, because <hi>the Law is not absolute and unlimited, but admits of several exceptions,</hi> whereof we may mistake the present action to be one.</p>
               <p>The <hi>great</hi> and <hi>general</hi> Laws of Christ, as of any other Legislator, have <hi>several cases</hi> which are <hi>not included</hi> in the <hi>general name</hi> of the <hi>duty</hi> injoyned or of the <hi>sin</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in the Law, but are <hi>exempt</hi> from it. What Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is injoyned in more universal words, than that of <hi>Peace?</hi> but yet in several cases we not only <hi>may,</hi> but out of Duty <hi>must</hi> nourish <hi>contention:</hi> For we are bid to <hi>contend earnestly for the Faith which was once deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Saints,</hi> Jud. <hi>vers.</hi> 3. We must be concerned for <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> when others concern themselves against them. We are not <hi>tamely</hi> and <hi>unaffectedly</hi> to see <hi>Gods Laws</hi> cancelled, or our <hi>countries peace</hi> disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but must strive and contend with as much <hi>wise zeal</hi> and <hi>active courage,</hi> and with infinitely more <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>peace of mind,</hi> to <hi>maintain</hi> and <hi>defend,</hi> than ill men do to <hi>oppose</hi> and <hi>destroy</hi> them. Again, what Law is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in fuller and plainer terms, than that of <hi>forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing injuries?</hi> but yet there are several cases wherein we may justly <hi>seek amends</hi> for them. For we may bring a <hi>malefactor</hi> to condign punishment, or an <hi>injurious</hi> man to restitution; and the like is observable of other Laws.</p>
               <p>Now those actions which come under the general
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:66440:256"/>
name of the sin prohibited, not being forbidden univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally, but some being excepted; here again is room for ignorance and mistake about the particular action af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have known the general Duty. For we may take that to be a case excepted, which is indeed a case prohibited; and venture upon an action as an exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed liberty, which in truth and reality is a forbidden sin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In other actions, although we know the <hi>general Law,</hi> yet many times we are in ignorance about the <hi>particular action,</hi> because there are <hi>several actions which are not directly forbidden by any Law, but are alwayes innocent and indifferent, unless when some Law takes hold of them indirectly.</hi> The action is usually allowed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when it is committed in such a manner as that the transgression of some Law accompanies it. There is no Law against it self, but only against some thing that is annexed to it. For God has not given a <hi>particular Law</hi> for every sort of actions, but has left us in several to govern our selves by other <hi>motives</hi> and <hi>inducements</hi> of <hi>pleasure, honour,</hi> or <hi>interest,</hi> and not by virtue of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. But although these unrestrained actions are no matter of a particular Law, which expresly names them, and directly binds us up to one side, either in chusing, or refusing the <hi>whole kind</hi> of them: yet in our use and exercise of them, they may at one time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fall under the power of several. For, to illustrate this by an instance, there is no Law which directly and expresly, either enjoyns or forbids us to <hi>play at cards,</hi> or other <hi>pastime</hi>; but yet several Laws commanding or forbidding other things may be transgressed in our use of them. For even in a game at <hi>cards</hi> we may incur the sin of <hi>Covetousness,</hi> by our desire of money; the sin of <hi>Injustice,</hi> by our endeavours to cheat and cozen; and the sins of <hi>passionateness, impatience,</hi> and <hi>unpeaceableness,</hi>
                  <pb n="477" facs="tcp:66440:256"/>
by our repining at our ill luck, our quarrelling, and contending; and the like might be shewn in other cases.</p>
               <p>Now seeing several actions which in themselves are thus innocent, and under no Law; may yet, at one time or other, by reason of some thing concomitant, and annexed to them, be indirectly a transgression of a Law: here is still a further reason, why, when we know the general Law, we yet are ignorant of our present actions being forbid by it. For the Law doth not look upon it directly, but takes a compass before it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends it. They lie not in the same line, and so one may be particularly seen and considered of, and much more known and understood in the general, without seeing of the other.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In other actions, although we know the General Law which we sin against, yet we do not believe that our present action is included in it, or forbid by it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>another Law happens to clash with it in some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and seems to injoyn and justifie what we do, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that be transgressed by it.</hi> For it often happens in a Christians Life that two Laws interfere, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand differently in the same instance. Our Duty is at variance with it self, so that when we pursue obedience in one particular, another is disobeyed by us. How ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and usual is it for him who would avoid the <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> and <hi>impatience of discourse,</hi> to fall into a fault of the opposite extream, by <hi>fullenness</hi> and <hi>unsociable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roseness?</hi> What is more common than for men to be over-<hi>censorious</hi> and <hi>troublesomly rigid in conversation,</hi> who aim at nothing but to be <hi>severely virtuous,</hi> and <hi>piously austere?</hi> It is an obvious errour for any, whilst they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a <hi>charitable feasting,</hi> to run into some <hi>small intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance</hi>; for <hi>inoffensiveness</hi> and <hi>kind compliance,</hi> to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle out the due <hi>severities</hi> of <hi>reproof</hi>; for <hi>severity</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:66440:257"/>
into <hi>ungentleness,</hi> for <hi>affection</hi> to degenerate into <hi>fondness</hi>; and, which is the great instance of errour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this score, for our <hi>zeal</hi> for <hi>God</hi> to disturb the <hi>peace,</hi> and transgress the bounds of <hi>charity</hi> towards <hi>men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not mean such <hi>zeal</hi> as transgresses <hi>notorious</hi> and weighty <hi>Laws,</hi> for <hi>disputable,</hi> nay, even for <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>evident Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Opinions.</hi> A zeal that will stick at nothing, but bursts through all Gods Commands to propagate an Article, and ventures upon <hi>murders, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, lying, slander, wars, blood-shed,</hi> and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of a most notorious and damning disobedience in practice, to promote an Orthodox belief. For these are such instances of offence as no <hi>honest heart</hi> can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look; but if a man has not <hi>debauched his Conscience,</hi> they must needs appear to be of a <hi>frightful guilt,</hi> and of a <hi>damning nature.</hi> Any <hi>virtuous temper</hi> must abhor, and every <hi>good conscience</hi> utterly condemn them. So that no man of an hon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>st and obedient heart can ever hope to serve God by them, or think any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever of force enough to justifie the practice of them.</p>
               <p>But then there are other sins, which are of a <hi>smaller guilt,</hi> or of a <hi>more alterable nature,</hi> such as either are not <hi>greatly,</hi> or not <hi>alwayes evil</hi>; but only when they happen to have <hi>ill effects,</hi> or are in an <hi>exorbitant degree:</hi> and these an <hi>eager zeal</hi> doth many times drive men to, and they think all is obedience, even when they proceed so far in them as to disobey.

will end in an happy reward.

                  <p>The nature of Prejudice. It a cause of Ignorance of our Duty. The difference betwixt things being proposed to a free and empty, and to a prejudiced or prepossessed mind. An evident proposal sufficient to make a free mind understand its duty; but besides it, a confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its repugnant prejudice is necessary to a mind that is prepossessed. An account of several Opinions which
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:66440:258"/>
make men ignorant of several instances of Duty. One prejudice, that nothing is lawfull in Gods worship, but what is authorized by an express command, or example of Scripture; the acts of sin that are justified by this prejudice. Another, that all private men are publick protectors of Religion, and the Christian Faith; the acts of sin justified by this Opinion. Other Opinions cause a sinfull neglect of the Sacraments. These are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to some honest and obedient hearts. An account of other prejudices, as that Christ is a Temporal King; the acts of disobedience authorized by this Opinion. That a good end will justifie an evil action; the acts of sin upon this perswasion. That Dominion is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Grace; the disobedient acts avow'd by this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. These are more disobedient and damning. The case stated, what prejudices are consistent with, and what destroy salvation. Some prejudices get into mens minds, not through a disobedient heart, but through weakness of understanding, and fallibility of the means of knowledge. These are consistent with a state of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. An instance of this in the prejudice of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles about preaching of the Gospel to all Nations. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prejudices get into mens minds through damning lusts or sins. A brief account of the influence of mens lusts and vices upon their Opinions. This is illustrated in the Gnosticks. They were famous for covetousness, and worldly compliances; and for impure lusts, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in bodily pleasures. The effect of these in produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing agreeable Opinions. Another of their vices was a turbulent and seditious humour. Their Opinion was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable. A further illustration of it from the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees. An account of their vices, and the influence which they had in begetting vile perswasions. This influence of mens lusts upon their judgments proved from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. The damnableness of such prejudices as enter

this way. Certain marks whereby to judge when preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices proceed from unmortified lusts. As <hi>first,</hi> If the sin whereto the prejudice serves, is unmortified in them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> If it lye so near to the prejudice, that we could not but see that it ministred to it, when we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Though it lye more remote, if we still adhere to it when we plainly see that some unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable and notorious Laws are evacuated, or infringed by it. A Rule to prevent disobedient prejudices; <hi>viz.</hi> Let Laws be the Rule whereby to judge of truth in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, not opinions the Rule whereby to measure the Obligation of Laws. Some Reasons of this, <hi>viz.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Laws are more plain and certain, but opinions are more difficult and dubious: Obedience to Laws is the end of revealed truth, and so fit to measure it, not to be measured by it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>A Prejudice is a <hi>false Principle,</hi> or <hi>such a former false Judgment, whereby we afterwards examine and judge amiss in others.</hi> For all our rational judgment of things is by Principles, when we determine of the truth or falshood of such as are <hi>suspicious</hi> and <hi>doubtful,</hi> by their agreeableness or repugnance to such others as we think are <hi>true</hi> and <hi>certain.</hi> So that those opinions, which first take possession of our minds, are the <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Standards</hi> which all others, that seek to enter after, must be tryed by.</p>
               <p>And if these anticipations of Judgment are <hi>true</hi> and <hi>solid,</hi> if they are taken up upon good reason, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation; they are right <hi>Maxims of knowledg,</hi> and <hi>Principles of understanding.</hi> But if they are <hi>false</hi> and <hi>faulty,</hi> and entertain'd upon weak grounds, through haste and rashness; they are <hi>false Rules</hi> and <hi>Principles of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</hi> And because they <hi>hinder us in our after-judgments,</hi> making us judge amiss of things, as they needs must who
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:66440:259"/>
judge according to a false measure, they are called <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And these are a most <hi>general</hi> Cause of the errours and ignorances of men. For we are ignorant many times of our Duty, and mistake a sinful action for a lawful liberty, when no want of plainness in God's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, or in the nature of Vertues and Vices, nor any want of opportunity to be told of them; but some of these hindrances of our own minds are the causes of our ignorance. Those very Duties which are brought clear and open to our understandings, are sometimes either <hi>not at all,</hi> or very <hi>maimedly</hi> and <hi>imperfectly</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, because our minds are blocked up by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary belief, which makes us not to attend to them, but either wholly to overlook, or in great measure to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate and undermine them. Our prejudice has got pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of our souls, and suffers not even a plain and clear Duty to be entertained if it makes against it, but either throws it out all, or pares off so much of it as is inconsistent with it. For one errour begets another in <hi>practice,</hi> as well as in <hi>speculation</hi>; so that if we have an erroneous belief which contradicts our Duty; it is but rational that we should erroneously evacuate or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair our Duty likewise. So long therefore as the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice is entertained, if the Duty be never so plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, or loudly proposed to our minds, it must needs be excluded, or only so much of it gain our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and belief, as doth not thwart the prejudice, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with it.</p>
               <p>To understand this we are to take notice, that any Truths or Duties, which are proposed to our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, have a very different success when they are offered to a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>empty,</hi> from what they have when they are proposed to a <hi>prejudiced</hi> and <hi>prepossessed</hi> mind. For with the <hi>former</hi> any Duty is sufficiently qualified
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:66440:260"/>
to beget a right understanding and belief, if it be <hi>plainly and in clear words proposed to them</hi>; but with the <hi>latter</hi> a plain proposal is not enough, but besides that, there is need withal of a <hi>confutation of the erroneous prejudices which make against it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To a mind that is <hi>open</hi> and <hi>free,</hi> not incensed by any repugnant lust, nor misled by any contrary opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>nothing more is needful to make it understand and believe its Duty, than to have a revelation of it from God in plain words, and a clear and evident proposal.</hi> For such men are ready and willing, not only to hear and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what God says, but also to take his meaning from the obvious and simple sence of <hi>his own words,</hi> and not from any agreement with their own <hi>bye-inclinations</hi> and <hi>prepossessions.</hi> They are not biassed by any lust, or made a party by any opinions which should make them lean to one sence, but are unconcerned on one side or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: and therefore they have no temptation to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Gods Words and misinterpret them, and to make them speak, not what according to their usual and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen sence they should, but what to gratifie their private lusts or opinions they wish they might do. Their minds in themselves are free to any impression, and wait for the plain and simple meaning of such expressions as God shall use to determine them. So that he need do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to give them a right apprehension of his will, than to utter it in such <hi>plain,</hi> and <hi>intelligible words,</hi> as in their <hi>usual</hi> and <hi>obvious</hi> sence are expressive of it. A plain and clear proposal then of any Duty, is sufficient to make these ingenuously honest, and free minds to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it; and nothing is a greater Argument that the expressions wherein our Duty is revealed are <hi>ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous</hi> or <hi>obscure,</hi> and that the proposal is <hi>incompetent</hi>; than that these <hi>teachable</hi> minds, which have nothing but the <hi>inevidence of the revelation</hi> to misguide them, do not rightly conceive and apprehend it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="485" facs="tcp:66440:260"/>But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. To a mind that is <hi>prejudiced</hi> and <hi>prepossessed,</hi> and, through a love to some former opinions and anticipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Judgment which are inconsistent with it, <hi>unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> to understand and assent to it; a <hi>plain and evident proposal of any Duty is not enough: but besides it, there is need moreover of silencing those doubts, and confuting those opinions which make against it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To such minds, I say, a <hi>plain expression, and evident proposal of Gods will is not sufficient to make them believe, and rightly apprehend it.</hi> For their prejudice is a Bar a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, and makes them not to admit, but overlook the most natural and open sence even of plain and clear expressions; which they do, not because the words do not obviously express, but because their prejudicate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion cannot consist with it. For their own opinion they believe is true, and that in their own sence, which, what it is, they know most certainly. And whilst they do think this a truth, they cannot believe that to be a true, although never so plain and obvious a sence of any other words, which convinces it of falshood. So that in this Case of clashing and contradiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>prejudicate opinion,</hi> and a <hi>new proposal,</hi> so long as the prejudice is adhered to one, of these <hi>two</hi> things must of necessity be chosen; either for the sake of such contradiction to <hi>throw away the new proposal</hi>; or to <hi>mitigate it by some sence that is reconcileable to the prejudicate belief.</hi> And if the Proposer were any way of a <hi>suspected credit,</hi> and a person liable to errour and mistake; such interfering proposals would be rejected without more ado, and not admit of any long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. But if the person who brings them be of <hi>unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable credit,</hi> both for the untaintedness of his <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity</hi> which cannot deceive us, and also for the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his <hi>knowledg,</hi> whereby he is not subject to be
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:66440:261"/>
deceived himself; (as God is in all those truths which his Word declares, and in all those Duties which his Law enjoins us) then is there no way left, if we stick still to our opinion, but to seek out for some amicable and consistent interpretation of his words, whereby they may be made to comport with it. And here the <hi>natural defect of words,</hi> and the <hi>universal imperfection of all speech</hi> befriends us. For scarce any Sentence is so plain and full for one sense, but that through the <hi>witty arts</hi> of some, and the <hi>irregular</hi> and <hi>improper use</hi> of others, it may be shown capable to speak ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And that other sence we shall be sure to put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, although it be never so remote and foreign from that true and obvious interpretation wherein God meant it. Nay, if we cannot readily fix upon it any other than the plain sence, which clashes with our own opinion; and yet dare not suspect its truth in that sense, be it what it will, wherein God intended it: yet so long as we are true to our prejudicate Principle, we must suspect that it hath another, which although we cannot hit upon at present, yet <hi>others,</hi> or, at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time, it may be <hi>we our selves</hi> may. This, I say, we must do; because so long as we think our own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion true, we cannot judge another to be true too so far as it contradicts it; so that if for his sake who proposes it, we must esteem it to be true likewise; that cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be than by softening it into such a sence as our own opinion, whereby we judge of it, can consist with. As for such <hi>interfering Truths</hi> or <hi>Laws</hi> then, we shall not interpret them by the <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>obvious</hi> sence of those words which express them; but by the <hi>consistence of our own prejudicate belief,</hi> whereby we measure the sence and meaning of them.</p>
               <p>A plain expression then of any Law of God is not sufficient to make us rightly apprehend, nor a clear
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:66440:261"/>
proposal able of it self to make us understand it against a prejudice, which opposes the plain and true sence of it. Because our prejudice, so long as we adhere to it, will make us reject and overlook the <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>true</hi> meaning of the Law which opposes it, and take up with any other <hi>false</hi> or <hi>maimed</hi> sence, although it be never so <hi>remote, improper,</hi> or <hi>imperfect,</hi> which agrees with it.</p>
               <p>But that our Duty may be owned and understood in its true and full meaning, 'tis necessary not only that it be clearly proposed; but also that our <hi>own doubts be silenced,</hi> and our <hi>prejudicate principle confuted,</hi> which impairs and undermines it. The true and full meaning of the Duty will not enter into our minds, till the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saying prejudice is thrown out of them. For in all our judgments of things, this is the natural and necessary course which God himself has set us; <hi>viz. to put a sence, or to pass a sentence upon any thing that is proposed to us, according as we find it to clash or agree with such received opinions</hi> and standard-perswasions of our own minds <hi>whereby we judg of it.</hi> If they infer it, we approve; but if they overthrow it, we disbelieve it. For it is against the Laws of all <hi>reasoning,</hi> and the Rules of <hi>Argument</hi> and <hi>Discourse,</hi> to <hi>reject the plain and necessary consequence of an allowed Principle.</hi> So that till we renounce the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice which manifestly destroys a Law, we must needs evacuate, or in great part impair the Law which is opposed by it. But to make the Law be understood in its plain meaning, and believed in its full extent; 'tis necessary that the Principle be rejected which thwarts or excludes it. All our <hi>Arguments for it</hi> must be <hi>answered</hi> or <hi>overborn</hi>; and all our <hi>exceptions</hi> either against the <hi>truth,</hi> or <hi>fulness of our plain Duty,</hi> must be <hi>taken off</hi>; and our belief must be won to it by <hi>new light,</hi> and <hi>encrease of Argument.</hi> And to conquer all our back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness,
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:66440:262"/>
and silence all our doubts, we must be show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that God doth indeed intend his Law in that plain and full sence, which his own words obviously express, but our prejudice opposes, by the importunity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed use of a repeated proof and revelation.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>prejudices</hi> then, or anticipated opinions, which are looked upon as great Truths and Rules of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will in all likelihood make us ignorant of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Duties, or at least of several parts of Duty, which are plainly enough revealed. They will make us to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlook either some <hi>whole</hi> Laws, or a <hi>great part</hi> of the <hi>compass</hi> and <hi>extent</hi> of them, and to think several acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be exempt from them, which are really bound up by them. Which, I say, we shall do, because we shall not judge of our Duty from those <hi>plain words</hi> that express it, which is certainly the safest course whereby to have a full sense of it; but from our own <hi>foreconceived No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>Opinions,</hi> which oftentimes, and in several in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and degrees, if not altogether, <hi>evacuate</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair</hi> it.</p>
               <p>To help our apprehensions in this <hi>abstract</hi> Discourse, we will look a little into the <hi>practice of men</hi>; and that will shew us plainly how bad an influence prejudices have upon their minds, in making them ignorant, either of several <hi>Duties,</hi> or of the sinfulness of <hi>several actions</hi> which are restrained by them. For we shall find great numbers of men of all sorts to have taken up several false opinions, which are inconsistent with some Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and which make those Laws that they are against to have no <hi>force</hi> at all, or very little, upon their <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> nor any <hi>effect</hi> upon their <hi>practice.</hi> So that they misinterpret that to be no Duty which God has made one, and transgress <hi>boldly</hi> and <hi>securely,</hi> without <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>remorse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For some, out of a certain <hi>timerousness</hi> of mind, have
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:66440:262"/>
entertained a wrong belief, That <hi>nothing is lawful in God's Worship, but what either some authentick Example recorded in Scripture has approved, or some Command has made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</hi> So that when any <hi>Law of their Governours</hi> comes to enjoin any <hi>Circumstance</hi> or <hi>Ceremony</hi> in Gods service, which <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Scriptures</hi> had left <hi>indifferent,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though when once such Law has past, the plain and known Precepts of <hi>obedience</hi> to <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>submission</hi> to <hi>Governours,</hi> of <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>unity</hi> among <hi>Fellow Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> enjoyn it; they account the fulfilling of it to be no longer a matter of <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>Duty,</hi> but <hi>unlawful</hi> and a <hi>sin.</hi> For their mistaken Notion of <hi>things being made lawful only by some Example or Law that warrants them,</hi> and not on the contrary being <hi>lawful</hi> and at <hi>liberty antecedent to all Laws and Precedents, because no Law forbids them,</hi> is the Rule whereby they measure the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of all these Duties, and it plainly overthrows them. So that in a confident belief thereof they secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly transgress these Laws, and break the <hi>unity</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb the <hi>peace</hi> of men, thinking that they <hi>obey God</hi> in so doing.</p>
               <p>Others have given way to a false opinion, that <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is so much every mans care, as that not only Kings and Governours,</hi> whose <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> it is to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of the Faith, <hi>but also every private Christian should contrive and act for the publick maintenance and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.</hi> They are not content in securing it to keep within their <hi>own sphere,</hi> and to do what they are bound in Duty towards it as <hi>private Christians.</hi> That is, <hi>to pray to God earnestly and importunately, that he would preserve it</hi>; and to <hi>endeavour industriously in their own place after it,</hi> by <hi>their own lively and exemplary practice of it,</hi> by <hi>a careful instruction of other men in the reasons of it,</hi> by <hi>exhorting them to a close adherence to it,</hi> and by <hi>pressing upon them all the motives of Heaven and another
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:66440:263"/>
World to perswade them to a conscientious taking up the Cross, when it shall please God to lay it in their way, and a patient and couragious suffering for it.</hi> When God by his Providence brings a <hi>National Religion</hi> into danger, these are the Duties whereto he calls every <hi>private</hi> man, and it is his <hi>present honour,</hi> and shall be his <hi>immortal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness</hi> conscientiously to <hi>discharge</hi> it. And would they content themselves with this, all were well and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But when once they have imbibed this opinion, that they are not only <hi>private Promoters,</hi> but also <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Contrivers</hi> and <hi>Protectors of the Faith</hi>; they run beyond all these <hi>private means</hi> into a <hi>censuring</hi> of the <hi>administration of affairs,</hi> and the <hi>prudence of Governours,</hi> into endless <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>jealousies, murmurings</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,</hi> and other instances of <hi>pragmaticalness, irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> and <hi>contempt of higher Powers,</hi> and <hi>disturbance</hi> of the <hi>publick Peace.</hi> All these their Principle justifies, and therefore in assurance of it they boldly venture on them. So that although the Commands of <hi>studying to be quiet,</hi> and to <hi>do their own business,</hi> against a <hi>pragmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal medling</hi> in the <hi>affairs,</hi> and <hi>disturbing</hi> the <hi>quiet</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, are expressed in words most plain and easily intelligible; yet do they overlook them, and in all those instances wherein their prejudice leads them to transgress, quite evacuate all their plain force and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Obligation.</p>
               <p>Some for a long time neglect the dutiful use of one <hi>Sacrament,</hi> because they think that they have a pious reason against it; and many other <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing minds</hi> omit a dutiful <hi>participation of the other,</hi> as scarce ever thinking themselves to be sufficiently prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for it. Their false opinion carries them into their sinful neglect, and makes them disobey those Laws which require the use of them, by making them first to think that they would offend God if they should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="491" facs="tcp:66440:263"/>These breaches of Duty, and indulged acts of sin, <hi>well-meaning</hi> and <hi>honestly obedient minds</hi> are oft-times drawn into through erroneous conceits and prejudicate Opinions. For some men of <hi>honest hearts,</hi> and of <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble modest tempers,</hi> who are ready to comply in every thing wherein their consciences allow them, are insna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into them, and disobey only because they judge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to be unlawful. And that which makes them judge so, is not any lust or sin which is harboured and unmortified in their hearts, which should be ministred to by such erroneous judgment. But the Opinion took possession of their souls by the <hi>education of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> or by the <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>instruction of spiritual guides</hi>; they imbibed it at first in the simplicity of their souls, and since that have continually been used to it, and bred up in it. So that although they never serve that sin whereto it ministers in other instances, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes fear and conscientiously avoid it; yet where this prejudicate Opinion warrants it, they do.</p>
               <p>These Prejudices, I say, are not altogether inconsistent with an honest and obedient heart, but are <hi>sometimes</hi> entertained by <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>religious men,</hi> although <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others damnably disobey</hi> in them. But then there are many others which are of a more <hi>heinous,</hi> and <hi>damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature</hi>; which although some well-meaning men may <hi>pardonably</hi> admit at <hi>first,</hi> before they have seen the <hi>damnable consequences,</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> of them: yet very few can adhere to when <hi>they</hi> are set before them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being in danger, if repentance intervene not, to be <hi>damn'd</hi> for them. Of which sort, among several others, I take these to be that follow.</p>
               <p>Some are possessed with an odd belief, that <hi>Christ is a Temporal and Secular King in Sion,</hi> (i. e.) the Church on Earth, and <hi>that his subjects are to fight for his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests, and for the protection of his Religion, with the same
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:66440:264"/>
worldly force and armed violence that the subjects of other secular Princes use.</hi> And as for <hi>Earthly Kings,</hi> since they are but Deputies and Delegates of Christ the Supream King of all, that <hi>they are no further to be submitted to, than they act serviceably and subordinately under him</hi>; but that <hi>they may,</hi> yea, <hi>ought to be persecuted as Enemies and Apostates from King Jesus, if in any thing they oppose and act against him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now when men have once imbibed this Principle, they run on furiously, as every man must who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands it, into all the mischiefs of Rebellion and Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. For in all Instances where this prejudice leads them to it, they utterly overlook, as things not belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, all the plain Laws of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, Submission</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to <hi>Governours</hi>; of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> and <hi>Charitableness, Mercy</hi> and <hi>Peaceableness</hi> towards their <hi>Fellow-subjects:</hi> and burst out violently into <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Governours,</hi> and <hi>reproachfull usage,</hi> and <hi>speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil of Dignities,</hi> into <hi>revenge</hi> and <hi>fierceness, strife</hi> and <hi>bitterness, sedition</hi> and <hi>tumults, spoils</hi> and <hi>robberies, murders</hi> and <hi>bloodshed</hi>; and into all other <hi>licentious</hi> and <hi>extravagant</hi> effects of a most <hi>unjust war,</hi> and <hi>horrible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</hi> In all which they think that they only fight Gods battles, and spoil and slay his enemies, and, like good Subjects and Soldiers of the Lord of Hosts, with all their might maintain his Rights, and serve his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est. For all this rebellion against earthly Kings, they esteem to be nothing else but a proof of their Loyalty and just Allegiance to King Jesus the Soveraign Lord of all, who by these worldly means must Rule on Earth, although he dwells in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Others to exalt the Temporal Monarchy and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of <hi>Christs pretended Vicar</hi> here on Earth, have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed this Principle, that a <hi>good end will justifie any action, and that all is lawfull which is necessary and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:66440:264"/>
for the advancement of the Churches Interest.</hi> And having once sucked in this venemous Opinion, in all those actions wherein it is any wayes concerned, there is no Precept so plain which they cannot overlook, nor any obligation so sacred which they do not cancel. They stick not at the breach of all the most <hi>exalted</hi> and <hi>sublime Laws of Christ.</hi> For instead of being <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>gentle,</hi> they are <hi>fierce</hi> and <hi>furious</hi>; instead of being <hi>slow to wrath,</hi> they are <hi>enemies without provocation</hi>; instead of <hi>forgiving injuries,</hi> they are violent to <hi>revenge</hi> them; instead of <hi>doing good to enemies,</hi> they are <hi>eager to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy</hi> them; instead of <hi>taking up the Cross,</hi> and <hi>bearing</hi> it with <hi>patience themselves,</hi> they are utterly <hi>impatient</hi> till by any means they can <hi>force</hi> it upon <hi>others.</hi> Nay, they burst through the most <hi>notorious</hi> and <hi>weighty Laws</hi> of <hi>Humanity</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> in <hi>dissimulation</hi> and <hi>equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> in <hi>lies</hi> and <hi>perjuries,</hi> in <hi>sowing strife,</hi> and all manner of <hi>unpeaceableness,</hi> in <hi>spoils</hi> and <hi>robberies, murders</hi> and <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sassinations, treasons</hi> and <hi>rebellions,</hi> which even <hi>natural</hi> conscience, where it has any force at all, must needs tremble and be amazed at. But yet all this time they think that they are doing Gods work, whil'st indeed they are subverting his whole Religion; for their poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous Principle bears them out through all, and they are confident that what they do will be accepted for his service, because it is intended for the advancement of his <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some again of the more extravagant <hi>Anabaptists</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained a wild Opinion, that <hi>all Dominion is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Grace,</hi> and that <hi>nothing but virtue and holiness can give any man a title to his possessions.</hi> And when once they had believed this, they acted but agreeably to their own Principle in overlooking all the plain Laws of <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Honesty</hi> in all those instances where this Doctrine would warrant the contrary, and in exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:66440:265"/>
all sorts of <hi>fraud, couzenage, spoils</hi> and <hi>robberies,</hi> where they had <hi>power</hi> and <hi>opportunity</hi> to commit them. For <hi>their spoiling of their neighbours</hi> they esteemed to be like <hi>Israels spoiling of the Egyptians, (viz.)</hi> a taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that which belonged not to them, seeing God had given it away from them.</p>
               <p>It were endless to recount all the <hi>enormously wicked</hi> and <hi>disobedient Opinions,</hi> which ill men take up in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their beloved sins. For some overlook the plain duties of <hi>temperance, mortification,</hi> and <hi>self-denial,</hi> because they are <hi>sensual</hi> and <hi>fleshly:</hi> and others give no heed to the manifest duty of <hi>paying tythes,</hi> because they are <hi>loth to part</hi> with their <hi>money.</hi> When Christ preached up a <hi>charitable</hi> use of the <hi>unrighteous Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> the <hi>Pharisees, who were covetous,</hi> would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and understand, but <hi>derided him,</hi> Luk. 16.14. And the same way it fares with other duties, when mens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified lusts, which are struck at by them, are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed against them.</p>
               <p>By these instances, and many more which might be mention'd, it clearly appears how destructive many mens consciences or prejudicate Opinions are of several parts of Religion, and the Divine Laws. They do in great measure cancel the force of Duty, and make men transgress in several instances against known Laws, by making them first to believe that in those cases they do not oblige them.</p>
               <p>But now to determine which of these prejudices is <hi>pardonable</hi> and <hi>consistent with a justified state,</hi> and which <hi>destroys</hi> and <hi>interrupts</hi> it; we must observe in them this difference.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That <hi>some</hi> of them <hi>get into mens minds</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, not through any thing of an evil and disobedient heart, but only through weakness of understanding, or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of the means of knowledge</hi>; and these are <hi>consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:66440:265"/>
with a state of Grace</hi> and <hi>Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>others get into mens consciences through some damnable lusts and vices,</hi> and <hi>they are deadly and damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Some prejudices, which lead men into sin and disobedience, <hi>get into their consciences, not through any thing of an evil and disobedient heart, but only through weakness of understanding, and fallibility of the means of knowledge</hi>; and these do not <hi>destroy, but consist with a state of Grace and Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They get not into mens understandings by means of an <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>disobedient heart.</hi> For it is not any love which they have for the damning sins of <hi>pride, ambition, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality, covetousness, unpeaceableness, faction,</hi> or the like, which makes them willing to believe those Opinions true that are in favour of them. When they take up their prejudice, they do not see so far as these ill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, nor discern how any of these sins is served by it; and therefore they cannot be thought to admit it with this design to serve them in it. Nay further, what is the best sign of all, that lust or disobedience, which the prejudice happens to minister to in some instance, is <hi>mortified</hi> and <hi>subdued</hi> in them; and so cannot have any such influence upon them. For sometimes those very men, who, in such instances as their prejudice avows it, are <hi>irreverent</hi> and <hi>disrespectful, pragmatical</hi> and <hi>disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to their Governours,</hi> or the like; in all other cases, wherein their Opinion is unconcerned, are most <hi>respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, quiet,</hi> and <hi>obedient. Humility</hi> and <hi>modesty, peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>quietness, submission</hi> and <hi>obedience,</hi> are both their temper and their practice. For they love and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and in the ordinary course and constant tenour of their lives conscientiously observe them; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing under such prejudicate Opinion as makes them believe them to be unlawfull in some cases, could over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:66440:266"/>
that love and obedience which they have for them, and prevail upon them so far as to act against them. So that with these men it is not the disobedient temper of their hearts which makes their conscience err; but the errour and prejudice of their conscience which makes their practice disobedient.</p>
               <p>In such men therefore as are thus qualified, who do not see those sins which their prejudice ministers to when they admit it, and in all the other actions of their lives, except where by this prejudice they are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled, shew plainly that they have mortified and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it: 'tis clear, that the prejudice did not get into their consciences by any influence of an evil, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient heart.</p>
               <p>But that which made way for it was only their <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural weakness of understanding,</hi> or the <hi>fallibility of the means of knowledge.</hi> They are not of an understanding sufficient to examine things exactly when they embrace their prejudice; for their <hi>Reason</hi> then is <hi>dim</hi> and <hi>short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted, weak</hi> and <hi>unexperienced,</hi> unable throughly to <hi>search into the natures of things,</hi> and to <hi>judge of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious weight, and just force of reasons,</hi> to <hi>sift</hi> and <hi>ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sack, separate</hi> and <hi>distinguish</hi> between <hi>solidity</hi> and <hi>show, truth</hi> and <hi>falsehood.</hi> But those arguments whereupon they believe, and upon the credit whereof they take up Opinions, are <hi>education</hi> and <hi>converse,</hi> the <hi>instruction of spiritual guides,</hi> the <hi>short reasonings</hi> of their <hi>neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours</hi> and <hi>acquaintance,</hi> or the <hi>authority</hi> of such <hi>books</hi> or <hi>persons</hi> as they are ordered to <hi>read,</hi> and directed to submit to. <hi>These</hi> are the motives to their belief, and the arguments whereupon they are induced to think one Opinion right, and another wrong, and the only means which they have of discerning between truth and falsehood.</p>
               <p>But now all these means are in no wise <hi>certain</hi>; they
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:66440:266"/>
are an argument of belief indeed, and the best that such men have; but yet they are far from being <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly conclusive.</hi> Sometimes they lead men right, but at other times they lead them wrong; for they are not at all determined one way; but in <hi>several men,</hi> and at <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times,</hi> according as it happens, they minister both to truth and falsehood.</p>
               <p>In matters that are <hi>primarily of belief</hi> and <hi>speculation in Religion,</hi> they lead a <hi>hundred</hi> men to errour where they lead <hi>one</hi> to Truth. For there are an <hi>hundred</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions in the world whereof <hi>one</hi> alone is true; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one has this to plead in its own behalf, that it is the Religion of the Place and Party where it is believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Professors of it are drawn to assent to it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these Arguments, <hi>(viz.)</hi> because they have been <hi>Bred</hi> up to it by the care of their <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> and <hi>confirmed</hi> in it by long <hi>Vse</hi> and <hi>Converse:</hi> It was <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation</hi> and <hi>Custome,</hi> the <hi>Authority</hi> of their <hi>Spiritual Guides,</hi> and the <hi>common Perswasion</hi> of their <hi>Countrey</hi> which made them both at first to believe, and still to adhere to it. And every one in these points having these Arguments to plead for his own belief, against the belief of every other man who differs from him: since of all these different Beliefs one alone is true, these Arguments must be allow'd indeed to minister to Truth in that, but in all the rest to serve the Interest of Falsehood.</p>
               <p>In matters of <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> 'tis true, there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more <hi>accord</hi> and <hi>good agreement.</hi> For almost all the <hi>laws of nature,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> make up by far the greatest part of every <hi>Christians</hi> Duty, are the <hi>Catholick</hi> Religion of all <hi>sober Sects</hi> and <hi>Parties</hi> in the world. So that these Arguments of <hi>Custome</hi> and <hi>Education</hi> are tolerably good, and right guides to mens <hi>Consciences,</hi> how ill so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are to their speculative <hi>Opinions</hi>; because al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:66440:267"/>
they carry them into a <hi>wrong belief,</hi> yet will they lead them into a <hi>righteous practice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But although in these <hi>practical Notions</hi> and <hi>Opinions</hi> they are <hi>commonly</hi> a <hi>right</hi>; yet <hi>sometimes,</hi> and to seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral persons they prove a <hi>wrong instrument.</hi> For even in matters of <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> men are no more secure from <hi>errour</hi> than they are from <hi>disobedience</hi>; nor more certain that they shall have no mistakes about them, than that they shall not go beyond them. They have, and, till they come to Heaven, ever will have errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Opinions as well as practices; so that these motives, <hi>Education,</hi> and <hi>Custome,</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> will never be wanting in the world to instill into weak and undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning minds such Opinions, as will, in some instances and degrees, evacuate, and undermine some duties.</p>
               <p>And since there will never be wanting in the world such fallible Arguments and means of knowing, nor such weak and unexperienced understandings as must of necessity make use of them: 'tis plain, that several disobedient prejudices will in all times get into mens minds, not through any wickedness or disobedience of their hearts, but only through the natural weakness of their minds, and the fallibility of the means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>And when any prejudices which lead to disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence enter this way, they do not <hi>put us out of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi> or <hi>destroy a state of Grace</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi>; but <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist</hi> with it. For in our whole action of disobedience upon them there is nothing that should provoke Gods wrath, and punitive displeasure against us. He will not be at <hi>enmity</hi> with us, either <hi>for acting according to our erroneous Conscience</hi>; or, if the errour was thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, <hi>for having an erroneous conscience for our rule of action.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He will <hi>not be offended at us,</hi> I say, for <hi>acting accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:66440:267"/>
to our erroneous conscience:</hi> for whether our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be true or false, it is the only rule that we can act by. We cannot perform duty without we understand it, nor obey Laws before we have some knowledge of them: we must judge what is commanded before we can observe it, and whether we judge right or wrong, we have no way to obey, but by acting according to such judgment. Yea, if our Conscience does err, and innocently mistake our Duty, yet whil'st we follow it in the simplicity of our hearts, we perform the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>soul of Obedience,</hi> even when we erroneously transgress it. For we do the mistaken action out of an <hi>obedient intention,</hi> we exert it <hi>for Gods sake,</hi> in an <hi>acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Authority,</hi> and a <hi>resignation to his pleasure</hi>; and this is so truly the life and spirit of an <hi>acceptable obedience,</hi> that, in case of such erroneous belief, we should <hi>sinfully</hi> and <hi>damnably disobey</hi> should we neglect it. So that if the errour of our conscience it self be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offensive, God will not take offence at our well meant, and obediently design'd performance of that, which our conscience erroneously tells us we are bound in duty to perform.</p>
               <p>Nor will God be <hi>offended at us for having such a scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> or rock of offence, as this prejudice and errour of our conscience is, if the <hi>errour it self is thus innocent.</hi> He will not take it ill that we did not judge that to be our Duty, which the Principle we had to judge by told us was no Duty, or it may be a breach of Duty and a sin. For this was truly to judge by Principles, and to have recourse in judgement to the best and likeliest no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which we could find in our own minds; which way of passing judgment is all that we have, and the very method which he himself has prescribed us. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will he be angry at us for <hi>admitting such false Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> into our minds as should afterwards <hi>misguide</hi> us,
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:66440:268"/>
if it were not our <hi>sins</hi> and <hi>passions,</hi> but the <hi>ordinary way,</hi> and <hi>usual means of knowledge</hi> which got them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. For when the very same means of informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and discourse, which carry us on to truth in other opinions, mislead us into errour and mistake in these; we erre in the honesty of our hearts, and in the use of means and ordinary endeavours; so that nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for our errour to be charged upon, but either a <hi>weakness of understanding,</hi> or an <hi>ill fortune:</hi> either that using fallible means, we were not so wise as to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void being deceived by them; or that we had the ill hap to be guided by them in such an instance, when errour lay at the end of them. And since these Causes of errour are only our weakness and unhappiness, but not our fault and disobedience; God will graciously bear with us, and will not be extream to punish us for them. Or if we happen to erre in an instance wherein he will exact obedience, he will at least bear with us so long, till besides the <hi>plain declarations</hi> of our Duty, and the <hi>common means</hi> of knowing it, we have had moreover such accumulation of proof and clearing of the Case, as will, if we are not wanting to our selves, answer all our exceptions, and bear down all our preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices against it.</p>
               <p>And of this we have a clear instance in the errour of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> about the discharge of that great Duty of <hi>preaching the Gospel to all Nations immediately after Christ's ascension.</hi> He had enjoined this in a Command as plain, one would think, as words can make it. <hi>All power is given unto me in Heaven and in Earth; Go ye therefore, and teach,</hi> not the Jews only, to whom I sent you at first, but <hi>all Nations,</hi> Matth. 28.18, 19; preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>remission of sins upon repentance to all Nations begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at Jerusalem,</hi> Luke 24.47. But for all this Precept was so express, and this Declaration of their Duty was
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:66440:268"/>
so plain and evident; yet was it not of it self sufficient to give them an understanding of it. For those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessions which they lay under drew such a Veil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes, and linked their minds so fast to a contrary belief, that they took no notice of it, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought their contrary practice to be forbid by it. They thought still that <hi>Israel was Gods peculiar people,</hi> that <hi>the Jews were the only seed of Abraham,</hi> and that <hi>the great Prophet Messiah, whom</hi> Moses <hi>told them God would one Day raise up among them, for eminence and extraordinariness of Divine Commission, like unto him, was to be theirs peculiarly to whom God had promised him.</hi> These prejudices, and anticipations of Judgment, had been instilled into their young and tender minds by the early <hi>care</hi> of their <hi>Parents,</hi> and fomented by the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction</hi> of their <hi>Teachers,</hi> and daily more and more confirmed in them by <hi>conversation,</hi> and an <hi>uninterrupted custom of perswasion.</hi> And being thus forcibly impressed upon them, they had so blocked up their obedient and well-meaning minds, that when a plain Command re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired them to practise contrary to this belief, they did not understand, but overlook it. Insomuch that <hi>Peter</hi> himself was not convinced of it by the manifest injunction of a clear Law; but stood in need to have his <hi>doubts solved,</hi> and his <hi>exceptions answered,</hi> and his former prejudices confuted and overborn, by such accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation of proof and evidence, as God was pleased to give him, in a most condescensive Dispute upon that Subject, by an <hi>after</hi> and <hi>repeated</hi> Revelation, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. and 11. Chap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ers.</p>
               <p>But now this ignorance of their Duty, which was so plainly delivered in the words of a clear Law, did not put them out of Gods favour, because it was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned only by such hindrances as were consistent with an honest heart, or such whereto not their <hi>sins</hi> and <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi>
                  <pb n="502" facs="tcp:66440:269"/>
but their <hi>natural weakness of understanding,</hi> and their <hi>education</hi> and <hi>custom,</hi> those <hi>fallible means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> had betrayed them. For God still lovingly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced them; he bore with their weaknesses, and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped their infirmities; he pitied their ignorance whilst they laboured under it, and because he saw it was fit and necessary that they should get quit of it, he graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously afforded them a further, and more powerful evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence whereby to overcome it. And all this pardon and forbearance, I say, they found, because their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices were consistent with an honest heart, since they were begot in them, not by any lusts or vices, but only by their weakness of understanding, and the fallibility of the means of knowledge.</p>
               <p>But as some prejudices which lead to sin and disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, get into mens Consciences only through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of understanding, and fallibility of means, which are therefore consistent with a state of favour and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; so are there,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Several others which are got into their Conscences, through the assistance of their lusts and vices</hi>; and these are <hi>deadly</hi> and <hi>damning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mens lusts and vices have a great influence upon their minds, and the chief hand many times in molding of their judgments and opinions. And therefore we may know mens <hi>manners</hi> by their <hi>perswasions about their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> before ever we see their <hi>practices.</hi> For they who will live wickedly, will quickly bring their minds to think wickedly. Their lusts and vices will soon insinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into their judgments and apprehensions: they will dispose their souls for such perswasions, as are most serviceable to them; and win them with ease into a <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> of evil things, by making them <hi>willing</hi> first, and <hi>eagerly desirous to believe</hi> them.</p>
               <p>For our <hi>belief</hi> of any opinion is produced in us by
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:66440:269"/>
our <hi>diligent search</hi> and <hi>consideration of all such Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as can get credit to it</hi>; by <hi>overlooking</hi> or <hi>clearing such difficulties,</hi> or <hi>industriously considering</hi> and <hi>improving all the answers to such exceptions as are made against it.</hi> As on the contrary, our <hi>disbelief</hi> of any opinion is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, by <hi>overlooking</hi> or <hi>weakening all those reasons which are brought to prove it,</hi> by <hi>darkening it with difficulties, perplexing it with doubts,</hi> and raising such <hi>exceptions</hi> as may shake or overthrow it. But now as for the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our wit and industry in either of these, it is plainly in our own <hi>choice,</hi> and we deal <hi>indifferently</hi> and <hi>impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially</hi> between both, or espouse either <hi>part</hi> as we stand affected. If then we are <hi>earnestly desirous,</hi> and strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enclined for <hi>one way</hi>; we can <hi>overlook</hi> or <hi>answer all that makes against it,</hi> and <hi>throw by difficulties, clear up doubts, invent reasons to justifie</hi> and <hi>prove it.</hi> So that the will and pleasure of our hearts will quickly draw after it the judgment of our understandings, and if once we are resolved upon a way, we shall soon find reasons to avow it.</p>
               <p>When therefore our lusts and vices have got our hearts, and give Laws to our wills and appetites; they will quickly bear Rule in our understandings also. We shall quickly believe that any of their gratifications are lawful, when once we are greatly desirous to have them so. Nothing being a more probable, and ordinary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the <hi>nature of things,</hi> as well as in the just <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God,</hi> of a <hi>disobedient</hi> and <hi>rebellious heart,</hi> than a <hi>reprobate mind,</hi> or a mind <note n="a" place="margin">

               <p>That execrable Sect of men the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> who were so famous for their <hi>impure</hi> and <hi>lawless consciences,</hi> were not more notorious for their <hi>vile opinions,</hi> than for their <hi>evil lives.</hi> I will consider both, that it may from thence more clearly appear how influential their lusts were upon their minds, in begetting suitable perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

               </p>
               <p>They were notoriously infamous for their <hi>covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and abominably <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>irreligious compliances.</hi> For they are described as men that <hi>have their hearts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised with covetous practices,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14; that <hi>do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

               <p>Another instance of their behaviour we have set down in relation to the <hi>Publick</hi>; and that is this, They were of a <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>ungovernable,</hi> of a <hi>haughty</hi> and <hi>turbulent,</hi> a <hi>querulous</hi> and <hi>seditious</hi> humour.

               <p>The wicked Sect of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who were the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach</hi> of the <hi>Jewish,</hi> as these <hi>filthy Gnosticks</hi> were of the <hi>Christian</hi> Name, were of a <hi>life</hi> and <hi>temper proud</hi> and <hi>ambitious, covetous</hi> and <hi>rapacious</hi>; whose <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,</hi> as well as their <hi>life</hi> and <hi>practice,</hi> was all <hi>rottenness</hi> and <hi>disobedience.</hi> For if we would have a character of them, our Saviour himself has given us one in the 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Gospel, which is most <hi>compleat</hi> and <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi>; wherein a combination of these several vices are set to make up their description.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Vain-glory. All their works they did to be seen of men,</hi> vers. 5.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Ambition. They loved the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, and greetings in the</hi> publick <hi>markets, and to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of men Rabbi, Rabbi,</hi> that is to say Master, or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, <hi>vers.</hi> 6, 7.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Covetousness, Fraud</hi> and <hi>Rapaciousness.</hi> For besides that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Luke</hi> informs us of their being <hi>covetous, Luk.</hi> 16.14; we are told here, that they would most prophanely abuse the most <hi>sacred</hi> things for their <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous</hi> ends, and <hi>make long prayers</hi> only <hi>for a pretence,</hi> that thereby they might be enabled more easily, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out suspicion <hi>to devour</hi> even Orphans, and <hi>Widows houses,</hi> vers. 14: being indeed, whatsoever they might outwardly appear to be, <hi>all extortion and excess within,</hi> vers. 25.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Hypocrisie.</hi> For they would <hi>dissemble</hi> even
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:66440:272"/>
in their most <hi>solemn performances,</hi> and use Religion on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a stalking-horse to worldly designs. They <hi>made long prayers</hi> only <hi>for a pretence,</hi> vers. 14; what they <hi>made clean was only the outside,</hi> vers. 25; for that indeed they beautified, but still they were <hi>all stench and rottenness within,</hi> vers. 27.</p>
               <p>In summ, they <hi>said,</hi> but <hi>did not</hi>; they <hi>bound heavy burdens on other mens shoulders, but would not touch them themselves with one of their fingers,</hi> vers. 3, 4. Yea, take them, even at the best, where they were Religious; and that they will be found to have been only in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, but not in substantial Duties; for <hi>they strained at gnats,</hi> at the same time that they <hi>swallow'd Camels; they paid tythe of</hi> cheap and inconsiderable things, such as <hi>mint, and annise, and cummin</hi>; but <hi>they omitted all the weightier matters of the Law, as Judgment, Mercy, and Faith,</hi> vers. 23, 24.</p>
               <p>And since they were men of this character, thus <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified</hi> in their <hi>lusts,</hi> and thus <hi>vicious</hi> and <hi>irreligious</hi> in their <hi>practice</hi>; what can in reason be expected, but that they should be full of debauchery and disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in their <hi>consciences</hi> and <hi>perswasions</hi> also? And so accordingly we find they were. For when Christ preached to them the Doctrine of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> in opposition to their <hi>miserable worldly</hi> way; they, <hi>being covetous,</hi> instead of believing, fell a mocking and <hi>deriding him,</hi> Luk. 16.14. And as they treated Christ in this particular, so did they likewise in all the rest of his Religion. For finding that it required such <hi>humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, sincerity, honesty, contentedness,</hi> and <hi>heavenly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> as were inconsistent with these <hi>unmortified lusts</hi> of theirs which I have mention'd; they would not <hi>own</hi> and <hi>embrace,</hi> but for that reason especially <hi>reject</hi> and <hi>disbelieve</hi> it. Nay further, even in their <hi>own</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged way they took up several disobedient preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:66440:273"/>
to serve their lusts; and either wholly evacuated, or in great part impair'd several Laws, by admitting such erroneous perswasions as undermined them. For to gratifie their <hi>haughty</hi> and <hi>stubborn,</hi> their <hi>petted</hi> and <hi>revengeful</hi> humour, they entertain'd a conceit, that <hi>if they</hi> did but <hi>say it is Corban,</hi> or <hi>a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; (i. e.)</hi> I bind my self by the vow or oath call'd <hi>Corban</hi> never more to do any good to thee, which was a form of oath in use among the Jews; they should be freed from all obligation of the <hi>fifth Commandment</hi> requiring <hi>honour, service,</hi> or <hi>relief to their Father or Mother,</hi> Mat. 15.4, 5, 6. And <hi>many other things like to this</hi> our Saviour tells us <hi>they did,</hi> Mark 7.13. But not to enquire further about <hi>particulars,</hi> we are plainly assured of them in the <hi>general,</hi> that they <hi>transgressed, rejected,</hi> and <hi>evacuated the Laws of God, through</hi> the erroneous perswasions and prejudicate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of <hi>their traditions,</hi> Mat. 15.3, 6. Mark 7.9.</p>
               <p>Thus natural and obvious it is for a <hi>wicked life</hi> to work a <hi>disobedient belief</hi>; and for mens <hi>unmortified lusts</hi> and <hi>passions,</hi> which set themselves against Gods Laws, to convey such <hi>prejudices</hi> into their consciences as will <hi>evacuate</hi> and <hi>overthrow</hi> them. Their <hi>unbelief</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters through the <hi>corruption</hi> of their <hi>heart,</hi> and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called an <hi>evil heart of unbelief,</hi> Heb. 3.12. they <hi>are hardened</hi> into a want of all sense and conscience of their offences, <hi>through the deceitfulness of sin,</hi> vers. 13. And this effect is obvious and ordinary; for not only the <hi>nature of things,</hi> but even the just <hi>judgement of God</hi> concur to it: Nothing being more common, than for <hi>those men, who hold the truth,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> sayes, <hi>in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness</hi> of living, <hi>and</hi> even <hi>whil'st they know God, do not glorifie him</hi> by their service and obedience, which are due to him, and are our way of glorifying him <hi>as God, nor are thankfull</hi> in their hearts and actions; to
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:66440:273"/>
lose that knowledge, and <hi>to become vain in their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, their foolish heart being darkned,</hi> by <hi>Gods giving them over to a reprobate mind,</hi> or a mind void of all true judgment, <hi>to do those things which are not convenient</hi> not knowing they are so, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18, 21, 28.</p>
               <p>But now as for <hi>these prejudices</hi> which get into our <hi>consciences</hi> and <hi>perswasions,</hi> not through any <hi>force of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> which <hi>compells,</hi> but through the <hi>witchcraft</hi> of <hi>lusts</hi> and <hi>vices</hi> which <hi>enveagle,</hi> and make us <hi>willing</hi> and <hi>desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> to believe them; they will <hi>not excuse</hi> us, because they are themselves <hi>sinfull,</hi> and <hi>deserve damnation.</hi> For they enter at an ill door, and win upon us through a reigning lust, or a damning sin; and therefore they are so far from excusing those transgressions which flow from them, that in themselves they are instances and effects of a deadly offence, and if repentance intervene not, will certainly prove desperate and damning.</p>
               <p>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>breathing out threatnings</hi> against all belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and in <hi>persecuting of the Church,</hi> acted only accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the best of his own <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Opinion.</hi> For he verily thought with himself, that he not only <hi>might,</hi> but <hi>ought to do several things contrary to the Name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus of Nazareth,</hi> Acts 26.9. But as this Opinion was his sin, so would his transgressions upon it have proved his condemnation, had not God shewn pity on him in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him to <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>conversion,</hi> whereby alone it was that he obtained <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>pardon. I was,</hi> sayes he, <hi>a persecutor, and injurious; but I obtained mercy by that Grace of God</hi> conferr'd upon me at my conversion, <hi>which was exceeding abundant with</hi> these two fundamental Graces, which are a most prolifick spring of all the rest, <hi>(viz.) Faith, and Love, which is in Jesus Christ,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.13, 14.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> who <hi>blasphemed</hi> and <hi>crucified our Saviour,</hi> did nothing against their own conscience: for their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:66440:274"/>
bore them out in all that practice, in regard they judged it to be no <hi>sinfull murther,</hi> but a most <hi>necessary act of Justice upon a great impostor,</hi> and a most <hi>laudable</hi> and <hi>legal execution. I wot Brethren,</hi> sayes S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter, that through ignorance ye did it, as did</hi> not you only, but <hi>also your rulers,</hi> Acts 3.14, 15, 17. But forasmuch as this Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance was their own fault, and their prejudices were owing to their own vices, in regard that for this reason alone their minds would not receive a true belief of Christ and his Laws, because they plainly contradicted their sinfull lusts and practices: therefore should it by no means excuse them, but, if their repentance did not prevent it, it would most certainly in the end prove deadly and damning. For their <hi>crucifixion of him,</hi> he tells them, was by <hi>wicked hands,</hi> Acts 2.23. and it was only upon <hi>their repentance,</hi> and <hi>conversion, that their sins</hi> of blasphemy and murder <hi>should be blotted out,</hi> Acts 3.19.</p>
               <p>Again, the transgressions of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> were justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by their own Opinions; for they looked upon themselves, notwithstanding them, to be <hi>holy men,</hi> and <hi>favourites of Heaven:</hi> But proceeding, as we have seen they did, from unmortified lusts and a wicked life, they rendred them obnoxious to damnation; <hi>How can you escape the damnation of hell?</hi> Mat. 23.33. The sins of the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> notwithstanding they were warranted by their disobedient Principles, were of a damnable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for their <hi>heresies</hi> and <hi>disobedient Principles</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, being the effects of disobedient and wicked hearts, <hi>deserved damnation,</hi> and are called by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> in that <hi>Chapter</hi> where he recounts them, and with great zeal inveighs against them, <hi>damnable heresies,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.1. They are <hi>works of the flesh,</hi> or the products of unmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified lusts and carnal practices; and must therefore share in the same judgment with other flesh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> works
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:66440:274"/>
amongst whom they are reckon'd. <hi>The works of the flesh,</hi> sayes S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, are manifest, seditions, heresies, envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, murders, drunkenness; of the which I tell you, that they which do such things shall not inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> Gal. 5.19, 20, 21. If we will transgress our Duty by disbelieving it first, and giving credit to such Opinions as destroy the obligation of it; our disbelief of our Duty will by no means excuse our sin, or rescue us from condemnation. For to disbelieve the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>threatnings of Christ</hi> is the very worst part of <hi>unbelief,</hi> and the most hatefull and deadly instance of <hi>infidelity.</hi> And as for <hi>unbelievers,</hi> sayes S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John,</hi> or those men who will not believe <hi>Religion,</hi> or the best part of it, <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Duties,</hi> but seek to evade its force after that God has plainly told them of it; <hi>they shall have their part in the Lake which burns with fire and brimstone,</hi> Rev. 21.8. Men <hi>without understanding,</hi> who will not see their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, because they are <note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 1.21, 28.</note> blinded by such lusts as fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, in <hi>the judgment of God are</hi> 
                  <note n="p" place="margin">Mat. 15.14.</note> 
                  <hi>worthy of death,</hi> Rom. 1.31, 32. The reason why their consciences ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to such Opinions as utterly destroy their Duty, is only because their lusts and vices have made them <hi>hate,</hi> and <hi>turn away</hi> from it: And as for every such preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice against a Duty, as proceeds from our <hi>aversation</hi> to it, it is of a great guilt, and liable to a very severe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. For in this S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> is peremptory; <hi>All they shall be damned who believe a lye, and believe not the truth, through the pleasure which they take in unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: They shall perish, because they receive not the LOVE of the Truth, that they may be saved by it,</hi> 2 Thess. 2.10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>When our disobedient prejudices therefore enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this score, and are begot in us through a wicked heart, and through some reigning lusts and vices which are served by them; but not by any weakness of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:66440:275"/>
or such fallibility of means as may betray even an honest heart into them: they are subject to a sad doom, and a severe censure; they will by no means plead our excuse, but are an Article of our condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>And as for some marks whereby to judge whether our disobedient prejudices proceed from this deadly Principle, <hi>our unmortified lusts</hi> and <hi>vices,</hi> and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are of this <hi>dangerous</hi> and <hi>damning nature,</hi> or no; we may observe these <hi>Characters,</hi> and judge according to <hi>these measures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> If that <hi>Lust</hi> or <hi>Sin</hi> whereto our prejudice is subservient be <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>powerfull, if it reign in us, and in the ordinary course and custome of our lives gives laws to us:</hi> the <hi>corruption</hi> and <hi>disobedience of our heart</hi> is plainly the cause of our <hi>disobedient conscience</hi> and <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt perswasion.</hi> It is not only the errour of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science which makes us serve the sin, for we serve it equally in other instances where that is wholly uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. The Sin is unmortified and imperious, it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries us on to transgress where it is further'd by the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of our consciences, and where it wants it. But it is the wickedness of our hearts which makes us to be wicked in our judgments, and to espouse such Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as encourage and defend it. For when any lust is so strong in us as to rule our practice, it will be sure to lay a corrupt byass upon our wills, so that we shall be apt still to judge in favour of it, and be very partial in all those Opinions wherein it has any interest. And therefore several disobedient prejudices will be taken up to serve a turn, and we shall work our selves up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a belief of them for the sins sake, which is justified and protected by them.</p>
               <p>Is any man therefore of a temper and conversation that is <hi>fierce</hi> and <hi>contentious, busie</hi> and <hi>restless, forward
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:66440:275"/>
to give Laws,</hi> and <hi>impatient to submit to them:</hi> 'Tis no wonder if he takes up Opinions that justifie <hi>contempt of Governours,</hi> that avow <hi>Alteration</hi> and <hi>Disturbance,</hi> and countenance <hi>Faction, Sedition,</hi> and a <hi>Civil War.</hi> For the ungovernableness of his Conscience is but agreeable to the ungovernableness of his Practice; the Sin reign'd first in his heart and life, and was from thence with ease instill'd into his Opinion and Perswasion.</p>
               <p>Is any man habitually inclined to <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Wrath</hi> and <hi>Malice, Revenge</hi> and <hi>Cruelty</hi>; is he <hi>gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Gain,</hi> and a <hi>slave</hi> to <hi>sensual Delights</hi> and <hi>bodily Pleasures:</hi> He is prepared for any of those <hi>Vile Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> which overturn all Laws to promote <hi>Christs Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Power</hi> on Earth, or to advance the <hi>secular</hi> great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his <hi>pretended Vicar</hi> and <hi>Holy Church</hi>; and for any others of like nature. For the unmortified lusts are a Law to him in his life before they come to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern in his conscience; he is first wicked and rebellious in his heart, and that makes him to admit of such wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Opinions into his understanding.</p>
               <p>In these men then the case is plain; it is clearly seen how they came by their disobedient prejudices, for their lives and conversations show that abundantly. Disobedience reign'd first in their hearts, and thence got into their consciences and perswasions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the <hi>disobedience and the prejudice lay so near,</hi> and <hi>were so close conjoyn'd, that a man could not but see one when he saw the other; it is still imputable to his wicked lusts and vices.</hi> For he discerned how obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was impair'd, and how the Sin was served by it when he first gave credit to it; and therefore he was plainly acted by a want of virtue and an evil heart. For if he had been touched with any love of virtue, he could not have allowed of that which he knew would evacuate and undermine it; but he would have shewn
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:66440:276"/>
much more forwardness to reject the Opinion for the sake of the sin, than to embrace it upon any appearances of argument and reason. So that his prejudice enter'd through an aversation to that instance of obedience which it undermined; and it was his love to the wicked lust which was advanced by it, that made way for it. He willingly and designedly served the sin, and he saw how much the Opinion contributed to it, and therefore he readily embraced it.</p>
               <p>Nay further,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If the sinfull consequences were <hi>not</hi> discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when a man at first embraced it; yet <hi>if they are such as are of a plain unquestionable guilt,</hi> and <hi>greatly sinfull,</hi> and <hi>when he is shewed afterwards how they follow from it, he still stands by it and adheres to it</hi>; however the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicate Opinion might enter at the first,</hi> yet it <hi>holds pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session by a heart that is wicked and disobedient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some sins there are whose <hi>guilt</hi> is not altogether so <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>indisputable,</hi> but that an <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>honest,</hi> although a <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>erring</hi> mind, may sometimes que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion and overlook it. And thus many truly religious souls do not think that their <hi>refusing to observe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of men about the ceremonies of divine worship, is disobedience</hi>; or that their <hi>over-acting in the cause of God and Religion, is pragmaticalness.</hi> For these sins, among several others, although they are plain and obvious to an <hi>unprejudiced</hi> and <hi>piercing understanding,</hi> which is able to discern the grounds and reasons of things, and fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to consider of them: Yet to such minds as have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len unhappily under some mistaken notions and false prepossessions, they are not evident; whence many men that have honest and obedient hearts, do yet err, and judge amiss concerning them. But then several other sins are so <hi>open</hi> and <hi>notorious,</hi> that no <hi>sober mind,</hi> and <hi>virtuous inclination</hi> can ever have any <hi>doubts</hi> about them.
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:66440:276"/>
Thus, for instance, no honest man who is willing fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and seriously to consider things, can ever question, I think, that <hi>killing without Commission from Authority, and due process of Law, is Murther</hi>; that <hi>spoils without judicial course, are robbery</hi>; that <hi>appearing in Arms against the supreme Sovereign Power, or men commissioned by him, is Rebellion</hi>; that <hi>intoxicating use of Wine, is Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>; and a <hi>promiscuous use of Women, Adultery or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</hi> These sins, and many others, are of so open and notorious a nature, that no man of an ordinary wit, if he has any competent degrees of honesty, can ever apprehend them to be other than damnably sinful. And if any man has any opinions which in any cases justifie some of these, if he continues to hold them still after he sees how these sins follow from them, which he must needs do when he practises and incurrs them, because the opinions lead him on to them; 'tis plain that his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion holds possession of his mind, because his heart is wicked: <hi>simplicity</hi> and <hi>ignorance</hi> it may be gave it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance; but <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>disobedience</hi> enable it to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere.</p>
               <p>If the man indeed was only <hi>simple</hi> and <hi>short-sighted, rash</hi> and <hi>forward</hi> at the <hi>first,</hi> and either had not <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> or <hi>patience</hi> enough to look on so far as the sinful consequences when he gave it entrance; his lusts and vices at that time could have no share in it, because he did not see how they could be served by it; and so far the simplicity of a well-m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aning mind, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient temper of an honest heart and a good intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may plead his excuse for his otherwise wicked and disobedient perswasion. But if afterwards he <hi>persists</hi> in it, when he <hi>sees</hi> all the <hi>iniquity</hi> and <hi>disobedience</hi> that flows from it, and goes on to cancel and transgress <hi>noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> and <hi>weighty Laws</hi> upon the assurance of it: 'tis manifest then that his <hi>heart is wicked,</hi> and that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:66440:277"/>
more by a <hi>reigning sin,</hi> than by a <hi>cogent reason.</hi> For if his heart were acted by a full resolution of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and a love of Vertue, he would quickly renounce such opinions when once he saw such notorious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable Laws to be overturned by them. But since he will stick to his wicked Principle, even when it destroys obedience, and prefer a disputable opinion before a weighty and plain Duty; 'tis plain to all, that he is not willing to obey, but industrious to seek a shift, and to evade all obligation to obedience.</p>
               <p>As for this enquiry then, <hi>viz.</hi> When our <hi>disobedient prejudices get into our consciences by the help of our own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified lusts and damning vices:</hi> from these measures we may make our own souls this Answer: If we are <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually,</hi> and <hi>in the common course of our lives, guided by that lust or vice which our prejudice advances</hi>; if <hi>we saw the disobedient effects of it when we first gave credit to it</hi>; or if <hi>we still adhere to it after that we have been plainly showed the unquestionable and notorious sins which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouched by it:</hi> Our prejudice took place by virtue of our disobedience, and without our timely repentance it will certainly condemn us. If it entred <hi>innocently</hi> and <hi>honestly</hi> through the <hi>weakness of our understandings,</hi> or the <hi>fallibility of the means of knowledge,</hi> it would be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and not imputed to us: but since it gains ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance by our love to damning lusts and disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, it is of a deadly guilt, and, unless repentance intervene, will certainly destroy us.</p>
               <p>And thus at last we have seen what ignorance is effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our prejudices; and what is to be judged of those transgressions which are incurred under it. And the summ of all is this, That our prejudices make us either <hi>quite overlook several Laws,</hi> or <hi>even whilst we know and consider of them,</hi> to <hi>venture upon several diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient actions which really come under them, not knowing
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:66440:277"/>
that they do.</hi> And if such prejudices entred through the <hi>fallibility of means,</hi> and <hi>weakness of an honest under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi> they are <hi>pardonable</hi> and <hi>uncondemning:</hi> but if they took place by means of <hi>strong lusts,</hi> and a <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heart,</hi> they are <hi>deadly sins,</hi> and fit to be charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, as all others are, without <hi>repentance,</hi> to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
               <p>But seeing it is much <hi>safer,</hi> and infinitely more eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to have no disobedient prejudice at all, than to be put into all this danger about the pardon and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it; before I dismiss this Point, I will set down one <hi>plain Rule</hi> and easie Method, in matters of <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>moment,</hi> to prevent it. For by this means we may all of us attain, in good measure, to that which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> assures us was his utmost care and industrious <hi>exercise; viz.</hi> a <hi>conscience void of offence,</hi> or rather an <note n="n" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive conscience, which is no scandal or cause of sin to us, and which doth not stumble and cast us down into any breach of Duty either <hi>towards God, or towards men,</hi> Acts 24.16.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Rule</hi> which I would press upon all <hi>simple</hi> and <hi>honest minds</hi> for that purpose is this, <hi>Begin with Duty and plain Laws, to make them the measure whereby to judge of Notions and Opinions; not with Notions and Opinions, to make them the measure whereby to interpret plain Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For our Duty is made <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>open,</hi> and expressed so clearly as that every man may understand it. It is no matter of <hi>skill</hi> and <hi>parts</hi> to <hi>know</hi> Christ's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but an <hi>honest</hi> and a <hi>teachable heart</hi> is a better preparation to that, than <hi>refinedness of wit</hi> and <hi>philosophick learning.</hi> For God who gave us Laws, knew the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of all capacities, and the compass of every under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; and what he intended that all should practise, he wanted not skill to express so plainly that every one
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:66440:278"/>
might apprehend it. Laws are the Rule of the last Judgment, and our obedience or disobedience to them is a matter of life or death; and that in all reason and equity ought to be revealed clearly and sufficiently to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very understanding, which every man must for ever live or dye by. As for Laws and Duty then, they are plain and easie; they are expressed in such clear and intelligible words as carry what God means by them in their usual and obvious acceptation. So that in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, if we begin there, there is no great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; seeing they are easily and obviously understood by any man, who brings along with him an obedient and teachable mind to the obvious understanding of them.</p>
               <p>But as for <hi>abstract Notions</hi> and <hi>general opinions,</hi> they admit of much <hi>doubting</hi> and <hi>dispute,</hi> and of great <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of reason,</hi> and <hi>variety of argument</hi> on <hi>one</hi> side, as well as on the <hi>other.</hi> And besides, <hi>all capacities</hi> are no <hi>fit Judges</hi> of them; but those only which have much <hi>quickness,</hi> and much <hi>experience</hi>; that can dispel the <hi>darkness,</hi> by <hi>clear evidence</hi>; and help the <hi>confusion,</hi> by a <hi>distinct representation</hi> of things; that can judge of <hi>reasons,</hi> and of <hi>exceptions,</hi> and of the <hi>various degrees in evidence,</hi> and the just weight of arguments. So that they are a matter, not for the determination of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon heads,</hi> but for the <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>witty,</hi> for <hi>refined Parts</hi> and <hi>Philosophers.</hi> Yea and even among <hi>them,</hi> by reason of their <hi>difficulty</hi> and <hi>doubtfulness,</hi> they admit of <hi>great disputes,</hi> and beget <hi>generally</hi> much <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>judgment</hi> and <hi>opinion</hi>; wherein if some think true, as it is very possible, nay often happens that neither do, the rest must of necessity be mistaken.</p>
               <p>

                  <head>The CONTENTS. </head>
                  <p>All the forementioned causes of ignorance of our present a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions being included in the known Law, are such to knowing and learned men. Besides them, the difficult and obscure nature of several sins is a general cause of it to the rude and unlearned. Sins upon this ignorance, as well as upon ignorance of the Law it self, unchosen, and so consistent with a state of Grace and Salvation.
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:66440:279"/>
Where there is something of choice in it they extenuate the sin, and abate the punishment, though they do not wholly excuse it. The excuse for these actions is only whilst we are plainly ignorant: they are damning when we are enlightned so far as to doubt of them, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable whil'st we are in darkness or errour. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse is for both the modes of ignorance, <hi>1.</hi> Forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; <hi>2.</hi> Errour. All this pardon hitherto discoursed of upon the account of ignorance of either sort, is no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the ignorance it self is involuntary. The will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of some mens ignorance. The several steps in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary ignorance. The causes of it. Two things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to render ignorance involuntary, <hi>1.</hi> An honest heart, <hi>2.</hi> An honest industry. What measures necessary to the acceptance of this industry. Gods candour in judging of its sufficiency. This discourse upon this first cause of an innocent involuntariness, <hi>(viz.)</hi> ignorance, sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THus upon all these accounts, which are mention'd in the <hi>two</hi> former <hi>Chapters,</hi> we see it will often happen, that although in the <hi>general we do know the Law which forbids any sin; yet shall we still be ignorant of our present actions being comprehended under it.</hi> For the <hi>small, and barely gradual difference between Good and Evil,</hi> the <hi>limitedness of most Laws,</hi> the <hi>indirect obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which pass upon some indifferent actions,</hi> the <hi>clash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and enterfering of some of Christs Laws,</hi> sometimes <hi>with other commands,</hi> and sometimes <hi>with our own prejudices and prepossessed Opinions</hi>; are also many reasons why af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we <hi>know</hi> the <hi>General Laws</hi> that forbid them, we shall still venture upon several <hi>particular actions through ignorance of their being forbidden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet besides all <hi>these,</hi> which are causes of such ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance to the most <hi>knowing men,</hi> and to those who
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:66440:280"/>
have <hi>great parts</hi> and <hi>learning:</hi> there will be moreover one <hi>great</hi> and <hi>general</hi> cause of it to the more <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>ignorant,</hi> and that is the <hi>difficult,</hi> and, to them, <hi>obscure nature of the sin it self, which in the Law is expresly, and by name forbidden.</hi> For how many of them who hear, it may be, of the Law against <hi>censoriousness, lascivious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, uncleanness, carnality, sensuality, refusing of the Cross,</hi> and <hi>other</hi> things; do not well understand what those words mean? Alas! the greater number of men in the world, have but very rude, and imperfect notices of things; they see them only in a huddle, and by halves. And as it is in their knowledge of other things; so is it in their understanding of Sin and Duty likewise. For their sight and sence of them is dark and defective, and albeit they have some general and confused apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of them; yet is not their knowledge so clear and distinct, as that they are thereby enabled to judge of every particular action, whether it falls under any of them, or no. And since they have but such half and imperfect notions of several sins, it is no wonder, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they know the <hi>General Law,</hi> if they venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on several actions which really come under it, not knowing that they do.</p>
               <p>And thus we see, that besides the <hi>ignorance of the Law it self,</hi> there is also another sort of ignorance which will be a cause of sin to several men of all sorts, and that is their <hi>ignorance of their present actions being comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the letter of the Law, and meant by it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now as for <hi>those transgressions,</hi> which men of an <hi>honest heart</hi> are guilty of, through this <hi>ignorance of their own actions being included in the Law,</hi> when they do know the Law that includes it: <hi>They do not put them out of a state of Grace, but consist with it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this Ignorance is mens <hi>unhappiness</hi> rather than their <hi>fault</hi>; it is not an Ignorance of their own <hi>choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,</hi>
                  <pb n="525" facs="tcp:66440:280"/>
seeing their will and choice is against it. For they <hi>desire</hi> to be free from it, and <hi>strive</hi> to prevent it, and <hi>endeavour,</hi> according to those abilities and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which God has afforded them, to get right and true apprehensions of all Gods will that they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; and of every evil action that they may avoid it. But it is the <hi>difficulty</hi> and <hi>intricateness of things</hi> which renders them ignorant, and that is not of their making. For the sins forbidden are not easily distinguished from the Liberty allow'd, or from the Duty commanded in some cases; and therefore it is that they mistake them, and are ignorant of the sinfulness of their present acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when their knowledge of it should enable them if they would to avoid it.</p>
               <p>And since it has so little of their <hi>own will,</hi> and the men, even when by reason of their ignorance they trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, are industriously desirous to know their Duty, and prepared to practise it so far as they understand it: it shall have nothing of <hi>Gods anger.</hi> It is altogether a pardonable slip, and a pitiable instance, and that is enough to recommend it to Gods mercy. For he is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>rigorous</hi> and <hi>severe</hi> in a case that is prepared for pity and pardon, so that he will not punish, but graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously forgive it.</p>
               <p>And if it were otherwise, <hi>who could possibly be saved?</hi> For this <hi>ignorance of their present actions being compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the words of the known Law,</hi> is such as the <hi>wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest</hi> men have been subject to; and they, among the rest, who were most eminently skill'd in all the Laws of God. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

The best men in all times, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Christians,</hi> have been subject to miscarriages through this sort of ignorance; and God, who is never wanting to the necessities of his servants, has alwayes provided a sufficient atonement and propitiation for them. For under the <hi>Law,</hi> if any honest <hi>Israelite</hi> happen'd to <hi>do any thing which was forbidden to be done by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>wist not that it was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; Moses</hi> appointed the <hi>Priests to make an expiation for him,</hi> and several atonements for that purpose are set down, <hi>Levit.</hi> 4. And under the Gospel our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ, by <note n="d" place="margin">Joh. 1.17.</note> 
                  <hi>whom Grace</hi> and Favour is said <hi>to be given much more largely</hi> than it was by the <hi>Law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> has provided us of a much more powerfull and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable propitiation. He himself, by virtue of his own sacrifice, atones for all such unknown offences; as well as the Jewish Priests did by their Sacrifices, which were prescribed in the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> For in comparison of the <hi>two</hi> Priesthoods, as to that part of their Office which lay in making these atonements, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> assures us, that like as the <hi>Jewish Priests</hi> had, so <hi>Christ can have compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion upon the ignorant,</hi> Heb. 5.2.</p>
               <p>As for those transgressions then which are therefore <hi>involuntary</hi> and <hi>unchosen,</hi> because we do <hi>not know that the Law which they are against doth comprehend them</hi>;
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:66440:281"/>
they shall not <hi>finally damn</hi> any man. So long as we have an honest heart, that is ready to perform what it knows, and unfeignedly desirous and industrious to know more, that it may perform it likewise; if in some things still we happen ignorantly to offend, such ignorant offences shall not prove our ruine. For our ignorance will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse our sin, and make it consistent with Gods Favour, and with all the hopes and happiness of heaven.</p>
               <p>Nay, even where our <hi>heart is not so honest</hi> as it should be, and we are ignorant of the present actions being comprized under that sin which the Law forbids through our <hi>own fault</hi>; yet even there our ignorance, although it cannot <hi>wholly excuse,</hi> doth still <hi>extenuate</hi> our <hi>sin,</hi> and proportionably <hi>abate</hi> our <hi>punishment.</hi> Perhaps it is our <hi>rashness,</hi> or <hi>inconsiderateness,</hi> or <hi>violent pursuit of some opinions</hi> and <hi>prejudice against others</hi> which makes us judge wrong of some particular actions, and not to see that they are included in the prohibition of some known Law, when really they are. Nay, so far may our mistake go, as not only to judge them to be no sinfull breaches of these Laws; but moreover to be virtuous performances of others. For our Saviour tells his Disciples, that <hi>the time was coming, when</hi> even <hi>they who killed them should think that</hi> thereby <hi>they did God good service,</hi> Joh. 16.2. And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> sayes plainly, that <hi>he verily thought with himself, that he ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth,</hi> Acts 26.9. All which <hi>murders</hi> and <hi>persecutions</hi> they were <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly</hi> guilty of; not as if they did not know the Laws against <hi>murder</hi> and <hi>persecution,</hi> but because they thought their present actions to be unconcern'd in them, and not forbid by them; nay, on the contrary, to be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted and injoyn'd by other Laws requiring <hi>zeal for God,</hi> and <hi>judgment against false Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this Ignorance was such as they might very
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:66440:282"/>
well have prevented had they been <hi>calm,</hi> and <hi>conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, humble,</hi> and <hi>teachable,</hi> and would have <hi>hearkned honestly,</hi> and with an <hi>even mind</hi> to that evidence which <hi>Christ</hi> gave of his being the <hi>Messiah,</hi> which was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to convince any <hi>honest mind.</hi> And this <hi>patience, humility,</hi> and <hi>teachableness</hi> were in their own Power to have exercised if they would; so that they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in good measure through their own choice, and by a <hi>wilful neglect</hi> of those means which would have brought them to a true belief, and a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. And since their Ignorance was thus a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their own choice, it is their sin, and they must answer for it.</p>
               <p>But although, being, as I say, their own fault, it could not wholly excuse; yet was it fit to lessen and mitigate their crime, and to abate their punishment. Their account should be less by reason of their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and the sinfull actions, being committed with an honest heart through a misguided understanding, were much more prepared for pardon than otherwise they would have been. And this <hi>Christ</hi> himself has plainly taught us, when he uses it as an argument with his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> for the forgiveness of that <hi>sinfull murder</hi> of the Jews, whereof they were guilty in his <hi>Crucifixion. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> sayes he, <hi>forgive them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they know not what they do</hi>; their killing of me they take to be no sinful mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of an innocent and anointed person, but a virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous execution of a lying Prophet, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.34. And this likewise S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> experienced: <hi>I obtained Mercy,</hi> sayes he, for persecuting the Church of God, <hi>because I did it ignorantly,</hi> not thinking it to be a sinfull perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, but a pious service, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.</p>
               <p>Yea, if the <hi>culpa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le ignorance</hi> be either of the <hi>Law it self,</hi> or of our <hi>present actions being contained under it</hi>; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>though God should not call us to <hi>repentance</hi> for what
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:66440:282"/>
we ignorantly committed, and so to <hi>pardon</hi>; yet even unpardoned we shall undergo a much <hi>lighter punishment</hi> by reason of our ignorance, than we should have suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed had we sinned in knowledge. For in this Point the words of our Lord and Judge are express, <hi>He who knew not his Masters will, and did things worthy of stripes; shall be beaten with few stripes,</hi> Luke 12.48.</p>
               <p>This allowance the Gospel makes for our sinful acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, so long as we are ignorant that the Laws which they are against do include and comprehend them. Whilst our Consciences are in <hi>darkness</hi> about them, and we do not see that we transgress in them; though that ignorance were in good measure <hi>culpably wilful,</hi> we should obtain a <hi>milder punishment</hi>; but if it were <hi>invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary</hi> and <hi>innocent,</hi> we shall be <hi>fully acquitted</hi> and <hi>excused.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This allowance, I say, there is whilst <hi>our sin is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi> and our Consciences do not see that the known Law is transgressed by our sinful action.</p>
               <p>But if our Consciences should come to <hi>know so much</hi> of the sinfulness of that action which we commit, as to <hi>scruple its lawfulness</hi>; and to be <hi>enlightned so far as real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to doubt of it:</hi> then is the case quite alter'd, and we cannot plead that we did it ignorantly, because we knew so much by it at least as should have made us forbear it. For if indeed we <hi>doubted</hi> of it, we knew it was as likely to be a Sin, as to be an innocent Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; because that is properly Doubting, when we sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend our Assent, and cannot tell which way to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, when we judge one to be as likely as the other, and do not positively and determinately believe the truth of either. And when this is our case concerning any Action, if we venture on it whilst the doubt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, we are guilty of sin, and must expect to suffer punishment. For by so doing we shew plainly, that
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:66440:283"/>
we will do more for sin than we will for God, and that it has a greater interest with us than he; because even whilst we apprehend it as likely to be our sin as our liberty, yet for the sins sake we chuse to venture on it, rather than for Gods sake to abstain from it.</p>
               <p>This Contempt of God there is in it, in the <hi>Nature of the very thing</hi> it self, although God had no ways expressed himself concerning it. But we must know further, that whensoever we are in this estate of doubt and unresolvedness, God has given us a <hi>peremptory Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> that <hi>we should not act what we fear is sinful, but omit it. Abstain,</hi> saith he, <hi>from all appearance of evil,</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.22. So that if after all our Disputes and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs we venture at last to commit the Action which we doubted of, we do not only slight God by running the hazard of Disobedience to one Law, whereof we are uncertain; but we wilfully disobey him in trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing of this other Law, whereof we all either are, or may be certain if we will. And if in this estate we presume thus to disobey, we shall be sure to suffer for our Disobedience.</p>
               <p>And in this case St. <hi>Paul</hi> is plain. For if there be any thing, whose lawfulness our <hi>Consciences are unresolved</hi> and <hi>unperswaded</hi> of; whilst that <hi>unresolvedness</hi> remains, he tells us plainly, that our <hi>commission</hi> of it is <hi>utterly unlawful. Whatsoever,</hi> says he, <hi>is not of Faith,</hi> or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a belief and perswasion of its lawfulness, <hi>is sin.</hi> So that if it be about the <hi>eating of meats,</hi> for Instance, <hi>he that doubts is damn'd,</hi> both of God and of himself, <hi>if he eat, because he eateth not of Faith,</hi> Rom. 14.23.</p>
               <p>If our minds therefore are so far enlightned concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any sinful Action, as that we are come to doubt of it, we are no longer innocently and excusably igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. For we see enough by it to make us chuse to
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:66440:283"/>
abstain from it; and if for all this we presume still to venture on it, sin lyes at the door, and we must answer for it. We are no longer within the excuse of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but we are guilty of a wilful sin, and are got within the bounds of Death and Damnation.</p>
               <p>But if in any Action we know nothing at all of the Law which forbids it; or after we have known that, if we are still ignorant of its being contain'd under it; if we are not come to <hi>doubt,</hi> but are either in <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> or <hi>Errour</hi> concerning it; our Ignorance shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse our Fault, and deliver us from Condemnation. We do not chuse the sin which we do thus ignorantly commit, and therefore we shall not suffer that Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is threatned to it; but our unknown offence is a pardonable slip, such as, according to the gracious Terms of Christs Gospel, shall surely go uncondem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>And this is true, not only of <hi>simple Ignorance,</hi> but likewise of the two particular <hi>Modes</hi> of Ignorance, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>First, <hi>Forgetfulness.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Our sins of Ignorance will be born with, if we venture upon the sinful Action through <hi>Ignorance of its sinfulness, which we knew formerly, but at the time of acting have forgotten.</hi> For a slip of Forgetfulness is no more than befel an <hi>Apostle,</hi> who was for all that a <hi>blessed Saint,</hi> and an <hi>Heir of Life</hi> still. St. <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self reviles the <hi>High-Priest,</hi> forgetting both his <hi>Duty,</hi> and that that man <hi>was he</hi> whom he spoke to. <hi>I wist not, Brethren,</hi> says he, <hi>that he was the High-Priest,</hi> for had I bethought my self I should not have spoke so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respectfully to him, it being thus written, <hi>Thou shalt not speak evil of the Ruler of thy People,</hi> Act. 23.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our sins of Ignorance shall be dispensed with, if
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:66440:284"/>
we are led to commit them through a <hi>mistake of their innocence, when indeed they are sinful,</hi> which is an act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them through <hi>errour.</hi> For no less a man than <hi>Peter</hi> was drawn into a sinful dissimulation, through an erroneous conceit that his giving no offence, but keeping in with the Jews (which was the thing that he aimed at by it) would justifie and bear him out in it. For which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> tells us when <hi>he came to Antioch, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood him to the face, because he was to be blamed,</hi> Gal. 2.11, 12, 13. But yet for all this S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> was at that time a <hi>true good Saint,</hi> and if it had pleased God then to call for him, he had been <hi>undoubtedly an Heir of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to mention no more upon this Point, as there were constant atonements for the errours of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under the <hi>Law,</hi> so is there provision made for them under the <hi>Gospel.</hi> For <hi>Christ</hi> who is our <hi>High Priest,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> assures us, <hi>can have compassion on the ignorant</hi> and <note place="margin">

                  <hi>erroneous,</hi> or <hi>them who are out of the way,</hi> Heb. 5.2.</p>
               <p>So long therefore we see as our ignorance of any kind, whether of the <hi>Law it self,</hi> or of our <hi>present a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions being comprehended by it,</hi> is <hi>involuntary</hi> and <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi>; so long shall we be <hi>born with</hi> for all such slips as we incur under it. For God will never be severe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us for <hi>weakness of understanding,</hi> or for <hi>want of parts,</hi> whilst there is nothing in us of a <hi>wicked heart</hi>: and therefore if our ignorance it self is innocent, our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences under it shall go unpunished.</p>
               <p>But here we must observe that all this allowance for our ignorance, is so far only as it is <hi>involuntary</hi> and <hi>faultless:</hi> but if we <hi>chuse</hi> to be ignorant, our ignorance is in it self our <hi>sin,</hi> and will make all our following of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences <hi>damnable.</hi> For we must answer for any thing of our own choice; and therefore if we chuse the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:66440:284"/>
we shall be interpreted to chuse, and so put to answer for, all those ill effects which it produces. Those sins which are <hi>voluntary in their cause,</hi> are interpreted to us, as we have seen, and put upon our score; so that if we chuse the ignorance which brings them, we shall be adjudged to suffer for them.</p>
               <p>Now as for the ignorance and errour of many men, which is the cause of their sins and transgressions, it is plainly of their own <hi>chusing.</hi> They have a mind to be ignorant of their Duty, and that is the reason why they do not understand it. For either they <hi>shut their eyes,</hi> and will not <hi>see</hi> it; or they are <hi>idle</hi> and <hi>careless,</hi> and will not <hi>enquire</hi> after it; or they <hi>bend their wits,</hi> at the instigation of their lusts, to <hi>dispute</hi> against it, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have <hi>darkened</hi> and <hi>confounded</hi> it in their own thoughts, they may <hi>mince</hi> or <hi>evacuate, mistake</hi> or <hi>disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> it. So that if at last they do <hi>not know</hi> it, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they do <hi>not desire the knowledge of it,</hi> or <hi>will be at no pains for it,</hi> or <hi>take pains against it, to supplant and disguise it.</hi> And these are they, who are not ignorant against their wills, but, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> says, <hi>willingly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5.</p>
               <p>And as for such ignorance as this, it will by <hi>no means excuse us before God</hi>; but if <hi>we</hi> will be ignorant, <hi>God's</hi> will and pleasure is, that we shall <hi>suffer for our sinful ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,</hi> and for all <hi>those sins</hi> that we commit under it, which we <hi>might</hi> and <hi>should</hi> have seen and avoided. For all those Laws, which are ignorantly transgressed by us, threaten death, and the ignorance being of our own chusing takes nothing off; so that death and damnation rest upon us.</p>
               <p>But that ignorance which can be pleaded to excuse us before God, must be an ignorance that is involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; an ignorance, which in the <hi>constitution of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is imposed upon us, and is not <hi>chosen</hi> by us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="534" facs="tcp:66440:285"/>And a right understanding of this difference in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance being of so great moment, I shall, before I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss this Point, observe when our ignorance is <hi>volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and when it is <hi>involuntary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, I will show <hi>when our ignorance is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>voluntary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>knowledge</hi> of our <hi>Duty,</hi> like as of all other things, it doth not spring up in our souls as an <hi>Herb</hi> doth out of the ground, nor drop into us as the <hi>rain</hi> doth from a Cloud; but it must be <hi>sought</hi> for, and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured</hi> after, and unless we use the <hi>means</hi> of acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it we must be content to live without it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>means of obtaining the knowledge of God's Laws,</hi> and of the <hi>innocence</hi> and <hi>sinfulness of our own actions,</hi> are the <hi>reading of his Word,</hi> the <hi>attendance upon his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,</hi> the <hi>thinking</hi> or <hi>considering upon what we read or hear in our own minds,</hi> and <hi>praying to God to make all these means effectual for our information:</hi> and if ever we expect to know God's will, we must put these in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
               <p>But now whether we will make use of these, or no, is plainly in our <hi>own choice,</hi> and at our <hi>own pleasure.</hi> For if we will, we may <note n="f" place="margin">

               <p>And this is the <hi>first</hi> way of our ignorance's becoming <hi>voluntary, viz.</hi> when it is so upon a <hi>voluntary neglect of those means which are necessary to attain knowledge.</hi> And this in the <hi>Schools</hi> is called a <note n="h" place="margin">

                  <pb n="535" facs="tcp:66440:285"/>
And if it be of such things as lay near in our way, and might have been known without much pains or much seeking; it is called <note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ignorantia crassa &amp; asse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctata.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But besides <hi>this</hi> sort of wilful ignorance of our Duty, through a <hi>wilful neglect of those means which are necessary to the knowledge of it</hi>; there is <hi>another</hi> which is higher and more enormous, and that is,</p>
               <p>Secondly, When we do not only <hi>sleight the means of knowing God's Law,</hi> but moreover <hi>use those of confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or mistaking it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For our knowledge of things is then made perfect and useful, when it is <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>distinct</hi>; and our assent and belief of things is then gained, when their <hi>evidence is represented</hi> and <hi>duly considered of.</hi> But now as for the employing of mens thoughts in <hi>clearing</hi> or <hi>confounding, believing</hi> or <hi>disbelieving</hi> of the Laws of God; it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly in their own power, whether to use it on <hi>one</hi> side, or on the <hi>other.</hi> And commonly it is their pleasure to use it on the worse. For they will consider only of the <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties</hi> and <hi>intricacies</hi> of Gods Laws, which may <hi>dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> and <hi>disturb, confound</hi> and <hi>perplex</hi> their thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them; and attend only to such <hi>exceptions</hi> as they can make against them, which may unsettle their minds, either about the <hi>meaning,</hi> or the <hi>truth</hi> of them: so that after all their <hi>reading</hi> and <hi>considering</hi> of them, they shall not understand, but <hi>err</hi> and <hi>mistake</hi> them. As it happens to all those who had disputed themselves out of the knowledge of their Duty, until, as <hi>Isaiah</hi> says, <hi>they call evil good, and good evil, put darkness for light, and light for darkness,</hi> Isai. 5.20.</p>
               <p>And when men are ignorant of their Duty, because they chose thus to endeavour it, and take pains for it; this ignorance is <hi>voluntary</hi> and <hi>wilful</hi> with a witness.</p>
               <p>These <hi>two</hi> reasons of mens being ignorant of their
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:66440:286"/>
Duty, <hi>viz.</hi> their <hi>neglect of such means as are necessary to the knowledge of it,</hi> or their <hi>use of the contrary means of confounding or discrediting it,</hi> are the causes of their <hi>wilful ignorance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that which makes them guilty of both these, is either the <hi>gross idleness,</hi> or the <hi>profligate wickedness of their hearts,</hi> which are wholly inslaved to some beloved lust or sin. They are <hi>wretchedly idle,</hi> and therefore they will not learn their Duty because that is <hi>painful</hi>; they are <hi>greatly wicked,</hi> and so care not for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Law because that would disquiet them. <hi>Men love darkness,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>better than light, because their works are evil; they hate the light and will not come to it, lest their deeds should be reproved by it,</hi> John 3.19, 20. Because they <hi>hate</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> the Law, they <hi>neglect</hi> the means of knowing it; nay, they <hi>pick quarrels</hi> with it, and endeavour all they can to <hi>perplex</hi> or <hi>darken,</hi> to <hi>evacuate</hi> or <hi>disparage</hi> it.</p>
               <p>So that our ignorance is then <hi>wilful,</hi> when we are therefore ignorant because we <hi>neglect the means of knowledge,</hi> or <hi>industriously endeavour to be mistaken.</hi> And that because we are either too <hi>idle to learn,</hi> or too <hi>wicked to care for</hi> the knowledge of our Duty. The <hi>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleness</hi> and <hi>wickedness of our hearts</hi> is the <hi>first spring,</hi> and the <hi>neglect of means,</hi> and <hi>industrious perverting of the truth</hi> are the great <hi>productive instruments</hi> of our <hi>wilful</hi> ignorance. Which is therefore called <hi>voluntary</hi> and <hi>wilful,</hi> because the <hi>Principle</hi> and the <hi>Instruments,</hi> the <hi>motive</hi> and the <hi>means</hi> to it, are both under the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>choice</hi> of our <hi>own wills.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>these</hi> things making our ignorance <hi>wilful, viz.</hi> a <hi>wilful neglect of the means of knowledge,</hi> or a <hi>wilful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of those Laws which we are to know:</hi> we shall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily discern,</p>

namely, that which implies a freedome from, and an absence of both <hi>these</hi>; so that unto it there is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> In all <hi>involuntary</hi> ignorance, it is necessary that we have an <hi>honest heart.</hi> We have S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi>'s word for it, that our receiving of the <hi>love of the truth</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to a <hi>saving belief,</hi> and <hi>understanding</hi> of it. <hi>They who believed not the truth, but believed lyes,</hi> fell into that miscarriage by this means, says he, <hi>because they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not the love of the truth, that they might be saved,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. And our Saviour has taught us, that an <hi>obedient heart</hi> is the surest step to a <hi>right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. If any man will,</hi> or is willing to <hi>do God's will, he shall know of the Doctrine</hi> which I preach, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be of God,</hi> John 7.17. The heart or will must in the first place be obedient, and unfeignedly desirous to know Gods will; not that it may <hi>question</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,</hi> but <hi>practise</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> it. For a failure here spoils all besides, because the Heart and Will is the Principle of all our actions, and if it be against obeying any Law, it will be also against understanding it, and so will be sure to make us neglect, and omit, more or less, the means of coming to the knowledge of it. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent therefore all wilful defects <hi>afterwards,</hi> care must be taken in the <hi>first</hi> place that our hearts be honest, and truly desirous to be shewn our Duty, be it what it will. They must entertain no Lusts which will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice them against Gods Laws, and make them wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, either to overlook, or to pervert them. But they must come with an entire obedience and resignation, being ready and desirous to hearken to whatsoever God shall say, and resolv'd to practise it whensoever they shall understand it. Of their sincerity in which
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:66440:287"/>
last, besides their own sense and feeling, they cannot have a greater Argument, than their being careful to be found in the practice of so much as they know al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, without which it is not to be expected that they should be perfecter in their practice by knowing more.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Honesty</hi> and <hi>obedience of the Heart</hi> then is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in the first place to make our ignorance invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, because we should wilfully omit the means of knowledge, and become thereby wilfully ignorant if we wanted it.</p>
               <p>But then as an effect of this Honesty of the heart, to make our ignorance involuntary and innocent, there is yet further required</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> An <hi>honest Industry.</hi> For the knowledge of our Duty, as was observed, is not to be got without our own search, but we must inquire after it, and make use of the means of obtaining it, before we shall be possessed of it. We must <hi>read good Books,</hi> which will teach us Gods Will, but especially the <hi>Bible</hi>; we must be <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>careful to hear Sermons; attend diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the instructions of our spiritual Guides,</hi> whom God has set over us for that very purpose. We must submit our selves to be <hi>catechised by our Governours, taught by our Superiours,</hi> and <hi>admonished by our Equals</hi>; begging always a Blessing from God to set home upon our Souls all their instructions. And after all we must be careful without <hi>prejudice</hi> or <hi>partiality</hi> to think and meditate upon those things which we read or hear, that we may the better understand them, and that they may not sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly slip from us, but we may remember and retain them.</p>
               <p>All these are such means as God has appointed for the attainment of spiritual knowledge, and laid in our way to a right understanding of his Will. And they
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:66440:287"/>
are such as he has placed in every mans power, for any of us to use who are so minded. So that if we are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of our Duty through the want of them, we are ignorant, because we our selves would have it so. But if ever we expect that our ignorance should be judged involuntary, we must industriously use all those means of knowledge, which are under the power of our own wills, whereby we may prevent it.</p>
               <p>And as for the <hi>measures</hi> of this industry, <hi>(viz.) what time is to be laid out upon it,</hi> and <hi>what pains are to be taken in it,</hi> that is so much as in <hi>every one,</hi> according to their several abilities and opportunities, <hi>would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted an effect of an honestly obedient heart, and of an unfeigned desire to know our duty, by any honest man.</hi> For God has not given all men either the same abilities or opportunities for knowledge; and since he has not, he doth not expect the same measures from them. He doth not reap where he has not sown, but that which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts, is, that <hi>every man according to his opportunities, should use and improve that talent,</hi> be it more or less, <hi>which was intrusted with him,</hi> as we are taught in the <hi>Parable</hi> of the <hi>Talents,</hi> Mat. 25. And to name that once for all, we have this laid down by our Saviour as an <hi>universal maxime</hi> of Gods Government; <hi>unto whomso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever much is given, of them shall much be required.</hi> Which is the very same equitable proceeding that is daily in use among our selves. <hi>For to whom men have committed much, of him they will exact the more,</hi> Luk. 12.48.</p>
               <p>If any man therefore is industrious after the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods will, according to the measure of those abilities and opportunities which God has given him; he is industrious according to that measure which God requires of him. All men have not the <hi>same leisure,</hi> for some are necessarily taken up by their place and way of life in much business, some in less; some have their time

at their own disposal, some are subject to the ordering of others. And all have not the <hi>same abilities and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,</hi> for some are able by study and reading to inform themselves, some have constant need of the help and instruction of others; some have most wise and understanding teachers, and may have their assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance when they will; others have men of meaner parts and attainments, and opportunity of hearing them more seldom. But now of all these, whose leisure and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities are thus different, God doth not in any wise exact the same measure: No, one shall be excused for what another shall be punished; but if every man endeavours according to his opportunities, he has done his Duty, and God has accepted him.</p>
               <p>And in the <hi>proportioning</hi> of this, where there is first an <hi>honest heart,</hi> God is not hard to please. For he knows that, besides their Duty, men have much other business to mind, which his own constitution of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has made necessary; and he allows of it. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours which he exacts of us, are not the endeavours of <hi>Angels,</hi> but of <hi>men,</hi> who are soon wearied, and much distracted, having so many other things to employ us. But he accepts of such a measure of industry in the use of all the means of knowledge, as would be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for an effect of an hearty desire to know his Laws, by any <hi>honest man.</hi> For where there is first an <hi>obedient heart,</hi> God will not be <hi>equalled,</hi> and much less <hi>out-done</hi> by the best of men in pity and kindness. Which is the argument from which our Saviour himself concludes that God will give the <hi>holy spirit at our prayers,</hi> because that <hi>men</hi> themselves, who are infinitely below him in goodness, <hi>will give good gifts to them that ask them,</hi> Luk. 11.13.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore take care in the first place to <hi>secure our selves of an obedient heart,</hi> and to <hi>give such evidence
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:66440:288"/>
of an honest industry, as any kind hearted honest man would accept of</hi>; and then we may have just reason to be confident, that although our <hi>endeavour</hi> is <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>imperfect,</hi> being <hi>much hindred,</hi> and <hi>often interrupted,</hi> yet shall it still be esteemed sufficient. For <hi>Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who is to judge of its <hi>sufficiency,</hi> is no <hi>stranger</hi> to our <hi>weaknesses,</hi> but, having felt them in himself, he is prone to pity and pardon them in us. He experiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>backwardness of our flesh,</hi> and the <hi>number of our distractions,</hi> and the <hi>tiredness of our powers,</hi> and the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuations and strength of temptations.</hi> So that having such an <hi>High Priest</hi> to intercede for us at present, and to judge us at the last day, <hi>who is touched with a feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our infirmities, having been tempted himself in all points, even as we are: let us come boldly unto the throne of Grace,</hi> as the Apostle exhorts us, <hi>that we may obtain mercy</hi> for what we cannot master, as well as <hi>find grace in a seasonable time of need</hi> to conquer what he expects we should overcome, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.15, 16. And this merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full connivance at our imperfections, and gracious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of our weak endeavours, we may with the greater reason and assurance hope for; because <hi>Christ</hi> our Judge will be most <hi>candid</hi> and <hi>benign,</hi> in putting the best sense, and in interpreting most to our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage all those our actions and endeavours, which shall then be brought before him. Whereof he has given us a clear instance, in that most favourable constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he made of that <hi>Charity,</hi> that was shewn unto his <hi>Brethren</hi> by those on his <hi>right hand,</hi> Mat. 25. For although it was not expressed to <hi>him,</hi> but only to their <hi>fellow Christians for his sake</hi>; yet because their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness reached him in the intention of their minds, and what they did to his servants for his sake, they would have done to himself much rather could they have met with an opportunity; he resented it as if it had been
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:66440:289"/>
really shown to his own person. For when they say unto him, <hi>Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee; or naked, and cloathed thee,</hi> &amp;c. he answers, <hi>inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as ye have done it to one of the least of these my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> I take the affection for the performance, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it as if <hi>you</hi> had <hi>done it unto me,</hi> vers. 40.</p>
               <p>When therefore the <hi>sufficiency</hi> of our endeavours fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the knowledge of our Duty, is come to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into by our Lord and Saviour <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>; we may be assured that it will have a favourable tryal. It it to be censured by a <hi>candid, equitable,</hi> and <hi>benign judge,</hi> who will interpret it to our advantage as much, nay, more than any <hi>good natured honest man</hi> would. So that if our industry after the knowledge of Gods will be in such a measure, as a candid and benign man would judge to be a sufficient effect of an obedient heart, and of an honest purpose; Christ will judge it to be so too.</p>
               <p>And where our Ignorance of any of Christs Laws is joyned with an <hi>honest heart,</hi> and remains after <hi>such an industry</hi>; we may take comfort to our selves, and be confident that it is <hi>involuntary</hi> and <hi>innocent.</hi> If we are <hi>desirous to know Gods Laws,</hi> and <hi>read good Books, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Sermons, hearken to any good instructions</hi> which we meet with, and that according to our <hi>opportunities,</hi> and in <hi>such measure</hi> as any <hi>good man</hi> would interpret to be an honest endeavour after the knowledge of our Duty if it were to himself: if after all this, I say, in some points we are still <hi>Ignorant,</hi> our Ignorance is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary,</hi> and shall not harm us; it is not chosen by us, and therefore it never will condemn us.</p>
               <p>And thus we have seen what <hi>ignorances excuse our slips</hi> and <hi>transgressions</hi> which are committed under them; and when those <hi>Ignorances</hi> are themselves <hi>involuntary</hi> and <hi>innocent,</hi> so as that we may comfortably expect to
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:66440:289"/>
be excused upon the account of them. And the summ of all that has been hitherto discoursed upon this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is this. That as for the <hi>Laws themselves, all men</hi> must needs be ignorant of some of them for <hi>some time,</hi> and <hi>some men</hi> for <hi>all their lives,</hi> because they want ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ability</hi> or <hi>opportunity</hi> to understand them. And as for their <hi>present actions being comprehended under them,</hi> that many men of <hi>all sorts</hi> and <hi>capacities,</hi> after that they have <hi>known the General Laws,</hi> will still be ignorant of <hi>it</hi> likewise. For as for the <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>learned,</hi> the <hi>small</hi> and <hi>meer gradual difference between good and evil in some instances,</hi> the <hi>allowed exceptions from the generality of others,</hi> the <hi>indirect force and obligation of a third sort,</hi> and the <hi>frequent clashing and enterfering,</hi> whether of <hi>Laws with Laws,</hi> or of <hi>Laws with their repugnant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices and opinions</hi>; will be sure to make <hi>them</hi> very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>overlook it.</hi> And as for the <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>ignorant,</hi> that, besides all <hi>these</hi> causes of such ignorance which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them with learned men, the <hi>difficult</hi> and <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure nature of several Vices and Virtues themselves,</hi> which are plainly and expresly forbidden or injoyn'd, will be of force sufficient to make the <hi>generality</hi> of them in many instances <hi>not to understand</hi> it. And as for the <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>excuse</hi> of our ignorance and unknown trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions from <hi>all,</hi> or <hi>any</hi> of these causes; that it is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary</hi> and <hi>innocent</hi> so long as it is joyned with an <hi>honest heart,</hi> and remains after an <hi>honest industry</hi>; and begins then only to be our <hi>wilful sin,</hi> and an <hi>Article</hi> of our <hi>condemnation,</hi> when <hi>our Lusts or Vices introduce it,</hi> and <hi>we have a mind to it,</hi> and <hi>take no pains against it,</hi> or, what is the consummation and height of all, <hi>industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously labour and endeavour after it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this may suffice to have spoken of the <hi>first</hi> sort of <hi>want of Knowledge,</hi> which, as I said above, produces an <hi>uncondemning involuntariness,</hi> (viz.) <hi>Ignorance,</hi> when
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:66440:290"/>
we <hi>commit sin, because we do not know the sinfulness of our present action, or the Law which we sin against.</hi>

                  <head>The CONTENTS. </head>
                  <p>Consideration is necessary to choice. Some sins are inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate. Three innocent causes of inconsideration. <hi>1.</hi> Suddenness and surprize of opportunity. An account of this. The involuntariness of it. Slips upon it are consistent. <hi>2.</hi> Weariness of our thinking powers or understandings. An account of this; and of its involuntariness. The consistence of our Transgressions by reason of it. <hi>3.</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composure or disturbance of them. An account of this. The causes of it are Drunkenness, or a strong Passion. Drunkenness is always our own fault. Our Passions grow strong in us sometimes by our own indulgence, and then they are our damning sin, and we must suffer for the evil that we commit under them: sometimes through the suddenness, and greatness of outward objects; and then they are pardonable, and our inconsiderate slips upon them are excusable. The Passions which have Good for their object, as Love, Desire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cannot by any force of outward objects be so suddenly forced upon us. But the Passions which have Evil, as Grief, Anger, and Fear especially, often are. The reason of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. Inconsideration upon the latter excusable, but not upon the former. This difference made by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:66440:290"/>
in a case where both were criminal. Excusable slips upon discomposure of our thinking powers, are such as proceed from an unwill'd sudden Grief or Anger, but especially from a sudden Fear. No fear is involuntary but what is sudden; and sins upon deliberate fear are damning; but upon unwill'd sudden Fear, Grief, or Anger, consistent with Salvation. Cautions about in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate sins to prevent false confidence. No sin is innocently inconsiderate: <hi>1.</hi> Where we have time and an undisturbed understanding. <hi>2.</hi> Where the sin is mischievous, or greatly criminal. <hi>3.</hi> When we do not strive against it. We must endeavour against all invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Failings, though we cannot resolve against them. <hi>4.</hi> When we are not sorry after we have committed it, nor beg pardon for it. <hi>5.</hi> When it is committed with observation. A summary Repetition of this fourth Book.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving in the foregoing Chapters discoursed large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>first</hi> cause of an <hi>innocent Involuntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> viz. <hi>Ignorance of our Duty</hi> or want of a <hi>general Knowledge,</hi> I proceed now to the <hi>second,</hi> viz. <hi>want of particular Animadvertence</hi> and <hi>Consideration</hi> of what we know, which is <hi>Inconsiderateness.</hi> And this is the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> way of rendring our Transgressions <hi>pardonably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary,</hi> which I proposed above; namely, <hi>when in any sinful action we do not bethink our selves, and consider of its sinfulness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not <hi>all knowledge</hi> of our Duty that renders every particular sin against it <hi>chosen</hi> and <hi>voluntary.</hi> For a knowledge that is only <hi>general,</hi> and <hi>at such time as the thing occurs to our thoughts,</hi> and <hi>we are asked the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,</hi> will not do: but as all our <hi>choice</hi> is of <hi>particular</hi> actions, so must our <hi>knowledge</hi> be likewise. Before we can be said to chuse a particular action, we must see and know it particularly; and if we act it without
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:66440:291"/>
thinking, we act it also without chusing, seeing all choice is upon sight and knowledge of what is chosen.</p>
               <p>But now <hi>this</hi> is the <hi>case</hi> in several of our Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, <hi>they slide from us without this actual application of our minds to them.</hi> For we do not think and consider of the evil of them when we commit them; and so their sinfulness being unseen, it is withal unchosen. They are of the number of our <hi>involuntary</hi> sins, and such as, implying nothing of our own will, shall have nothing of Gods anger, who will not punish, but gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously bear with them.</p>
               <p>And these slips stealing from us without our <hi>consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>thinking</hi> on them, or <hi>adverting</hi> in the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our minds to them; are called by these several names, which are all of the same signification, <hi>viz.</hi> sins of <hi>inadvertency, incogitancy,</hi> and <hi>inconsideration.</hi> Which because they are such as, through the weakness of our Natures, we are <hi>continually</hi> subject to, and liable <hi>daily</hi> to incur, are stiled in another word sins of <hi>daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as for this <hi>second</hi> sort of sins, our <hi>inconsiderate Transgressions,</hi> they may steal from us <hi>involuntarily</hi> and <hi>innocently</hi> upon as many grounds, as there may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent <hi>causes</hi> of <hi>inconsiderate actions.</hi> And as for the unwill'd, and therefore innocent causes of inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they are reducible to these <hi>three.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Suddenness</hi> and <hi>surprize of Opportunity.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Weariness,</hi> and</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Discomposure and disturbance of our thinking powers wherewith we should consider.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>first</hi> cause of inconsideration in our Actions, whereupon we venture upon some sin without think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or considering of it, is the <hi>suddenness of the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,</hi> and <hi>the surprize of Temptation.</hi> It falls out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly, and stays for us at such time as our minds
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:66440:291"/>
are otherwise employ'd; and so we act it without considering, because it lyes ready and prepared for us just then, when we have no leisure for thinking and consideration. And the <hi>first</hi> beginnings of a <hi>sinful Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> whether of <hi>Anger,</hi> of <hi>Envy,</hi> &amp;c. and the <hi>unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised slips of the Tongue</hi> in <hi>rash censuring,</hi> in <hi>uncharitable speaking,</hi> in <hi>indeliberate backbiting,</hi> and the <hi>like</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally enter this way. For they come upon us in the <hi>throng of Conversation,</hi> and opportunities are offered for them before we foresee them; and so we spring out indeliberately to act and exert them.</p>
               <p>And this inconsideration is such as <hi>we cannot avoid.</hi> For we have no freedom of <hi>acting</hi> where we want a freedom of <hi>thinking,</hi> seeing we cannot chuse without consideration. But as for these inconsiderate slips, they steal from us before we can bethink our selves, and stay not for our consideration, but run before it. For our operative Powers, when they are spurr'd on by any thing of an <hi>inward desire,</hi> or of a remaining <hi>corrupt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,</hi> (and who, as long as he lives here, can be wholly free from it?) are ready of themselves to spring out into Action and Practice upon the first offer of Temptation, and stand in need of reason and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, not to raise and excite, but to restrain and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press them. So that upon the offer of a fit occasion we act many times amiss before we are aware; and we cannot help it, because we cannot deliberate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of it.</p>
               <p>But as these slips of surprize are such as we cannot avoid, so are they such withal wherefore God will not exact a severe account of us. He will not <hi>punish</hi> but <hi>pity</hi> us for them, and in great mercy dispense with them.</p>
               <p>For they are <hi>necessarily incident to all men</hi>; they have been incurr'd by his best servants, but were never look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:66440:292"/>
upon to be of that provoking nature as to put them out of his favour, or to interrupt their state of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and acceptance. Just <hi>Noah</hi> through his ignorance of the strength of Wine was surprized into one sin; for he was <hi>drunken</hi> before he was aware, or could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern what effects the fruits of his <hi>new Vineyard</hi> would have upon him. <hi>Noah drank wine,</hi> says <hi>Moses, and was drunken, Gen.</hi> 9.21. But this was perfectly a mixture of <hi>surprize</hi> and <hi>ignorance,</hi> for his wits had left him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was aware, and before he ever knew that the Wine which he drunk would drive them from him. For it was at his <hi>first</hi> planting of a Vineyard, before he understood what measure of it would cause intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>He began,</hi> says the Text, <hi>to be a Husbandman, and he planted a Vineyard, and he drank of the wine of his</hi> new <hi>Vineyard, and was drunken,</hi> v. 20 21. The great Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> himself was guilty of one sudden slip to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Ananias</hi> the High Priest, who, whilst his mind was intent upon his Speech which he was making in his own defence, commanded him to be smitten on the face. Upon which unexpected occasion he was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized into a <hi>sudden anger,</hi> and into an <hi>unadvised irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence. God shall smite thee, thou whited wall,</hi> says he presently to him again, <hi>for sittest thou to judge me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law, and</hi> yet <hi>commandest me to be smitten contrary to the Law?</hi> Act. 23.1, 2, 3. But as soon as ever he dad done, he retracts his words, and confesses that his Speech was evil; but yet he pleads that it was pardonable, as being altogether unconsidered through the suddenness of the occasion. <hi>I wist not, Brethren,</hi> says he, <hi>that he was the High Priest,</hi> I did not think of that; for if I had I should not have spoke so disrespect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to him, it being thus <hi>written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the Ruler of thy people,</hi> v. 4, 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another innocent cause of inconsideration, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:66440:292"/>
we venture upon several actions without thinking of their sinfulness, is the <hi>natural weariness of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi> or <hi>understandings.</hi> It is the very frame of our Natures, and we cannot help it, for our minds to be tired out by being held long and constantly to one thing. We find it is so with us in all Studies whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; for let our thoughts be employed upon what we will, they cannot be kept at stretch upon it for a long time together, but either we must draw them off and relieve them, or else they will flag and fail of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>But now as for some sins, they are a <hi>continued tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> They do not soon come upon us, and go off as soon again; but they lye before us and stick to us, and for a long time are still alluring and solliciting us. And here although our minds can consider of them, and watch against them for some time; yet by reason of their long abode with us they wax faint at last, and grow weary and forgetful: and then the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on gets ground, and enters when we are not aware, and in some thing we prove unadvised, and yield to it because we cannot hold out longer to consider of such things as should guard and preserve us from it. Thus in <hi>afflictions</hi> and <hi>sickness,</hi> for instance, by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easiness of his flesh, and the hardness of his condition, a man is tempted to <hi>fret</hi> and <hi>murmure,</hi> and to be <hi>peevish</hi> and <hi>repining.</hi> But for some considerable time he stands upon his guard, and his thoughts are in readiness; and so long he represses his passion and keeps it under: so that although the sin be importunately offered, it is not embraced. And if the temptation would pass off whilst he stands thus prepared to watch against it, all were well, and his Vertue would remain in safety. But on the contrary it is <hi>lasting</hi> and <hi>permanent,</hi> it sticks to him, and incessantly importunes him, and so proves a
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:66440:293"/>
continual snare to him. And now if his <hi>mind</hi> would endure to be held <hi>always upon the stretch,</hi> and in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued watchfulness against it, all were well, and he would keep back from it still. But alas! his Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, after a long toil, grow <hi>weary</hi>; and his Powers of thinking, being constantly imploy'd, are <hi>spent</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled</hi>; and then his watchfulness begins to impair, and his thoughts by degrees to unbend; and whilst he becomes less attent, and less careful to oppose the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, it wins ground, and prevails upon him when he is not aware: so that although he could not at <hi>first,</hi> yet he is surprized at <hi>last</hi> into some <hi>impatient thought,</hi> or <hi>peevish behaviour.</hi> And the case is the same in a <hi>continued provocation</hi> to <hi>Anger, Lust,</hi> or <hi>other</hi> sins.</p>
               <p>Now this <hi>weariness,</hi> which renders us thus inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, is no matter of our own chusing; it is the very frame of our Nature, and not the effect of our will; so that we must submit to it, and we cannot help it. For the <hi>Soul</hi> in <hi>thinking</hi> and <hi>understanding</hi> uses <hi>bodily powers,</hi> and they by exercise are <hi>spent</hi> and <hi>wasted, weakned</hi> and <hi>enfeebled:</hi> and therefore when by a fixt watchfulness and consideration of one thing, they have been kept long attent, they naturally grow weak and weary, and there is no avoiding it.</p>
               <p>And since we cannot help it, God will never exact of us that we should; but when he comes to judge us for those slips, which were inconsiderate upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, he will not punish, but in great mercy pardon and bear with us.</p>
               <p>And this we find that he has always done. For his <hi>best Servants</hi> have been wearied into slips of this nature, and yet they have not put them out of a state of Grace, nor made a breach in God's acceptance; but he has own'd and rewarded them as his faithful Servants still.</p>

But yet notwithstanding all these, and several other fretful expressions of a tired mind, God owns him for his <hi>dear Servant</hi> still, and honours him in the end with a most noble mark of a <hi>particular affection,</hi> by accepting of <hi>his Sacrifice for his Friends,</hi> when he would not accept of it <hi>from themselves,</hi> Job 42.8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David,</hi> the man after Gods own heart, when in great fear he flyes from <hi>Saul,</hi> and after several escapes made from one place to another, could not either weary or avoid him; being tired out of all patience and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure at last, begins sinfully to call in question the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>Gods promise.</hi> For although <hi>Samuel</hi> had <note n="a" place="margin">1 Sam. 16.13.</note> come from God to <hi>anoint</hi> him King, and had thereby in Gods Name assured him of the Crown: yet, after a long confidence in Gods Faithfulness, he begins at last in the tiredness of his spirit to doubt within himself whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God would be as good as his word, and to <hi>say in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 27.1. which he did, as he himself gives the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:66440:294"/>
of it, only because the <hi>weariness</hi> of his mind, through his continued and repeated dangers, had made him <hi>hasty</hi> and <hi>inconsiderate. I said in my haste,</hi> saith he, <hi>I am cut off from before thine eyes</hi>; referring in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to this very case, <hi>Psal.</hi> 31.22.</p>
               <p>Good <hi>Asaph,</hi> by the continuance of his troubles, is wearied into a like offence. For although he guarded his spirit well at the beginning, and for some time; yet after he had laboured long under his affliction, he breaks out at last in the discomposure of his soul into these <hi>repining thoughts</hi> and <hi>distrustful expostulations: Will the Lord cast off for ever, and will he be favourable no more? Is his mercy clean gone for ever, and doth his promise fail for evermore? Hath God forgotten to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies?</hi> Psal. 77.7, 8, 9. But when once he had got liberty to recollect his thoughts, and to recover again his former guard; he doth not any longer give way to these <hi>distrustful surmises,</hi> but immediately suppresses and corrects them. <hi>Then I said,</hi> as he goes on, <hi>this is mine own infirmity,</hi> v. 10</p>
               <p n="3">3. A <hi>third</hi> innocent Cause of inconsideration in our Actions, is the <hi>discomposure</hi> and <hi>disturbance of our think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing powers, which should consider of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our souls, as I said, are united to our bodies, and make use of their powers in their most <hi>spiritual</hi> acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Apprehension.</hi> And therefore upon any ruffling discomposure in our bodily spirits, our thoughts are ruffled and discomposed likewise. They see nothing clearly at such times, nor have any distinct notices of things; but are blunder'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused even as our bodily powers themselves are.</p>
               <p>Now that which thus discomposes our bodily spirits, so as that our souls can see and consider of nothing through their disorder, is either <hi>strong Drink,</hi> or
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:66440:294"/>
a <hi>strong Passion.</hi> For so much is all exercise of reason and consideration disturbed and hindred by these, that of men in <hi>drink</hi> or in a <hi>high passion,</hi> it is usually said, that they are not themselves, and that they have not their wits about them.</p>
               <p>But although either <hi>Wine</hi> or any <hi>violent passion</hi> are <hi>sufficient causes</hi> of disturbance in our spirits, and of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composure in our thinking powers, which unfit us to consider of what we do during such time as we are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed by them; yet are not both of them <hi>innocent,</hi> and able to excuse those inconsiderate slips which we commit by reason of them. For <hi>drunkenness</hi> is always our own fault, and if we sin unadvisedly through its discomposure, we shall certainly suffer punishment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that is a discomposure of our own seeking.</p>
               <p>As for our <hi>passions</hi> indeed, they are causes of <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous quality.</hi> For sometimes they grow strong in us by our <hi>own fault.</hi> Either we feed them, or we indulge them; we suggest such things to them as will foment them, or we permit them to grow unruly of themselves, without checking and repressing of them, as we might and should, were we so minded. And when our passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are thus indulged, and the violence of them is of our own chusing; they are themselves our <hi>sin,</hi> and so cannot plead our <hi>excuse</hi> and <hi>vindication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then at other times they are <hi>forced upon us by the power and suddenness of outward objects,</hi> whether we will or no. For we hate them, and are afraid of them; and if we were aware we would stand upon our guard, and call in against them all the Aids of Reason and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to preserve us from being too much disturbed by them. But God's Providence casts them upon us on the sudden, so that we do not see them before they come, nor can consider aforehand to prevent and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void them. And when once they are come, by their
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:66440:295"/>
very natural force in disturbing of our Spirits, they take away from us all power of consideration. So that they are unconsidered in <hi>themselves,</hi> and unconsidered in their <hi>effects,</hi> and therefore they are involuntary all the way. And when our passions are made violent this way, <hi>viz.</hi> by being raised in <hi>us,</hi> not by any thing of our own <hi>search</hi> or <hi>indulgence,</hi> but by the <hi>timing of God's Providence,</hi> and by the <hi>suddenness</hi> and <hi>greatness of outward objects,</hi> they are <hi>pardonable in themselves,</hi> and will <hi>excuse our inconsiderate transgressions.</hi> Those slips which we incur under them are prepared for pardon, because we did not seek, nor could avoid them.</p>
               <p>Thus then our innocent Discomposures which unfit us for consideration, are those only which are caused in us by strong passions not of our own indulging. The passion which begets them must enter against our wills, through the <hi>greatness</hi> and <hi>suddenness of outward objects</hi>; it must be forced upon us suddenly and by surprize, and then we cannot refuse it, or the discomposure which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues upon it, because we have no time beforehand where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to consider how to prevent it.</p>
               <p>Now it is not every passion which the power of outward objects can force upon us on such a sudden. For <hi>love, desire,</hi> and all those passions which have <hi>good for their object,</hi> are more under our own Command, and spring up in us more <hi>gradually.</hi> They arrive not to such a discomposing pitch in a moment, but they require more time, and go on more leisurely; and in all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedial steps they are subject to our own power, so that we may arrest them, if we please, before they have got so far. And therefore all the inconsideration which they effect in us is more or less wilful, and a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our own choice, because it proceeds from our own permission and indulgence.</p>
               <p>But then as for other passions of <hi>grief, anger,</hi> and
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:66440:295"/>
                  <hi>fear</hi> especially, which have <hi>evil</hi> for their object; if the <hi>opportunity be sudden,</hi> and the <hi>object great enough,</hi> they may be raised in us to such a degree, as to <hi>amaze</hi> and <hi>confound us in a moment.</hi> A man may be in such a fright upon the sudden, as not to know what he doth, as we see by daily experience; and the case is the same in the others likewise. And the reason of this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>these</hi> passions and the <hi>former</hi> is this, because the <hi>suffering of evil</hi> is far more repugnant to <hi>self-preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>self-love,</hi> which are the fundamental principle of all our passions, than the <hi>absence of good.</hi> For if we sit without that good which would move our <hi>love</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,</hi> we are still where we were: but if we fall under that evil, which excites our <hi>fear,</hi> we are made misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and much the worse: that is only a denial of a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delight; but this is a real deprivation, and a step towards destruction. And since our self-love and self-preservation are so much more nearly concerned in the suffering of evil, than in the absence of good; our passions, which are only their several aspects and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, must needs be more quick and violent in that than they are in this, and the discomposure upon them will be so likewise.</p>
               <p>This difference there is betwixt our <hi>inconsiderateness</hi> upon the <hi>violent fears of evil,</hi> and upon our <hi>violent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires</hi> and <hi>pursuit of good.</hi> Which is observed by our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> in an instance where both were <hi>criminal</hi>; in which notwithstanding the discomposure upon the <hi>fears of evil,</hi> being fit to plead the more excuse, made the transgression that ensued upon it to be a lesser sin. For both the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> concurred in the grievous sin of shedding <hi>innocent blood</hi> when they <hi>crucified</hi> and <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered him.</hi> In which wicked action, that which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>them</hi> was <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 27.18.</note> 
                  <hi>envy</hi> and <hi>malice,</hi> but that which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with <hi>him,</hi> was his <hi>fear of their calumnies,</hi> and of
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:66440:296"/>
the <hi>anger of the Roman Emperour.</hi> For in his <hi>own heart</hi> he was minded to <note n="c" place="margin">John. 18 38, 39.</note> 
                  <hi>release him,</hi> being <hi>convinced of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,</hi> and <note n="d" place="margin">John 19 8.</note>

                  <hi>Rabble</hi> did afterwards, was a Title whereof the Emperour would be extremely jealous: therefore he gives him up to their will, fearing lest, if he did not, he should be traduced as no Friend to that most jealous Prince <hi>Tiberius Caesar.</hi> And when <hi>Christ</hi> himself comes to pass Judgment in comparison of <hi>his</hi> offence and <hi>theirs, He who delivered me unto thee,</hi> saith he, <hi>hath the greater sin,</hi> Joh. 19.11.</p>
               <p>Those discomposures then of our knowing Faculties, which are innocent, and fit to excuse our inconsiderate slips which proceed from them; are such as spring from an <hi>unwill'd sudden grief,</hi> or <hi>anger,</hi> but especially from an <hi>unwill'd sudden fear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To make it <hi>unwill'd,</hi> I say, it must be sudden; for if our <hi>fear</hi> it self, which is a passion that amazes more than all the rest, doth not presently effect any thing, but stays some considerable time, and reigns long before it produces any sinful action: then it is a matter of our <hi>own choice,</hi> being it is a fear of our <hi>own indulging.</hi> We give it room and entertainment, we feed it, or give way to it; and that makes our fear to become our sin, which can never serve for our vindication.</p>
               <p>For a true <hi>Christian</hi> must be as <hi>bold</hi> as a <hi>Lyon,</hi> and fear nothing so much as the <hi>disobedience of his God,</hi> and the <hi>breach of his Duty.</hi> But as for other things, which men use to be afraid of, whether they be loss of <hi>Fame,</hi> of <hi>Estate,</hi> of <hi>Friends,</hi> of <hi>Liberty,</hi> or even of <hi>Life</hi> it self; though he may justly fear and avoid them, when he can <hi>innocently</hi>; yet if they are the <hi>burden of the Cross imposed upon the doing of his Duty,</hi> he must chearfully

                  <hi>take it up,</hi> and not fear and fly from, but overlook and contemn them. For God will make us an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Recompence in the next World, for any thing which we part with for his sake in this. And therefore he indispensably requires us, as in all reason he very well may, not to fear and shrink from the loss of any thing, even of life it self, when he calls for it; but in Faith of his Promises, and in hope of his Rewards, most couragiously to undergo it. <hi>Persecutions</hi> and <hi>Dangers,</hi> which are the great objects of our fears, are the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est tryals of our obedience, for which reason they are so often in Scripture called <note n="h" place="margin">2 Pet. 2.11. 1 Cor. 10.13. Jam. 1.2, 3.</note> Temptations; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their business is to evidence how much we will part with for obedience, but by no means to excuse us when we disobey. But in relation to them Christs command is this: <hi>Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but fear him who can cast both body and soul into Hell,</hi> Mat. 10.28. And if we suffer our fears of them to chase us away from the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Religion, or to drive us from the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his Will; his Sentence against us is plain and peremptory: <hi>Whosoever is ashamed of me and my words,</hi> and dare not owne them, although it be <hi>in</hi> a <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that is <hi>sinful and adulterous,</hi> wherein he will be sure to suffer for the profession of them; <hi>of him shall the Son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the Glory of his Father with his holy Angels,</hi> Mark 8.38.</p>
               <p>As for all <hi>Fear</hi> then <hi>which drives us from our Duty,</hi> it is our <hi>fault</hi>; and if we <hi>stand</hi> and <hi>pause</hi> upon it, and have time to <hi>deliberate</hi> and arm our selves against it; if we fear still, our fear is our <hi>wilful</hi> and <hi>deadly sin,</hi> and doth not <hi>excuse,</hi> but <hi>deserve our condemnation.</hi> And such was the <hi>fear of Peter</hi> that made him <hi>deny his Lord,</hi> which cost him so many <hi>penitential tears</hi> to wash off the stain of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.75.

And when it doth so, it is forced upon us, and is not chosen by us; we are hurried into it without our own consent, and cast upon it whether we will or no: and since the inconsideration it self is thus involuntary, the slips upon it are excusable, and such as God will not severely punish, but has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways prone to pardon and dispense with.</p>

               </p>
               <p>If we have <hi>Time</hi> to think, but our minds are <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi> and <hi>distempered,</hi> which makes them unfit to think and consider in it, as it happens in the cases of a <hi>great weariness,</hi> and a <hi>violent sudden passion</hi> mentioned above; there, 'tis true, we have no choice, because we have not all that is necessary to consideration. But if we have <hi>ability</hi> and <hi>power</hi> as well as <hi>time</hi> and <hi>leisure,</hi> our thoughts are at our own choice, and if we transgress inconsiderately, the fault is our own; for we might have helped it if we would, and if we will not, we must answer for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. No sin is innocently inconsiderate which is of a <hi>mischievous nature,</hi> and <hi>greatly criminal.</hi> For if a man has not brought himself into a <hi>habit of sin,</hi> and under a <hi>great hardness of heart</hi> (which is always his own fault, and subjects him to a most dreadful punishment) his own Soul must needs <hi>give back,</hi> and his <hi>Conscience bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle</hi> at every <hi>great offence</hi>; and where he doubts and demurs, he cannot say he is rash and inconsiderate.

them without <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>doubtings, disputes</hi> and <hi>conflicts</hi> in his own soul. He must consider them over and over, and view them on one side and on the other, before he can be able to master his own fears, and work himself into courage sufficient to venture on them.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>lesser</hi> sins indeed, a mans Conscience has not so quick a sense, nor so great a dread of them; and therefore he may be surprized sometimes into the commission of them before he considers of them. A good man may speak a <hi>rash word,</hi> and be <hi>carelesly angry,</hi> or <hi>triflingly peevish,</hi> through <hi>surprize</hi> and <hi>suddenness</hi>; but he cannot <hi>contrive the death of his neighbour,</hi> or <hi>stab a man to the heart, without fear</hi> and <hi>consideration.</hi> He may be insnared unawares into a <hi>wanton eye,</hi> or a <hi>lascivous thought</hi>; but he cannot fall into an act of <hi>fornication</hi> and <hi>adultery,</hi> till he might look about him, and should bethink himself. He may rashly and unadvisedly be guilty of an <hi>uncharitable censure,</hi> of a <hi>surly behaviour,</hi> of a <hi>discourteous, uncondescensive, uncandid</hi> action: but he cannot <hi>slander his neighbour,</hi> or entertain <hi>malice, wrath,</hi> and <hi>implacable enmity</hi> against him, without deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, unless it be his own fault that he will not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate, and consider of them. He may run before he bethinks himself into a <hi>covetous wish,</hi> but not into <hi>fraud</hi> and <hi>circumvention,</hi> into <hi>theft</hi> and <hi>robbery,</hi> into <hi>perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> and <hi>oppression</hi>: and the like is observable in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther instances. These <hi>lesser</hi> sins, which are acted in more <hi>haste,</hi> and need less deliberation, because mens consciences are less sensible and afraid of them, men may, and very often do commit inconsiderately and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advisedly; they are surprized into them before they bethinks themselves, and consider of them.</p>
               <p>But then as for <hi>greater sins,</hi> which either <hi>imply thought</hi> and <hi>contrivance,</hi> or <hi>require time</hi> and <hi>leisure,</hi> or, for the heinousness of their guilt, are <hi>frightful unto conscience</hi>;
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:66440:299"/>
we can have no excuse of inconsideration when we fall under them. Some, I say, <hi>imply thought</hi> and <hi>contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,</hi> as <hi>fraud</hi> and <hi>circumvention</hi>; others <hi>require time,</hi> and a long stay upon the very commission of them, as <hi>rapes</hi> and <hi>adulteries, thefts</hi> and <hi>robberies, drunkenness</hi> and <hi>revellings, wrath, anger,</hi> and <hi>malice</hi>; and all of them are <hi>frightful</hi> and <hi>terrifying</hi> to any <hi>honest,</hi> and <hi>truly tender Conscience.</hi> And when we think and contrive for them, or dwell long upon them, or are frighted with them, and put into doubts and disputes, fears and demurs about them; it is gross non-sence and absurd contradiction to say that we did we wist not what, and committed them when we could not consider of them. So that as for any sin which is of a <hi>mischievous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> or <hi>greatly criminal,</hi> unless it be our own fault, and we have made our Consciences hard and callous, we cannot venture on it without considering it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we cannot act it without checks and fears of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science about it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. No sin is innocently and involuntarily inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, which <hi>we do not endeavour and strive against.</hi> To <hi>endeavour</hi> against all sin is in our own power, and at our own choice, although it be not perfectly to <hi>overcome</hi> it and get free from it. For our endeavours are our own, and are either put forth, or omitted at our own pleasure; so that it is only because we would have it so if they are wanting. And therefore if we are inconsiderate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we refused, and wilfully neglected to prevent it; our inconsideration enters upon our own choice, and is so far owing to our own will. For we were willing to come under it, and would not strive against it; and so far as it was willed by us, it may be charged upon us, and imputed to condemn us.</p>
               <p>Let no man therefore indulge himself in an inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derateness of sinning, and take no pains against it, but
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:66440:299"/>
quietly submit to it, out of a fond conceit of being excused upon his inconsideration. For if he make no opposition to his inconsiderateness, but carelesly lays himself open to it, and idly waits for it; he makes it cease to be wholly his infirmity, and in some measure to become his fault. Because it is so far an effect of his own will, as it is of his wilful negligence; and as he wills it, he shall not be excused, but put to answer and account for it.</p>
               <p>But if any man expect to have his inconsiderate slips excused as involuntary and innocent, he must not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge to them, or quietly wait for them, but seriously endeavour and strive against them. 'Tis true indeed, he cannot <hi>resolve against all,</hi> because he cannot <hi>live free from all</hi>; and what a man cannot perform, it is down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right folly and gross absurdity to resolve upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of. No man in his wits resolves to be as <hi>wise</hi> as <hi>Solomon,</hi> to <hi>support a Mill-stone</hi> by his own strength, or to <hi>destroy</hi> a <hi>vast Army</hi> by his <hi>single valour.</hi> For since these things cannot be done by him, if he understands what he doth, he cannot resolve to do them. And therefore as for the being wholly freed from all infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and never falling by inconsideration; it is utterly absurd for any man to resolve upon it, because no man can ever attain unto it. But although we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve against all inconsiderate slips, yet can we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to get quit of them, and strive against them. For <hi>we may endeavour to do what is not to be done</hi>; and do as much of it as we can, although we are not able to do it all. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himself <hi>endeavoured,</hi> and exhorts <hi>all others who were perfect</hi> to such acceptable degrees as he was, to endeavour with him after a state of <hi>absolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> although none of them all would ever be able in this life to arrive to it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.14, 15. They could not resolve upon it indeed, because they could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:66440:300"/>
it; but they could and ought to endeavour after it, and to attain so far as they had power, when they could not so far as they desired. And after that rate must we strive against all inconsiderate transgressions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. For although we shall never get wholly free from them, yet still must we take pains against them; but if they seize upon us through a neglect of our own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, they seize upon us through our own will; and then they are unfit to be judged involuntary.</p>

For if our wills are not displeased with our offence, when once we come to discern our selves guilty of it, nor seek, by begging Gods pardon, as far as may be to undo it; it is manifest that really they were not against it. They did not chuse it, 'tis true, when it was acted, because then they were not made to see it; but afterwards they make it their own as much as may be, by showing how readily they are bent and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined for it. They are not at all sorry for it, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of it, but take a pleasure and delight in it; and what can any Body judge from thence, but that they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="565" facs="tcp:66440:300"/>If therefore we would have it thought that our ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and inconsideration was at any time against our wills, we must evidence <hi>that</hi> by showing how much we are troubled, and displeased with it. Our wills must express their dislike of it, and utterly disclaim and renounce it; or else it will readily be inferred that they either had, or would have had a hand in it.</p>
               <p>After all <hi>these marks</hi> whereby to judge of an <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently,</hi> and <hi>involuntarily inconsiderate sin</hi>; I presume I have no need to adde that it must be such as is <hi>unobser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved when we venture on it.</hi> For if we see and observe it, it is not possible that it should be any longer incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate. And therefore no man may look upon his sin, and say, Is it not a little one, and yet after that venture to commit it with a confidence of being excused for it. For no <hi>known</hi> and <hi>wilful sin</hi> is little in Gods account, whatsoever it be in <hi>ours,</hi> but <hi>every offence with open eyes, and with a convinced Conscience, is deadly and damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> The man that presumed wilfully and willingly to <hi>carry a burthen of Sticks upon the Sabbath Day,</hi> under the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> was <note n="n" place="margin">Numb. 15.36.</note>

               <p>And these are such <hi>Conditions</hi> as are necessary to make our <hi>inconsiderate slips involuntary</hi> and <hi>innocent.</hi> And therefore as ever we expect that the forementioned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertencies should excuse us, we must take care that they have all these requisites.

of them where we have time and understanding,</hi> nor <hi>in any great and mischievous sin,</hi> nor <hi>without a serious endeavour against them before,</hi> and a <hi>sorrowful repentance</hi> and <hi>desire of pardon after we have committed them.</hi> All these must concur in us before our inconsiderateness excuse our sin, and rescue us from danger of Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And now I have gone through both the Particulars of our <hi>involuntary,</hi> because <hi>unknown sins,</hi> whether their involuntariness proceeds from <hi>ignorance,</hi> or <hi>inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; neither of which shall be rigorously dealt with, or imputed to us for our Condemnation.</p>
               <p>And thus at last we see, what in the beginning of this <hi>Book</hi> I proposed to inquire of; <hi>viz. what are the mitigations of that integrity of obedience which is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-condition of happiness, and what are those defects; which it bears and dispenses with.</hi> And the result of all is this: <hi>That the integrity of obedience, which the Gospel indispensably exacts of us, is an integrity of our chosen actions.</hi> And therefore <hi>if wittingly and wilfully we trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress any one Commandment, we are under the Curse which the Gospel threatens; but if we transgress several unwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly and against our wills, we are out of the reach of it, and intire in Gods account still.</hi> We do not lose our integrity, or break the condition <hi>by every slip of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> whether that whereof we are ignorant be <hi>some Law that forbids any sin,</hi> or <hi>our present actions being forbid by it:</hi> nor <hi>by every slip of inconsideration,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our inconsiderateness proceed from <hi>suddenness</hi> or <hi>surprize,</hi> from <hi>weariness,</hi> or from the <hi>discomposure</hi> and <hi>disturbance of our thinking Faculties.</hi> For not any of these Failings will <hi>deprive us of that, which Christs Gospel will construe to be a perfect and intire obedience</hi>; they do not <hi>destroy a state of Grace</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> but <hi>consist</hi> with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="567" facs="tcp:66440:301"/>And all these <hi>allowances</hi> the Gospel makes to our <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful actions</hi>; besides some others to our <hi>thoughts</hi> and <note n="o" place="margin">See Book 5. Chap. 4.</note>

                  <p>The Rigour of the Mosaick Law is taken away by Christ, who came to preach Pardon upon Repentance where that denounced an unavoidable punishment. Repentance is the great Remedy. God heartily desires mens Repentance, and promises Forgiveness to it. This has been preached in all times. The Remedy for our unknown sins. They are uncapable of a particular Prayer and Repentance, but are forgiven upon a general one. The Remedy of wilful sins is a particular Repentance. That is available for their pardon; for wilful sins after Baptism, as well as before it. Two places, which seem to deny all pardon to wilful sins after Baptism, cleared; the wilful sin, <hi>Heb 10.26,</hi> is not any wilful transgression of any particular Law of Christ, which have all been pardone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

things there spoken of it. The falling away men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Heb. 6,</hi> is likewise Apostasie from Christianity, which is shewn from those things which they are said to fall from, and those others which are said to be implied in their falling. An account of the desperate state of these men. The state of some habitual Sinners desperate and irreclaimable, by reason their period of Grace is over, but this is no discouragement to any mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving hitherto insisted largely upon that <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of Obedience</hi> which the Gospel indispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly requires of every man to his Salvation; and upon those <hi>Defects</hi> which either <hi>destroy,</hi> or <hi>consist</hi> with it: I proceed now to inquire <hi>what Remedies it directs us to for recovering a state of Grace and Favour, when at any time we happen to fall from it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Jews,</hi> according to the strictness of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> the punishment took place upon the first wilful breach; and therefore in those Laws which were established under pain of death, when it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by sufficient evidence, that any man was guilty of the wilful transgression of them, the Sentence was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable, and the man dyed without mercy. <hi>He that despised Moses's Law,</hi> saith the Apostle, if it were in an instance whereto the Law threatned death, <hi>dyed without mercy,</hi> being convicted <hi>under the hands of two or three witnesses,</hi> Heb. 10.28. A man that had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>Murder,</hi> or <hi>Adultery,</hi> or any other crime, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Death</hi> was the <hi>established Penalty,</hi> was to dye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all remedy; for no <hi>Sacrifice</hi> would be accepted for him, nor would the Law admit of any <hi>favour</hi> or <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation.</hi> And therefore <hi>David,</hi> when he made his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential Psalm for <hi>murdering Vriah,</hi> and <hi>adulterating his Wife,</hi> expresses the <hi>Legal unpardonableness</hi> of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:66440:303"/>
in these words —<hi>thou desirest not sacrifice, else would I give it; but thou delightest not in burnt-offerings</hi> for such sins as I stand guilty of. No, my crimes are of that nature, for which any man less than a King should dye, and such wherefore no Sacrifice will be accepted, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.16.</p>
               <p>This was the rigour of that <hi>Political Law,</hi> which God imposed upon the <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Moses</hi>; those punishments that were threatned by it, which were <hi>temporal</hi> and of this World, were irreversible, when once they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred.</p>
               <p>But when <hi>Christ</hi> came into the World, his business was to give Laws of a much more gracious nature, which would admit of a Salvo for every sin, and offer men a remedy, which if they did but use, although they had transgressed, they should not suffer punishment.</p>
               <p>This <hi>gracious Covenant,</hi> whose Promises and Rewards are <hi>future,</hi> and to be enjoy'd in the next World, was published more or less ever since <hi>Adam.</hi> For by the Grace of this, all the holy <hi>Patriarchs</hi> hoped for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; and by it likewise all the <hi>Good men</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they should be brought to Gods Tribunal in the next World, hoped to be forgiven. But the Promulgation of it under <hi>Moses</hi> was <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>obscure,</hi> and lay hid in great measure, and almost buried under the crowd of the <hi>rigid</hi> and <hi>inexorable Laws</hi> of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saick Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when <hi>Christ</hi> came into the World, his Errand was to abrogate all the rigour of <hi>Moses's Law,</hi> and to preach an <hi>universal Pardon</hi> upon <hi>Repentance.</hi> And of this he gave them a clear instance in the case of the <hi>Woman,</hi> who was taken in the very <hi>act of Adultery. Moses,</hi> say they, and that very truly, <note n="a" place="margin">Lev. 20.10.</note> 
                  <hi>commanded us</hi> in his Law <hi>that such should be stoned; but what sayest thou?</hi> Joh. 8.5. But his Sentence was, <hi>Go and sin no
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:66440:303"/>
more, and then will not I condemn thee,</hi> v. 11; which was a fit sentence for that Religion, <hi>whereby they should be justified from all those things, from which they could not be justified by the Law of Moses,</hi> Act. 13.39.</p>
               <p>Whatsoever it was therefore under the rigour of the <hi>meer Law</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> under the <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Law of Christ</hi> our case is not become quite desperate, and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable upon the first offence. It is not every <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful sin,</hi> and much less our <hi>slips of ignorance</hi> and <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,</hi> which can for ever exclude us from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, and incapacitate us for his Mercy. No, the Religion of Christ is not a Religion that seeks ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of us, and shuts us up close Prisoners of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as soon as we are guilty of any thing which may deserve it: For Christ need never have come into the World for that end, since the Law had rendred us accursed and miserable enough already. But he came on a quite contrary Errand, to be the Minister of Life and Pardon, and not to seal us up to eternal Death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the first wilful transgression, but to procure for us remission of all our deadly and damning sins, and to restore us out of a state of Enmity and Death, to a state of Mercy and Reconciliation. He came to find out a remedy for all our evils, and to prescribe us a way of recovering our selves when we had fallen by any sin; so that although none of us all have lived free from it, yet in the event sin shall not be our ruine.</p>
               <p>And that remedy which God has provided us for this purpose, is <hi>Repentance.</hi> He doth not abandon us upon the commission of every sin; but <hi>he is heartily desirous that we should repent of it,</hi> and when we do so, <hi>he has obliged himself by his Truth and Faithfulness to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is <hi>heartily desirous,</hi> I say, <hi>that whensoever we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any sin we should repent of it.</hi> If we dare take his
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:66440:304"/>
own word, he tells us, <hi>as he lives, that he doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the death of any sinner, but that the wicked turn from his way, and live: turn you, turn you,</hi> as he goes on, <hi>from your evil ways; for why will you dye, O house of Israel?</hi> Ezek. 33.11. And this all the World expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience by him, in his <hi>long-suffering</hi> and <hi>forbearance</hi> with them. For he doth not exact the punishment so soon as we have incurred it; but expects long to see if we will return and repent, that then he may with honour pardon and remit it; this being, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> assures us, the end of his <hi>forbearance</hi> and <hi>long-suffering, to lead us to repentance,</hi> Rom. 2.4. And what S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> says, that we all <hi>experience.</hi> For during all that time wherein he bears with us, how <hi>restless</hi> and <hi>unwearied, earnest</hi> and <hi>affectionate</hi> are his <hi>endeavours</hi> for this purpose? He <hi>admonishes us of our faults by his Word,</hi> and <hi>by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi>; he <hi>invites us to return by his Love,</hi> and <hi>by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi>; he <hi>moves us to bethink our selves by his Spirit,</hi> and <hi>by his Providences</hi>; and if we are <hi>stubborn,</hi> and not to be thus gently won by these <hi>methods of mildness,</hi> he seeks to reclaim us by a <hi>blessed,</hi> and a <hi>most affectionate force</hi> and <hi>violence.</hi> For he <hi>corrects</hi> us with his <hi>Rod,</hi> and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits us in chastisement, and never ceases to try all means of reducing us to a sense of our sin and repentance, till we are become <hi>plainly incorrigible,</hi> and <hi>utterly rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious,</hi> and so fit for nothing but to be <hi>swallowed up of ruine.</hi> And yet even then his desire of reclaiming us is so <hi>strong,</hi> and his love so <hi>affectionate</hi>; that he scarce knows how to give us <hi>over. How shall I give thee up,</hi> saith he, <hi>O Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, O Israel?</hi> Hos. 11.8.</p>
               <p>And <hi>when we do repent,</hi> I say, <hi>he has obliged himself by his Truth and Faithfulness most graciously to forgive us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the Doctrine of the <hi>Prophets. Let the

wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord,</hi> says Isaiah, <hi>for he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon,</hi> Isa. 55.7. <hi>If the wicked man,</hi> says God by <hi>Ezekiel, will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not dye.</hi> All his <hi>transgressions, which he hath</hi> formerly <hi>committed, shall not be mentioned unto him, but in his righteousness, that he hath done</hi> since, <hi>he shall live. For have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should dye, saith the Lord God? and not that he should turn from his ways and live?</hi> Ezek. 18 21, 22, 23.</p>

                  <hi>Luke, in all the Country about Jordan, came preaching the Baptism of repentance for the remission of sins,</hi> Luk. 3.3.</p>
               <p>Our Lord and Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> himself, when he comes after to proclaim his own Gospel, goes on with it. <hi>Jesus began to preach,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               <p>And when the <hi>Apostles</hi> came to <hi>execute their Orders,</hi> the publishing of this was all their <hi>care</hi> and <hi>practice.</hi> For they all of them went about preaching in <hi>all places,</hi> and to <hi>all persons, repentance</hi> for the <hi>remission of sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his first Sermon thus exhorts the people; <hi>Repent and be baptized every one of you for the remission of sins,</hi> Act. 2.38: and so again <hi>Act.</hi> 3. <hi>Repent and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out,</hi> v. 19. And the same he proclaims more <hi>generally</hi> in his second Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, assuring all Christians, that the <hi>Lord is not willing that any man should perish, but that all should come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> which is sure to prevent it, 2 Pet. 3.9.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> preaches to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that <hi>now God had commanded all men every where to repent,</hi> Act. 17.30.</p>
               <p>And St. <hi>John</hi> assures us, that by virtue of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Covenant which was confirmed with us in Christs Blood, <hi>if</hi> with repenting hearts <hi>we confess our sins, he is faithful</hi> to his word, <hi>and just</hi> to his promise <hi>to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from</hi> the guilt and stain of <hi>all unrighteousness</hi> of one sort or other, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9.</p>

                  <hi>Covenant of remission of sins upon repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> God <hi>most earnestly desires that we should repent,</hi> and <hi>he is most truly and faithfully willing to forgive us all our former sins upon our true repentance.</hi> Nay I might add, he is not only <hi>willing,</hi> but extremely <hi>joyful</hi> and <hi>glad of the occasion.</hi> For it is his highest pleasure to go out and meet a <hi>returning Soul</hi>; and the joy of his heart to embrace a <hi>reclaimed Penitent,</hi> as our Saviour has most clearly intimated to us in the most <hi>welcome reception</hi> of the <hi>returning Prodigal,</hi> Luk. 15.11, 12, &amp;c. <hi>There is</hi> a general <hi>joy</hi> in the Heavenly Court, says our Saviour again, and <hi>in the presence of all the Angels of God,</hi> even <hi>over</hi> any <hi>one sinner that repenteth,</hi> Luk. 15.10: nay <hi>there is more joy over one penitent, than</hi> there is <hi>over ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance,</hi> v. 7.</p>

               <p>And this remedy is <hi>adequate</hi> to all our needs, and able to regain all that which our sins at any time have made us lose. For it will repair the breach upon all sorts of offences, whether they be our <hi>known</hi> or <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,</hi> our <hi>voluntary</hi> or <hi>involuntary</hi> sins.

               <p>This remedy of repentance, I say, God has fitted for all sorts of transgressions; whether they be,

               <p n="1">1. Our <hi>unknown</hi> and <hi>secret</hi> sins have the benefit of
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:66440:306"/>
this remedy, and that whereupon God will pardon them is a <hi>general repentance,</hi> and a <hi>general prayer for forgiveness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for several both of our <hi>voluntary</hi> and <hi>involuntary</hi> sins, they are <hi>secret</hi> and <hi>concealed</hi> from us, and quite without our <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>remembrance.</hi> We are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant and in the dark about them, and our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences have no more sense of them, than they have of those which we were never guilty of. For as for our <hi>involuntary sins,</hi> in <hi>some</hi> of them we are wholly <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi> and never think them sinful; and in <hi>others</hi> we are <hi>inconsiderate,</hi> and do not many times observe that we sin in them. And as for our <hi>voluntary</hi> and <hi>wilful</hi> sins, though we know full well, and observe when we at first commit them; yet doth our knowledge of them, as of other things, slip out of our minds by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and through length of time, and throng of other thoughts, at last we quite <hi>forget</hi> them.</p>
               <p>And these sins being thus <hi>quite out of our thoughts,</hi> and wholly <hi>secret</hi> and <hi>unknown</hi> to us; we cannot <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly</hi> either <hi>beg pardon for them,</hi> or <hi>repent of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We cannot, I say, <hi>particularly beg pardon for them.</hi> For no man can become a suiter in behalf of he knows not whom, nor recommend any thing to Gods mercy before he has discovered it himself. And since these particular sins are secret and unknown, they cannot be the matter of a particular prayer and recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Nor can we <hi>particularly repent</hi> of them. As for our <hi>wilful</hi> sins indeed, whether we <hi>remember</hi> them or have <hi>forgot</hi> them, the case is the same as to <hi>one prime part</hi> of a <hi>particular repentance,</hi> viz. <hi>our forsaking of them,</hi> and <hi>beginning to obey that particular known Law which we had wilfully sinned against.</hi> We must retract <hi>every</hi> volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary sin by a voluntary obedience, and without this we
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:66440:306"/>
can have no just hopes of pardon. For there is no hopes of salvation to any man but upon a <hi>particular obedience to all known Laws</hi>; so that when once he sees and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands a Duty, he must obey it particularly before he can expect to live by it. But now as for <hi>those Laws</hi> which are transgressed by our <hi>wilful</hi> sins, they are all <hi>known,</hi> since we could not will and chuse to disobey them, unless we saw and knew our selves to be bound by them. So that whether we had sinned against them formerly, or no; whether we remember it, or have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got it; obedience to them is our present Duty, and a Duty too so necessary, that without it we cannot be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. If therefore we have sinned against any such known Law we must amend it, and leave off wilfully to repeat it; for our obedience to all them is necessary to our pardon, and whether we remember or have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got that we transgressed <hi>formerly,</hi> as to the present it is all one, for we must chuse to obey now.</p>
               <p>As for our <hi>wilful</hi> sins then, which being long since acted, are now quite <hi>forgotten</hi> and <hi>unknown,</hi> one great act of a particular repentance is necessary to their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>viz. conversion or new obedience</hi> and <hi>reformation.</hi> For all <hi>wilful</hi> sins are transgressions of <hi>known</hi> Laws, and whether a man has broken or kept it <hi>formerly,</hi> a <hi>present</hi> obedience in all chosen actions to every such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Law is necessary to put him into a <hi>state of mercy</hi> and <hi>salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as for other acts of a particular repentance, <hi>viz. confession, sorrow, detestation,</hi> and the like; there is no place for them about any of our <hi>Secret,</hi> whether they be <hi>voluntary,</hi> or <hi>involuntary</hi> sins. For no man can <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess he knows not what,</hi> nor <hi>grieve he understands not why,</hi> nor <hi>hate</hi> and <hi>detest he knows not whom</hi>; so that he must particularly know his sins before he can be thus particular in his repentance of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="578" facs="tcp:66440:307"/>A <hi>particular prayer</hi> and <hi>repentance</hi> then have no place about our <hi>unknown</hi> sins; they are not capable to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised about them, and therefore they cannot be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for the pardon of them.</p>
               <p>But that <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>repentance</hi> whereof they are <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,</hi> and whereupon God will graciously <hi>forgive</hi> them, is <hi>indefinite</hi> and <hi>general.</hi> These may very well be used about them. For we may all understand thus much by our selves that we are all Sinners, and are guilty of much more than we know and can remember. Several sins slipt from us at first without our knowledge and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and several others, which were at first observed, were afterwards forgotten. And when we know this general number, although we are not able to recover any particular instance, we may very well be sorry for it, and beg God to forgive it; and so expiate them as much as may be by a <hi>general prayer</hi> and <hi>repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this remedy God has assigned for our <hi>unknown sins,</hi> and when we make use of it he will forgive them. Holy <hi>David</hi> was very sensible that he laboured under many such <hi>secret faults,</hi> and by this means of a <hi>general penitential prayer,</hi> he endeavours to procure their <hi>pardon. Who,</hi> says he, <hi>can understand his errours? Cleanse thou me from my secret faults,</hi> Psal. 19.12. And because such sins are daily slipping from us, that our remedy might be as near as our disease, our Lord has put into our daily prayers this general petition for our expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Forgive us our trespasses,</hi> Matth. 6.12.</p>
               <p>As for this first sort then, our <hi>unknown</hi> and <hi>secret</hi> sins, a <hi>general prayer</hi> and <hi>repentance</hi> is their remedy. If we obey all known Laws, and particularly repent of all our known transgressions; our secret and unknown sins need not lye heavy on us. For if we are honestly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of them, and use due pains and ingenuity about them; if we neither overlook them through sloth and
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:66440:307"/>
negligence, nor mistake them through partiality and wilfulness; a general and penitential prayer shall serve their turn, and restore us unto mercy and reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
               <p>And then,</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for all our <hi>known</hi> sins, God has not been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us in them neither, but has most graciously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided us of a remedy, and means of reconciliation for them, of what <hi>nature</hi> or <hi>degree</hi> soever they be. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<list>
                     <item>1. Our <hi>voluntary</hi> and <hi>wilful</hi>; or,</item>
                     <item>2. Our <hi>involuntary</hi> sins.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In the Gospel God has provided us of a remedy to restore us again to his favour, when once we have lost it through our <hi>voluntary,</hi> and <hi>wilful</hi> sins; and that remedy is a <hi>particular repentance</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>To the pardon of these it is altogether necessary that we <hi>particularly amend</hi> and <hi>forsake</hi> them. For they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt a state of love and good agreement, and set God and us at enmity and defiance. So long as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in, they keep God and men at a distance, they interpose betwixt us and his mercy, and hinder all the signs of his approbation, and all the expressions of his pardoning Grace from issuing out upon us. To restore us therefore to Gods Grace and acceptance, these vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary sins must be taken out of the way; and by a voluntary amendment and reformation, we must undo all that was done amiss in our wilful transgression. And of these sins all those places are meant, that make <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> which, as we saw above, includes in it <hi>amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> the indispensable condition of life and pardon. As when <hi>repentance and remission</hi> of sins is commanded <hi>to be preached to all Nations,</hi> Luke 24.47: and men are bid to <hi>repent,</hi> that <hi>their sins may be blotted out,</hi> Acts 3.19; or, as it is in the peremptory and severe words of
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:66440:308"/>
our Saviour, to <hi>repent, or else they shall all perish,</hi> Luke 13.3.</p>
               <p>And as this particular repentance and reformation is altogether <hi>necessary</hi> to the pardon of our wilful sins; so is it most certainly <hi>available</hi> and <hi>sufficient</hi> for them. Although they are of a most heinous guilt, and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Nature; yet is not their offence unpardonable, or their case desperate. For after a man has put himself out of a state of Grace and God's favour by them, he is not quite cast off, nor need to despair of getting in again. He is not presently upon every such offence banished this Kings Court and Presence for ever; but upon his particular repentance and reformation he will be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to recover his former station. For the preaching of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> of the <hi>Baptist,</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and of his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,</hi> was to call the <hi>wilful</hi> and all <hi>lost Sinners,</hi> both of the <hi>Jewish</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> World to this reconciliation; Christ, as himself informs us, <hi>coming to</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Matth. 18.11.</note> 
                  <hi>save that which was lost,</hi> and to <note n="e" place="margin">Matth. 9.13.</note> 
                  <hi>call all Sinners</hi> of one sort or another <hi>to repentance.</hi> Mens very <hi>Baptism</hi> or entrance into Christianity, is a cleansing of them from the guilt of <hi>all former sins without exception. Repent, and be baptized every one,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter, for the remission of sins,</hi> Acts 2.38; and <hi>be baptized,</hi> says <hi>Ananias</hi> unto <hi>Saul, and wash away</hi> all <hi>thy sins,</hi> Acts 22.16.</p>
               <p>Nay after men are once <hi>baptized,</hi> and have all their former wilful sins washt off in that <hi>water of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; yet is <hi>not every wilful sin, which they are guilty of, thenceforward irrecoverably damnable,</hi> but <hi>they are still called to accept of mercy and forgiveness upon repentance,</hi> as before. When men come under the Covenant of Grace, and list themselves under the Discipline of <hi>Christ</hi>; they do not subject themselves to a <hi>Covenant of Terror</hi> and <hi>Desperation,</hi> which takes hold of the first offence, and denounces an irrevocable enmity ever
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:66440:308"/>
after. No, a <hi>baptized offender</hi> is under the Grace of repentance as well as others. For that repentance whereto we are called by Christs Gospel, is not so much an <hi>act</hi> as a <hi>state:</hi> which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> intimates when he talks of <hi>renewing men unto repentance,</hi> that is, unto the condition and standing terms of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 6. It is of Gods Grace that there is <hi>any</hi> forgiveness, and, in order thereunto, <hi>any</hi> place for repentance at all; and of the same Grace we have received a promise of forgiveness upon repentance for <hi>all sins,</hi> and at <hi>all times</hi> whatsoever. <hi>If any man</hi> among us baptized Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians <hi>sin,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John,</hi> his case is in no wise desperate, for <hi>we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our sins,</hi> as well as <hi>for the sins of the whole</hi> unchristned <hi>world,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.1, 2. The Gospel doth not bid every <hi>wilfully offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Christian</hi> to despair, and conclude himself to be irrevocably lost, and fallen beyond remedy into a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned condition. But its design is quite another thing, to recover them again from that state of death, and to call them by repentance to mercy and forgiveness. For the Spirit of God himself writes to the <note n="f" place="margin">Rev. 2.16, 21.</note>

<pb n="582" facs="tcp:66440:309"/>
to <hi>repentance, that his spirit might be saved in the</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>day of the Lord Jesus,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.1, 5. And as for the other Members of the <hi>Church of Corinth,</hi> who were unconcerned and <hi>puffed up</hi> at such an enormous acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; he reproves them smartly, that by bringing them to a sense of their sin, he may work them into a reformation, v. 1, 2. Which good effect when he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood that his reproof had wrought upon them, he rejoyces mightily, and glories in it in his next <hi>Letter. I rejoyce,</hi> says he, that by <hi>my former letter you were made sorry,</hi> seeing it was <hi>after a godly manner,</hi> and <hi>you sorrowed to repentance:</hi> For such <hi>godly sorrow worketh repentance unto salvation,</hi> which is <hi>not to be repented of,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.8, 9, 10. And as he practised thus with <hi>baptized wilful offenders</hi> himself, so doth he instruct <hi>Timothy</hi> that he should do likewise. For he tells him, that the way whereby the man of God ought to deal with sinners, even those of the worst sort, who are not only <hi>subject,</hi> but <hi>enslaved</hi> to it, is not peremptorily to damn, and seal them up fast unto destruction: but in great meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to endeavour to reclaim them, that by recovering them to <hi>repentance,</hi> he may restore them again to life and pardon. <hi>The man of God,</hi> says he, <hi>must in meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness instruct</hi> even the refractory and contumacious, or <hi>those that oppose themselves</hi> against him, <hi>if God perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture will give them repentance, to the acknowledgment of the truth, and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the Devil, who are taken captive by him at his will,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.25, 26. And to name no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of this nature, but to summ up all in one, even those great and <hi>enormous wilful sinners,</hi> whose offences are so hainous, as to make them fit to be <hi>expelled the society of Christians</hi>; are not yet in their very <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication</hi> shut up irrecoverably under the pains of Hell, but quite contrary are endeavoured by this very
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:66440:309"/>
means to be reduced to <hi>repentance,</hi> and thereby to <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and <hi>acceptance; Excommunication</hi> it self being, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.5. And the <hi>Power of the Keys</hi> in <hi>remitting</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining sins,</hi> that is, in the excommunicating or absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of offenders, is intrusted with the Ministers of Christs Church <hi>for</hi> the <hi>edification</hi> of the excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted sinners themselves, <hi>and not for</hi> their <hi>destruction,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.8. and chap. 13.10.</p>
               <p>And by all this we see that the <hi>Grace of Christs Gospel</hi> is a <hi>grace of repentance and remission of sins</hi> all the way, both <hi>before Baptism,</hi> and also <hi>after</hi> it. In all periods, from the beginning to the end, it is an instrument of pardon and a means of peace; or a <hi>word</hi> and <hi>ministry,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>of reconciliation,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19. If we break our <hi>Baptismal vows,</hi> which are the condition of the Covenant, <hi>once,</hi> and thereby forfeit all our Right to Happiness; it gives us liberty to <hi>repeat</hi> them. For we have the freedom both in our <hi>private</hi> and our <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick prayers</hi> to renew all our good resolutions, and to make God new promises, and to undertake for the performance of that wherein we have wilfully failed by new engagements. Nay it doth not only allow that we <hi>may</hi> thus renew the Covenant; but it requires that we <hi>should:</hi> it <hi>has appointed an Ordinance,</hi> the <hi>Eucharist</hi> or <hi>Lords Supper</hi> I mean, <hi>for this very purpose.</hi> For the Bread and Wine which we eat and drink there, our Saviour tells us is a <hi>Federal form,</hi> the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> or, according to the manner of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Nations, who ratified their Covenants by eating and drinking together, the <hi>re-entring</hi> or <hi>confirming of that Covenant, which was at first sealed</hi> and <hi>confirmed in his Blood.

And this he has not only <hi>allowed,</hi> but <hi>injoyned</hi> to all his Disciples— <hi>Do this,</hi> says he, <hi>in remembrance of me.</hi> And that not only at <hi>one time,</hi> as it is with Baptism, but at <hi>all times</hi> during your whole lives; for in this manner of a Federal <hi>eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>drinking of this Bread and Wine, you must shew forth the Lords death always,</hi> even <hi>till he come</hi> again the second time, <hi>i. e.</hi> unto the worlds end, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24, 25, 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Forgiveness of sins</hi> then <hi>upon repentance</hi> is a <hi>Grace which is begun in Baptism, and ever after continued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repeated in every Prayer, and sealed in every Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the end of our lives.</hi> So that no wilful sin can damn us, if we repent of it; but the damned accursed sinner is only he who lives and dyes <hi>impenitent.</hi> Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as that very sin, for which St. <hi>Paul</hi> says there is no benefit from Christs Death, nor any help of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice under the Gospel; is therefore excluded from all <hi>Grace of pardon,</hi> because it is from all <hi>possibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> For therein it is that the <hi>irrecoverableness</hi> of those lost sinners consists— <hi>It is impossible,</hi> says he, <hi>to renew them to repentance,</hi> Heb. 6.6.</p>
               <p>Thus then, we see, that Christs Gospel has afforded us a remedy even for our wilful sins, whether they be committed <hi>before Baptism,</hi> or <hi>after</hi> it, at one time or at another, at all without exception; so that although sometimes we do fall under them, yet we shall not be eternally condemned for them. Let us but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent particularly therefore and amend it, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever sin we have wilfully been guilty of, our work is done. For our repentance shall set us straight, and our reformation will make us innocent; and if we are careful to do so no more, our offence will be looked upon as if it never had been done at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="585" facs="tcp:66440:310"/>But against this <hi>pardonableness of our wilful sins after our belief of the Gospel,</hi> and <hi>Baptism into the Christian Faith</hi>; some perhaps may be ready to object <hi>two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> from St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> wherein he may seem to teach us a more <hi>rigorous</hi> and <hi>severe Lesson.</hi>

               <p>In the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

               <p>And in the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Chapter,</hi> to the eternal Terror of all <hi>willing</hi> and <hi>wilful Back-sliders,</hi> he speaks thus to the same purpose: <hi>It is impossible for those who were once enlightned, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the holy Ghost, and have tasted the good word of God; if after all this they shall fall away,</hi> to be again recovered, or for any of us <hi>to renew them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; seeing they crucifie to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame,</hi> v. 4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>But now if our <hi>wilful sins after Baptism</hi> and belief of the Gospel be thus <hi>desperate,</hi> and utterly excluded from all hopes of cure and benefit of Expiation by Christs Sacrifice, as the Apostle in these places seems to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate: how can the Gospel be truly called a <hi>Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Reconciliation, Grace,</hi> and <hi>Pardon,</hi> towards all sorts of <hi>wilful sins?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To take off all this difficulty I will answer to the places severally, that all those good minds, which are wont to be perplexed by them, may be more perfectly relieved by a <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>distinct</hi> understanding of them.</p>
               <p>First then, to begin with that, the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of his Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> are

I have set down the place at large, that the very <hi>Text</hi> it self may afford us an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated proof of the ensuing Explication.</p>
               <p>But now as for this sin, which, being wilfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted after the belief and acknowledgment of Christs
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:66440:311"/>
Gospel, is here said to have no help from Christs Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, nor any benefit of his Propitiation: it is <hi>not the sinful transgression of every Law of Christ, no nor of any one</hi>; but a <hi>total Apostasie and abrenunciation of them all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The sin, I say, which being <hi>wilfully committed</hi> after the belief of Christs Gospel is here said to exclude us from all benefit of Christs Sacrifice, is <hi>not the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of any of Christs Laws whatsoever, nay nor of any one.</hi> For the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were guilty of the <hi>wilful</hi> transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of several Laws, and that too after they had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the <hi>Faith of Christ.</hi> They were guilty of an indulged <hi>Lasciviousness, Vncleanness,</hi> and <hi>Fornication,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.21. Nay one of them was guilty of it in such an instance, as was <hi>not so much as named,</hi> and much less practised <hi>among the Gentiles</hi> themselves; <hi>viz.</hi> in a most incestuous marrying of his Step-mother, or <hi>his Fathers wife,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.1. And St. <hi>Peter,</hi> a great Apostle, after three years converse with his Lord and Master, <hi>denies him three times,</hi> and that not suddenly e're he could bethink himself, but after a due space of time between one denial and another, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.57, 58, 59. All which he did in the most <hi>aggravated</hi> manner, by accumulating <hi>perjuries</hi> and <hi>prophaneness</hi> upon the sin of disowning his Master; for when his <hi>bare word</hi> would not be believed, <hi>he began to curse and to swear that he knew him not,</hi> Mar. 14.71. All these were sins <hi>wilful</hi> in their commission, and some of them most <hi>highly cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal</hi> in their nature; but yet none of them was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the benefit of Christs Sacrifice, for they all enjoyed it. So that it is not any one transgression of a particular Law after men have embraced the Faith of Christ, which is the un-atoned sin here mentioned.</p>
               <p>But it is <hi>an utter rejecting of all the Laws of Christ, and a total Apostasie from his whole Religion.</hi> It is the
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:66440:312"/>
                  <hi>renouncing of Christs Authority,</hi> the <hi>disowning of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,</hi> and <hi>falling quite off from him to Judaism,</hi> or <hi>Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,</hi> or <hi>something directly Antichristian,</hi> which is the sin here intended.

               <p>And that this <hi>particular</hi> way of sinning, by an <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Apostasie,</hi> and <hi>falling quite off from the profession of the Christian Faith,</hi> is that very sin which is here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, will appear from all those things which are spoken of it in this place.</p>
               <p>'Tis plain from the <hi>Apostles exhortation against it— Let us hold fast,</hi> says he, <hi>the profession of our faith,</hi> and not revolt from it, v. 23.</p>
               <p>From his <hi>further disswasion from it</hi> in the <hi>verse</hi> next but one,— <hi>not forsaking the</hi> Christian <hi>Assemblies,</hi> which is a great step towards the disowning of Christ himself, <hi>as the manner of some is,</hi> v. 25.</p>
               <p>From his <hi>Character of it</hi> in the <hi>verses</hi> that follow, it being a sin that includes in it <hi>all</hi> these instances of ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation.</p>
               <p>By it we <hi>become utterly Antichristian,</hi> and <hi>Adversaries to Christ and his Religion; —the fiery indignation</hi> that is kindled by this sin, <hi>shall devour</hi> all them, who by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of it are become <hi>Adversaries,</hi> ver. 27.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="589" facs="tcp:66440:312"/>By it we <hi>deny Christ to be risen,</hi> and <hi>look upon the Son of God as yet in the Grave</hi> and <hi>under our feet</hi>; we <hi>count his blood,</hi> which was spilt for the confirmation of the New Covenant, <hi>to have been the impure</hi> and <hi>unholy blood of a Malefactor justly executed</hi>; we <hi>despise all the clear proof</hi> and <hi>convictive evidence of the Spirit of Grace,</hi> which we once thought a sufficient Argument for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and whereby we were moved to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of that truth of his, which now we contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meliously reject. Whosoever hath committed this sin, saith the <hi>Apostle,</hi> I will show him what he hath done; <hi>he hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified an holy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of Grace,</hi> ver. 29.</p>
               <p>As for the sin then which is here spoken of, it is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this; <hi>viz. a sin that is contrary to the holding fast of our Christian profession,</hi> that <hi>implies a forsaking of the Christian Assemblies,</hi> that <hi>makes us open enemies and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries to Christ and his cause,</hi> seeing thereby <hi>we deny Christ to be risen,</hi> and <hi>affirm him to have been an Impostor,</hi> and <hi>his blood to have been,</hi> like that of the Thieves which were crucified with him, <hi>unholy and impure as the blood of a Malefactor,</hi> and <hi>set at nought all the miraculous proofs,</hi> and <hi>despise all the convictive evidence of the Holy Ghost</hi> that <hi>Spirit of Grace,</hi> which hath proved to us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly that that Religion of his, which we now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, is a most certain truth of God. All <hi>these marks</hi> are evidently attributed to that sin which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle here speaks of; and then what can any man think it to be less, than an <hi>absolute Apostasie from the whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> and an <hi>utter abrenunciation of all the Laws of Christ?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now whosoever <hi>wilfully</hi> falls under this, I confess he is in a very deplorable and most desperate case. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:66440:313"/>
for him, as saith the Apostle, <hi>there remains no more benefit</hi> from Christs Propitiation or <hi>Sacrifice for sin</hi>: He has affronted that so enormously, that God will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver suffer him to be the better by it. And this to a <hi>Jew</hi> ought to be no <hi>uncouth</hi> or <hi>surprizing Doctrine,</hi> seeing he who thus renounced <hi>Moses</hi> could have no Sacrifice to atone for him. For no propitiation was allowed for him who <hi>wilfully rejected any one particular Command of Moses,</hi> but least of all if he had <hi>apostatized from the whole Law. He that despised</hi> even any one particular threatning death in <hi>Moses's Law, died without mercy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der two or three Witnesses.</hi> But now this <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Law of Moses</hi> was sealed only in the <hi>blood of Bulls and Goats</hi>; whereas this <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Law of Christ,</hi> which these men renounce that I am speaking of, was confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his <hi>own blood: Moses,</hi> the Authour of that Law, was but a <hi>Servant</hi>; whereas <hi>Christ,</hi> the Authour of this, was a <hi>Son.</hi> If then the revolting from <hi>Moses</hi> was so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable, that it inevitably incurred death, and put a man out of all hopes of propitiation and benefit of Sacrifice; <hi>of how much sorer punishment,</hi> as he most ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally argues, must all Apostates from Christ <hi>be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted worthy,</hi> who by their falling away from his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <hi>tread under foot the Son of God himself,</hi> a Person infinitely above <hi>Moses; and count the blood,</hi> not of Bulls and Goats, but of the Christ of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with this <hi>Covenant</hi> was sealed, to be <hi>an unholy thing?</hi> They are indeed irrevocably plunged in death, and their apostatizing or <hi>drawing back</hi> from that Religion, which upon so good evidence they had before acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, is to their own ruine and <hi>destruction,</hi> ver. 38.</p>
               <p>But although this <hi>total apostasie</hi> and <hi>abrenunciation of Christianity</hi> it self, when 'tis <hi>wilfully committed,</hi> be thus remediless and desperate a sin; yet is that nothing to the breach of <hi>any particular Law,</hi> or to the <hi>wilful trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions

<pb n="593" facs="tcp:66440:314"/>
                  <hi>gifts of God,</hi> as are afforded to persons baptized; from the <hi>hopes of Heaven,</hi> and all <hi>the promises</hi> and <hi>good word of God</hi>; from the <hi>gift of tongues,</hi> and <hi>other effects of the Holy Ghost,</hi> whereof, upon the <hi>imposition of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles hands,</hi> they had been made <hi>Partakers</hi>; and from the <hi>power of working miracles,</hi> that were so conspicuous under the appearance of Christ, those times of <hi>Messiah,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to call the <hi>Age</hi> or <hi>world to come. If those,</hi> says the Apostle, <hi>who were once</hi> baptized or <hi>enlightned, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the holy Ghost, and have tasted of the good word</hi> or promise <hi>of God, and the powers of the world to come; if they shall fall away</hi> or apostatize from all these, <hi>it is impossible to renew them,</hi> v. 4, 5, 6. This, as is evident, is the <hi>Apostasie</hi> which is here specified, which is nothing less than a <hi>renouncing of the Baptismal Covenant,</hi> of <hi>the preaching of the Word,</hi> of <hi>the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments,</hi> of <hi>all the Gospel-promises,</hi> nay of <hi>all those miraculous gifts and powers of the Holy Ghost, whereof in the first times they were ordinarily made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>; and what can any man take this to be, but an <hi>utter renouncing of the whole Gospel</hi> and <hi>Religion of Christ?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that it is so, is still further manifest from <hi>those things which are said to be implied in their falling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For hereby they are said to <hi>condemn Christ as an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor</hi>; to <hi>justifie his murderers</hi>; to <hi>say he was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied justly,</hi> and <hi>that were he now alive, they should be ready to crucifie him over again,</hi> which is a <hi>publishing again to all the world his reproach,</hi> and a <hi>putting him anew to an open shame.</hi> By <hi>this falling away,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>they crucifie to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame,</hi> v. 6.</p>
               <p>But now thus to <hi>renounce our Baptism,</hi> and <hi>all our Christian Priviledges,</hi> to <hi>condemn Christ as a cheat and
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:66440:315"/>
Impostor,</hi> to <hi>justifie his Murderers,</hi> and to <hi>defame his Religion</hi>; what is it less than a <hi>renouncing of his Gospel,</hi> and a <hi>falling off to persecute the Christian Faith and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for this indeed, the Apostle says expresly that it is desperate, and that <hi>it is impossible for him,</hi> by any endeavours or arguings which he can use, <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new-again</hi> those who are guilty of it, to that Gospel-Covenant which they thus abjure, and which is the only gracious means of repentance and reconciliation. And since it is to no purpose, says he, I will not attempt it, but <hi>go on</hi> in speaking to those who still retain the Faith, without concerning my self to <hi>prove again the foundation</hi> to those who have apostatized from it, v. 1, 3.</p>
               <p>These wilful Apostates therefore are in a most deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable case, for they have sinned themselves out of all capacity of mercy, and transgressed beyond all reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. For there is no pardon to any wilful sinner whatsoever without he repent; but as for Apostates, <hi>it is impossible for any man to renew them again unto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their <hi>renewal I say is impossible.</hi> For as for all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane means which any men, even the <hi>Apostles</hi> of our Lord themselves, could use for their recovery; they have defeated them already. They know all the <hi>evidence of Miracles,</hi> and the <hi>demonstrations of the Spirit</hi>; nay they have not only <hi>seen</hi> them, but they themselves have been <hi>partakers of them,</hi> and <hi>impower'd to work them:</hi> but yet after all they have renounced that belief which all these perswade to, they are Armour of proof against all these demonstrations of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and <hi>Infidels to Christ</hi> notwithstanding them. So that let an Apostle himself urge any thing to them in behalf of Christs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, his Argument has been overcome before he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:66440:315"/>
it. He tells them nothing new, nor shews them any thing but what they have seen, nay what they themselves were formerly impower'd to shew to others; but all that was not strong enough to keep them in the Faith, for when they saw it all, they turned <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Apostates</hi> still.</p>
               <p>As for any <hi>humane means</hi> then, they are of no force with them, they cannot reclaim them, or bring them anew to the acknowledgment of the Gospel, which is the only gracious Ministry of Repentance and Reconciliation. So that if ever they be restored again, it must be by a <hi>Divine Power</hi>; for nothing now can possibly prevail with them but a <hi>special Providence</hi> and a <hi>special Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now here is the <hi>desperateness of their state, these will never be afforded them.</hi> For when men have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully sinned up to this height, and fallen off against so great means, and so clear conviction; God in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary methods of his Grace is resolved to concern himself no further with them, nor to trouble himself any more for their recovery. They have had all the care and cultivation of his Grace which they are like to have, and now, like <hi>barren ground,</hi> (which after all that has been laid out upon it, brings forth nothing but <hi>thorns</hi> and <hi>bryers,</hi> that are not only <hi>useless,</hi> but <hi>prickling</hi> and <hi>offensive</hi>) they are <hi>nigh unto cursing.</hi> And this is the very instance which the <hi>Apostle</hi> himself uses, and the reason which he gives of that <hi>impossibility</hi> which he had affirmed to be in that undertaking. <hi>It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,</hi> says he, for any man <hi>to renew them,</hi> because God will no longer help on his endeavours with his Grace, nor look any further after them. For with those men who are Infidels after all his care, he will deal just as he doth with ground whose fruit is evil and offensive after all his labour; and as for his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with that, 'tis plainly this. <hi>That earth</hi> indeed <hi>which
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:66440:316"/>
drinketh up the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it was dressed; recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth more</hi> blessing still <hi>from God. But that which,</hi> after it has been thus water'd, <hi>bears thorns and bryars, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and nigh unto cursing, whose end is,</hi> not to be water'd any more, but <hi>burnt up,</hi> v. 7, 8.</p>
               <p>As for these <hi>two</hi> places of the Apostle therefore in his Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> we see indeed that they speak of <hi>wilful sins beyond pardon,</hi> and of transgressions which are irremissible; but these sins are not the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful transgressions of any <hi>Christian man,</hi> but a <hi>wilful Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie from Christianity it self.</hi> So that after all it is true still, that every man, who owns the Religion, and professes the Faith of Christ, is provided of a remedy for all his wilful sins, whensoever they are committed; for let him but particularly repent of them and amend them, and he never shall be condemned for them.</p>
               <p>Nay so fast is the tye, and so inseparable is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion under the Gospel of Christ betwixt <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Remission</hi>; that, as I observed, this irremissible sin of <hi>wilful Apostasie</hi> it self, is therefore alone declared <hi>impossible to be forgiven,</hi> because it is <hi>impossible to bring men to repent of it,</hi> Heb. 6.6.</p>
               <p>If a man doth but <hi>repent</hi> then, let his sin be <hi>wilfully committed,</hi> whether <hi>before</hi> or <hi>after Baptism,</hi> it matters not; for his repentance shall set him straight in both, and his offence shall be quite forgotten, as if it had never been.</p>
               <p>Indeed if a man goes on in a <hi>constant trade of sin, silencing continually his own conscience,</hi> and <hi>grieving Gods holy Spirit,</hi> and <hi>despising all the means and offers of his Grace</hi>; he may sin himself <hi>beyond his time of mercy,</hi> and so his sins will prove irremissible, because he is gone too far ever to repent of them, which is their only remedy and means of pardon. For there is a <hi>set period of
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:66440:316"/>
Grace,</hi> and a certain season and space of time wherein God will still make the offers of his help, and of the guidance of his Spirit to reclaim and reform men. But if after all, they slight all his offers, and reject his aid, and prove utterly incorrigible; he grows weary at last, and will trouble himself no more about them, but leave them wholly to themselves. And this God plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimates concerning incorrigible <hi>Ephraim,</hi> who was just then about to be abandoned, and to be given up to the unmasterable wickedness of his own heart— <hi>How shall I give thee up,</hi> says he, <hi>O Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, O Israel?</hi> Hos. 11.8. And our Saviour says the same over <hi>intractable Jerusalem. O! if thou hadst but known, at least in this thy day, the things that belong unto thy peace</hi> with God; <hi>but now</hi> it is too late, for <hi>they are hid from thine eyes,</hi> Luk. 19.42.</p>
               <p>This, I confess, is a <hi>state of sin</hi> which is <hi>desperate</hi> and <hi>irrecoverable</hi>; not for that repentance is no sure means of remission; but because when once men are come thus far, God deserts them, so that they never can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of them.</p>
               <p>But as for <hi>the time when any man is come up to this unpardonable pitch, that only God in Heaven knows.</hi> No man can say, I am beyond my time of repentance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause without a <hi>special Revelation</hi> no man can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it. And therefore let a man have sinned never so long, yet cannot that discourage him from repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, because if he set himself seriously about it, for ought he knows, God will pity him, and afford him his Grace and Spirit, which is never wanting to such as heartily desire it, to aid and strengthen him in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Nay indeed, if a man be come so far as to bethink himself, and to be apprehensive of his danger, and to be convinced of the destructiveness of his sinful courses; there is no question to be made but that he
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:66440:317"/>
will. For the tide is turned, and the change is begun already; and that is a thing which needed God's Grace as much as any thing that is yet remaining. For a <hi>cariere in wickedness</hi> is like <hi>running down hill</hi>; the great difficulty is to make the <hi>first stop,</hi> but when once that is done, to return again is much more easie. And therefore if a man has received so much Grace, as makes him break off his evil courses for the present, and stand and deliberate with himself, whether or no he shall proceed in it; he need not doubt, if he will go on to endeavour as he has begun, but that he shall have more, till at last he is fully enabled to perfect and compleat it. He has an experimental evidence that his time of Grace is not past, he may be sure it is still with him, because it helps and works in him. For it is Grace that brings him on to what he is, and if he be but as willing to be aided by it, as it is ready to assist him, it will not fail to carry him on further. Gods Grace will still grow upon him, as his own endeavours do; so that if he make good use of this, he shall have more. For this is laid down by our Lord as a certain Rule of Divine dispensations; <hi>To him that hath,</hi> that is, maketh a right use of that Grace which he hath, <hi>shall</hi> more <hi>be given</hi> even in <hi>abundance,</hi> Mat. 25.29.</p>
               <p>Whatsoever irreconcileableness therefore there may be, and truly is in some states of sin, when men have gone on beyond their time of Grace; yet he who has so much Grace as to doubt and question, to fear and scruple, has great reason to think that, as for his part, he is not past Grace, but under it. For an <hi>irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> sinner is commonly one that is <hi>hardned</hi>; he trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresses without sense, and goes on without fear; he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated with his lusts, and lull'd asleep in his sin, and scarce ever comes to himself till he awakes in Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But if once he begins, especially in the time of
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:66440:317"/>
                  <hi>health,</hi> either through a <hi>severe reproof,</hi> or a <hi>severe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> to <hi>interrupt his sin for the present,</hi> and to <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the evil of it</hi>; and if from thence he goes on to <hi>good desires,</hi> and <hi>holy purposes of well-doing:</hi> then he feels that Grace which he is afraid he wants, and that good Spirit works in him, which he suspects to have deserted him. He is not in this irrecoverable state, but is going on towards a good recovery.</p>
               <p>Indeed if his <hi>Conscience is awakned in the height of horror,</hi> and <hi>extremity of despair,</hi> so that he is <hi>obstinate against all good advice,</hi> and <hi>dead to all endeavour,</hi> and <hi>continues to be so</hi>; this is not an effect of <hi>Grace,</hi> and a <hi>step towards repentance</hi>; but a <hi>terror of Judgment</hi> and a <hi>fore-taste of Hell.</hi> If it deads all <hi>industry</hi> by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all <hi>hope</hi>; if he <hi>complain of his estate</hi> without <hi>seeking to get out of it,</hi> and <hi>despair without all amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; this <hi>fear of heart</hi> and <hi>terror of soul,</hi> 'tis true, doth not bring him nearer unto life and pardon, but by secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him faster in his sin, it shuts him up a closer Prisoner of Condemnation.</p>
               <p>But if he be so <hi>apprehensive of his danger</hi> as to <hi>run from it</hi>; if he has so much <hi>hope</hi> as will put him upon <hi>trying all means,</hi> and <hi>using his best endeavours</hi>; if upon his apprehensions of his present evil state, he fears, and desires, and resolves, and strives to get quit of it; he is not deprived of a good Providence or of a gracious Spirit, but enjoys the benefit of them, and is conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them. He is in the way to Life, and under the recovering methods of Grace; Gods holy Spirit has not for ever abandoned him, but has begun again to work in him.</p>
               <p>And thus at last it appears, that as for all the <hi>wilful sins</hi> of any <hi>Christian</hi> man, they are in no wise desperate and helpless; but the Gospel has reached out a remedy for them to all who are willing to make use of it. For
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:66440:318"/>
let them but particularly repent of them, and amend them, and then they are safe from them. So long as they continue in the profession of the Christian Faith, and do not apostatize from it, there is no sin whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever which they wilfully commit, but is pardonable upon their repentance. If once they honestly undo the fault, and conscientiously forsake it, their work is done; for their penitent reformation shall make them innocent, and whatever punishment the Law may threaten to any sins, when God comes to Judgment, he will not exact it of any man who has been thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed from them.</p>
               <p>Do we find our selves guilty then of any unretract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wilful sins, and thereby subject to a dreadful sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence according to those measures that have in great largeness been hitherto discoursed of? Let us particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly repent of them, and begin to amend them, and then we are safe from it, and shall most certainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it. Have any voluntary faults put us out of a state of favour, and made us obnoxious to the severities of Judgment? let us reform them, and do so no more, and repair the breach which ensued upon them, and we are surely pardoned. For the Gospel of Christ doth not in any wise intend to amaze and astonish us, or to affright us from amendment, by putting us into a despair of mercy. No, we must lay this down as a most unerring Rule, That <hi>that can never come from God which tends to detain us in our sins, and to discourage our reformation.</hi> For the summ of all his designs and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, both in the <hi>sending of his Son,</hi> and in the <hi>preaching of his Gospel,</hi> is to free and cleanse us from all sin, and to carry us on to reformation and repentance by the sure and stedfast hopes of pardon and acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance.</p>
               <p>Whensoever we have <hi>wittingly</hi> done evil therefore,
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:66440:318"/>
let us take care to do so no more; and if it were offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive or injurious to our brethren, to repair the hurt our sin has done, and all is well. And if any Law of the Gospel threaten us, let us begin thus to fulfil it, and then we are safe from it. Let us fulfil it, I say, for that only is a saving repentance, which, as we saw above, implies obedience, and ends in reformation. And if we repent in that manner of any sin, whatsoever it be, or whensoever it be committed, whether <hi>before Baptism,</hi> or <hi>after</hi> it, it matters not, we shall surely go unpunished, and shall not be eternally damned for it.</p>

                  <p>Of the Necessity of Reconciliation upon Sins whereby we have offended, and of Restitution upon others whereby we have injured our Brethren. In sin three things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, the offence against God, and the offence and injury against men. Sins whereby God alone is offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are sufficiently repented of, and pardonable upon reformation and amendment. Those whereby we have also offended, or injured our brethren, are not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently repented of, or pardonable upon that alone, unless moreover we seek to be reconciled, and make restitution. These two means of pardon, for affronts, and injuries against men, are necessary fruits of a sincere and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:66440:319"/>
repentance. Of sins whereby we have justly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended our Brethren. Their ill effects represented, which are to be redressed by penitential acknowledgments, and seeking to be reconciled. These penitential acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements necessary only to appease those, whom by our sin we have offended; and so unnecessary, when they know nothing of our offence. Where they do, Reconciliation is necessary so far only as it can be had, and where we have an opportunity of seeking it. This discourse upon Reconciliation sum'd up. Of sins of injustice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we have injured men. Reparation ordinarily neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to a sincere, and always to a sufficient Repentance of them. 'Tis necessary moreover in it self, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of strict justice. An account of particular inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, how to be repaired where the injured persons can, and how where they cannot receive it. Restitution ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary whether our Brethren know themselves to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by us, or no. It is due only upon sins of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice. Of the perfect right which we have to things of strict Iustice, and of the imperfect right which we have to things of Charity, whence the performance of them is sometimes called righteousness. In sins of injustice, reparation due so far only as we can, and according as we have opportunity to make it. In judging of a just opportunity, caution given that we be neither too strict, so as more than needs to prejudice our selves; nor too loose, so as to overcharge our Neighbours. This Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of reparation upon injuries summed up.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FROM what has been discoursed concerning <hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of wilful sins</hi> in the <hi>foregoing Chapter,</hi> it plainly appears that they are not <hi>hopeless,</hi> but that at what time soever any of them have been committed by a <hi>Christian</hi> man, whether <hi>before Baptism,</hi> or <hi>after it,</hi> they are still <hi>pardonable</hi> upon his <hi>particular repentance of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="603" facs="tcp:66440:319"/>This repentance, as has been shewn, implies <hi>amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> so that we never shall be judged to have repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of them, till we have <hi>forsaken</hi> them, and are <hi>reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> from them. Amendment then is necessary to our repentance, and to the pardon of <hi>all</hi> voluntary offences whatsoever; and to the pardon of <hi>some, viz. those where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God alone is concerned,</hi> it is not only <hi>necessary,</hi> but <hi>sufficient:</hi> but then to a <hi>right repentance,</hi> and to the <hi>pardon</hi> of <hi>others,</hi> which do not barely <hi>offend God,</hi> but are <hi>offensive</hi> also and <hi>injurious to our Brethren,</hi> there is <hi>more</hi> required. For although God will forgive his <hi>own</hi> share of any sin, <hi>viz.</hi> so far as it is <hi>an act of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to him,</hi> and account us duly penitent upon our <hi>amendment</hi> and <hi>reformation</hi>; yet will he not judge so favourably, or so easily pass over the hurt which is thereby done to other men. And since in several sins, there is not only an <hi>offence to God,</hi> but withal an <hi>affront</hi> or <hi>injury</hi> to <hi>our Brethren</hi>; what ever God may do in <hi>some,</hi> 'tis plain that he will not pardon <hi>others,</hi> or look upon us to have sufficiently repented of them, upon a <hi>bare forsaking</hi> of the fault, without our seeking also to be <hi>reconciled</hi> to the offended persons, and making of due <hi>reparation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this being a thing which occasions much <hi>doubt</hi> and <hi>scruple</hi> in many <hi>honest</hi> minds, I will here endeavour to give a plain state of the Duty of <hi>reconciliation upon offences,</hi> and of <hi>restitution upon injuries against our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> that so we may have no needless fears upon this account, or know how to put an end to them when we have just occasion for them.</p>
               <p>In sin there are <hi>three</hi> things considerable, according as it may concern either <hi>God</hi> or <hi>men,</hi> or <hi>both; viz.</hi> the <hi>offence against God,</hi> and the <hi>offence</hi> and <hi>injury</hi> which it may include <hi>against men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, As for <hi>the offence against God,</hi> as it is <hi>a breach
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:66440:320"/>
of his Law,</hi> and a <hi>going cross to his pleasure</hi>; it is ato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>reformation</hi> and <hi>amendment.</hi> Till we are reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed indeed from our <hi>former</hi> sins, and are become Gods dutiful Sons, and faithful Servants, for the <hi>present,</hi> and for the <hi>future</hi>; it is not consistent with the <hi>honour of his goodness</hi> and <hi>holiness,</hi> with the <hi>authority of his Laws,</hi> and with the <hi>ends of his Government,</hi> to bear any <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placential love,</hi> or show any marks of <hi>favour</hi> and <hi>friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affection</hi> towards us. But as soon as ever we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiously reformed from them, he will be reconciled to us. He will never punish us for any disobedience against his <hi>Divine Majesty,</hi> after we have forsaken it; but whensoever we turn off from any evil way, so far as he <hi>himself was concerned in the dishonour of the offence,</hi> he will graciously pass it by, and as may plainly appear from what has hitherto been discoursed, return to have mercy upon us.</p>
               <p>But then as for the <hi>offence,</hi> and also as for the <hi>injury</hi> which our sins may at any time imply <hi>towards men</hi>; he will not judge us <hi>savingly to have repented of them,</hi> nor <hi>pardon</hi> them upon <hi>amendment</hi> alone, unless, together with that, we expiate the <hi>first</hi> by <hi>seeking to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Party whom we have offended,</hi> and the <hi>latter</hi> by <hi>making amends for the damage done,</hi> and <hi>offering a due reparation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These <hi>two</hi> means of pardon for our sins of <hi>affront</hi> or <hi>injury against men, viz.</hi> our <hi>seeking to be reconciled,</hi> and <hi>making all due restitution,</hi> are no less <hi>natural fruits</hi> and <hi>necessary effects</hi> of <hi>repentance</hi> for <hi>them,</hi> than <hi>reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>amendment</hi> is for <hi>them,</hi> and for <hi>all others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the most natural effect of a sincere and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent repentance, is to <hi>undo the fault,</hi> and <hi>set things in the same place where they were before,</hi> It implies a <hi>change of mind from sin,</hi> that now our hearts and thoughts are set against it; which change is helped on and produced
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:66440:320"/>
in us by our <hi>hatred of it,</hi> our <hi>grief</hi> and <hi>sorrow for it,</hi> and our <hi>being ashamed of it:</hi> And the natural effect of a change of mind, of <hi>hatred, shame,</hi> and <hi>grief,</hi> where they are in any just degrees and perfect measure, is to <hi>wish that the action</hi> which causes them <hi>had never been done,</hi> and, as much as it is possible, <hi>to undo it again.</hi> So that if our repentance for any sin is both <hi>true</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> if it implies an <hi>undissembled hatred,</hi> a <hi>deep shame,</hi> and a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>hearty grief</hi> and sorrow for it; it will make us <hi>cancel</hi> and <hi>undo</hi> it, and take away, as far as can be, all the footsteps which it had left behind it.</p>
               <p>And because there are <hi>more effects remaining after some sins, than after others</hi>; the <hi>fruits of repentance are more for some, than they are for others.</hi> For in <hi>some</hi> only <hi>God</hi> is concerned, as it happens in the <hi>sins of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,</hi> and in <hi>several instances of unsoberness,</hi> when there is no <hi>scandal</hi> to our Brethren joined with them: and the breach in these being only in <hi>God's Authority</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> it is repaired by our beginning to <hi>owne his Laws,</hi> and the stain is wiped off by <hi>amendment</hi> and <hi>new obedience.</hi> But in <hi>others,</hi> our <hi>Brethren</hi> are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too, as it falls out in all those sins whereby we <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure,</hi> or <hi>affront men:</hi> and since there remains after these sins, not only a <hi>dishonour of God,</hi> but also a <hi>lasting hurt</hi> and <hi>offence to our Neighbour.</hi> The breach made by these is not repaired barely by our beginning to <hi>obey God,</hi> unless we also seek to <hi>appease</hi> and <hi>satisfie men,</hi> by our <hi>penitential acknowledgments</hi> and <hi>restitution.</hi> And therefore if we are so far penitent, as to <hi>retract</hi> and <hi>undo</hi> our sins, without which we are not duly <hi>ashamed,</hi> or <hi>sorry,</hi> nor <hi>sufficiently changed,</hi> and <hi>reclaimed from</hi> them; we shall be ready, not only to repair the disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which they cast upon God, but the injury and offence which they gave to men too.</p>
               <p>But in the account of these two instances of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:66440:321"/>
and means of pardon to be more particular.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In sin we are to consider the <hi>offence and just dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure which it gives to our brethren,</hi> as it manifests our <hi>contempt</hi> of them, and our <hi>hostile inclination</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult over them, or to vex and disquiet them: and this is to be put away by our <hi>seeking to be reconciled with penitential confessions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all sins against <hi>Justice</hi> or <hi>Righteousness</hi> towards all men in <hi>general,</hi> or towards any in those <hi>particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> wherein we may be concerned; there is not only an act of <hi>disobedience towards God,</hi> but also of <hi>affront</hi> or <hi>injury against our Brethren:</hi> And this, <hi>if they understand it,</hi> will beget an <hi>alienation of mind,</hi> and create <hi>hard thoughts</hi> and <hi>hostile inclinations.</hi> For when they have observed our <hi>contempt</hi> of them, or our <hi>ill will</hi> to them, from our <hi>mockery</hi> and <hi>contumelious usage,</hi> our <hi>whisperings</hi> and <hi>backbitings,</hi> our <hi>slanderings, false witness, fraud, cozenage,</hi> or any other trespass against them, whether to their <hi>damage,</hi> or only to their <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement,</hi> or <hi>both</hi>; they will have great reason to be <hi>afraid</hi> of us, and <hi>offended</hi> with us. They will think our society unsafe, and either fly our company; or be jealous of us, and stand upon their guard when at any time they are so unhappy as to be ingaged in it. So that upon these sins against the <hi>Honour, Persons,</hi> and <hi>Estates</hi> of our <hi>Brethren,</hi> when once they come to <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand</hi> how they are damnified by them, there is not only an act of <hi>disobedience towards God,</hi> but also a plain <hi>breach</hi> of that <hi>friendship, good will,</hi> and <hi>mutual confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> which ought to be among men.</p>
               <p>And now to <hi>undo</hi> all these evils which ensue upon these sins, and to set things in the same state which they held before; there must not only be an act of <hi>reformation</hi> and <hi>amendment</hi> to <hi>appease God,</hi> but also some <hi>outward indications of a change</hi> to the <hi>parties of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,</hi>
                  <pb n="607" facs="tcp:66440:321"/>
and such <hi>penitential acknowledgments</hi> as may <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the breach which they have made among men.</hi> We must let the persons grieved <hi>know</hi> that now we are <hi>ashamed,</hi> and <hi>sorry</hi> for our <hi>fault,</hi> that our <hi>temper</hi> is <hi>changed,</hi> and our <hi>mind</hi> is <hi>alter'd</hi>; so that they may safely venture to <hi>return</hi> again into <hi>favour</hi> with us, and never fear suffering the like indignities from us any more. And this now will <hi>reconcile mens minds,</hi> and <hi>reunite their hearts,</hi> and make them to become again <hi>kindly affectionate, secure,</hi> and <hi>confident,</hi> in the society and conversation of each other. And when this is done, and they have both by reformation and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made their peace with God, so far as his honour was concerned in it, and also by such penitential ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments made their peace with men; they have undone, as much as is possible, all that was done amiss, and such repentance shall suffice, and prepare them for Gods pardon. And this is that which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour expresly requires of us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>If thou bring thy gift to the Altar,</hi> saith he, <hi>and there,</hi> before thou offerest it, <hi>remembrest that thy brother</hi> hath taken just offence, and <hi>hath ought against thee,</hi> (whether upon account of thy <hi>causless anger</hi> in calling him <hi>Fool,</hi> and <hi>Racha,</hi> or using any other opprobrious language; or of any other affront or injury whatsoever;) presume not to think of appeasing God before thou hast appeased him, but <hi>leave there thy gift before the Altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift</hi> for thy reconciliation unto God, v. 22, 23, 24.</p>
               <p>As for those sins then, whereby we have not only dishonoured God by disobedience, but also provoked and offended men by affront or injury; to procure the pardon of them, we must not only seek unto God by reformation and amendment, but to them too by such penitential acknowledgments as may repair the breach,
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:66440:322"/>
and reconcile the difference, which our sins had made betwixt them and us.</p>
               <p>But here we must observe, that as the necessity of superadding these <hi>penitential confessions</hi> to our <hi>amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> arises only from the necessity of <hi>appeasing men,</hi> whom our sins had offended: So whensoever our tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes against them have given them <hi>no offence,</hi> there is no need of these <hi>acknowledgments</hi> for a <hi>reconciliation.</hi> And therefore in all our sins against them, whereby we have either injured or disparaged them, which they <hi>know not</hi> of, there is no need of it at all. For if they understand not that we have wronged or abused them, they cannot be angry at us for so doing; and so there being no breach made by our offence, there is no place for a reconciliation.</p>
               <p>Yea I add further, if they are come to understand our offence, and have accordingly resented it; there is not always still a necessity of having them <hi>actually reconciled,</hi> but then only <hi>when it can be had,</hi> and <hi>we have an opportunity of doing it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is then only a <hi>necessity of having them reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, when it can be had.</hi> For some men are unalterable in their resentments, and never lay them down; they are eternal in their hatred, and will not forgive an injury to their lives end. And with these, God doth not require that we should actually be reconciled, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will he be angry at us, when at last we miss of it. He has not made <hi>impossibilities</hi> the <hi>means of pardon,</hi> nor will he make the <hi>unconquerable obstinacy</hi> of one mans sin, to be an article of anothers <hi>punishment</hi> and <hi>condemnation.</hi> And therefore when we have to do with such men, we shall be accepted, if we <hi>earnestly seek reconciliation,</hi> although we cannot <hi>find</hi> it. So that if in this case we <hi>seriously express our sorrow,</hi> and <hi>beg pardon for our fault,</hi> and <hi>promise never after to repeat it,</hi>
                  <pb n="609" facs="tcp:66440:322"/>
and, <hi>by our obliging carriage</hi> and <hi>after-kindness, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to atone for our past offence,</hi> and to show them how <hi>safely they may confide in our present engagements:</hi> if all this doth not melt them into a compliance, the <hi>sinful continuation</hi> of the breach is now their <hi>own</hi>; but as for <hi>us,</hi> we have done enough to mend what was amiss, and shall deliver our own souls.</p>
               <p>And even with those men <hi>from whom it might be had,</hi> there is then only a <hi>necessity of an actual reconcilement when we have an opportunity of doing it.</hi> For in the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mixture of conversation,</hi> and <hi>variety of company</hi> which we meet with in this world, how universally are men, especially of an <hi>abusive sportful wit,</hi> and a <hi>proud petulant humor,</hi> guilty of these offences towards those persons whom they shall never see again, and whom they know not <hi>where</hi> to find, or <hi>when.</hi> Now here, by reason of absence of the persons whom they should make it to, an actual acknowledgment and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, is impossible, and all that can be done towards it, is only <hi>sincerely</hi> and <hi>firmly</hi> to resolve to seek it, whensoever an opportunity shall be offer'd. And this <hi>honest purpose of reconciliation,</hi> till such time as we have an opportunity to perform it, shall be every whit as available to our pardon, as if we were indeed recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled. The <hi>will,</hi> as I have <note n="a" place="margin">Book 1. c. 3.</note> shewn, <hi>shall be taken for the deed,</hi> where <hi>'tis in our power to will only, but not to do,</hi> and where <hi>the deed would certainly follow, if there were but an opportunity to shew it in.</hi> For in this case the <hi>Apostles</hi> rule is sure; <hi>Where there is first a willing mind, it is accepted according to what a man hath, and not according to what he hath not,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.12.</p>
               <p>As for the Duty of seeking Reconciliation then, where our sin has given offence to men, it is plainly this: <hi>If they know nothing of our fault,</hi> they are <hi>not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred,</hi> and so have need of no <hi>atonement.</hi> But if they
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:66440:323"/>
                  <hi>do understand it,</hi> and <hi>are offended</hi> at it; we <hi>must seek a reconciliation, if it can be had,</hi> and <hi>where we have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to endeavour it.</hi> But if there be <hi>no opportunity</hi> of making our acknowledgments at <hi>present,</hi> we must <hi>firmly purpose</hi> it in our own minds, and <hi>resolve</hi> to make it when a fitting season shall be offer'd: and upon this <hi>honest purpose,</hi> which would prove effectual, were the persons present, we shall be pardoned, as if we had performed it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In sin we are to consider the <hi>damage and injury which it implies towards our Neighbour,</hi> as it causes his <hi>unjust loss</hi> or <hi>hindrance,</hi> whether as to his <hi>Life, Liberty, Good Name,</hi> or <hi>Estate</hi>; and this is to be expiated <hi>by making amends for the wrong,</hi> and <hi>restoring what our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury took away, by a just and full reparation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How often doth mens <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Revenge,</hi> their <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness</hi> and <hi>Ambition,</hi> render them not only <hi>offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive</hi> by <hi>indignities</hi> and <hi>affronts,</hi> but really <hi>hurtful</hi> and <hi>injurious to their brethren.</hi> They <hi>blast their Reputation</hi> by <hi>slanders</hi> and <hi>false reports</hi>; they <hi>spoil them of their Goods</hi> by <hi>theft</hi> or <hi>oppression,</hi> by <hi>fraud</hi> and <hi>cozenage</hi>; they <hi>rob them of their lives</hi> or <hi>liberties</hi> by <hi>murder</hi> and <hi>false witness</hi>; they <hi>inflame their enemies, estrange their friends,</hi> and <hi>stop</hi> or <hi>destroy their preferment,</hi> by their <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious suggestions, unjust suspicions,</hi> and <hi>spiteful repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations of them.</hi> And when at any time we do thus by our Neighbour, he is really a loser by reason of our sin, and has just reason to complain of us, and to stand at a distance from us as dangerous and hurtful persons, till we do not only <hi>confess our fault,</hi> and <hi>seek a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement,</hi> but moreover make him a <hi>just amends,</hi> and set him in the same state, if possibly we can, which he enjoyed before.</p>
               <p>This we shall surely do, if we are <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly penitent</hi>; and till we have thus <hi>restored a spoil,</hi> and
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:66440:323"/>
                  <hi>repaired a wrong,</hi> we cannot be thought <hi>truly,</hi> or at least <hi>perfectly</hi> to have <hi>repented</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>We cannot <hi>ordinarily</hi> be thought, I say, <hi>to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of it truly,</hi> but only <hi>under a</hi>

                  <hi>false disguise</hi> and <hi>vain hypocrisie.</hi> For that is <hi>ordinarily</hi> no <hi>true sorrow</hi> which doth not <hi>undo the fault,</hi> and set things, as much as may be, in the same state which they held before. We shall not be thought to be <hi>really angry at the crime,</hi> if still we hold fast the <hi>bait, and are pleased with the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</hi> We shall not be esteemed to <hi>hate it,</hi> so long as we are in <hi>love with that which comes by it</hi>; for we did not love it for <hi>it self</hi> at first, but only for the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just gains sake</hi> which led us on to it; and if we yet hold that fast, and will not restore it and let it go, 'tis plain we love it, and adhere to it for its sake still. So long then as men are pleased in the <hi>fruits</hi> of their inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and <hi>continue the damage which their brother suffered,</hi> or <hi>hold fast the unlawful gain which they themselves acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by it</hi>; they cannot in reason be thought to <hi>renounce</hi> or to <hi>redress</hi> it, but to <hi>justifie</hi> and <hi>confirm</hi> it. They are resolved to have their end in it, and to enjoy that by it which led them on to it; and this is not to be <hi>punished</hi> and <hi>afflicted for a fault,</hi> but to be <hi>enriched by it</hi>; it is not <hi>repenting of it,</hi> but <hi>owning</hi> and <hi>avowing</hi> it.</p>
               <p>But if the sense of Gods wrath, which they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd by their unjust dealings, should put these men, who will not repair them, into some <hi>real trouble of mind</hi> and <hi>grief of heart,</hi> as sometimes it doth; yet so long as they make no just amends, but suffer all the ill effects upon their brethren to remain, their <hi>repentance,</hi> such as it is, although it be <hi>real</hi> and <hi>sincere,</hi> is not yet <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> and <hi>entire,</hi> and <hi>able to work that reformation which it is designed for.</hi> Their mind is changed in part, but 'tis but half way; their sorrow for their sin is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but not enough; it would not have strength

sufficient to prevent the sin, because it cannot wean them from the temptation. For the <hi>unjust gain</hi> still keeps possession of their heart, and all their grief and change of mind is not able to remove it: their brothers loss is still their love and delight, and all their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance cannot bring them to repair it. They still ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to, and love the <hi>fruits of their offence,</hi> more than they do the <hi>rewards of amendment</hi> and <hi>obedience:</hi> so that if they should be tempted by these inducements again, they would have the same effect upon them which they had at first, and make them as unjust as they were before.</p>
               <p>Thus necessary is <hi>restitution</hi> and <hi>reparation of a wrong,</hi> to evidence that men <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>perfectly repent</hi> of it.</p>

               <p>Thus necessary is <hi>restitution of unjust Possessions,</hi> and <hi>reparation of unjust damages,</hi> not only <hi>to evidence a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere</hi> and <hi>sufficient repentance,</hi> but also as an instance of <hi>common Equity</hi> and <hi>natural Justice,</hi> and to maintain a <hi>mutual peace, security,</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> in the World. And therefore God, that he might take away <hi>all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation</hi> to <hi>sportful,</hi> or <hi>malicious injuries,</hi> and <hi>unjust get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi> in <hi>some</hi>; and all <hi>enmity</hi> and <hi>strife, unsociable fears</hi> and <hi>jealousies, murmurings,</hi> and <hi>complaints</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of them in <hi>others</hi>; has laid a great stress upon it, and made it plainly necessary to the obtaining of his <note n="c" place="margin">

               <p>If then we are guilty of any injury, and have at any time wrongfully damnified our Neighbour; we must not only seek to be reconciled, and remove the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but withal we must repair the loss, and make him in as good a state, if by any means we can, as he was in before. And therefore if we have spoiled him of his <hi>Goods</hi> by <hi>fraud, oppression,</hi> or <hi>robbery</hi>; we must in the fittest way, which our <hi>own prudence,</hi> or the <hi>wisdom of our friends,</hi> and <hi>spiritual Guides</hi> shall direct, <hi>restore</hi> them unto him again. If we have injured him in his <hi>Good name,</hi> and by <hi>slanders, false stories,</hi> and <hi>malicious representations</hi> put a <hi>blot upon his honour, advantaged his enemies, disingaged his friends,</hi> and <hi>stopt his promotion</hi>; we must <hi>confess our fault,</hi> and declare our miscarriage,
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:66440:325"/>
we must <hi>endeavour to wipe off</hi> all the dirt which we have thrown upon him, and to set him <hi>right</hi> again in the apprehensions of <hi>all</hi> men, but of <hi>those</hi> most especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, who by our means were brought to think ill and hardly of him. If we have wrongfully deprived him of his <hi>liberty,</hi> or of any thing else, by <hi>false witness,</hi> or <hi>corrupt judgment,</hi> or any other way; we must take <hi>shame</hi> to our selves, and <hi>clear up his innocence,</hi> and take off all the <hi>undeserved reproach,</hi> and all the <hi>criminal dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise,</hi> wherein we had involved him.</p>
               <p>As for some injuries, 'tis true, they <hi>never can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,</hi> nor is it possible to make the persons whole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain who suffered by them. Of which sort are <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Adultery,</hi> a <hi>customary constant fraud in traffick,</hi> and the like. But although the damage in these can never be <hi>intirely</hi> repaired, yet in <hi>part</hi> it may; and when we cannot do as much as we should, 'tis but just and necessary that we do as much as we can. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in those injuries whereby <hi>many are made to suffer,</hi> as it ordinarily happens in <hi>murder</hi> and <hi>adultery,</hi> which damnifie not the <hi>persons injured</hi> alone, but their <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi> also and <hi>Dependants</hi>; we must make restitution to those that <hi>can,</hi> that we may be pardoned for neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those who <hi>cannot</hi> receive it. And if <hi>few</hi> of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured persons are to be met with, as it happens through the <hi>infinity of Sufferers</hi> by a <hi>constant fraud in commerce</hi>; there cannot be a better <hi>commutation,</hi> than to put <hi>the poor into their place,</hi> and make the needy their Receivers.

               <p>Thus is restitution to repair the damage, as necessary as confession is to atone the offence which our sins have given to our Brethren. And this it is, whether our Brethren <hi>know of</hi> the unjust loss or hindrance which we have caused to them, or no. As for the <hi>confession of our fault,</hi> to have the offended party reconciled; that, 'tis true, is necessary only to make peace where they have taken offence, and therefore it is of no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity where they do not know our sin, because there they cannot be offended by it. But as for the <hi>reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of unjust damages,</hi> that is necessary out of natural equity and strict Justice, so that we are bound to it wheresoever Justice is infringed, and any one is inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whether he understands it, and be offended at it, or no. If then our Neighbour knows he has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by us, and is offended at it; we must not only make restitution to repair his loss, but also beg his pardon to atone the offence, and to procure a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation. But if he is wronged and knows it not, we need make no acknowledgments, 'tis true, since he has no need to be reconciled; but still we must make a just amends, and repair the damage, be the way of doing it never so private, and managed with as much discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as can be used about it.</p>
               <p>But to prevent <hi>needless fears,</hi> as well as to press a <hi>necessary practice</hi> in this Point; I think it not amiss to add these limitations to the <hi>obligation</hi> of this <hi>Duty, viz.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> We are <hi>bound to make amends and restitution only upon sins against strict Justice, not upon sins against Charity.</hi> All restitution must be of something, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another man has a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>compleat right,</hi> otherwise it is not <hi>restoring,</hi> but <hi>giving</hi> it. It is returning of a thing to its right Owner, and putting him into possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on who has the just title and propriety. Now such right as this no man has to things of <hi>Charity,</hi> but only to things of <hi>strict Justice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true indeed, there is a certain dueness in <hi>them,</hi> as well as there is in <hi>these</hi>; we ought to <hi>give Alms,</hi> as well as to <hi>perform Contracts</hi>; to be <hi>grateful, compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, courteous,</hi> and <hi>condescensive,</hi> as well as to <hi>restore a pledge,</hi> or <hi>fulfil a bargain.</hi> These Points of <hi>Charity,</hi> as well as those of <hi>Justice,</hi> are due from us, and ought to be performed by us: and since there is a <hi>Duty on our parts to bestow,</hi> there must be answerably some kind of <hi>right in others to rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that even the instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of kindness and Charity, are in some sence a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of right and duty; and because those who receive them are not altogether void of title, but have some right to them, they are oft-times in Scripture called works of <hi>righteousness,</hi> and the persons who perform them, are called upon that account <hi>just,</hi> or <hi>righteous men.</hi> Thus where we read, <hi>Take heed that you do not your</hi>

               <p>Some right then our Brethren have to our works of <hi>mercy, liberality, gratitude, candor, affability, courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy,</hi> and other instances of <hi>common charity</hi>: So much due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness there is in them, and so much right and title they have to them, as can denominate them <hi>works of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> and us who perform them <hi>just</hi> and <hi>righteous men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this right is much less than that which they have to all expressions of <hi>strict Justice</hi>; and is rather <hi>an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect draught</hi> and a <hi>beginning of right,</hi> than <hi>right</hi> it self. For all <hi>full</hi> and <hi>perfect right bestows a title,</hi> it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vests a man in <hi>propriety</hi>; so that what he has a compleat right to, he may justly call <hi>his own.</hi> And such a right as this all men have to the <hi>safety of their persons, goods,</hi> and <hi>reputations,</hi> and all other things which are a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>strict Justice.</hi> They have a full claim to them, and cannot, without their own consent, be deprived of them: and therefore if any private person like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves damnifies them in these, they may justly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain he wrongs them, and demand satisfaction; and when they receive it, they do not <hi>thank</hi> him as for a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>charitable gift,</hi> but look on it as their <hi>own,</hi> and accept it as a <hi>debt</hi> and <hi>necessary restitution.</hi> Thus full and perfect is that right which men have to things of strict Justice, it invests them with propriety, and makes the things which they have a right to, to become their own; so that 'tis no <hi>gift,</hi> nor <hi>thank-worthy,</hi> when other men either <hi>perform at first,</hi> or after injury <hi>restore</hi> it to them.</p>
               <p>But as for that <hi>right, which men have to all expressions of kindness and charity; it founds no full claim, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vests
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:66440:327"/>
a man with Lordship and Propriety</hi>; so that he must owne <hi>anothers kindness</hi> when he receives them, and cannot say he is deprived of his own, when they are withheld from him. This Right does not confer Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, but doth only something towards it; it makes it anothers duty to give, and his gift must compleat our Title, and bestow a perfect Claim to it. Thus, for instance, if any person has an opportunity put into his hands, to <hi>be helpful to a man in want or misery</hi>; when the needful persons <hi>ask an alms,</hi> they do not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a debt,</hi> but <hi>intreat his charity</hi>; they do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act what is <hi>their own,</hi> but beg what <hi>is his</hi>; so that he has an opportunity, not of <hi>doing justice,</hi> but of <hi>shewing kindness</hi> and charity when he gives; and they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a duty of <hi>acknowledging his kindness,</hi> and <hi>being thankful</hi> when they receive it. And the case is the same in <hi>gratitude, candor, courtesie,</hi> and other instances of Love and Charity. The right which any man has to them is not so full, that he can say they are his own; there is a duty indeed on other men to give, and that <hi>gift may make them his in time</hi>; but till that is done, he cannot say he is injuriously deprived of any thing which of compleat right belongs to him, or require that they, who have taken nothing that is his from him, should repair the loss, and make a restitution.</p>
               <p>Restitution then in transgressions against strict Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice is a duty, because there men are deprived of that which is really their own; and it is but justice, and not thank-worthy, that he who deprives them of that, should give it back again, and restore it to them. But in sins against meer Charity it is no duty; for there, since men have lost nothing that is their own, they can demand nothing to be restored to them. By these <hi>sins of uncharitableness</hi> indeed <hi>God is dishonoured,</hi> and by our <hi>amendment that must be repaired</hi>; our <hi>Brethren</hi>

               <p>We are bound, I say again, to make an actual resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution only <hi>when we have an opportunity of doing it.</hi> An <hi>honest purpose,</hi> as was said above, shall be accepted for all <hi>affirmative precepts,</hi> till there be a season offered for an <hi>actual performance.</hi> When there is an opportunity for it, we must not only will, but do and practise them: but till that happens, all that God expects, or that we can do, is to resolve to practise them, as we shall find occasion. And therefore if honestly we seek an opportunity to repair a wrong, but cannot find it: let us not disturb our souls with fears and scruples, but rest in peace; in confidence that our honest purpose shall bear us out, till Gods Providence affords us an opportune season wherein we may perform.</p>
               <p>And in judging of this, <hi>when a fit season is come,</hi> and <hi>when such an opportunity is offered as we are bound to make our restitution in</hi>; we must neither be <hi>too strict</hi> and <hi>rigorous,</hi> nor <hi>too gentle and remiss.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We <hi>must not be too strict,</hi> and tye our selves up to so much quickness in restoring, as to run upon <hi>great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies</hi> that are of far more weight than the thing is worth, to <hi>prejudice considerably our own affairs,</hi> and <hi>neglect,</hi> it may be, some other as <hi>weighty duties,</hi> rather than <hi>delay a little longer</hi>; especially when it may be done at <hi>another time</hi> as well as <hi>then,</hi> and the damage,
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:66440:328"/>
which the <hi>injured person</hi> sustains by such <hi>delay,</hi> is nothing in respect of that which <hi>we</hi> incur by a <hi>precipitate dispatch</hi> of it. Under such incommodious circumstances we may be allowed to put it off a while, and we need not fear lest our brother should be offended, or farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by such delay, since we have <hi>just reason to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume he willingly agrees to it.</hi> For thus far we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably presume upon the <hi>free consent</hi> of all the <hi>conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable part of mankind,</hi> that, out of <hi>common humanity</hi> and <hi>compassion,</hi> they will be content to deny themselves in <hi>small</hi> things, to advantage us in <hi>great</hi> ones; and to want some <hi>slight</hi> conveniencies themselves, rather than put us, for the supplying of them, to deprive ourselves of such as are <hi>considerably weightier.</hi> And where we have so good a reason to <hi>presume of their consent</hi> to it, we shall not be trespassers against them, or any ways offensive to them, by our delaying of it.</p>
               <p>But then, on the other hand, we must not be <hi>too remiss</hi> and <hi>partial to our selves,</hi> in judging of a fitting season for such a reparation, nor prone to press upon our brethrens wants and inconveniencies, but to spare our own. We must not refuse an offer, because it is joyned with <hi>some pains,</hi> and clog'd with <hi>some difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> and may occasion <hi>some loss</hi> and <hi>hindrance</hi> to us, or <hi>additional expence.</hi> Our slowness in returning a just amends at any time, but chiefly where the <hi>opportunities for it are more uncertain,</hi> must not be such as argues that we <hi>seek to excuse it,</hi> or are <hi>very indifferent to it,</hi> and <hi>easily put by it:</hi> it must not seem to intimate that we are <hi>in suspense about it,</hi> or have not <hi>perfectly resolved upon it,</hi> or, at least, that the performance of it is a <hi>forced, ungrateful thing,</hi> so that we would not come to it so long as we can find any pretence to turn it off, or are able to overlook it. For this shews evidently that our <hi>repentance is without zeal,</hi> that our <hi>sorrow is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:66440:329"/>
life,</hi> and that, at best, we are acted only by an <hi>imperfect</hi> and <hi>insufficient,</hi> if not also by an <hi>unsincere pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</hi> And therefore to <hi>vindicate the honour,</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the degrees</hi> of <hi>our repentance</hi> and <hi>obedient purposes,</hi> which are absolutely necessary to our pardon and acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance, we must shew such an <hi>overplus of affectionate haste</hi> to repair our injured brothers loss, as manifests that we are more concerned for him, than we are for our selves, and that we regard the pains and burden of our own part much less, than in all rational presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, were he to judge of it, he himself would. This we shall do where the <hi>sorrow</hi> of our sin is <hi>great,</hi> where we have a <hi>high zeal</hi> against it, and have <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly repented of it:</hi> and when we are actuated and carried on by these, they will prevent all doubts, and never suffer any <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>uncertain question</hi> about the fitness of the opportunity, to come into a debate of Conscience. But if men have not so much <hi>love</hi> for the duty of Restitution, and so much <hi>zeal</hi> in their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as will make them overlook <hi>little things</hi>; if their repentance has no more warmth than is just necessary to make them do what is indispensably to be done, so that they come to <hi>weigh scruples,</hi> and nicely to debate whether some <hi>doubtful hindrances</hi> are <hi>sufficient</hi> to delay their restitution, or no: the best way that I can advise them, is to refer their <hi>brothers loss in wanting for some time,</hi> and theirs in <hi>making a present reparation,</hi> to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their <hi>spiritual Guides,</hi> or any other <hi>wise Advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers</hi>; and then peaceably to acquiesce in that course whereto those wise and good men shall direct them.</p>
               <p>As for the duty of <hi>making reparation</hi> then where our sins have <hi>injured men,</hi> it is plainly this. In sins which are not only against <hi>Charity,</hi> but also against <hi>Justice,</hi> whereby we have wronged any man either in his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Goods,</hi> or <hi>Reputation</hi>; whether he <hi>knows</hi> that we
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:66440:329"/>
have injured him or no, we must <hi>make a just amends</hi> and <hi>restitution.</hi> This must be made, <hi>where it can,</hi> to the <hi>injured man himself</hi>; and where <hi>that is not to be done,</hi> to his <hi>family</hi> and <hi>dependants</hi>; and, where <hi>that is impracticable</hi> too, to the <hi>poor,</hi> or to <hi>God himself,</hi> by some <hi>charitable</hi> or <hi>pious commutation.</hi> And this we are bound to do <hi>so far as it is in our power,</hi> and <hi>according as we can find an opportunity</hi>; being <hi>desirous of it,</hi> and <hi>fully resolved upon it when we want one</hi>; and <hi>doing as much as we can</hi> towards it, and <hi>asking pardon for that wherein we fail, when we are disabled from doing all.</hi> It is not enough after these sins to <hi>do so no more,</hi> unless, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to these rules, we make <hi>amendment</hi> for what we have done already. <hi>Reformation</hi> and <hi>forsaking of the fault</hi> will atone for any other <hi>wilful</hi> sin, whereby we have <hi>offended none but God:</hi> and <hi>that,</hi> and, <hi>peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential acknowledgments,</hi> will expiate those whereby we have <hi>offended</hi> both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>men</hi>; but if we have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>offended,</hi> but <hi>wronged</hi> also and <hi>injured</hi> them, we must not only <hi>amend our fault</hi> to <hi>please God,</hi> and <hi>penitently acknowledge</hi> it to <hi>appease them</hi>; but, as ever we would secure the pardon of it, we must <hi>restore</hi> the <hi>spoil,</hi> and <hi>repair the wrong,</hi> and set them, as far as may be, in as good a state as our sin took from them.</p>

                  <head>The CONTENTS. </head>
                  <p>Involuntary sins imply something of our own fault, and so 'tis fit we should be sorry for them, and beg pardon.
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:66440:330"/>
They had a remedy under <hi>Moses</hi>'s Lay, and have now likewise under Christs Gospel. We are qualified for their pardon, not by a particular repentance and reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but in the general, by our obedience in all our wilful and chosen actions; in particular, by our prayers for Gods pardon, and our Charity and forgiveness of the sins of other men. This Discourse of Repentance sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up. An Application to particular offenders, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther voluntary or involuntary. A Summary of all that has been hitherto discoursed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving shewed in the <hi>former</hi> Chapters what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy Christs Gospel has afforded us for the most dangerous sort of offences, <hi>viz.</hi> our <hi>chosen</hi> and <hi>wilful ones</hi>; I shall proceed now in this to inquire what remedy he has likewise provided for our <hi>involuntary</hi> and <hi>unchosen sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for our involuntary slips themselves, they also come under the <hi>Letter of the Law,</hi> and within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of the Penalty. They are a doing what the Law forbids, and so an incurring of that evil which it threatens. For the words of the Law it self are unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited and universal, they make no exception of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary or involuntary, considered or unconsidered; but they require that something should be performed or omitted, and threaten us if we do it not. So that if they were to be tryed by the <hi>strictness</hi> and <hi>rigour of the Laws</hi>; even our involuntary slips themselves would prove a matter of our condemnation.</p>
               <p>But if God should proceed to judge us, I will not say according to what the compass of the <hi>literal Law</hi> would comprehend, but even according to the utmost of what the <hi>justice of the thing</hi> would bear, the greatest part of our involuntary sins would be charged upon us. For how few are there who live up to the <hi>utmost of
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:66440:330"/>
their possibilities</hi>; but they fall sometimes where they might stand, and are rash in some instances when, if they had used due care, they might have deliberated. We do not come up to that, which, according to the highest ability of our natures, and the utmost stretch of our faculties, might be done: and therefore setting aside the rigour of the Letter, which requiring more than can be performed, must threaten where the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment that is threatned cannot in justice be exacted: yet should God proceed with us for <hi>most</hi> of our invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary slips according to the utmost severity which Justice it self would bear, we should be in an evil state, and give in a sad account for them. So that we have need to be <hi>sorrowful</hi> even for the <hi>greatest part</hi> of our <hi>involuntary sins,</hi> and to <hi>beg Gods pardon for them,</hi> that all the defects of our care may be made up by the riches of his mercy and goodness.</p>
               <p>And as for the rest of them, which steal from us not so much through any thing of our <hi>culpable neglect</hi> as our <hi>unhappiness,</hi> and are purely involuntary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable; an <hi>after-grief</hi> is necessary in them also, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be only to <hi>evidence our involuntariness</hi> in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and that our wills were perfectly against them. Because, as was observed above, our <hi>ignorant offences</hi> themselves cannot in reason be esteemed <hi>invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,</hi> further than we shew our wills to be set against them, by our <hi>trouble at them,</hi> and our <hi>prayers for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> when afterwards we come to discover and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them. So that some <hi>repentance</hi> is still due, even for our <hi>involuntary and unchosen sins,</hi> and they must have our <hi>sorrow</hi> and our <hi>prayers</hi> before they are fit to be forgiven.</p>
               <p>And here we all experience the abundance of Gods Love; for he allows for these pitiable infirmities, and has provided us of a remedy, which if we make use of,
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:66440:331"/>
we shall never be condemned for them.</p>
               <p>Under <hi>Moses's Law</hi> these involuntary slips of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and inconsideration, being they were continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incurred, were allowed the benefit of a continual atonement. For God himself appointed several Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices for them which should expiate their guilt, so that every man, who was subject to them, was furnished with a sufficient remedy against them.</p>
               <p>And as they had their remedy and relief under the <hi>Law of Moses</hi>; so ought they to have much more under the <hi>Gospel of Christ.</hi> And in this our Lord has not been wanting, but has afforded us a Salvo for them; so that although we are all of us guilty of them, yet none of us need to suffer for them.</p>
               <p>But now as for <hi>this remedy</hi> which Christ has prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed for the Expiation of our <hi>involuntary sins</hi>; it is not the <hi>same</hi> which he requires to the Expiation of our <hi>voluntary and wilful ones.</hi> For that, as we have seen, is nothing less than a <hi>particular repentance</hi> and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the forsaking of that very sin which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted wilfully. But as for our involuntary sins, this can be no cure for them, because it is impracticable, and not possible to be effectually used about them. For we shall always live subject to them more or less; and although we may labour and strive against them, yet shall we never be able, as long as we are in this world, to get entirely free from them. We have no power and choice to avoid what we cannot see and consider of, and all these sins come in upon the account of our unwill'd ignorance or inconsideration; and since we cannot see and consider of them, we cannot particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevent them, which is effectually to repent of them.</p>
               <p>A <hi>particular Repentance</hi> and <hi>Reformation</hi> then is not the Gospel-remedy for our <hi>involuntary sins.</hi> It cannot be the cure assigned for them, because it is impossible
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:66440:331"/>
to them; their pardon must not depend upon it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause then they were wholly impardonable and despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, since in them no man on earth can use it.</p>
               <p>But that remedy which Christ has appointed for them, and that repentance whereupon he will graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously pardon and forgive them, is in the <hi>general,</hi> an <hi>hearty</hi>

                  <hi>repentance and reformation of all wilful sins, and an entire obedience in all such actions as are voluntary and chosen.</hi> If we serve God faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and truly in all our other actions, where we do see our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and can chuse to practise it; he will connive at these slips, which, after an honest care and industry, are involuntary and unchosen. For any <hi>kind master</hi> would do so to his <hi>honest servant</hi>; and more especially every <hi>tender father</hi> would to his <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient child.</hi> And God, who is <hi>Love it self,</hi> being the <hi>first Fountain</hi> and the <hi>compleatest Pattern</hi> of all kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the world, will never be out-done in any <hi>love that is excellent</hi> and <hi>praise-worthy</hi> by his own creatures. But if their kindness would bear with such infirmities and oversights of an honest mind, his will dispense with them much rather.</p>
               <p>The faithful servants therefore and obedient children of God, who repent particularly of all their other sins that are known and wilful, and effectually amend <hi>them</hi>; shall be sure to find this favour at the hands of their heavenly Lord and Father for all these failings which are involuntary and unchosen. Their obedience in other things shall plead their excuse, and make their unwill'd slips in these to be uncondemning.</p>
               <p>But to be yet more particular, these involuntary trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions of men that are obedient in all their voluntary actions, shall certainly be pardoned through the means of these <hi>particular</hi> duties.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Their involuntary failings of ignorance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consideration shall be forgiven them <hi>upon their prayers</hi>; if they beg Gods pardon for them, he is as ready to grant, as they are to desire it. And this we are sure of, because that no <hi>earthly Parent,</hi> who is wise and good, would refuse to bestow it in such Cases at the request of his Children; whereas they have nothing near that pity and tenderness for <hi>their</hi> Children, which God has for <hi>his.</hi> And this is an Argument which Christ himself has taught us to rely upon in this matter: <hi>If you,</hi> says he, <hi>being evil, will</hi> yet, for all that, at their request <hi>give good gifts to your Children; how much more shall your heavenly Father,</hi> who has not the least taint of your illness, <hi>give</hi> the best of gifts, even <hi>the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to them that ask him?</hi> Luke 11.13.</p>
               <p>And indeed that we may never want this remedy, Christ has put a Prayer for this purpose daily into our mouths; that since our involuntary sins are of <hi>daily incursion,</hi> we may as <hi>daily beg pardon</hi> for them. For he has made it a part of our <hi>daily prayers</hi> to ask pardon, among others, for our <hi>daily trespasses,</hi> this being one of those Petitions which he has taught us to put up as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as we do that for our daily bread, that he would <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our trespasses,</hi> Matth. 6.11, 12.

an honest man may sometimes erre and be mistaken; as an <hi>historical relation</hi> of a matter of <hi>fact.</hi> For he is recounting what a brave and gallant Church they were in that state, wherein the great Apostle left them: and as one of the <hi>Particulars</hi> of that relation this comes in, That as for their <hi>involuntary sins they begged Gods par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and that too <hi>with a pious assurance of obtaining it.</hi> So that as for this practice, of a <hi>confident hope of pardon for their involuntary sins upon their prayers,</hi> it was not only such as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               <p>This therefore is one great remedy for our involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary slips, <hi>They shall he forgiven us upon our prayers for pardon and forgiveness.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>As God himself delights in <hi>mercy,</hi> so doth he require that we should; and to oblige us to it the more, he has made our kind dealing towards our Brethren the <note n="f" place="margin">Luke 6.36, 37, 38.</note> Condition of his kindness towards us. <hi>Above all things,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter, have fervent Charity among your selves; for Charity shall cover,</hi> or procure pardon for, <hi>the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of</hi> those many, because unavoidable and involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, <hi>sins,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.8. And hereto Charity is then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially available, when it is shewn in the highest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of all, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>procuring our Brethrens repentance</hi> and <hi>conversion.</hi> For thus says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>James, Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him</hi>; for his encouragement <hi>let him know</hi> this from me, <hi>That he who converts the Sinner from the errour of his way shall</hi> not only <hi>save</hi> the others <hi>soul from death,</hi> but <hi>shall</hi> also <hi>hide a multitude of</hi> his own <hi>sins,</hi> James 5.19, 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="631" facs="tcp:66440:333"/>Thus is Charity in all acts of <hi>kindness</hi> and <hi>beneficence</hi> most available to procure the pardon of our <hi>many,</hi> because <hi>unavoidable</hi> and <hi>involuntary sins.</hi> But among all the instances of Charity, <hi>one</hi> is particularly singled out by our Saviour as a necessary Condition to our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness at Gods hands, and that is <hi>our forgiving others that offend against us.</hi> For the man <hi>who would have no pity upon his Fellow-servant as his Lord had shewed upon him,</hi> was <hi>unpardoned</hi> all again, and <hi>delivered over to the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors till he should pay the uttermost Farthing,</hi> Matth. 18.32, 33, 34; and the <hi>same</hi> measure our <hi>heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will mete out to us, if we forgive not every one his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their trespasses,</hi> v. 35. And that a Condition so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our forgiveness might never be forgotten our Lord has put it expresly into that Prayer which he has taught us to put up daily for the pardon of our own sins. For he bids us pray that <hi>God would forgive us our trespasses against him,</hi> even <hi>as we forgive those that trespass against us,</hi> Matth. 6.12. And that we may take the more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of a Point so indispensable, he tells us as soon as ever the Prayer is done, that <hi>if we forgive men their trespasses, our heavenly Father will also forgive us; but if we forgive not men their trespasses; neither will our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father forgive us our trespasses,</hi> vers. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>If we are rigorous and severe therefore with our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, God will be so with us also; and when he comes to judge us we shall find as little allowance at his hands as they have done at ours. For <hi>he shall have judgment</hi> from God <hi>without mercy, who</hi> to men <hi>hath shewn no mercy</hi>; but if any man has been merciful to his Brethren, God will be much more so to him; for <hi>mercy rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth</hi> even <hi>against judgment,</hi> James 2.13. This will be the greatest motive to procure Grace, and the best Plea that can be urged to obtain mercy at Gods hands; <hi>Blessed are the merciful,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>for they shall obtain mercy.</hi> Mat. 5.7.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="632" facs="tcp:66440:334"/>And thus as for our <hi>involuntary slips,</hi> we see now what is their remedy; they shall be forgiven us upon <hi>our prayers,</hi> and upon <hi>the prayers of our friends</hi> and <hi>other good Christians for us</hi>; and upon <hi>our Charity</hi> and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of other men. With the same measure that we mete, God will mete out to us again,</hi> Mat. 7.2. So that if we shew mercy to the unwill'd sins, yea and the volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry offences of other men; if in other things we are obedient, we shall be sure to find it for our own.</p>
               <p>And thus at last we see what remedy the Gospel has provided us for all sorts of offences, whether they be our <hi>voluntary</hi> or <hi>involuntary</hi> sins. And upon the whole matter we find that our case is not desperate under any sort of sins, but that if we will use it, we have a sufficient cure for them. For if we are in a state of death by reason of any <hi>wilful</hi> sin; let us but <hi>particularly repent of it</hi> and <hi>amend it,</hi> and, if it either <hi>injured</hi> or <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended our Brethren, seek to be reconciled</hi> and <hi>repair the wrong,</hi> and we are restored to pardon.

And either way when God comes to judge us, whether we have in all points <hi>fulfilled his Laws,</hi> or are <hi>pardoned our transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of them,</hi> we shall be <hi>acquitted by him.</hi> We shall be safe at that day, if we have either <hi>kept the condition,</hi> or <hi>used the remedy</hi>; for a <hi>pardon</hi> will justifie us to as much purpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>To apply this then to every mans particular case.

<pb n="633" facs="tcp:66440:334"/>
guilty of these, or of any other sins of like nature whereat all mens consciences are wont to boggle, and their hearts to check them, till they have sinned themselves into numbness and stupefaction? let him <hi>particularly amend that evil way,</hi> and <hi>retract that very sin,</hi> and, if his crime implied any, as far as he can, <hi>repair the wrong</hi> it did his brethren; and then he is in a safe condition. For his particular repentance and amendment shall make up the breach which such wilful offence had made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and him, and shall most certainly procure his pardon.</p>
               <p>Has any man of opportunities and understanding committed any action of <hi>Lasciviousness, Vncleanness, Passionateness, Fierceness, evil Speaking, Backbiting, Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soriousness, Vncandidness, Vnmercifulness, Vnpeaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> or the like? has any such man, or <hi>any other what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,</hi> been guilty of <hi>these</hi> or the <hi>like</hi> offences when his own <hi>Soul reproved</hi> him, and either did, or would have set the sinfulness of his present action before him, unless he has sinned in it so long, as to lose all sense of it, and to stifle all suggestions against it? let him also <hi>particularly</hi> amend and reform such voluntary sin, and make his peace with his offended brethren, that he may be saved. His particular repentance shall likewise make his peace, and procure for him Gods favour and acceptance.</p>
               <p>Has any man, lastly, been <hi>surprized</hi> into <hi>rash words</hi> and <hi>censures,</hi> into <hi>sudden anger,</hi> and <hi>trifling discontents,</hi> and <hi>peevish,</hi> or <hi>uncourteous,</hi> or <hi>uncandid,</hi> or <hi>uncondescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive behaviour</hi>? has he been <hi>wearied</hi> by long importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity into some <hi>loose thoughts</hi> and <hi>wanton fancies,</hi> into some <hi>small fretfulness,</hi> or <hi>impatience,</hi> or the like? has he spoke or acted unadvisedly through <hi>deep grief,</hi> or <hi>violent fears,</hi> or other <hi>astonishing unwill'd passion</hi>? let him <hi>bewail his failings,</hi> and <hi>strive</hi> against them, although

he be not able perfectly to overcome them; let him seek peace, and <hi>use charity,</hi> and <hi>shew mercy</hi> upon the like errours and escapes, and upon the more wilful of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences of his brethren, and then with comfort <hi>beg Gods pardon.</hi> For his prayers thus attended shall set him straight, and procure his reconciliation.</p>
               <p>If a man is <hi>conscious</hi> to himself of any of these sorts of sins, these remedies will certainly restore him. And as for those <hi>unknown</hi> and <hi>secret sins,</hi> whereof his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence cannot inform him; he has an obvious and an easie expedient, for a <hi>general penitential prayer</hi> will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be accepted for his pardon.</p>
               <p>Whatsoever therefore his sins be, if he please to make use of it, he is provided of his remedy. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance shall surely save his Soul, and make atonement for all his offences. So that of whatsoever <hi>nature, number,</hi> or <hi>degree</hi> his faults have been, after once he has thus repented of them, they shall never be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him; but through the Merits of Christs Death, and the Grace of his Gospel, they shall be looked upon as if they had never been.</p>
               <p>And thus at last we have seen what that <hi>condition is which the Gospel indispensably exacts of us towards our acceptance</hi> in the last Judgment, what <hi>those defects are whereof it allows,</hi> and what <hi>those Salvo's for all sorts of disobedience which it offers.</hi> For it <hi>requires an entire obedience of all our voluntary actions,</hi> it <hi>bears with all our innocently involuntary failings,</hi> and it <hi>admits us to recover our former state</hi> when once we have lost it, or to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe in it</hi> when we enjoy it, by a <hi>particular repentance</hi> and <hi>amendment of all our wilful sins,</hi> and by our <hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>charity for our involuntary ones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This then is the true Test whereby at the last Day we must all be tryed. If we have <hi>obeyed entirely,</hi> and <hi>have been guilty of no wilful sin</hi>; or if, when we have,

we <hi>did not rest in it,</hi> but <hi>repented</hi> and <hi>amended it,</hi> and, where there was any, <hi>repaired the wrong,</hi> and <hi>sought to be reconciled</hi>; and if we have <hi>beg'd pardon for all our involuntary slips,</hi> and have been diligent in <hi>shewing cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> and <hi>forgiveness, to atone for them:</hi> then are we <hi>innocent in the accounts of the Gospel,</hi> and when Christ comes to judge us, we shall hear the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sentence of <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you,</hi> Mat. 25.34.

These are considerable either as to their first birth, or indulged continuance. The first stirrings of lusts after evil things are unavoidable. The after-entertainment is by our own indulgence. Even these are uncondemning so long as they neither are consented to, nor fulfilled, being in themselves not deadly under the Gospel, but a temptation to deadly and damning sins. The way whereby sin wins upon men, and the nature and force of temptation. To be tempted is no sin, which is proved from the nature of temptation, from <hi>Adams</hi> being tempted before he sinned, and from Christs being tempted who knew no sin. Degrees in temptation or in lusts of evil. Some are checked quickly, and are not permitted long to parly. This happens only in grown men and perfect Christians, and that too not in all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances. These certainly are not damning. Others stay longer, and strive and contend with our mind or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, although at last they are vanquished by it. This happens ordinarily to younger Converts, and in extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary temptations to grown Christians. These still are uncondemning, which is shewn from <hi>Gal. 5.16, 17;</hi> and from the instance of our Saviour Christ. What lusts and desires of evil are damning. They are condemning when they make us consent to a damning sin. A distinct account of the several steps to a sinful action. A proof of this, that from their gaining of our consent in all the after-steps they are mortal. Our lusts must be mortified to that degree, as to be disabled from carrying us on thus far. This is done when men become true Christians. The better men are, the less difficulty and self-denial do they find in mortification. Watchfulness and strife still necessary. The danger of indulging to temptations, or to lusts and desires of evil. This point summed up.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <pb n="637" facs="tcp:66440:336"/>IN matters of Religion and another World, nothing is more ordinarily observable than that those people are wont to have the greatest fears, who have the least reason for them. For good Christians, although they think the best of others, are generally very suspicious of themselves. They have a deep sense of the danger of sin, and a full conviction of the fatal end of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and that makes them think, that in a matter wherein it so highly concerns them not to be mistaken, they can never be over-jealous of their own hearts, or too cautious, lest after all, those insupportable punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of sin should fall to be their own portion.</p>
               <p>And this they do especially, if in any <hi>material point,</hi> whereupon, as to the Sentence of Life or Death, the Gospel lays a great stress, they are <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous.</hi> For there are no terrors in the world that are comparable to those of Religion, nor have any men upon earth so much reason to be afraid, as they who are in danger to fall under them. And therefore if there is any thing which will be of great account in the last Judgment, or, what is all one, which they think will be severely accounted for; and they either find themselves to be guilty of it, or, which comes to the same thing, fansie that they are: they must needs be fearfully perplexed, and deprived of all <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>comfort,</hi> though really they are in the greatest <hi>safety.</hi> 'Tis true indeed that in the end they shall be no losers, nor shall their <hi>mistaken fears</hi> ever be <hi>fulfilled</hi> upon them; because at the last Day God will judge them according to his own Rule, and not according to their errours and misapprehensions of it; so that if they have really done all that which he requires to Heaven and Happiness, he will think well of them notwithstanding they think never so hardly of themselves. Their errors
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:66440:337"/>
shall in no wise pervert his Truth, for he sees what they are, howsoever they may mistake it; and if he sees them to be righteous, his sentence will follow his own knowledge, and he will declare to all the world that they are so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This</hi> is the <hi>security</hi> of all <hi>good men,</hi> as it is the <hi>eternal terror</hi> and <hi>astonishment</hi> of all <hi>hypocrites</hi> and <hi>sinners,</hi> that they shall be brought before an <hi>unerring</hi> and <hi>uncorrupt Judge,</hi> who can neither be bribed nor deceived, and who cannot mistake them, or wrongfully condemn them, howsoever they may mistake, or wrongfully condemn themselves. And since it is so, they are real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly safe in their own goodness, when they most of all suspect their own danger; and secure from evil, even whilst they are afraid of falling under it.</p>
               <p>But although every good man is in this <hi>safety,</hi> let his understanding of himself be what it will; yet if in any of those things which he takes to be a matter of life or death, he judges wrong of himself, and thinks erroneously, he can enjoy no <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>comfort.</hi> He will go to Heaven full of fears, and forbodeing thoughts; and never think himself in the way to Bliss till he is actually inthroned in it, and possessed of it. He will meet indeed with happiness in the end, but he will have no sight or expectation of it in the way; for all his life long he will be tormented with doubts and suspicions, fears and jealousies; and be still by turns concluding himself lost as to the next World, though he be lost no where but in his own fancy. And this imagined future misery will bring him under a real one for the present; it will make him have sad thoughts and a sorrowful heart, it will bereave him of all joy and peace, and almost overwhelm him in groundless perplexity and vexation.</p>
               <p>But that pious Souls may not fear where no fear is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="639" facs="tcp:66440:337"/>
nor torment themselves with unreasonable expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; having before shewn what that condition really is which renders any mans a safe condition, I will go on now to remove their groundless scruples and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes concerning it, by shewing <hi>what,</hi> and of <hi>what force those things are, which are wont, without any suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reason, to disquiet the minds, and to disturb the peace of good and safe, but mistaken Christians about it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for the <hi>causes of good mens fears,</hi> so far as I have been able to learn them, they are chiefly these that follow.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Good men are wont to call in question the <hi>savea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of their present,</hi> and the <hi>happiness of their future state</hi>; because after all their care against them, they find that <hi>some motions of the flesh, some stirrings of their lusts, some thoughts of evil do still arise up in them.</hi> They feel themselves subject to delightsom fancies and desires of forbidden things. They are liable to a <hi>lustful thought,</hi> a <hi>covetous wish,</hi> an insurrection of <hi>anger,</hi> of <hi>envy,</hi> and of several other damning sins. 'Tis true indeed that these lusts do not reign in them, because they do not consent to their instigations, nor do what they would have them. They can only inhabit and stir in them, but have not strength enough to give Laws to them; for they repress them before they get so far, and prevail over them before they go on to fulfil what they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to. Not any of these sinful lusts, whereof they are afraid, has got so much power over them, as to carry them on either to <hi>consent</hi> to them, or to <hi>fulfil</hi> them; for though they may <hi>think</hi> on some forbidden things in their <hi>minds,</hi> or <hi>desire</hi> them in their <hi>hearts</hi>; yet do they not <hi>will</hi> and <hi>chuse</hi> any of them, and least of all do they <hi>work</hi> and <hi>practise</hi> them. They may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have a thought and fancy, a wish and inclination after <hi>unchast</hi> pleasures; but they correct themselves
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:66440:338"/>
there, and go no further, for they never in their hearts consent to an <hi>unlawful embrace,</hi> nor ever proceed to an <hi>unclean action.</hi> In a sudden motion of <hi>anger,</hi> it may be, they may have several <hi>expressions of wrath</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of revenge</hi> occur to their <hi>thoughts,</hi> and obtruding themselves upon their <hi>fancy</hi>; but they stop there and go no higher, for they do not consent to utter an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious word,</hi> or to commit a <hi>spiteful action</hi>; and the same they experience by themselves in other instances. In all which several forbidden things will get into their <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>desires,</hi> and steal from them a <hi>wish</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination</hi>; but when once they have done that they can do no more, being unable either to gain their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, or to command their practice, so as that they should not only desire, but also chuse and fulfil them. But although they do not suffer sin to reign in them so as to <hi>consent to it,</hi> or to <hi>fulfil it in the lusts thereof</hi>; yet they fear lest their <hi>very thoughts</hi> and <hi>inclinations after it</hi> should prove <hi>damnable.</hi> For God requires the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of our <hi>whole man,</hi> of the <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> as well as of our <hi>wills</hi> and <hi>actions</hi>; and he is disobeyed by <hi>any,</hi> as well as by <hi>all</hi> our faculties. And seeing every sin is forbidden under pain of death, who knows but that this admission of sin into our thoughts and desires is a deadly transgression. This is one great cause of fear, and a rock of offence to truly honest and good men.</p>
               <p>But to take off all doubt and scruple upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, we must know that <hi>our impotent lusts</hi> and <hi>ineffective desires of evil things, if they are able to get no further than a thought or a wish,</hi> though at present they are a <hi>matter of our exercise</hi> and <hi>humiliation</hi>; yet at the Day of Judgment they shall be no <hi>Article of death or condemnation.</hi> For Christs Gospel doth not sentence us severely upon these first <hi>motions of a lust,</hi> or <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings

of a sin</hi>; no, if they arrive no higher than <hi>fancy</hi> and <hi>inclination,</hi> through the merits of Christs Sacrifice there is Grace enough in store for them, and in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel account they are not grown up to be a matter of Death, nor come within the Confines of destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>That I may speak with the more distinctness to this Point, I will here shew these two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>for our feeble lusts and desires after evil, which are unconsented to, and unfulfilled, we shall not at the last day be condemned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. For <hi>what lusts and desires of them we shall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I say, <hi>For our feeble lusts and desires of evil, which are unconsented to and unfulfilled, at the day of Judgment no man otherwise good shall ever be condemned.</hi> God will never sentence us to Hell for every <hi>sudden desire</hi> an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination after sinful things</hi>; but if it rests there, and goes no further than bare desire, he will pardon and pass it by, but not eternally avenge it.</p>
               <p>To speak <hi>distinctly</hi> to this Point, these <hi>lustings</hi> and <hi>desires</hi> are considerable either as to their <hi>first birth,</hi> or as to their <hi>indulged</hi> and <hi>allowed continuance</hi>: the <hi>first</hi> are <hi>never</hi> damning, and the <hi>latter many times</hi> are no Article of condemnation.</p>
               <p>As for our bodily lusts and desires of evil, in their <hi>first birth,</hi> I say, <hi>they are never damning, nor shall any man, who is otherwise vertuous</hi> and <hi>obedient, be ever judged to dye for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if it were otherwise, who could possibly be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? For as long as we live in this World, we have all of us these <hi>first motions</hi> of appetites after evil things more or less; and there is no avoiding of it. For the Laws of God, which are impositions superinduced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Natures, by their prohibitions make several of our most <hi>natural appetites</hi> and <hi>desires</hi> themselves to be
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:66440:339"/>
sinful; the <hi>lusts of the Flesh</hi> making up a good part of the <hi>prohibitions</hi> of the Gospel. But although God by his after-prohibition has made them sinful, yet from that natural necessity which he had laid upon us before, we cannot live intirely free from them. For our Flesh will lust, and make offers after such things as are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fitted to its liking; and we cannot help it: because our Bodies, so long as they are conversant among the things of this World, from their natural frame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution will still be <hi>delighted</hi> with some things, to <hi>crave</hi> and <hi>desire</hi>; and <hi>pained</hi> by others, to <hi>hate</hi> and <hi>abhor</hi> them. This, I say, is <hi>natural,</hi> whilst there is any life and sense in our Bodies, the good and evil things of the world must of necessity thus sensibly affect them; and where they are affected with pleasure, there 'tis natural for them to desire; as where they feel pain, 'tis natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for them to abhor the thing which occasions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces it.</p>
               <p>These <hi>first</hi> lustings then and cravings after forbidden things are natural, and were made necessary before the prohibition came to make them sinful. And if by an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Law men shall be condemned for being sensibly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with outward things, or for having a sudden lust and inclination after them upon their being so sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly affected with them; then shall they be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for what they could not help, and dye for not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming impossibilities.</p>
               <p>But God neither <hi>can,</hi> nor <hi>doth</hi> make any Laws which exact things so rigorous: He <hi>punishes nothing in us but what proceeded from our own will,</hi> nor exacts an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of us for our <hi>natural lusts</hi> and <hi>inclinations,</hi> further than they are subject to our <hi>own choice</hi> and <hi>free disposal.</hi> If a <hi>sudden fear,</hi> or an <hi>unclean desire</hi> arise up in the heart of an <hi>holy man,</hi> from the <hi>presence</hi> of <hi>outward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> or <hi>inward imaginations,</hi> and the <hi>natural temper of
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:66440:339"/>
his Blood and Spirits</hi>; he shall not be put to answer for it, because he could not prevent it. He could no more hinder it, than he can hinder the <hi>beating of his heart,</hi> or the <hi>motion of his blood</hi>; seeing it was no free work of his <hi>will,</hi> but a natural effect of his <hi>temper.</hi> And to be condemned for that, is to suffer for having <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> as well as <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi>; and to undergo pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for being made up of <hi>Body</hi> as well as <hi>Soul,</hi> for being a <hi>man</hi> and not an <hi>Angel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for several things indeed which follow upon the <hi>first suggestion of a prohibited object,</hi> and upon the <hi>first lusting</hi> after it: they are not the effects of <hi>nature,</hi> but of our own <hi>choice.</hi> For though a <hi>fancy</hi> of <hi>evil,</hi> and a <hi>sudden lusting</hi> after it from its fansied agreeableness, may obtrude it self upon us whether we will or no, either by <hi>chance,</hi> or by <hi>occasion of a temptation</hi>: yet a <hi>continued entertainment of it,</hi> and a stay upon it in our imaginations, to cherish lust, and inflame desire, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come upon us but by our <hi>own liking</hi> and <hi>connivence.</hi> For as soon as ever we can observe them, our thoughts are our own, to dispose of <hi>how,</hi> and upon <hi>what</hi> we please The <hi>first thought,</hi> 'tis true is not always in our power to hinder, because many times it comes upon us e're we can observe it. For our souls, as I have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times said, are souls in flesh, and make use of our bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly powers in their most spiritual operations; being linked so fast to them, as that they cannot but commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, and be affected with them. But then the <hi>stay</hi> upon it, and the <hi>continued attention</hi> to it in after-enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment is a thing that cannot be so suddenly forced upon us, but we give way to it only <hi>when,</hi> and <hi>how long</hi> we our selves please. So that whatsoever the <hi>first fancy</hi> and <hi>desire</hi> of evil was, the <hi>after-entertainment</hi> is our own; seeing it came not from any necessity of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but from the free determination or connivence of our own will.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="644" facs="tcp:66440:340"/>But yet even these <hi>after-thoughts</hi> and <hi>inclinations af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter forbidden things</hi> are not <hi>always</hi> an Article of our condemnation; but then only when we <hi>consent</hi> to them, or <hi>practise</hi> and <hi>fulfil</hi> them. For if the forbidden thing is only fansied in our minds, and craved by our appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, but has got no consent of our hearts, nor any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of our lives and actions: according to the gracious terms of that Gospel whereby we must stand or fall, it is not yet come within the terrours of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor has made us liable to Death and Hell.</p>
               <p>For the evil and danger of our <hi>bodily desires,</hi> we must know, is the evil and danger of a <hi>temptation.</hi> When our <hi>appetites desire</hi> what the prohibition has made <hi>evil,</hi> and our <hi>Spirits</hi> on the other side declare what the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment has made <hi>good</hi>; then is the time of <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>tryal</hi> whether our wills are resolved to stick to our <hi>lusts</hi> or to our <hi>Duty,</hi> and whether they will prefer God or sin. And herein lyes the great danger of our natural appetites; for although <hi>in themselves they are not deadly and damning to any man otherwise good,</hi> yet are <hi>they traps and snares to deadly and damning sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>themselves,</hi> I say, <hi>to any Christian man who is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise good and vertuous, our natural appetites are not dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and damning.</hi> The lusting and inclination of our <hi>Flesh</hi> after <hi>Meats</hi> and <hi>Drinks,</hi> and after <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi>; and the lusting of the <hi>eye</hi> after <hi>gain</hi> and <hi>riches,</hi> are not <hi>absolutely</hi> and <hi>directly forbidden,</hi> or in <hi>themselves,</hi> and before they have got any further, an <hi>Article of our condemnation.</hi> No, all the desires of the Flesh are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally necessary, some to preserve our <hi>own persons,</hi> and some to the <hi>preservation</hi> and <hi>propagation of Mankind.</hi> This God himself has made, and he allows of it. It is no mans sin to have a <hi>stomach to his meat,</hi> or to have <hi>desires after ease,</hi> and a <hi>fleshly inclination after bodily plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures:</hi> because God has so framed our Bodies that they
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:66440:340"/>
should, and therefore he cannot be angry with us if we do desire them. Indeed he has not left these desires to their own swing, but has put several restraints upon them: he has bound them up from <hi>some objects,</hi> and in <hi>some degrees.</hi> For we are forbid to desire and lust af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>meat</hi> and <hi>drink, ease</hi> and <hi>pleasure, riches</hi> and <hi>plenty,</hi> when either we are <hi>injurious</hi> to other men in procuring that which we lust after, or when we are <hi>excessive</hi> and <hi>intemperate</hi> in the use of it, or for its sake <hi>transgress any other Commandment.</hi> Our <hi>desires of meat</hi> and <hi>drink,</hi> for instance, must not carry us on to excessive measures in <hi>gluttony</hi> and <hi>drunkenness</hi>; our <hi>carnal lusts</hi> must not draw us on to act them with undue objects in <hi>fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, adultery, rapes,</hi> or other <hi>prohibited uncleannesses</hi>; and our <hi>desire of money</hi> must not betray us into <hi>thefts</hi> or <hi>robberies, fraud</hi> and <hi>circumvention, extortion</hi> and <hi>oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, niggardliness, uncharitableness,</hi> or other sins whether against <hi>Justice</hi> or <hi>Charity.</hi> As on the other side our <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>aversations</hi> from <hi>want,</hi> or <hi>pain,</hi> or other <hi>bodily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> must not induce us to <hi>neglect a Commandment</hi> that we may please our Flesh, or to <hi>deny our Religion</hi> for the securing of a bodily enjoyment. These restraints God has laid upon our bodily appetites, having given us these Commands, with several others mentioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, which we are oft-times tempted to transgress in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the fulfilling of them. For our bodily appetites themselves do not <hi>distinguish,</hi> either of <hi>objects,</hi> or of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</hi> A mans <hi>palate,</hi> or his <hi>stomach</hi> in any delicious meat or drink which yields a pleasure to it, doth not tell him when they have enough, or cease desiring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are gone on to be intemperate. Our <hi>eyes</hi> lust after money, but they consider not whose it is; but so they may have it, they matter not to whom it belongs, or how they come by it: and so it is in our fleshly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites of other things. For it is the natural pleasure of
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:66440:341"/>
those things which we lust after that moves our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and therefore they lust after them so long as they are pleased with them. They never stop at a fixt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, or turn away from a forbidden object; so that if we will be ruled by them, they will carry us on to any thing that agrees with them, whether it be <hi>lawful</hi> or <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,</hi> and so are sure to insnare us into sin. And here indeed God has set a strict restraint upon them, and will punish them severely if they go beyond it. For</p>
               <p>Then, as I said, our <hi>lusts are deadly to us, and articles of our condemnation, when they have damning effects,</hi> and <hi>ensnare us into deadly and damning sins.</hi> To any good man the bare lusts and desires of evil are not so truly a <hi>damning sin,</hi> as a <hi>dangerous temptation</hi>; they are not in themselves an Article of Death to him, but they are apt to carry him on to that which is. For that which puts any sin into a capacity to tempt us, is our lust or desire of something which is annexed to it, and which we hope to obtain by it. There is always something that goes along with it, which is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fitted to please our flesh, and to excite a carnal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite; and by this we are tempted and allured into the practice and commission of it. For <hi>bare</hi> sin could never tempt any man, nor could any one in his wits ever chuse to disobey for disobedience sake without any thing further: because there is no good in transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion nakedly considered, which should move any mans will to chuse and embrace it; but on the contrary much evil, that will disswade and affright him from it. For it deprives us of <hi>Gods favour,</hi> and <hi>subjects us to his vengeance,</hi> and <hi>fills us with sad hearts,</hi> and <hi>anxious thoughts,</hi> and <hi>terrible expectations.</hi> But that which wins us over to a liking and approbation of it, is the appearance of some <hi>pleasure, profit, honour,</hi> or other
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:66440:341"/>
annexed allurement which we expect to reap by it. It is one or other of these that overcomes all our fears, and inveagles us into the commission of it; for they strike in with our natural appetites, and raise in us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires after it; and those prove the bait which draws us in, and the insnaring temptation.</p>
               <p>For herein lies all the <hi>force</hi> of any <hi>temptation: The satisfaction of a lust is joyned with the acting of a sin, which is an invitation to us for the sake of the one to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the other also.</hi> The transgression has something annexed which is agreeable to our fleshly Natures, and raises in us desires of it, and cravings after it; and when it has got this hold of us, it draws us as much as we can be drawn by our love of our own lusts, and the gratification of our bodily appetites; which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a great step to our choice and commission of it, and a strong temptation.</p>
               <p>For this is the <hi>natural order</hi> of our <hi>actions</hi>; either our <hi>Consciences</hi> or our <hi>Passions move</hi> and <hi>excite</hi> us to them, and then our <hi>Wills chuse</hi> and <hi>intend</hi> them, and upon that choice and intention our <hi>Vnderstandings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive</hi> and <hi>direct,</hi> and last of all our <hi>bodily</hi> and <hi>executive Powers fulfil</hi> and <hi>perform them.</hi> All our bodily actions are at the choice and under the command of our wills, and all our choice is upon the appearance of some good or other, which either our consciences, or our fleshly lusts and appetites propose to us. For our wills, we must remember, are placed in a middle state, and are canvased and beset on both sides, our lusts being urgent with us to consent to one thing, and our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to another. And this is that <hi>strife betwixt the flesh and spirit,</hi> which is mentioned in the Scriptures; and that contention which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> describes in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> between the <hi>Law of lust in the members</hi> and the <hi>Law of God in the mind.</hi> These <hi>two</hi>
                  <pb n="648" facs="tcp:66440:342"/>
Principles, our <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> or our <hi>Lusts</hi> and our <hi>Consciences,</hi> are those great Interests that vie and strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle in us, and emulously contend which shall obtain the consent and choice of the will of man. And when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever either of them has got that, our actions follow in course. For our bodily members move at our own choice; and therefore if our lusts after the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of sin have once prevailed upon our wills to consent to it, they have gained their point and their work is done, and we shall go on without more ado to act and commit it.</p>
               <p>In this then lies all the force of a temptation, that the sin which we are tempted to has something annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it wherein our flesh is delighted, and which it lusts after, and desires for the sake of that pleasure which it finds in it. And when by this means any sin has got our fleshly love and desire, it has got a powerful friend in our own bosoms. For our lusts are strong and violent, and where they set upon a thing, they will not easily be denied, but are urgent and importunate with our wills to consent to their gratification, and yield to the fulfilling of them. So that if once any sin has struck in with them, it is able to try its strength, and contend with the Law of God in the mind; being furnished now with a powerful bait and a strong tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</p>
               <p>Thus are our lusts and desires of forbidden things, not the forbidden sin it self, but the temptation to it; so that in bare lusting or desiring of them, we do not commit the damning sins themselves, but are tempted only to their commission. And in this S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>James</hi> is most express; for <hi>then,</hi> says he, <hi>every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lusts, and enticed</hi> to evil by them, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14.</p>
               <p>And as for <hi>meer temptation</hi> to a damning sin, it is
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:66440:342"/>
not deadly and damning. For our being tempted to sin is not a renouncing of our Lord, but an exercise of our service and obedience to him, and a tryal whether or no we will renounce him. It is the great proof and argument how dearly we love him, and how closely and faithfully our wills adhere to him. It shews how obedience is uppermost in our hearts, and that we will rather deny our dearest lusts and importunate desires, than venture, for their sakes, to offend him. So that to be tempted is no instance of damning disobedience, but a plain proof how much we will lose and suffer ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than we will disobey. It is a tryal of us how we prefer God and our Duty before other things, even those that are most dear to us of all things in the world besides. We do not sin damnably then in being tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, so long as we consent not to it, but manfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist and overcome the temptation.</p>
               <p>And this is evident from hence, because <hi>those very men who have lived most free from sin, have not for all that lived free from temptation.</hi> Even <hi>Adam</hi> himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he knew what sin was, and during his state of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, was liable to be tempted. For the Tree of <hi>Knowledge of good and evil,</hi> whereof God had forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den him to eat, was <hi>alluring to his eyes,</hi> and an <hi>incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to his lust,</hi> as well as any other Tree of the Garden. And because it was so, the Woman was won to eat of it through the strength of such desire after it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing God had commanded her to abstain from it. <hi>The woman saw that the Tree was good for food, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant to the eye, and she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat</hi>; and by the same inducement she drew in her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and <hi>gave it unto him, and he did eat</hi> also, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.6. And the <hi>second Adam,</hi> who was most entirely innocent and guilty of no sort of <note n="a" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.22. John 14.30.</note> sin, was yet liable to temptation like as we are, being <hi>in all points tempted
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:66440:343"/>
like as we are, yet without sin,</hi> Heb. 4.15. Nay, says the Apostle, it was necessary that he should be so; that by what he felt in himself, he might the better know how to shew mercy and have compassion upon us. <hi>In all things,</hi> says he, <hi>it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful</hi> as well as a <hi>faithful High Priest; for in that he himself hath suffer'd being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted,</hi> Heb. 2.17, 18.</p>
               <p>As for our being tempted then, or invited to any sin by our bare lusts and inclinations after it; in it self, and before it has got any further, it is no deadly sin or damnable transgression. It is the <hi>scene of good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,</hi> the <hi>tryal of obedience,</hi> a <hi>test of our great love and preference of God and his Law before all the world besides, yea even before our own dearest lusts, and our own selves. It is nothing more than befel</hi> Adam <hi>before he had sinned,</hi> or <hi>than befel Christ who never knew sin</hi>; and therefore in it self bare lust and desire, or being tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted and invited to sin, cannot be damnably sinful.</p>
               <p>As for our <hi>Lusts</hi> or <hi>Temptations,</hi> 'tis true they differ in <hi>degrees,</hi> according as our desires of that evil which we are tempted to are indulged, and have advanced more or less. For sometimes a <hi>lust may stir,</hi> but as <hi>soon</hi> as ever it is <hi>observed</hi> it is <hi>again extinguished.</hi> The plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the sin, whether by being seen or fansied, raises in us a sudden thought or desire after it; but the lust is expelled as soon as it is discovered, it is not suffered to remain and dwell in us, but is presently thrown out with indignation. For we turn away our fancy from the evil thing, and will not endure to think upon it, or to continue craving and lusting after it. And this is a power over our own desires, and a way of breaking the strength of temptation, which is incident only to <hi>grown men</hi> and to <hi>perfect Christians:</hi> and that not in all instances of temptation, but only in such as are not
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:66440:343"/>
                  <hi>extraordinary in themselves,</hi> and which have been <hi>often vanquished</hi> and <hi>triumphed</hi> over. It is in such cases where use has made the conquest easie, and long cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of ceasing and turning away from the inveigling desire has taken off all the difficulty; so that now we are able to silence and subdue the lust as soon as we discern it. And as for these feeble desires and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent temptations, there is no question but that a good Christian may be under them, and yet be in no danger of being condemned for them.</p>
               <p>But then at other times our <hi>lusts live longer,</hi> and <hi>advance higher</hi>; they grow up to good degrees, till they are able to contend and strive against our mind and conscience; so that even when at last they are denied, and our wills chuse to do what God commands in spite of them; yet is it after much struggling and opposition. The flesh lusteth against the spirit, as well as the spirit lusteth against the flesh; and although at last the fleshly lusts are overpower'd, and cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with our wills to chuse on their side; yet do they strive hard and contend for it. And here a lust is not presently subdued as soon as it is discerned, but it strives and struggles; it can make head against the Law in the mind, although it cannot overcome it; it has some interest in the will, although it have not an interest sufficient; for the will hearkens to it for some time, and considers of what it offers, notwithstanding at last it reject its suit, and through the sollicitations of a more powerful Favourite, resolves against it. And this power our lusts have in us whilst we are <hi>young Converts,</hi> and of a more <hi>imperfect goodness</hi>; nay in some very <hi>great temptations</hi> indeed, such as are the <hi>fear of death</hi> and <hi>bodily torments</hi> especially, they will struggle thus in those who are the most <hi>perfect</hi> Christians of all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="652" facs="tcp:66440:344"/>But now when our lusts are in this d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Paul</hi> himself says of the truly <hi>regenerate,</hi> or of those who, in his words, <hi>walk in the spirit.</hi> For in them he says plainly, that the <hi>flesh lusteth against the spirit,</hi> albeit it is not able to <hi>prevail over</hi> it; so that even in doing what the spirit commands them, they do against the contrary will and lusting of the flesh which gainsays it. <hi>The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; so that</hi> even in fulfilling the will of the spirit, you contradict another will of your lusts, and <hi>cannot do,</hi> or <note n="b" place="margin">

Nay even <hi>Christ</hi> himself who knew no sin, nor ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any thing which could in strict justice be worthy of death; was yet subject to such a conflict of flesh and spirit as this now mentioned. His very <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Passion,</hi> which was the <hi>very</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Phil. 2.8.</note> 
                  <hi>consummation</hi> and <hi>highest part of his obedience,</hi> was not without great struggling of his flesh, and a long and earnest conflict of his bodily desires against it. For he was in a <hi>strange fear</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composure</hi> about it; <hi>he began,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Mark, to be sore amazed,</hi> Mark 14.34. And when he had reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered himself a little from the maze of that sudden fright, he <hi>prays</hi> against it— <hi>O my Father, if it he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, let this cup pass from me,</hi> Mat. 26.39. And when his request was not granted at first, he makes a fresh address wherein he is more <hi>importunate— being in his Agony,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Luke, he prayed more earnestly,</hi> Luk. 22.44; <hi>his supplications he offered up with strong crying and
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:66440:344"/>
tears,</hi> Hebr. 5.7. All this strife and opposition did the desire of life, and the bodily appetite after ease and safety, together with the sense of God's wrath and high displeasure, raise in him against this obedience of his sufferings. But because all this was only lust and desire, which although it lasted some time, and discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed him much, was not yet able to gain any thing of his will and <note n="d" place="margin">Matth. 26.39, 42.</note> consent to it; therefore notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, was he perfectly innocent. All that can be said is, That he was tempted by the desires of his Flesh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this great and last instance of obedience; but he did not yield or consent to the temptation.</p>
               <p>Thus then as for the lusts and desires of our Flesh, whether they be suddenly rejected and make no resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or are longer liv'd and contend much; if they have got no consent of our wills to the fulfilling of them, nor any choice of the evil which is craved by them, they are only a temptation to a damning sin, but in themselves thus far they are not damning.</p>
               <p>As for these motions and lustings after evil things then, that are unconsented to and unfulfilled, which are the complaint and fear of good men; they shall not harm them, or be charged upon them to their condemnation. But when God comes to judgment, he will pardon and pass them by, and not eternally punish and avenge for them.</p>
               <p>And having shewn thus <hi>for what lusts and desires of evil we shall at the last day be pardoned</hi>; I come now,</p>
               <p n="2">2. To shew <hi>for which of them we shall be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for this, we have in great part our answer to it already. For our <hi>lusts are then damnable and dangerously evil, when they are effectual instruments and temptations to damning evils, and carry us on either to chuse, or practise them.</hi> For they are the great Favourites and Seducers of our
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:66440:345"/>
wills, and thereby the Authors of our actions; they first bring us to chuse and consent to the deadly sin whereby they are gratified, and then to act it; and when they are gone on to either of these, they are an Article of our condemnation. They are uncondemning till they come so far, but if once they have got us to <hi>consent to the alluring sin, from that consent begins their sting,</hi> and both it, and all that follows it, make us lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to eternal destruction.</p>
               <p>To make this Discourse more clear, I will here set down those <hi>several steps</hi> whereby we ascend to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion, and are carried on to the working and commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of any sin.</p>
               <p n="1">1. At the <hi>representation</hi> of the object which is to tempt us to it, whether it be an <hi>unchast embrace,</hi> an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful gain,</hi> or the like, either by what we <hi>feel of</hi> it now if it be before our <hi>senses,</hi> or by what we <hi>fansie</hi> if it is in our <hi>imagination,</hi> our <hi>flesh is pleased</hi> and <hi>delighted</hi> with it. And from this <hi>pleasure</hi> it naturally goes on to <hi>love,</hi> and from <hi>loving</hi> to <hi>desire</hi> it. And <hi>desire</hi> or <hi>lust</hi> is the <hi>last step</hi> among the passions; for <hi>delight</hi> begets <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>love</hi> ends in <hi>desire</hi>; but when once we are come to desire a thing, our passions have done their part, and all that in them lyes towards the action.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When in the <hi>appetite</hi> or <hi>animal soul</hi> the sin has gone thus far, the next step is, that to gratifie this desire or lust of our Flesh, our <hi>wills</hi> should <hi>consent</hi> to it. For our wills are the Disposers of all that follows, so that unless they consent to get that which the Flesh so much desires, there can nothing more be done towards it. But if they do <hi>consent to the desire,</hi> and <hi>intend to fulfil it</hi>; then,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our <hi>understanding</hi> and <hi>contrivance</hi> is employed in <hi>deliberating</hi> and <hi>consulting what time, what place, what means</hi> are fittest to accomplish it with the least difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:66440:345"/>
and the most delight, and to the greatest advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. And when our minds have seen which to prefer and fix upon; then,</p>
               <p n="4">4. Our <hi>wills resolve upon them,</hi> and make <hi>choice of them.</hi> And when this is done, the last <hi>Decree is past,</hi> and all the time of <hi>doubting</hi> and <hi>deliberation</hi> is over; so that nothing more remains, but,</p>
               <p n="5">5. To apply our <hi>bodily powers to perform our resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> in the execution and commission of that which was resolved upon.</p>
               <p>This is the natural order of our faculties, and the process that is observed by our principles of action in their completion and final commission of any sin. The first beginning is in the <hi>lower soul,</hi> for that is the inlet of all sin, and the seat of temptation; and there it is that sin hath all its strength and insnaring power, upon which account it is called by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> a <hi>Law in the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> Rom. 7.23. And when these lusts of our Flesh have won the <hi>consent of our wills,</hi> they are secure of all our after-contrivances for it, and of our actual perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance and execution of it. For both our thoughts and our bodily powers are at the Command of our own wills; so that if at the instigation of our lusts, our wills have once consented to the sin, they will quickly set our heads awork to contrive for it, and our hands and other bodily powers to execute and fulfil it.</p>
               <p>And in this method our Principles of action move, when we act with <hi>full deliberation,</hi> and when they are <hi>all employed.</hi> Sometimes indeed there is no <hi>contrivance</hi> at all, because none is needful; as it happens when the opportunity of the sin is present with us, and just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us at such time as we consent to it; so that nothing more is wanting but only to act and fulfil it. But when the opportunity is absent, and we are put to forecast and contrive for it; then is the process of our faculties
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:66440:346"/>
in that very order which I have here described.</p>
               <p>For an instance and illustration of this, we will take the sin of <hi>drunkenness,</hi> and the process will appear to be in that order which I have mentioned. For in a man whose inclination that way disposes him to be tempted by it, the <hi>fancy</hi> of it in himself, or the having it suggested by another, gives him a <hi>thought</hi> of the <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> which accompanies it; and from that apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of its pleasurableness he begins to <hi>love,</hi> and from that loved he goes on straightway to <hi>desire</hi> it. And now his <hi>will</hi> being sollicited by his lust or bodily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, <hi>consents</hi> to the fulfilling of it. And this consent being once gained, the next thing in order is to <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate</hi> and <hi>contrive what company, what time,</hi> and <hi>what place</hi> are fittest for it. And when by comparing all things together he comes to make a judgment of that, he immediately <hi>chuses</hi> and <hi>resolves</hi> upon it; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, there is nothing remaining further but to <hi>execute</hi> what he has resolved, and go on to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it.</p>
               <p>This then is the method and progress, from our lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and desiring of any thing that is evil, to our acting and committing it. It begins in <hi>delight,</hi> and <hi>love</hi> and <hi>desire</hi>; and thence goes on to our <hi>consenting</hi> to it, to our <hi>contrivance</hi> for it, to our <hi>resolutions</hi> upon it, and after all these to our <hi>practice</hi> and <hi>performance</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>Now so long as the evil is entertained only in a <hi>short delightsom thought,</hi> or <hi>love,</hi> or <hi>desires,</hi> and rests <hi>there,</hi> but goes no <hi>further:</hi> it is not so much our <hi>damning sin,</hi> as our <hi>dangerous temptation</hi>; it will be connived at, and at the last Day we shall not be condemned for it. For thus far the sin is only solliciting our choice, but has not got it; and as yet we have not committed a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal crime, but are only under a tryal whether we will be drawn to the commission of it, or no. But if once
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:66440:346"/>
our wills <hi>consent to it,</hi> then begins the sting, and there the danger enters; for the lusting after evil so far as to <hi>consent</hi> to it, and much more so as to <hi>contrive</hi> for it, or to <hi>fulfil</hi> it, makes us liable to death and eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. For our <hi>own choice,</hi> as we heard above<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>makes any sin damning</hi>; so that if by means of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting lust any sin has prevailed so far, it is become a deadly offence, and subjects us to destruction. <hi>Lust,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>James, when it has conceived,</hi> or is imperfectly consented to, answering to conception which is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect information, <hi>bringeth forth sin; and sin when</hi> by being perfectly consented to, <hi>it is finished, bringeth forth death</hi> which is the wages of it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.15.</p>
               <p>And that our lusts after any sin are then damnably sinful when they are gone <hi>beyond</hi> desire, and are come on either to our <hi>consent,</hi> or <hi>contrivance,</hi> or actual <hi>perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi>; appears further from these instances in them all <hi>three.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we lust so long after any evil thing, as to <hi>consent to the sinful enjoyment of it,</hi> we are guilty of all that punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is threatned to it. <hi>He that looks upon a woman,</hi> says our Saviour, so long as <hi>to lust after her,</hi> or to <note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Juxta Domini nostri Dictum, Qui Mulierem viderit ad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscendum, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us est Adulterii corde concepti: intelligere possu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus quod et sires turpes &amp; dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabiles necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate non agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, pro ipsa ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men rerum tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium voluntate damnamur.</hi> Sal. de Prov. l. 6. p. 205. Ed. Oxon.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in his heart to the enjoyment of her, <hi>he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted adultery already with her in his heart,</hi> Mat. 5.28.</p>
               <p>If we lust so long as to <hi>contrive for it,</hi> which is a degree further; we are more guilty of the sin, and more liable to the punishment of it still. The <hi>incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi> and contrivances of <hi>murder,</hi> as was observed above, are reckoned among those things which <hi>pollute a man,</hi> (and thereby unfit him for entring into Heaven, where nothing can ever have admittance that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean) as well as <hi>murder</hi> it self is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.19.</p>
               <p>But if our lust after any sinful enjoyment carry us on, not only to <hi>consent to it,</hi> or to <hi>contrive for it,</hi> but, what is the perfection of all, to <hi>work</hi> and <hi>fulfil</hi> it: then
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:66440:347"/>
has it ensnared us into as much mischief as it can, and is become <hi>dangerous</hi> and <hi>damning</hi> with a witness. For then it has prevailed with us to compleat our sin, and give the last hand to it; it has brought us under that which is most of all threatned; for now we <hi>fulfil the lusts of the flesh,</hi> Gal. 5.16, 19; <hi>we work iniquity,</hi> Mat. 7.23.</p>
               <p>And if we continue to do this not only for <hi>once</hi> or <hi>twice,</hi> but in <hi>constant returns,</hi> and in a <hi>fixt course</hi> and <hi>tenure of action</hi>; then as our <hi>sin is grown higher,</hi> the acts thereof being more numerous, and the guilt more crying; so will our punishment also be more <hi>dreadfully severe.</hi> And this is called <hi>walking after the flesh,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.10; and <hi>living after the flesh,</hi> Rom. 8.13. And this being a <hi>state of wasted virtue,</hi> and <hi>habitual reigning sin</hi>; it is not only, through its obnoxiousness to punishment, a <hi>state of death</hi>; but also, through its hardness of cure and difficult recovery, a state of <hi>great doubt</hi> and <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> likewise.</p>
               <p>So that as for all these <hi>further degrees,</hi> from the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of our wills, onward</hi>; if our lusts after any sin have gone on to them, they are deadly and damning. For the same <hi>Law in the members</hi> which <hi>wars against the law of the mind,</hi> so as thus to captivate and triumph over it, is as the <hi>Law of sin,</hi> so, as the Apostle says, the <hi>Law of death</hi> too, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23.24.</p>
               <p>All our lustings after evil therefore, when once they come to be consented to, although before they were connived at, are thenceforth deadly and damning. So that whosoever hopes to be saved at the last Day from the punishment of them, must thus far mortifie and kill them. <hi>Mortifie,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, those desires which are seated in your earthly members,</hi> Col. 3.5; for it is only <hi>if you through the spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, that you shall live,</hi> Rom. 8.13. As to these <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable degrees,</hi> all fleshly lusts must of necessity be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:66440:347"/>
in all <hi>good Christian men</hi>; for no man will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to <hi>belong to Christ</hi> till this change is wrought in him. <hi>They that are Christs,</hi> says the same Apostle, <hi>have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts,</hi> Gal. 5.24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mortifie</hi> and <hi>crucifie</hi> them, I say, we must; not so as to have <hi>no fleshly appetites</hi> and <hi>bodily desires of evil</hi>; for then must we have <hi>no bodily desires at all.</hi> Because our lusts themselves, as was observed, do not distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of <hi>lawful</hi> or <hi>unlawful,</hi> but are naturally moved by an agreeable object, whether it be <hi>with God</hi> or <hi>against him.</hi> But we must mortifie them to that <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi> as that they never be <hi>able to win us over to consent to any forbidden thing for their gratification.</hi> They must never have so much interest in our hearts, as to make us prefer them before our duty, and chuse to perform what <hi>they</hi> bid us, rather than what <hi>God</hi> doth. Some stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and <hi>ineffective motions</hi> of them, which cannot prevail against God, nor gain over the consent of our wills to any thing that he has forbidden, are dispensed with; they are the stage of temptation but not of death; for God bears with them, and the mortified men themselves do daily feel and labour under them. But it is the <hi>prevailing strength</hi> of our lusts after evil things, when they get our consent to them, and carry us on to transgress Gods Laws to fulfil them: this conquering power of fleshly lusts, I say, it is which is to be morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in every good man, because under this strength and empire of them he cannot go to Heaven.</p>
               <p>And that no <hi>good man</hi> may call in question the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his state, from any needless fears about this <hi>morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi>; this we must know every man has done in <hi>his conversion to become a good Christian.</hi> For before he can be such, he has killed the reigning power of lust, so as not to be acted any longer by its instigation. He feels some small stirrings of it afterwards indeed; but they
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:66440:348"/>
do not win upon him, or prevail over him; for he is always ready to deny the satisfaction of his lust, before he will displease his God; and makes all the desires of his flesh to give way to the dictates of his Conscience. <hi>Ye that are Christs,</hi> saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts,</hi> Gal. 5.24.</p>
               <p>And when this is <hi>once</hi> done, there is no <hi>great trouble</hi> in it <hi>afterwards</hi>; for the more any man is <hi>accustomed to obey,</hi> the less difficulty doth he find in <hi>mortification</hi> and <hi>self-denial,</hi> and in restraining of all those lusts which tempt to disobedience. He is not now in every tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation put to the pain and trouble of <hi>cutting off a right hand,</hi> or of <hi>plucking out a right eye</hi>; the self-denial and mortification went so near him at first, 'tis true; but since he has been used to it, and his flesh is accustomed to bear the yoke and to be under subjection, there are no such pangs and uneasiness attending it. So that if he is not now still upon the severe task of <hi>painful mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,</hi> it is because he doth not need it, since it is done already to his hand. His lusts are so far morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as it is absolutely necessary they should; they are crucified to that degree, as to be disabled from gaining his <hi>consent to them,</hi> his <hi>contrivance for them,</hi> or his <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling</hi> and <hi>performance of them</hi>; and that is as much mortification as God will exact of him.</p>
               <p>But yet when this is done, and our lusts are morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to this degree, there is <hi>still need of a watchful care over them,</hi> and <hi>of a continual strife against them, lest they should rebel again and go further.</hi> For the objects of sense, and the allurements of our flesh are still before us; and our bodies naturally are still as capable to be delighted in them, and thereupon to lust and long after them, as ever they were before. It is only the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering strength of the Law in the mind or consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which maintains the resolution of our wills against
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:66440:348"/>
them, and by that means keeps them under. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if once we begin to slacken our care, and to keep no hank upon them; but allow them to go where, and how far they please; they will quickly grow upon us, and prove too hard for us, and bring us first to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to them, and after that to compleat and fulfil them.</p>
               <p>Let no man therefore <hi>indulge to the thoughts of unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pleasures,</hi> and by the delights of his fancy foment and cherish the lusts and desires of his Flesh; presuming that all is safe whilst he doth not consent to them, nor yields to fulfil them. For admitting that all things else are innocent and uncondemning, yet however by this means he lays a snare for his own soul. For he throws himself into temptation, and so cannot expect that God should deliver him out of it. God has promised to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve us indeed in all necessities of his own making; if his <hi>Providence throws us upon trial, his Grace shall support us under it,</hi> and make a way for our escape out of it. <hi>He will not suffer you to be tempted above what you are able,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>but</hi> together with the temptation he <hi>will make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear</hi> so much of <hi>it</hi> as befalls you, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. But what is this to us if we bring our selves into snares, and prove our own tempters? For there is no reason at all to presume that God, if he will deliver us from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enemies, should deliver us also from our own selves; and that he should secure us by his Spirit from those very snares, which we lay for our own Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. No, if we will entertain Serpents in our bosoms, he has no where engaged, nor is there any reason why he should, that we shall not be stung by them. But on the contrary, he warns us against them, and bids us be careful to keep off from them. Yea, so far must we be from bringing temptations upon our selves, that, if
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:66440:349"/>
we will observe his orders, we must pray daily even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those whereto his Providence might expose us. This being one of those Petitions, which, according to our Lords appointment, we are to put up to God as often as we do that for our daily bread; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>he would not lead us into temptation,</hi> Matth. 6.13. So that if by indulging to delightsome fancies, and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lusts of evil, we throw our selves into a great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, we have just reason to fear that God, for our punishment, should leave us in it, and suffer us damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to fall by it. Such indulgence is apt of <hi>it self</hi> to inflame our lusts, and to weaken our resolutions; and God is also prone to withdraw his Grace, and to leave us to our own strength upon it; and since at the same time it <hi>increases our necessities,</hi> and <hi>withdraws our aids,</hi> it must need<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> put us into a dangerous condition. If then we would secure our souls, and keep off from damning sins; we must resist temptations at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and not give way to them; we must not cherish and indulge, but timely check, and heedfully suppress them.</p>
               <p>And thus at last we see what is the just force of this first cause of fear to honest minds, their <hi>ineffective lusts,</hi> and <hi>impotent desires of evil.</hi> The <hi>first beginnings of lust cannot be avoided, and the longer entertainment of it shall not finally be punished, if it is soon checked by us, nay if it stays longer and contends much with us, so long as it doth not prevail upon us to consent to and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the sin whereto it is a temptation.</hi> But <hi>when once it has gained our consent and choice of that sin whereto it would engage us, then is it of a damning stain, and all its following effects are mortal.</hi> All which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>James</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuates to us in that account which he gives us of the progress and production of sin, which he sets down from the <hi>motive</hi> or <hi>first temptation,</hi> to the <hi>perfect birth</hi>
                  <pb n="663" facs="tcp:66440:349"/>
or <hi>compleat production,</hi> in this order: <hi>Then,</hi> says he, <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lusts, and inticed</hi> to evil by them. This lust or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of evil is only the first step, being as yet not grown up to the stature of sin, but only to that of temptation. But when it advances, and draws in our other faculties; then sin begins and ripens; it is first conceived, and then finished; and after the finishing of it, it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of condemnation, although before it were uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning. For <hi>then when lust hath conceived,</hi> by being in some imperfected measure willed and consented to, <hi>it bringeth forth,</hi> answerable to its conception, which is but an imperfect sort of production, an imperfect em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo of <hi>sin; and</hi> this embryo of <hi>sin, when</hi> by a full choice and perfect consent, and much more when by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and practice, <hi>it is finished, bringeth forth</hi> its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per wages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Although these lustings and desires therefore which good men complain of, may justly be an imployment of their <hi>watchfulness</hi> and <hi>care</hi>; yet ought they not to be a cause of their <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>scruple.</hi> For it shall not bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them those evils which they are afraid of, nor ever prove their ruine and destruction. The evil thing is entertained only in a thought, or a wish; they lust after it, and are tempted by it; but that is all, for they do not consent to the temptation. And since their lusts go no further than thus, they shall not harm them when Christ comes to Judgment, nor ever bring them into condemnation.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. Of two other Causes of groundless Scruple to good Souls.</head>
               <argument>
                  <head>The CONTENTS.</head>
                  <p> A second cause of scruple is their unaffectedness or distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction sometimes in their prayers. Attention disturbed often whether we will or no. A particular cause of it in fervent prayers. Fervency and affection not depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so much upon the command of our wills, as upon the temper of our bodies. Fervency is unconstant in them whose temper is fit for it. God measures us not by the fixedness of our thoughts, or the warmth of our tempers, but by the choice of our wills and the obedience of our lives. Other qualifications in prayer are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to have our prayers heard when these are wanting. Yea, those Vertues which make our prayers acceptable, are more eminently shown in our obedience, so that it would bring down to us the blessings of prayer, should it prove in those respects defective. A third cause of scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is the danger of idle or impertinent words mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Matth. 12.36.</hi> The scruple upon this represented. The practical errour of a morose behaviour incurred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. This discountenanced by the light of Nature, and by Christianity. The benefits and place of serious Discourse. Pleasureable conversation a great Field of Vertue. The idle words, <hi>Matth. 12,</hi> not every vain and useless; but false, slanderous and reproachful words; this proved from the place.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <pb n="665" facs="tcp:66440:350"/>ANother thing which disquiets the hearts of good and honest men, and makes them needlesly to call in question the saveableness of their present state, and their title to salvation; is the <hi>coldness</hi> and <hi>unaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,</hi> the <hi>unsettledness</hi> and <hi>distractions which they find in themselves when they are at prayers.</hi> Good people are wont to cry out of <hi>desertions,</hi> to think that God has thrown them off, and that his Spirit has forsaken them, if at any time they find a great distraction and dulness of Spirit in their devotions, and a great abatement of that zeal and fervency, that fixedness and attention, which they have happily enjoyed at other times.</p>
               <p>But this is a great mistake from mens ignorance of <hi>Gods Laws,</hi> and of their <hi>own selves.</hi> For God has no where told them that he will judge them at the last day by the <hi>steadiness</hi> and <hi>fixedness,</hi> the <hi>tide</hi> and <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency of their devotions</hi>; but by the <hi>integrity of their hearts,</hi> and the <hi>uprightness of their obedience.</hi> The last Sentence shall not pass upon men according to the heat of their affections; but according to the goodness of their lives. So that if they have been careful to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise <hi>all God's Commandments</hi> according to their power and opportunities, and this of <hi>prayer</hi> among the rest, in such sort as their unavoidable infirmities would suffer them, they shall be safe in that Judgment notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any inequality in their bodily tempers, or uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy and abatement in their bodily affections.</p>
               <p>To state this business so, as that we may neither be <hi>unnecessarily scrupulous</hi> about these qualifications of our prayers when we <hi>cannot,</hi> nor, on the other side, <hi>irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously careless</hi> of them when we <hi>might,</hi> enjoy them; I shall say something of their <hi>necessity</hi> when they can be had, as well as of that <hi>allowance</hi> which God will make to them when, through any <hi>bodily indispositions,</hi> or <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreseen
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:66440:351"/>
accidents,</hi> they cannot.</p>
               <p>If we would put up our prayers to God in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as it is fit for <hi>us</hi> to offer them in, or for <hi>him</hi> to hear them, we must make them with a <hi>due fixedness</hi> and <hi>attention of mind,</hi> and <hi>fervency of affection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We must offer them up with a due <hi>fixedness</hi> and <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of mind.</hi> Our thoughts must go along with our lips, and our souls must be intent upon the business which we are about, when we are making our prayers to God. We must not expect that he should mind those vain words, and mere talk, which we do not; or that he should hear us, when we do not hear our selves: No, it is the work of the Soul, and not the bare labour of the lips, which he attends to; so that if only our Tongues pray, but our minds are straying, this is as good as no prayer at all.</p>
               <p>We must offer them up also with much <hi>earnestness of desire,</hi> and <hi>fervency of affection.</hi> We must shew that we put a price upon a mercy, before we are fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; for otherwise there is no assurance that we shall be duely thankful for it. We must not seem cold, and indifferent after it, for that is a sign that we can almost be as well content without it. But we must be eager in our desire, and express a fervency of affection after it; such as we are wont to use in the pursuit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing which we greatly value: and this is an induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for God to give us that, which he sees we so dearly love; it sets a price upon his blessings, and shews the measure of our own vertuous inclinations, and therefore he will encourage and reward it. <hi>The effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous man,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>James, availeth much,</hi> Jam. 5.16.</p>
               <p>Thus are a due attention of mind, and a fervent heat of desire in devotion, such qualifications as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to render our prayers becoming either us to
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:66440:351"/>
offer, or God to hear; so that we must always strive, and, according to our <hi>power</hi> and <hi>present circumstances,</hi> endeavour after them. We must take care, as much as we can, to <hi>compose our thoughts</hi> when we pray, to <hi>draw them off from other things</hi> for some time before, and still to <hi>bring them back again</hi> when at any time we find them wandring. And we must endeavour also by a due sense of the <hi>necessity,</hi> the <hi>greatness,</hi> and <hi>unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedness of Gods mercies,</hi> to <hi>heighten our affections,</hi> and make them bend vigorously and eagerly after those things which we pray for; that so God seeing we are <hi>serious</hi> and in <hi>earnest</hi> with him, he may be induced to grant those benefits which we desire of him.</p>
               <p>But then, on the other hand, if after all our care and pains in fixing of our thoughts, and raising of our desires, through some <hi>bodily indisposition</hi> or <hi>unforeseen accidents,</hi> which we cannot help, our minds run some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times still astray, and our desires are cold and languid; this <hi>unwill'd dulness</hi> and <hi>distraction shall not influence our main state</hi>; it is a thing which we cannot help, and no man living is perfectly free from it, and therefore God will not be severe upon it, but in great mercy he will pity and connive at it.</p>
               <p>For as for the <hi>attention of our minds,</hi> and the <hi>fixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our thoughts,</hi> either in <hi>prayer,</hi> or in any <hi>other</hi> busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; it is a thing which is not always in our own power, but may be hindred and interrupted by many acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents whether we will or no. For any thing that makes our <hi>bodily spirits tumultuary</hi> and <hi>restless,</hi> renders our <hi>attention small</hi> and <hi>interrupted.</hi> Any <hi>high motion of our blood,</hi> any <hi>former impression upon our spirits</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by our <hi>precedent studies,</hi> or our <hi>crowd of business,</hi> will make great variety of thoughts and roving fancies obtrude themselves upon us; and this is our natural frame and constitution which we must submit to, and
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:66440:352"/>
cannot remedy. We can no more prevent it, than we can prevent our <hi>dreams,</hi> but our fancies will be struck, and diverting thoughts will be thrown into us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we will or no. For from the <hi>natural union of our souls and bodies,</hi> our <hi>minds,</hi> in their most <hi>spiritual</hi> ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of <hi>thinking</hi> and <hi>understanding,</hi> go along with our <hi>bodily spirits,</hi> and apprehend after their impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and we can as well refuse to <hi>see when our eyes are open,</hi> or to <hi>taste what is put into our mouths,</hi> as we can refuse to have a <hi>thought of those things which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed upon our bodily fancy or imagination.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion betwixt these is necessary and natural; and there is no breaking or avoiding it. So that let us be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at our prayers, or at any other exercise, if any temper of our bodies, any accidental motion of our blood, any former impressions of foregoing studies or other business stir in our fancies; our thoughts must needs be diverted, and our attention disturbed by them. Nay in our prayers we are more apt to find it thus, than in any other thing. For there men oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times use <hi>violence,</hi> and screw up the fixedness of their minds, and the fervency of their hearts to the highest pitch: and then their bodily spirits, being overstrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are liable, not only to be discomposed by outward accidents, but also to give back and fall of themselves; and when in this manner they withdraw, there is room made, till they can be again recollected, for other thoughts to arise instead of them. All this, I say, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens from the very nature and frame of our bodies, and from that dependance which our minds and thoughts themselves have upon them; so that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prevent or overcome it wholly. We may, and ought indeed to strive against these distractions as much as we can, and to compose our thoughts as much as our natural temper, or our present circumstances will suffer
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:66440:352"/>
us: when they wander in our prayers, as soon as we discern it we may recollect them; and when other thoughts intrude, as soon as they are observed we may reject them: but then this is all that we can do, or that God requires we should do; for we cannot pray perfectly and continuedly without them.</p>
               <p>And then as for the <hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>fervency of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> whether in our prayers or in any thing else, they are <hi>fickle</hi> and <hi>very changeable,</hi> and do not depend so much upon the <hi>choice of our wills,</hi> as upon the <hi>temper of our bodies.</hi> Some upon every occasion are more <hi>warm</hi> and <hi>eager in their passions,</hi> either of <hi>love</hi> or <hi>hatred, hopes</hi> or <hi>fears, joy</hi> or <hi>sorrow,</hi> than other men either are, or can be. For there is a difference in <hi>tempers,</hi> as well as in <hi>palates</hi>; and mens <hi>passions</hi> do no more issue out upon the same things, in the same eagerness; than their <hi>stomachs</hi> do after the same food with the same degrees of appetite. So that as for a <hi>great fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency</hi> and a <hi>vehement affection</hi>; every man cannot work himself up to it, because all tempers do not admit of it. For <hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>affectionateness in Devotion,</hi> as in other things, is more a mans <hi>temper</hi> than his <hi>choice</hi>; and therefore it is not to be expected that all people should be able to raise themselves up to a transporting pitch in it; but only that they should, who are born to it.</p>
               <p>Nay even they whose <hi>natural temper</hi> fits them for a <hi>great fervency</hi> and a <hi>high affection,</hi> are not able to work themselves up to it at <hi>all times.</hi> For no mans temper is <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>unchangeable</hi>; seeing our very bodies are subject to a thousand alterations either from <hi>things within,</hi> or from others that are <hi>without us.</hi> If a mans <hi>blood</hi> is put into an <hi>irregular ferment</hi> either by a <hi>cold air,</hi> or an <hi>inward distemper,</hi> or any <hi>discomposing accident</hi>; it spoils, not only the fixedness of his thoughts, but the zeal of his affections likewise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let there be any
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:66440:353"/>
damp or disorder, any dulness or indisposition, either upon a mans blood or spirits; and the discomposure of his body is presently felt in his soul, for his thoughts flag, and his passions run low, and all his powers are under a cloud, and suffer an abatement. And this every man finds in himself, when he labours under a <hi>sickly</hi> and <hi>crazy temper,</hi> an <hi>aking head,</hi> or any other <hi>bodily indisposition.</hi> For our passions are bodily powers, and are performed altogether by bodily instruments; they live and dye with them, and are subject to all their coolings and abatements, their changes and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. And therefore as long as our bodily tempers and dispositions alter, and, by reason of a number of accidents, whether from without or from within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, are still changeable and unconstant; the zeal and fervency of our affections must needs be so too.</p>
               <p>Thus is some distraction of mind and chilness of affection, either in our prayers, or in pursuit of any other thing, most necessarily incident to all men. We cannot wholly prevent them, or live altogether free from them; but sometimes they will break in, and seize upon us do what we can.</p>
               <p>And since we cannot help them, God will not be always angry, or eternally torment us for them. No, he knows that we are <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> and his love and favour to us doth not alter as our unsetled thoughts, or bodily tempers do. He measures us not by the <hi>fixedness of our thoughts,</hi> or by the <hi>fervency of our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> which are not always in our own power; but by our <hi>wills</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> which are. So that if we are careful to will and chuse what is pleasing to him, and from our hearts entirely to obey him; we need not doubt but that whatever <hi>involuntary</hi> distractions there may be sometimes in our thoughts, or abatements in our bodily tempers whilst we are at our prayers; we shall still be accepted by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="671" facs="tcp:66440:353"/>We shall be accepted, I say, and the blessings which we sue for obtained, although sometimes our prayers are less attent, and less affectionate, than at other times they are, and we at all times greatly desire they might be. For our <hi>fixedness</hi> and <hi>fervency</hi> are not the only things which procure acceptance for our prayers. They are <hi>great good things,</hi> as I said, and such qualifications as make our requests fit, both <hi>for us to offer,</hi> and <hi>for God to hear</hi>; and therefore we must take care still when we pray, in such measure as we are able, to be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with them. But although they are some, yet are they not the only qualifications of our prayers which prevail with God, and move him to hear them. For our <hi>trust</hi> and <hi>dependance,</hi> our <hi>submission</hi> and <hi>resigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and other <hi>spiritual vertues</hi> and instances of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, are likewise dispositions which God respects in them; nay indeed which he prizes above all, and principally looks at. So that if we pray with these, God is honoured by our prayers, and he will reward them; and our petitions shall not be put up in vain, although, by reason of some bodily dulness or distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the fixt attention of our minds, and the fervency of our hearts, which we endeavour after always, and enjoy at other times, should happen to be wanting.</p>
               <p>Yea I add further, so long as our <hi>hearts are honest,</hi> and our <hi>lives entirely obedient,</hi> we are <hi>always</hi> furnished with those qualifications which are sufficient to bring down Gods Grace and Blessing upon us, and which are the principal things that make our prayers themselves an acceptable Offering. A good man is drawing down the blessings of Heaven upon himself all his life long, and not only whilst he is upon his knees: so that if at any time his prayers are less perfect, and chance to falter; that defect will be otherwise supplied, and he will have all that mercy conveyed to him through
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:66440:354"/>
another means, which his prayers should have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him; seeing that which makes his prayers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Gods love and mercy for him, will make his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience procure the very same.</p>
               <p>For I suppose no man is so silly as to imagine that it is the <hi>lifting up of his eyes and hands,</hi> the <hi>composedness of his countenance,</hi> the <hi>quaintness of his phrase,</hi> the <hi>elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his expressions,</hi> the <hi>volubility of his language,</hi> or any other <hi>external thing</hi> which makes his prayers so powerful, and brings down the blessing of God upon them. But it is that <hi>dependance upon God,</hi> that <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God,</hi> that <hi>love of God</hi> and <hi>desire of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> that <hi>acknowledgment of his tenderness and power,</hi> that <hi>submission to his Authority,</hi> and <hi>resignation to his pleasure,</hi> which are all <hi>implied in prayer,</hi> and <hi>fitly expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by it,</hi> and which make up the very <hi>life</hi> and <hi>spirit</hi> of it: these, I say, it is which God looks at in our prayers, and for the sake whereof he so graciously ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and rewards them. But now as for all <hi>these,</hi> they are expressed every whit as much by the <hi>obedience of our lives,</hi> as by the <hi>prayer of our lips</hi>; nay indeed <hi>much more</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in as much as our <hi>actions</hi> are a more perfect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression and certain evidence of all these tempers of a good heart, than our <hi>words</hi> are. They differ as much as <hi>words</hi> and <hi>deeds,</hi> as <hi>profession</hi> and <hi>performance</hi>; for whereas in our prayers we only speak and profess all this, in the obedience of our lives we work and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it. We shew our <hi>love</hi> and <hi>resignation to God,</hi> when <hi>for his sake we deny our selves,</hi> and <hi>give up our own will in obedience to his.</hi> We <hi>acknowledge his Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> most effectually, when we <hi>obey it</hi>; and <hi>owne his Providence</hi> to the best purpose, when we <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly acquiesce in it,</hi> and <hi>patiently submit to it</hi>; and <hi>confess his love</hi> and <hi>kindness</hi> after the most acceptable sort, when we <hi>throw our selves upon it,</hi> and <hi>work and
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:66440:354"/>
endeavour all our lives long in hopes and expectations of it.</hi> In our daily <hi>actions</hi> of <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> of <hi>Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> and <hi>Sobriety,</hi> of <hi>Meekness, Patience, Mercy</hi> and <hi>Forgiveness,</hi> and in all other instances of obedience, we <hi>give God the honour to chuse for us,</hi> to <hi>dispose of us,</hi> to <hi>be sought after and intrusted by us.</hi> We evidence our <hi>esteem of him,</hi> our <hi>love for him,</hi> our <hi>trust in him,</hi> our <hi>dependance on him,</hi> our <hi>resignation to him</hi>; and that most effectually. So that whatsoever can move God in our <hi>prayers,</hi> will move him in a higher degree, and after another fashion in our <hi>obedience</hi>; the Spirit of goodness which is evidenced in our prayers, being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced much more in the course of good actions. No Rhetorick therefore of our Prayers is like to that of a good life, every action of obedience in a good man having the effect of a prayer, and calling down upon him the same mercy and the same Grace, which would be procured by a supplication.</p>
               <p>Let a man therefore make sure in the first place of a <hi>good life,</hi> and of an <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>intire obedience</hi>; and then he need not fear to want those things which all good men have need to pray for, seeing he will shew so much daily in his life as will make his requests be granted, and his prayers be hearkened to. He cannot perish for want of those mercies which he prays for, although it be sometimes with coldness and distraction; because not only <hi>the other obedient tempers of his prayers,</hi> when through some unchosen hindrances a due fixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and fervency are wanting, but also the <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>uninterrupted obedience of his life</hi> is daily ascending up, and brings them down upon him.</p>
               <p>Let no good soul therefore be further troubled and disquieted upon this account, as if, because after all his care his prayers are sometimes dull and cold, and his thoughts therein are much distracted, he should either
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:66440:355"/>
be <hi>eternally punished</hi> for them, or at least <hi>go without those blessings</hi> which he desires in them. For so long as the <hi>Spirit of obedience</hi> appears both in his Prayers and in his actions, the <hi>unwilled distractions of his mind,</hi> and the <hi>dulness</hi> and <hi>frozenness of his affections</hi> at some times, shall be no hindrance either to his <hi>Suit</hi> at present, or to his <hi>happiness</hi> hereafter: his request shall not be thrown by, nor he condemned for them; but, so far as God sees it fitting for him, it shall be granted, and he shall eternally be saved notwithstanding them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A <hi>third</hi> scruple which is wont causelesly to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet and trouble <hi>good</hi> and <hi>honest minds,</hi> is the words of our Saviour <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. <hi>I say unto you, That</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>every idle word which men shall speak, they shall give an account thereof at the Day of Judgment,</hi> ver. 36.</p>

               <p>This is a great snare, and to avoid it men run into a great errour. For they are led to place a <hi>great Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in <hi>holy talk,</hi> and <hi>religious forms of expression,</hi> which they prize so far as to think <hi>their conversation is unhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed without it.</hi> And if at any time their seriousness was thrown aside, and their Discourse, though <hi>innocent,</hi> was <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>useless,</hi> they are greatly troubled and afraid,
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:66440:355"/>
and think they are fallen within the limits of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And this has a very ill effect, for it frights men from all the <hi>innocent freedom of converse,</hi> and the <hi>cheerful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments of company.</hi> It makes them to appear <hi>staid</hi> and <hi>reserved, silent</hi> and <hi>morose</hi>; to contribute nothing to the harmless mirth and cheerfulness of conversation themselves, and to frown upon it in others. For all converse and society is managed by the <hi>tongue,</hi> and the ordinary entertainment of company is <hi>talking</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi>; but where men think every idle and useless word so dangerous a sin, they are afraid to speak. So that all that comes from them is <hi>studied</hi> and <hi>deliberate, grave</hi> and <hi>composed</hi>; they neither dare use any freedom themselves, nor can without offence allow it to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by others.</p>
               <p>But this is so far from being <hi>injoined by Christ,</hi> that it is <hi>discountenanced by nature</hi>; it is so far from being a piece of <hi>Religion</hi> and a <hi>holy Duty,</hi> that 'tis rather a piece of <hi>immorality</hi> and <hi>ill manners.</hi> For <hi>Aristotle</hi> and other <hi>Philosophers</hi> of old, have long ago made <hi>urbanity,</hi> or an <hi>innocent freedom and fac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

us. For his coming into the world was after another way, in a <hi>free use of the innocent allowances, and liberties of mankind. The Son of man,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  <hi>lovely</hi> or grateful to men, <hi>think on these things,</hi> Phil. 4.8. <hi>Love</hi> is the <hi>Epitome of our whole Duty,</hi> and all the <hi>sweetners</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments of society</hi> that can be, so long as they are <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>honest,</hi> are not only <hi>consistent</hi> with it, but <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>expressions</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>grave entertainments of discourse</hi> and <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious conference</hi>; they, without doubt, have a <hi>great use,</hi> and in their place may deserve a great commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. For <hi>good Christians may be much better'd and improved,</hi> by having their <hi>Graces awakned,</hi> their <hi>pious affections inflamed,</hi> their <hi>holy purposes fixt and setled,</hi> their <hi>endeavours directed and encouraged,</hi> and <hi>every thing that is good in them quickned and confirmed by them.</hi> But then 'tis to be considered that even good things themselves must be taken in their <hi>own season,</hi> and must not be suffered to ingross all our time, a great part whereof is to be spent upon other things. For we have not only one thing to do, but at several times sundry things call for us. <hi>There is a time,</hi> says <hi>Solomon, to every thing, and a season to every purpose under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: there is a time to weep, and a time to laugh, a time to mourn, and a time to dance,</hi> Eccles. 3.1, 4. There is a time for diversion, as well as a time for business;
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:66440:356"/>
a time wherein to have a more liberal and free dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, as well as a time for godly and religious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
               <p>Nay the <hi>innocent delights of conversation</hi> and pleasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable entertainments of discourse, are themselves a great <hi>field of vertue,</hi> and an <hi>exercise</hi> and <hi>occasion</hi> of <hi>many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of obedience.</hi> For in them we may every one of us exercise in our <hi>own persons,</hi> and be <hi>examples unto others,</hi> of much <hi>courtesie</hi> and <hi>kindness, civility</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descension, affability</hi> and <hi>obligingness</hi> Let no man think then that his hours of common converse are lost hours, and that whatsoever time he spends upon <hi>offices of civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and <hi>freedom of company,</hi> is misplaced, and stoln from God and Religion. For we are fulfilling Gods Laws, and doing his work, whilst we keep all these Commandments in the pleasurable entertainments of common life; they are such business as he has set us, and our obedient performance of them is no less his service, than <hi>Devotion, holy Conference,</hi> and <hi>Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is no prejudice or hindrance to Religion therefore to be free and open in conversation, and pleasurable and chearful in common life; but rather an instance and expression of it. It is no part of any mans duty to be talking always in <hi>Scripture-phrase</hi> and <hi>sanctified expression,</hi> or else to be <hi>wholly silent</hi> and <hi>severely morose,</hi> and not to talk at all. For an innocent chearfulness, and freedom of discourse is not so truly the good mans sin, as the exercise of his vertue and obedience.</p>
               <p>But as for that opinion, that <hi>every idle and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent word shall be severely accounted for at the Day of Judgment,</hi> which is the great sourer of conversation, and the occasion of this conceit; it is a great mistake. For it is not every <hi>idle</hi> and <hi>unprofitable,</hi> but every <hi>false, slanderous,</hi> or otherwise <hi>sinful</hi> and <hi>unlawful word</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

                  <hi>vain,</hi> which sometimes signifies the same that <hi>false</hi> or <hi>lying.</hi> In which sense it is used in the <hi>third</hi> Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where we are bid <hi>not to take the Name of God in vain, i. e.</hi> in <hi>perjury</hi> or <hi>falshood.</hi> For that sense our Saviour gives to it in his repetition of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>It hath been said to them of old,</hi> saith he, in the <hi>third</hi> Commandment, <hi>thou shalt not forswear thy self</hi> or swear falsly, v. 33.</p>
               <p>But if nothing more than <hi>useless</hi> and <hi>unprofitable</hi> were noted by the <hi>word it self</hi> which we translate <hi>idle</hi>; yet is it no unusual thing in the Scriptures by several words <hi>to mean and intend more, than in their literal sense they do express.</hi> Thus are the <hi>abominable works of darkness</hi> mentioned <hi>Eph.</hi> 5, called <note n="f" place="margin">

                  <hi>unfruitful works</hi>; where the meaning surely is, not only that they bring in no profit or advantage, but also that they are most deadly and mischievous, v. 11: and the <hi>wicked servant</hi> spoken of <hi>Mat.</hi> 25, is called the <note n="g" place="margin">

                  <hi>idle</hi> or <hi>unprofitable words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so they are in this place. For the idle words whereof our Saviour speaks v. 36; are such words as are not only <hi>idle</hi> and <hi>unprofitable,</hi> but positively <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>evil</hi>; being indeed <hi>false, slanderous,</hi> and <hi>reviling</hi> words; as will appear from the consideration of these particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="679" facs="tcp:66440:357"/>For the words which are threatned in that 36. ver. are such as are a sign, not of a <hi>trifling,</hi> but of an <hi>evil heart. How can ye,</hi> says he, <hi>being evil, speak good things; for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</hi> So that <hi>as a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth,</hi> or speaketh <hi>good things; an evil man likewise, out of the evil treasure of his heart, bringeth forth evil things,</hi> v. 34, 35.</p>
               <p>And being the fruits of an evil heart, they are the signs, not of an <hi>impertinent,</hi> but of an <hi>evil man. The tree is corrupt,</hi> says he, <hi>if the fruit be corrupt; for the tree is known by its fruits,</hi> v. 33.</p>
               <p>And since they are such words as are thus <hi>sinful in themselves,</hi> and an argument of so <hi>much sin in us</hi>; they shall in the last Judgment be charged upon us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us. <hi>For by thy words,</hi> says he, as well as actions, <hi>thou shalt be justified, and by thy words,</hi> if they be such idle words as I mean, <hi>thou shalt be condemned,</hi> v. 37.</p>
               <p>The words then which are spoken of in this place from the 33. to the 38. ver. are such as are a <hi>sign of a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heart,</hi> as <hi>make a wicked man,</hi> and <hi>render us in the last Judgment liable to condemnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now words of this black dye and of these mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous effects, are not every <hi>idle</hi> and <hi>impertinent</hi>; but <hi>false, slanderous, railing,</hi> or otherwise <hi>sinful</hi> and <hi>forbidden words.</hi> But <hi>false</hi> and <hi>slanderous</hi> words are especially struck at in this place, such as were those <hi>lying</hi> and <hi>contumelious</hi> ones that occasioned all this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, when the <hi>Jews most reproachfully charged his Miracles upon the Devil,</hi> telling him that <hi>he cast out Devils through Beelzebub the Prince of the Devils,</hi> v. 24. Upon occasion of which black calumny, he proceeds in all the following verses to warn them against such <hi>blasphemous speeches</hi>; demonstrating clearly the <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness of them,</hi> v. 25, to 31; the <hi>sinfulness of them,</hi>
                  <pb n="680" facs="tcp:66440:358"/>
ver. 33, 34, 35; and the <hi>mischievous effects</hi> of them in the <hi>two</hi> next verses. Such reproachful words as these let me tell you, says he, you shall be called to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for, as well as for your works and actions. <hi>I say unto you,</hi> and you may believe me, for you will find it true, that <hi>every idle,</hi> or slanderous and reproachful <hi>word,</hi> such as now you have spoken against me, <hi>that men shall speak, they shall give an account thereof in the day of judgment. For</hi> when that day comes, think you of it as you please now, mens words as well as their actions shall be called to an account: <hi>by thy words thou shalt be justified, and,</hi> if they have been such as yours now are, <hi>by thy words thou shalt be condemned,</hi> ver. 36, 37.</p>
               <p>And thus by all this it appears, that the <hi>idle word</hi> here threatned by our Lord, is not every word that is <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>useless,</hi> but only such as are <hi>railing, false,</hi> or <hi>slanderous.</hi> And in this sense some Manuscripts read the place. For in the Book of <hi>Steph.</hi> it is not <hi>every idle,</hi> but <hi>every</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>So that as for this third scruple, it is as groundless as was the former; no good man need to be disquieted by it, since they shall never be condemned for it.</p>

                     </gap> in Scripture by the Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost or Spirit is taken for the gifts or effects of it; whether they be first ordinary, either in our minds and understandings, or in our wills and tempers; or secondly, extraordinary and miraculous. Extraordinary gifts of all sorts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from one and the same Spirit or Holy Ghost; upon which account any of them indifferently are sometimes called Spirit, sometimes Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost and Spirit are frequently distinguished, and then by Holy Ghost is meant extraordinary gifts respecting the understanding; by Spirit extraordinary gifts respecting the executive powers. The summ of this Explication of the Holy Ghost. What sin against it is unpardonable. To sin against the Holy Ghost is to dishonour him. This is done in every act of sin, but these are not unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. What the unpardonable sin is. Of sin against the ordinary endowments of the Holy Ghost, whether of mind or will; the several degrees in this, all of them are pardonable. Of sin against the Spirit. Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of this comes very near it, and was the sin of the Pharisees, <hi>Mat. 12;</hi> but it was pardonable. Of sinning against the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost the last means of reducing men to believe the Gospel, that Covenant of Repentance. The sin against it is unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable,
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:66440:359"/>
because such sinners are irreclamable. All dishonour of this is not unpardonable; for <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> dishonoured it in actions, who was yet capable of pardon; but only a blaspheming of it in words. No man is guilty of it whilst he continues Christian.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ANother causless ground of fear, which disquiets the minds, and affrights the hearts of good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian people, is the <hi>sin against the Holy Ghost.</hi> They hear very dreadful things spoken of it, for our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> who knew it best, and who at the last Day is to judge of it, has told us plainly before-hand, that <hi>he who blasphemeth the Holy Ghost shall never be forgiven, neither in this world, nor in the world to come,</hi> Mat. 12.32; or, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Mark</hi> expresses it, <hi>he shall never have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness, but is liable to eternal damnation,</hi> Mark 3.29. This is a fearful Sentence upon a desperate sin; and seeing they are in darkness about it, and do not well understand it, they know not but that they themselves <hi>may</hi> be guilty of it; nay some of a <hi>timorous temper</hi> and <hi>abused minds</hi> go further, and think that they really <hi>are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to cure their fears, and to quiet their minds in this matter, there needs nothing more be done than to give them right apprehensions, and a clear explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this sin; for if they once knew what it is, they would be at ease from such tormenting suspicions, and unreasonable fears about it.</p>

                  <hi>hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us, because he hath given us</hi> that loving tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>of his Spirit,</hi> ver. 12, 13. The <hi>temper</hi> which was so observable in <hi>Christ</hi> is called <hi>the Spirit of Christ,</hi> Rom. 8.9; the <hi>temper of Elias</hi> is called <hi>the spirit of Elias,</hi> Luke 1.17; the <hi>Spirit of the Lord</hi> is explained by the <hi>Spirit of the fear of the Lord,</hi> Isai. 11.2; and that <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which God hath given us,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, is not the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of fear, but the spirit of power, of love, and of a sound mind,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7.</p>
               <p>Thus doth the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> signifie many times in Scripture those <hi>ordinary gifts and Graces, which are the good effects of the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But besides these effects of it in the good endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

and perfections of our natural faculties, whether of mind or temper, which are <hi>common</hi> and <hi>ordinary</hi>; sometimes it signifies more especially those gifts which are <hi>extraordinary</hi> and <hi>miraculous.</hi> Of which sort are the <hi>gift of tongues,</hi> of <hi>prophecy,</hi> of <hi>healing Diseases with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any natural means,</hi> and performing other <hi>miraculous operations,</hi> so famous in the first times of the Gospel. Thus, for example, that Saying, <hi>I will pour out in those days of my Spirit,</hi> is interpreted by this in the next words, <hi>And they shall prophesie,</hi> Acts 2.18. And the <hi>elder Brothers,</hi> which was a <hi>double</hi> share of the <hi>prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick power of Elias,</hi> is called a <hi>double portion of his Spirit,</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 2.9. And the Corinthians <hi>zealous pursuit</hi> of the miraculous and extraordinary gifts of <hi>prophecy, speaking with tongues, healing diseases,</hi> and <hi>working mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi>; is called by the Apostle their being <note n="b" place="margin">

                  <hi>Luke, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to speak as the Spirit gave them utterance,</hi> Acts 2.4.

Saint <hi>Paul, bearing the Apostles witness, with signs, and wonders, and divers miracles, and</hi> other <hi>gifts of the Holy Ghost,</hi> ver. 4.

               <p>Thus, I say, by reason that all these <hi>extraordinary gifts,</hi> whether relating to our <hi>minds</hi> in <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>speaking with tongues,</hi> or to our <hi>executive powers,</hi> in <hi>healing diseases,</hi> and <hi>working miracles,</hi> proceed all from the self same <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> or <hi>Holy Spirit</hi>; the gifts of either sort are called indifferently by either name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sometimes called the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and sometimes the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But although, as I say for this reason the words <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> are sometimes used <hi>promiscuously</hi> to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>all</hi> or <hi>any</hi> of these extraordinary gifts <hi>indifferently</hi>; yet, what is very material to our purpose, sometimes, nay very frequently, they are <note n="d" place="margin">See the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                  <hi>distinguished.</hi> And then by the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is meant not <hi>all extraordinary gifts indifferently,</hi> but particularly those which respect our <hi>understandings,</hi> not <hi>executive powers,</hi> consisting ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>illumination,</hi> than in <hi>power</hi> and <hi>action</hi>; of which sort are the <hi>gift of tongues,</hi> of <hi>prophecy,</hi> of <hi>discerning Spirits,</hi> of <hi>knowledg,</hi> of <hi>revelation,</hi> and such like. Thus the lying against <hi>that part</hi> of the <hi>gift of discerning Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> which consisted in understanding the <hi>thoughts and purposes of the heart,</hi> is called <hi>lying to the Holy Ghost.</hi> For so S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> who was endowed with this gift, tells <hi>Ananias,</hi> when he would have imposed upon him; <hi>Why hath Satan filled thine heart,</hi> saith he, <hi>to lye to the Holy Ghost?</hi> Acts 5.3. And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

<pb n="687" facs="tcp:66440:361"/>
with the Holy Ghost,</hi> Acts 7.55. But more especially the <hi>gift of Tongues</hi> and <hi>Prophecy</hi> is dignified with that name. Thus in the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> when the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s house begun to <hi>speak with Tongues</hi> upon S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peters</hi> preaching; it is said, that <hi>the Holy Ghost fell on all them that heard the word,</hi> and that <hi>on the Gentiles was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost,</hi> v. 44, 45, 46. The Disciples at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> who being baptized with the <hi>Baptism of John,</hi> cannot be supposed ignorant of the many miraculous Cures so much talked of among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and of the strange effects of the Spirit in Jesus whom <hi>John</hi> preached; did yet tell <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>they had not so much as heard of the Holy Ghost,</hi> Act. 19.2; which might very well be, because the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> or <hi>gift of Tongues</hi> and <hi>Prophecy,</hi> were <hi>not given till after Jesus was glorified,</hi> Joh. 7.39. But upon the preaching of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> they were made partakers of it, for <hi>when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came upon them, and they spake with tongues, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied,</hi> Act. 19.6. And to name no more instances in this matter, that place which I now hinted in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John,</hi> is a full proof of this restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed acceptation. For there after all the instances of <hi>curing diseases, casting out Devils,</hi> and other effects of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in miraculous operations, which Christ shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wheresoever he came; it is yet expresly affirmed, that <hi>the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified</hi> by his Exaltation to the right hand of God, v. 39. The <hi>Holy Ghost, i. e.</hi> these <hi>gifts of Tongues,</hi> of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and the like, which are all that remained still to be shed abroad, and which came upon the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> at the descent of the Holy Ghost at <hi>Pentecost,</hi> Act. 2.</p>
               <p>Thus is the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> set to denote, not all the miraculous and extraordinary gifts of the Spirit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously,
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:66440:362"/>
but particularly those which respect the <hi>mind</hi> or <hi>understanding</hi>; such as the gift of <hi>Tongues,</hi> of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> of <hi>deep Knowledge,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>And on the other side as for the word <hi>Spirit,</hi> it is set to express, not <hi>all extraordinary gifts</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> of the <hi>Spirit in general,</hi> but those by name which <hi>respect our executive, not knowing powers,</hi> and which consist, not in <hi>illumination,</hi> but in <hi>action.</hi> Of which sort are the <hi>gift of healing diseases,</hi> of <hi>casting out Devils,</hi> of <hi>rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the dead,</hi> and other <hi>miraculous operations.</hi> Thus the <hi>miraculous courage</hi> and <hi>valour</hi> which was given to <hi>Othoniel,</hi> is called the <hi>Spirit of the Lord,</hi> Judg. 3.10; as is that likewise which was given to <hi>Gideon,</hi> Judg. 6.34; and the <hi>miraculous strength of Samson</hi> is called the <hi>Spirit of the Lord upon Samson,</hi> Judg. 14.6. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christs working the <hi>miraculous cure</hi> upon the <hi>man with the withered hand,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Matthew</hi> applies to him that saying of the Prophet, <hi>the Spirit of the Lord came upon him,</hi> Mat. 12.18; and his <hi>casting out Devils</hi> he himself attributes to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, <hi>I,</hi> says he, <hi>by the spirit of God cast out devils,</hi> v. 28.</p>
               <p>As by the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> therefore are meant particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the gifts of <hi>illumination</hi> in <hi>Tongues</hi> and <hi>Prophecy</hi>; so by the <hi>Spirit</hi> are signified the <hi>gifts of Power</hi> in <hi>healing diseases, casting out Devils,</hi> and <hi>doing mighty and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And both these together take up the full compass of the <hi>extraordinary gifts of the Spirit,</hi> and are both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly expressed by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> when he says, that <hi>Jesus was anointed with the holy Ghost, and with Power,</hi> Act. 10.38.</p>
               <p>These then are the several meanings of the words, <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and <hi>holy Spirit.</hi> They denote, as the <hi>third Person in the Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghost himself</hi>; so also those <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> which proceed from him. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:66440:362"/>
those gifts are <hi>ordinary,</hi> either in the <hi>endowments of our minds,</hi> or the <hi>vertuous tempers</hi> and <hi>dispositions of our wills and hearts</hi>; or <hi>extraordinary</hi> and <hi>miraculous.</hi> Wherein yet we must observe this difference, that the gifts of the <hi>executive powers</hi> in <hi>healing diseases, casting out Devils, working Miracles,</hi> are by a peculiar name called the <hi>Spirit</hi>; and the gifts of the <hi>knowing</hi> or <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding Faculties,</hi> in <hi>Prophecies, Revelations, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with divers sorts of Tongues,</hi> are by a contradistinct name called the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus having shewn what is meant by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> I proceed now to show,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What is meant by sinning against it</hi>; and <hi>which of all those which are committed against it, is the unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The only way whereby any men are capable to sin against God, as was observed, is by <hi>affront</hi> and <hi>disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>; for God is out of our reach for any other sort of injury, and we cannot otherwise hurt him, than by shewing our contempt and disrepect of him.</p>
               <p>And in regard the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> in his own person is <hi>very and essential God,</hi> this must needs be the only way whereby we can sin against him likewise. We cannot injure him in his <hi>Nature,</hi> but only in his <hi>Honour</hi>; but then we sin against him, when we <hi>walk cross to him,</hi> and <hi>oppose him,</hi> or any way <hi>slight</hi> and <hi>contemn, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value</hi> or <hi>reproach</hi> him, or any of those excellent and Divine gifts which proceed from him.</p>
               <p>Now this we do more or less in <hi>every sin.</hi> For this <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of God is an <hi>universal instrument of faith and good life</hi>; it has taken the utmost care by <hi>miracles,</hi> and other its <hi>convictive evidences to evince the truth</hi> of Christs Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and doth now still by his <hi>daily suggestions</hi> and <hi>sollicitations</hi> excite men to the <hi>observance</hi> of it. And seeing the Spirit of God has shown it self so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:66440:363"/>
for our <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi>; every <hi>act</hi> of <hi>unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> and <hi>disobedience</hi> is a direct opposition to it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of it, and therefore is a sin against it.</p>
               <p>But every such sin is not the <hi>unpardonable fault</hi> here mentioned. For our very <hi>wilful sins themselves,</hi> as has been shewn, <hi>are not desperate under Christs Religion,</hi> the Gospel being a Covenant that doth not damn men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all voluntary sin, but encourages their repentance with the promise of pardon; so that although all our sins are against God and his Spirit, they are not <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missible,</hi> but will be remitted to every man who repents of them.</p>
               <p>It is not every sin against the Spirit of God then, which this place in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Matthew</hi> threatens so severely. But the <hi>unpardonable sin</hi> is a sin by it self; it has some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing peculiar in it from all other sins, which by shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us out from all possibility of repentance, excludes it from all hopes of being forgiven.</p>
               <p>And indeed it is plainly this. <hi>It is a sinning against the Holy Ghost in the last sense, as it signifies not only the power of miracles, but also the gift of tongues, and other il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminations of the Holy Ghost, which came down upon the Apostles at</hi> Pentecost; <hi>and it is such a sinning against these, as is particularly by reviling and blaspheming them.</hi> This, and none other, I take to be the sin here mentioned.</p>
               <p>For the clearer discerning whereof, we will consider the sins against the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> in all the acceptations before laid down; and in all of them, except the last, we shall find room for <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>remission.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First then, to sin against the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> as it signifies the <hi>ordinary endowments, and vertuous tempers of our minds and wills, is not the unpardonable sin</hi> that is here spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of. For every sin against any <hi>particular vertue</hi> is a sin against the Holy Ghost in that sense. Every act of <hi>drunkenness,</hi> for instance, is against the gift of <hi>sobriety</hi>;
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:66440:363"/>
and every act of <hi>uncleanness</hi> is against the gift of <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency</hi>; and so it is in the several actions of all other sorts of sin. But now as for all these, the great offer and invitation of the Gospel is, that men would accept of mercy upon repentance. The <hi>Incestuous Corinthian</hi> sinned deeply against the grace of <hi>chastity,</hi> and he <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented,</hi> and was <hi>forgiven</hi>; S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter denied his Lord</hi> and upon his repentance he was also pardoned; and the same Grace has been allowed, as we have seen, to all other wilful sinners.</p>
               <p>Nay in this sort of sinning against the <hi>Holy Ghost, viz.</hi> by <hi>sinning against those Christian gifts and graces which he works in us,</hi> there is mercy to <hi>very great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</hi> For sometimes we do not hearken to his holy motions, but fall into <hi>lesser sins</hi> and <hi>offensive indecencies,</hi> notwithstanding all his vertuous suggestions and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to the contrary: and then he is troubled and <hi>grieved</hi> at us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. And at other times we ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon <hi>more hainous crimes,</hi> which quite lay waste the conscience, and undo all the vertuous temper and resolution of our souls, so that we lie long in our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence, as <hi>David</hi> did in the matter of <hi>Vriah,</hi> and are almost hardned in our wicked way before we are able again to recover out of it: and in these offences the Spirit has been so much affronted, and his impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate suggestions so frequently thrown out, that he is almost ready to <hi>forsake us,</hi> and to <hi>leave us to our selves,</hi> so that it may be called a <hi>quenching of him,</hi> 1 Thess. 5.19. But although the last of these especially be very <hi>dangerous</hi>; yet is neither of them <hi>desperate.</hi> But after we have been guilty of them, God continues still to make offers and invitations, and by his <hi>long-sufferance,</hi> and his <hi>gracious providences,</hi> and the <hi>repeated calls of his Word and Ministers</hi>; he still endeavours to recover us to pardon, by recalling us to repentance. Yea the holy
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:66440:364"/>
Spirit it self makes fresh assaults upon us, and tries again whether we will hearken to it, and be relieved by it; as it was with <hi>David</hi> after he had complained of his being <hi>deprived of Gods presence,</hi> and of the <hi>holy Spirit's being taken from him,</hi> Psal. 51.11; and as it is with every other <hi>reclaimed back-slider.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The sinning against the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> therefore in this sense, as it signifies the <hi>ordinary gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost,</hi> is far from being the unpardonable sin, and is manifestly under the grace of pardon and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Nor is a sin against the <hi>extraordinary gifts</hi> of <hi>casting out Devils, healing diseases, working miracles,</hi> or other things called the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that <hi>unpardonable</hi> sin which is here intended. To <hi>blaspheme the Spirit,</hi> 'tis true, comes very near it, and when men are once gone on to that, God is very nigh giving of them up, and using no more means about them to bring them either to <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Repentance,</hi> which are the only way to pardon and forgiveness. But although this pitch of sin be extreme dangerous, yet in great likelihood it is not wholly desperate; for after all the dirt that men had thrown upon this evidence, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>miraculous opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wrought by Christ whilst he continued upon earth,</hi> God was still pleased to use some means further to bring them to believe; and that was the evidence of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> which came down to compleat all after that <hi>Jesus</hi> was <hi>glorified,</hi> Act. 2. This great proof, which was to be poured out upon the Disciples at <hi>Pentecost,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other Christians at the Imposition of their hands for a good while after, might effect that wherein the other had failed, and be acknowledged by those very men who had blasphemed the former. So that their case, notwithstanding it were gone extreme far, was not for all that quite hopeless, because one remedy still remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:66440:364"/>
which God resolved he would use to reclaim them, though after that he would try no more. The blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming of the Spirit then was very near the unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, because unamendable, sin, but yet it was not fully grown up to it; it was in the next degree to unpardonable, but yet, if it went no further, it might be pardoned still.</p>
               <p>And of this I think we have a clear proof, even in those <hi>blasphemous Pharisees,</hi> whose <hi>reviling of the Spirit</hi> was the occasion of all this discourse. For as for the <hi>Spirit,</hi> they blasphemed it in this very Chapter, when upon occasion of the <hi>miraculous cure of the man with the withered hand,</hi> v. 13; and of <hi>Christs casting out of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> v. 28; both which were so manifestly wrought before their eyes, that none of them durst question, or deny the working of them; they go blasphemously to charge these evident effects of the <hi>Spirit</hi> upon the power of <hi>Magick,</hi> and to say that these works of <hi>God</hi> were performed by the <hi>Devil.</hi> For when these mighty effects of the Spirit were urged to them in behalf of <hi>Jesus, they answered and said,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Matthew, this Fellow doth not cast out Devils, but by Beelzebub the Prince of the Devils,</hi> v. 24. Here is a reproach to these miraculous gifts of the Spirit, as great as can be invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for it is nothing less than an attributing them to the most foul and loathsom Fiends in Nature, even to the very Devils themselves. But yet this Blasphemy, as dangerous as it was, is not utterly unpardonable and hopeless. For our Lord himself in this very <hi>Chapter</hi> encourages their hopes, by giving them a promise that some further means should still be used to cure their Infidelity, after that they had blasphemed this; telling these very men, that the <hi>sign of his Death and Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> with the other evidences of the Holy Ghost which were to ensue upon it, should be a further ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:66440:365"/>
to satisfie them in what they inquired after, <hi>viz. his being the Messiah, or the Son of God.</hi> For <hi>when certain of the Pharisees,</hi> presently upon his finishing this Discourse of their Blaspheming of the Holy Spirit, <hi>v.</hi> 37, <hi>made Answer to him saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee</hi> to confirm to us the truth of that pretension: <hi>he answered,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Matthew</hi> goes on, <hi>an evil and an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterous Generation seeketh a sign, and there shall no</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>sign be given it, but</hi> only <hi>the sign of the Prophet Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> and that indeed shall. <hi>For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the Whales Belly,</hi> and was afterwards deliver'd out of it to go and preach to the Ninevites: <hi>so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth,</hi> and after that rise again to preach by his Apostles to you and all the world, sending to you, for a further evidence still, the Holy Ghost, <hi>v.</hi> 38, 39, 40.</p>
               <p>So that as for this <hi>blasphemy of the spirit,</hi> wherewith the Pharisees reviled it, it was not utterly unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but was still within the possibility of pardon. For after they had committed it, Christ promised them a further Argument in his Resurrection after the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Jonas,</hi> which should be a new sign added to all that they had already seen, to gain them over to faith or belief, and thereby to pardon and forgiveness; every sin being pardonable to him that believeth.</p>
               <p>And this pardonableness of <hi>blaspheming of the spirit,</hi> our Lord further intimates in that very place, by a wary change of the phrase when he comes to speak of the unpardonableness of it; calling the unpardonable blasphemy, not a <hi>blasphemy against the spirit,</hi> (although it was the spirit which was indeed blasphemed <hi>v.</hi> 24; and whereof he had just made mention, <hi>v.</hi> 28;) but a <hi>blasphemy against the Holy Ghost,</hi> which being, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John</hi> says, <note n="*" place="margin">John 7.39.</note> 
                  <hi>not yet given,</hi> could not yet be blasphemed, <hi>v.</hi> 31, 32.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="695" facs="tcp:66440:365"/>But</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The desperate and unpardonable sin here mentioned, which shall <hi>never be forgiven, neither in this world, nor in that which is to come,</hi> is a sin against the <hi>last</hi> and <hi>greatest evidence</hi> of all, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>gift of tongues,</hi> of <hi>prophecy,</hi> and of other things called the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> In all the other evidence that came before to win men to a belief of Christ's Religion, which is the only means of pardon to the World; God had still a reserve, and resolved upon some further course if they proved inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual. If the <hi>testimony of John Baptist to Christ's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lamb of God,</hi> if the <hi>message of an Angel at his conception,</hi> the <hi>Star at his birth,</hi> and the <hi>Quire of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels at his entrance into the World</hi>; if the <hi>innocency of his life,</hi> the <hi>wisdom of his words,</hi> and the <hi>mightiness of his wonders</hi> in <hi>commanding the winds and seas,</hi> in <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring diseases,</hi> in <hi>casting out Devils,</hi> in <hi>restoring the weak to strength,</hi> and the <hi>dead to life</hi>; if all these prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>successful, and unable to perswade an <hi>Infidel,</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Generation</hi>: yet still God resolves to try one means more, which before that time the World never saw nor heard of, and that is the <hi>ample and most full effusion of the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles at Pentecost, and upon others at the imposition of their hands for a long time after.</hi> This further evidence shall still be given to subdue the stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornness of mens unbelief, which had proved too hard for all the former. When I am departed from you, says our Saviour to his Apostles, <hi>I will send</hi> the Holy Ghost, who is <hi>the Comforter</hi> or <note n="d" place="margin">

<pb n="696" facs="tcp:66440:366"/>
saying I am the <hi>Messiah, because</hi> he shall shew that <hi>I</hi> am owned above, and <hi>am gone to my Father,</hi> whence I have sent him down so plentifully upon you, <hi>John</hi> 16.8, 9, 10. But when once God had given this proof, he had done all that he designed: for this is the last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy which he had decreed to make use of to cure the infidelity of an unbelieving Age. So that if men shall use it, as they have done all that went before; and if instead of being perswaded by it, they shall proceed not only to <hi>sleight</hi> and <hi>despise,</hi> but, what is more, to <hi>revile</hi> and <hi>blaspheme</hi> it, as they have already done with the Spirit; then is the irreversible Decree gone out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, and God is unalterably resolved to strive no more with them, but to let them dye in their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. If they should be won by it indeed, and believe upon it; be their former offences what they will, no less than a blaspheming of the Spirit, yet may they justly expect to be pardoned. For the offer of Grace is universal, <hi>Whosoever believes and is baptized shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> Mark 16.16: and <hi>nothing is impossible to him that believeth,</hi> Mark 9.23. But when once men have gone so far as to be guilty of it, their sin is unpardonable, because their Faith is impossible. For they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected all the evidence which any man can urge for their conviction: seeing they have despised all that which God has offered. Their infidelity is stronger than can be cured, by any Argument that Christ either has, or will afford to prevail over it; so that they must dye in their sin, and there is no hope for them.</p>
               <p>Indeed if God so please, there is no question but that after they have once blasphemed it, he <hi>can</hi> still so melt and soften, fashion and prepare their minds, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they shall hearken to the incomparable evidence of the Spirit and the Holy Ghost, which to any honest mind are irresistible. But this sin is of so provoking a
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:66440:366"/>
nature, that when once they are guilty of it he <hi>will</hi> not. He has past an irreversible Decree upon them, never more to meddle with them; so that they never will be pardoned, because, as things stand, they never will be reclaimed. Which is the very reason which the Apostle himself gives of the desperate state of <hi>Apostate</hi> Christians. For by renouncing of that faith, which, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the evidence both of the spirit, and the Holy Ghost, they had been before convinced of; <hi>they despite,</hi> says he, <hi>the Spirit of Grace,</hi> as it implies both the Spirit and the Holy Ghost too, so that as for them, <hi>it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to renew them again unto repentance</hi>; that being such a sin as God will never give repentance to, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6.</p>
               <p>The sinning against the Holy Ghost in this sence then, as it denotes the <hi>gift of tongues,</hi> of <hi>prophecy,</hi> &amp;c. which is the last evidence that God is resolved to make use of for the conversion of an unbelieving World, is that unpardonable sin which shall never be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>And yet even here in this limited and contracted sence of the word <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> we must still proceed with some caution. For it is not every <hi>affront</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour</hi> that is put upon these gifts, which is the sin here styled irremissible. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> cast a very high in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity and reproach upon them in his <hi>actions:</hi> for he went about to purchase the <hi>gift of tongues,</hi> and other <hi>sacred illuminations</hi> called the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> which fell upon men at the imposition of the Apostles hands, as if they had been only a trick to get money, or a fit thing to drive a trade withal, and make a gainful mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise; <hi>When Simon saw that through the laying on of the hands of the Apostles the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Luke, saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:66440:367"/>
the Holy Ghost,</hi> Acts 8.18, 19. This was a very great abuse, and a most unworthy comparing of the heavenly and holy Spirit of God to a mercetable ware, and vendible commodity; thinking it fit to serve any ends, and to minister to the basest purposes of filthy lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre and covetousness. But yet this sin against the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost in its strictest acceptation, was not the unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable sin; it came very near it indeed, and would hardly be remitted; but still in all likelihood it was remissible. And therefore S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> although he be very severe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this sordid man for the high affront, doth not yet pronounce an irreversible doom of damnation upon him, but on the contrary exhorts him to repent, that the sin of his heart may be forgiven. <hi>Repent,</hi> says he, <hi>of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee,</hi> ver. 22.</p>
               <p>But that which is the desperately damning sin against the Holy Ghost, which shall never be forgiven either in this world, or in that which is to come; is the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning against it, not by <hi>interpretation</hi> only in our <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> but <hi>directly in our words and expressions.</hi> It is our <hi>speaking reproachfully</hi> and <hi>slanderously of it,</hi> as the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees did of the <hi>spirit</hi> when they attributed it to <hi>Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub.</hi> And therefore it is expresly called the <hi>speaking blasphemously</hi> against the Holy Ghost. <hi>Whosoever speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>

                  <hi>Mark, because they said he hath an unclean spirit,</hi> Mark 3 30.</p>
               <p>And thus at length we see what that sin against the Holy Ghost is, whose doom is so dreadful, and whose case is so desperate under the Gospel. It is nothing less than a <hi>slandering and reviling,</hi> instead of owning
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:66440:367"/>
and assenting to <hi>that last evidence, which God has given us of the truth of the Gospel in the gifts of tongues, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and other extraordinary illuminations called the Holy Ghost.</hi> So that no man who <hi>ownes Christ's Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and thinks he was no <hi>Impostor,</hi> and believes that these <hi>miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghost</hi> were no <hi>magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal shows or diabolical delusions,</hi> can ever be guilty of it. No, before he arrive to that, he must not only be an <hi>Infidel to the faith,</hi> but also a <hi>Blasphemer of it</hi>; he must not only disbelieve this last and greatest evidence, but disparage and rail against it. If then there be any man who <hi>ownes Christ's Authority,</hi> and <hi>obeys his Laws,</hi> and <hi>believes his Gospel,</hi> and <hi>hopes in its promises,</hi> and <hi>fears its threatnings,</hi> and expects that every word of that Covenant, which was confirmed to us by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible evidence of the Spirit and the Holy Ghost, shall come to pass; he is not more guiltless of any sin, than of this against the Holy Ghost; for he doth not so much as sleight and disparage, but ownes and submits to it.</p>
               <p>If good men therefore are afraid by reason of the irremissibleness of the sin against the Holy Ghost; they fear where they need not, and their scruple is utterly unreasonable and groundless, For let it be as unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable as it will, that shall not hurt them, for they can never suffer by it, since, whilst they continue such as now they are, they cannot possibly be guilty of it, or of any thing that comes near it.</p>

                  <p>Some other causless scruples. The point of growth in Grace more largely stated. A summary repetition of this whole Discourse. They may dye with courage whose Conscience doth not accuse them. This accusation must not be for idle words, distractions in Prayer, &amp;c. but for a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful transgression of some Law of Piety, Sobriety, &amp;c. above mentioned. It must further be particular and express, not general and roving. If an honest mans heart condemn him not for some such unrepented sins, God never will.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEsides these scruples already mentioned, some good minds may be put in fear, and doubt of the safety of their present state, because S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John</hi> says, that <hi>whosoever is born of God sinneth not,</hi> being no longer a <hi>child of God</hi> if he do, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.6, 9.</p>
               <p>But the sin here spoken of, as was observed <note n="a" place="margin">Book 4. Chap. 2.</note> above, is defined by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John</hi> himself at the fourth verse of this Chapter, to be not every deviation or <hi>going beside the Law,</hi> but <hi>a wilful transgression</hi> and <note n="b" place="margin">

                  <hi>rejecting of the Law it self.</hi> And this indeed is inconsistent with a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate state, and puts us out of Gods favour, making us liable to eternal destruction. But then the case for these sins is not desperate, seeing if once we forsake them, and repent of them, we are as safe again as ever we were before we committed them. For our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance will set us straight; and if we transgress not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

again, we are without the reach of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Others doubt whether when once they have wilfully sinned they ever can repent, or shall afterwards be pardoned, because they read of <hi>Esau,</hi> that after he had sold his <hi>birth-right</hi> with the blessing that attended it, <hi>when he would have inherited it afterwards he was reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and <hi>found no place</hi> of a <note n="c" place="margin">

               <p>In answer to this it will be sufficient to observe, that this change of mind or repentance which <hi>Esau</hi> sought, but could not find, was not in <hi>himself,</hi> but in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Isaac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was not in <hi>himself,</hi> I say, for there he did find a place for it, being he was really possessed of it. For he was heartily sorry for his former folly in parting with his <hi>birth-right</hi>; and for his present unhappiness in being cozen'd of his Father <hi>Isaacs blessing,</hi> and he sought to have them reverst with bitter crys, and importunate desires, and much unfeigned intreaties; which clearly show that <hi>Esaus</hi> own mind was changed abundantly.</p>
               <p>But that repentance, or change of mind in reversing of the blessing, for which he laboured hard, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effect, was in his Father <hi>Isaac.</hi> The good Old man had already pronounced the blessing upon <hi>Jacob,</hi> and when <hi>Esau</hi> most earnestly intreated him to reverse it, he told him flatly he would not: <hi>I have blessed him</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saith he, <hi>yea and he shall be blessed,</hi> Gen. 27.33. For the story, as it is there recited, is plainly this. When <hi>Isaac</hi> bid his Son <hi>Esau</hi> provide him some Venison, that he might eat thereof, and bless him before he died: <hi>Jacob,</hi> by the counsel and assistance of his Mother <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca,</hi> counterfeited both the person and the Venison of <hi>Esau,</hi> and going in therewith to his Father before
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:66440:369"/>
                  <hi>Esau</hi> returned, craftily stole away the blessing from him. And when <hi>Esau</hi> came in afterwards to receive the blessing which <hi>Isaac</hi> his Father had promised him, he tells him that <hi>Jacob</hi> his Brother had come with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty before him, and under a crafty disguise had taken it away from him.<note place="margin">Verse 37.</note> For <hi>I have made him thy Lord,</hi> saith he, <hi>and all his brethren have I given to him for servants.</hi> And although <hi>Esau</hi> intreated his Father to reverse it,<note place="margin">ver. 34, 38.</note> and <hi>cryed,</hi> as it is there said, <hi>with a great and exceeding bitter cry</hi>; yet <hi>Isaac</hi> would not change his mind, or alter what he had pronounced: <hi>I have blessed him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">33.</note> saith he, <hi>yea and he shall be blessed.</hi> This reversion of the blessing, and repentance or change of mind in his Father <hi>Isaac,</hi> was that which <hi>Esau</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured after, and which, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> here says, <hi>he sought carefully with tears.</hi> But as he observes out of this story all was in vain, for it would not be granted him. When he sought to <hi>inherit the blessing,</hi> his suit was not granted but <hi>rejected</hi>; for <hi>Isaacs</hi> Decree was past, and <hi>he found no place of repentance,</hi> or way to make him change his mind; <hi>although he sought</hi> that <note n="d" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>In this place then the Apostle says not at all that it <hi>was impossible for</hi> Esau <hi>to repent of his sins against God,</hi> or that <hi>God would not forgive him upon his repentance:</hi> but only that <hi>Isaac would not repent of his decree,</hi> or reverse that blessing which he had pronounced upon <hi>Jacob.</hi> Which inflexibleness of <hi>Isaac</hi> he doth indeed make use of in these verses to illustrate Gods inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness towards some sinners; but then those are not all <hi>wilful sinners</hi> indifferently, but only <hi>Apostates,</hi> who have wilfully renounced their Christianity, which, as we have seen before, is a sin that God will afford no more grace, or place of repentance to. And this, as I take it, appears plainly from the foregoing verses.
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:66440:369"/>
                  <hi>Take care,</hi> says he, <hi>lest that which is lame,</hi> or the weak Christian, <hi>be turned out of the way</hi> of his Christian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession through fears of Persecution, v. 13; <hi>Look di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently lest any man fail,</hi> or fall from <hi>the Grace</hi> or Gospel <hi>of God,</hi> v. 15; which I exhort you the more earnestly to do, because if any man doth reject all those Gospel-blessings and priviledges, which in that Religion which you have received are now offered to him, and apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statize from them; God will never afford him the tender of them again, but will be as unalterable in his Decree against him, as <hi>Isaac</hi> was in his against <hi>Esau,</hi> who, as you know from the story, after once he had mist of the <hi>blessing, found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears,</hi> v. 17.</p>
               <p>Others again are troubled in mind, and are afraid lest their Souls are yet in danger, because they do not perceive themselves <hi>to grow in grace,</hi> and <hi>to be increased in goodness.</hi> They complain that their <hi>spiritual life</hi> is at a stand, and that they are not more <hi>devout</hi> and <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously affected,</hi> more <hi>vertuous</hi> and better <hi>Christians</hi> than they were for some considerable time before. And this makes them jealous lest they should pass for <hi>idle servants,</hi> who have not used and improved their <hi>Talents</hi> and who shall be dealt with at the last Day as if they had abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them.</p>
               <p>To speak clearly to this business, and yet to be as brief as conveniently I can, it is <hi>first</hi> observable, that to <hi>grow in grace</hi> is the same thing as to <hi>grow in vertue and goodness,</hi> or to <hi>go on to higher measures of life and perfection in any, or in all the instances of duty and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> For an obedient life, as I have largely shewn, is that sole instance and proof of <hi>grace,</hi> which can ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any of us acceptable in Gods sight, and whereupon the Gospel encourages us to hope for pardon and a happy Sentence at the last Judgment. So that if any
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:66440:370"/>
mans <hi>life</hi> is more <hi>perfect</hi> than it was, if he grows in <hi>doing good,</hi> and <hi>keeping back from evil,</hi> and goes on higher still in <hi>performing all Gods Commandments</hi>; if he begins to have a greater <hi>honour for God,</hi> to be more <hi>careful to please,</hi> and more <hi>afraid to offend</hi> him; if he is more forward to <hi>depend upon his Providence,</hi> to <hi>trust in his Promises,</hi> to <hi>resign himself up to his Will,</hi> and to <hi>submit to his pleasure,</hi> to <hi>praise him for all his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> and <hi>Disposals,</hi> and to <hi>perform all his Precepts:</hi> if he is more <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>heavenly-minded, chast</hi> and <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, just</hi> and <hi>charitable</hi>; if he is more <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, courteous</hi> and <hi>affable, quiet</hi> and <hi>peaceable,</hi> more ready to <hi>repair wrongs,</hi> and to <hi>forgive injuries</hi> than formerly: if he thus advances to <hi>higher measures,</hi> to <hi>greater ease,</hi> or to <hi>more constancy</hi> and <hi>evenness of obedience</hi> in <hi>any,</hi> or in <hi>all instances of Duty</hi> towards <hi>God</hi> and <hi>men,</hi> and that in <hi>all relations</hi>; his vertue is in its <hi>spring,</hi> and is still going on; he <hi>grows in grace,</hi> and God will accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly reward him.</p>
               <p>One <hi>particular</hi> Vertue there is, which men are wont to look at more especially in this matter, and that is <hi>Prayer.</hi> They measure their growth in grace by their improvement in this, and think their <hi>spiritual life</hi> is then <hi>most perfect,</hi> when their <hi>Devotions are most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged.</hi> Which they conclude they are, not when they are put up with the greatest <hi>trust</hi> and <hi>dependance, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> and <hi>resignedness to God Almighty,</hi> or with any other of those <hi>obedient tempers</hi> implied in Prayer which are apt to influence our <hi>whole lives:</hi> but when they are accompanied with the most <hi>sensible joys,</hi> and <hi>ravishing transports,</hi> and <hi>unusual height of fervency</hi> and <hi>affection.</hi> So that if at any time they can <hi>pray</hi> more <hi>passionately,</hi> and put forth more <hi>intense desires,</hi> and work them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up to more <hi>heavenly raptures</hi> than ordinarily they have been able to attain to; they fancy that they do
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:66440:370"/>
indeed grow in grace, and are become higher in Gods favour and acceptance. But if ever this service hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be more <hi>irksom</hi> to them, and they discharge it with much <hi>backwardness</hi> and <hi>weariness, dulness</hi> and <hi>indifference</hi>; they think God frowns upon them, and has deserted them, and that their grace is in a decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning state, and sinking down to nothing.</p>
               <p>But this is a very <hi>uncertain</hi> and <hi>dangerous</hi> mark for any man in this case to judge by, and will very often deceive him that builds upon it. For these fervent heats, and delightsom transports of Devotion, are not so much a <hi>duty</hi> as a <hi>priviledge,</hi> which all tempers cannot attain to, but only those that are naturally disposed for it: so that a growth in them, is not a growth in <hi>saving grace,</hi> but rather in <hi>sensible joy</hi> and <hi>happiness,</hi> and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us not so truly gracious in Gods eyes, as happy in our own. Besides, as an improvement in these religious and pleasing raptures is not a growth in grace it self, so neither is it always <hi>joyned with it,</hi> and therefore no sure argument can be deduced from it. For 'tis easily observable, that several persons of <hi>devotional tempers,</hi> who are usually raised up to a high pitch, and ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with most delightsom transports in their Prayers; are yet very <hi>dangerously defective in many instances of necessary Duty</hi> and a <hi>holy life.</hi> They fall oft-times, even whilst they enjoy their blissful heats and heavenly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of Devotion, into damning acts of <hi>fraud</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice, anger</hi> and <hi>malice, strife</hi> and <hi>variance, fierceness</hi> and <hi>revenge:</hi> they live in them, and are habitually inslaved to them, and yet for all that they find no want of this delight in prayer, nor any abatement of their devout intenseness of mind, and earnest fervour of affection still. But now these men, being so <hi>maimed</hi> and <hi>partial</hi> in their service, and having no <hi>entire obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> to confide in; they have not grace enough, as
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:66440:371"/>
manifestly appears from what has been <note place="margin">Book 3.</note> said upon that point, to bear them out, nor so much vertue as God has indispensably required to save them.</p>
               <p>As for these qualifications of our Prayers then, those <hi>sensible joys</hi> and <hi>passionate transports</hi> which accompany them; they are no instance of obedience and saving grace themselves, nor any certain argument that those persons are endowed with it who are allowed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them. They are oft-times found in ill men, who, so long as they rest there and grow no better, cannot go to Heaven.</p>
               <p>And then as for the other more acceptable and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient tempers of our prayers, such as <hi>trust</hi> and <hi>depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, submission</hi> and <hi>resignedness,</hi> &amp;c. which the men of <hi>sober devotion</hi> most justly prefer before the former, as usually most <hi>others</hi> do when once their <hi>religious heats</hi> are over: though a growth in them is truly a growth in grace, yet a growth in them <hi>alone</hi> is not enough to save us. They indeed in <hi>themselves</hi> are so many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular instances of obedience, and besides that, they are also <hi>great means</hi> and proper instruments to produce others: so that our growth in them is a growth in some particular Graces, and a very likely way to grow in others also. But still we must remember that they are but <hi>one part of saving Grace,</hi> and by no means the <hi>whole</hi>; so that till we are grown in others too, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hope to be saved by them. They are some instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of vertue, and a growth in them is in part a growth in grace: but a growth in them alone, or in any other particular vertues whatsoever, except we are grown up to a saving pitch in all the rest, and are come up to an entire obedience, is not enough to serve our turn. For this is the indispensable condition of the Christian Religion, and this the <note n="f" place="margin">Eph. 4.13.</note> 
                  <hi>perfect man</hi> and <hi>just stature</hi> in the Christian Faith; that we be grown up to an <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:66440:371"/>
obedience in all our voluntary</hi> and <hi>chosen actions,</hi> not only to <hi>some few,</hi> but to <hi>all the parts of Duty,</hi> and <hi>the Laws of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if we would single out some <hi>one,</hi> or some <hi>few Vertues,</hi> from our growth and improvement wherein we may justly presume that we have attained to <hi>saving degrees in all the rest:</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>James</hi> directs us to the <hi>duties of the tongue,</hi> in abstaining from <hi>back-biting, censuring,</hi> and <hi>evil-speaking,</hi> &amp;c. which under all the <hi>invitations of conversation,</hi> and the <hi>temptations of common life,</hi> is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the last point which good men gain, and that wherein <note n="g" place="margin">Ecclus 19.16. <hi>and</hi> 14.1.</note> they, who scarce ever sin <hi>wilfully</hi> at <hi>all,</hi> or very <hi>rarely,</hi> are wont most frequently through <hi>indeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration</hi> and <hi>inadvisedness</hi> to miscarry. <hi>If any man,</hi> saith he, <hi>offendeth not in word,</hi> but has attained to an innocent and obedient guidance of his tongue; <hi>that same</hi> man need not be defective in other duties, he <hi>is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body,</hi> Jam. 3.2.</p>
               <p>Thus is mens growth in <hi>saving Grace,</hi> not a growth only in some <hi>one,</hi> or in some <hi>few vertues</hi>; but in an <hi>universal</hi> and <hi>entire obedience.</hi> And this every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is bound incessantly to endeavour after. The longer he lives, the higher improvement ought he to make, and to attain every vertue in a larger measure, and in greater firmness and perfection, than he had before. <hi>Grow in grace,</hi> says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter, and in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.18. <hi>Forgetting those things which are behind</hi> me, and alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy attained, says S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, and reaching out after those things which are</hi> still <hi>before me, I press on forward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the mark,</hi> that I may acquire a more compleat growth than yet I have. And <hi>let as many</hi> among you <hi>as be perfect, be thus minded,</hi> Phil. 3.13, 14.</p>
               <p>Thus are all good Christians bound to advance still
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:66440:372"/>
further in a virtuous course, and the longer they live, to be still more <hi>uniform</hi> and <hi>constant, firm</hi> and <hi>perfect in all instances of obedience</hi> and a <hi>holy life.</hi> But then this obligation is not always laid upon them under the <hi>forfeiture of Heaven,</hi> but when once they have attained so far as is indispensably necessary to their acceptance, only of some <hi>higher rewards</hi> and <hi>greater degrees of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness</hi> which are <hi>to be enjoyed there.</hi> For there are different degrees in happiness, answerable to the different mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures in mens obedience: they that <hi>perform most,</hi> shall be <hi>rewarded highest</hi>; but they who <hi>perform no more than is indispensably required,</hi> although they miss of that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of reward which by the Grace of the Gospel is due to an eminent height of obedient endeavours, shall yet obtain the <hi>pardon of their sins,</hi> and a <hi>state of joy</hi> and <hi>blessedness in Heaven,</hi> as well as they who have endeavoured and performed more. An <hi>entire obedience in all chosen actions,</hi> and a <hi>particular repentance and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of all those sins wherein at any time we have wilfully disobeyed God,</hi> is sufficient, as has been shown, to secure the happiness of the next life. According as we have attained to greater or lesser perfection in it, so shall the degrees of our reward there be proportioned; but if we have arrived to it at all, we have as much to show as is just necessary. And therefore whilst we are yet in the more imperfect measures of it, and only thirst after a more perfect obedience, that we may still be more acceptable to God, and have right to a more noble and excellent reward; we are in a safe state, and have no need to disquiet our Souls with fears and jealousies, lest they should eternally miscarry.</p>
               <p>If any person then has used Gods Grace, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved his Talents to this measure, he has not been unprofitable and useless, but has profited so far as is necessary to his happiness. He is bound indeed still to
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:66440:372"/>
advance higher, and in every instance of Vertue to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove further; but this he is, not under the loss of Heaven, but only under the danger of falling back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such a state of sin as would destroy the hopes of it again, and the forfeiture of greater glory and rewards there when an intire obedience in all chosen instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and a particular reformation and repentance of all wilful sins is once secured, there is so much growth in grace as is absolotely necessary; an exalted pitch and compleat measures of this obedience with more <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>pleasure, constancy</hi> and <hi>evenness,</hi> with <hi>less mixture of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary sins</hi> which need particular repentance, and with a <hi>greater freedom from innocent and unwilled infirmities,</hi> is necessary to more absolute degrees and greater hights of glory: but till that can be had, this is sufficient to a mans salvation.</p>
               <p>Several other scruples there are which are wont to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet and perplex the minds of good and honest peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who are safe in Gods account, although their Case seems never so hazardous in their own. And of this sort are their fears that their <hi>obedience is unsincere,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have an <hi>eye at their own good,</hi> and a respect to their own safety; since they serve God in hopes to be better by him, and out of a fear, should they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey, of suffering evil from him. They are afraid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that it is defective in a main Point, for they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>love</hi> and <hi>serve</hi> him in that comprehensive latitude which the Commandment requires, <hi>viz. With all their heart, and with all their soul, and with all their mind.</hi> They doubt they are <hi>past Grace and Pardon,</hi> because they have <hi>sinned after that they have been enlightned,</hi> and that <hi>wilfully</hi>; and the Apostles affirms that <hi>for such there remains no more Sacrifice for sins,</hi> Heb. 10.26. These doubts are still apt to disturb their peace, and make sad their hearts; and some others of like nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="710" facs="tcp:66440:373"/>But of these and several others I have given sufficient Accounts above; such as, I hope, may satisfie any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable man, who is capable to read and to consider of them; and thither I refer the Reader, not thinking fit here to repeat them.</p>
               <p>And thus at last we have seen when an <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire obedience</hi> is taken care for in the first place, how plainly <hi>groundless</hi> those fears are, which are wont to perplex the thoughts of good and safe, yet ignorant and misguided people about their state of happiness and salvation.</p>
               <p>And now I have done with all those points which I thought necessary to be enquired into, to the end that I might shew every man now before-hand how he stands prepared for the next world; and which at the beginning of this whole Discourse I proposed to treat of. I have shown what <hi>that condition is of bliss or misery, which the Gospel indispensably exacts of us,</hi> and that, as I take it, so particularly, that no man, who will be at the pains to read and consider of it, can overlook or mistake it; what <hi>those defects are, which it bears and dispenseth with</hi>; what <hi>those remedies</hi> and <hi>means of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation are, which it has provided for us</hi>; and, when all these are taken care for, how <hi>groundless all those other scruples are,</hi> which are wont to disquiet ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest minds about the goodness of their present state, and their title to eternal salvation.</p>
               <p>And upon the whole matter the sum of all amounts to this, that when <hi>Christ</hi> shall come to <hi>sit in judgment at the last day,</hi> and to pass sentence of life or death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every man according to the direction of his Gospel, he will pronounce upon <hi>every man according to his works.</hi> If he has <hi>honestly</hi> and <hi>entirely obey'd</hi> the whole will of God in all the particular Laws before-mention'd, <hi>never willfully and deliberately offending in any one instance,</hi> nor
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:66440:373"/>
                  <hi>indulging himself in the practice of any thing which he knows to be a sin</hi>; he is safe in the Accounts of the last Judgment, and shall never come into Condemnation. Nay if he has been a <hi>damnable offender,</hi> and has <hi>willfully transgressed</hi> either in <hi>one</hi> instance, or in <hi>many</hi>; in <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi> repetitions of his sin, or in <hi>few</hi>; yet if he <hi>repent of it before death seize him,</hi> and <hi>amend it ere he is haled away to Judgment</hi>; he is <hi>safe</hi> still. For he shall be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according as his works then are when God comes to enquire of them; so that if ever he be found in an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest obedience, observing everything which he sees to be his duty, and willfully venturing upon nothing which his Conscience tells him is sinful; he is found in the state of Grace and Pardon, and if he die in it, he shall be saved. All his <hi>unwill'd ignorances</hi> and <hi>innocent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advisednesses upon his Prayers for pardon</hi> and his <hi>merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and forgiveness of other men,</hi> shall be abated; all his other <hi>causes of fear</hi> and <hi>scruple shall be overlooked</hi>; they shall not be brought against him to his Condemnation, but in the honest and entire obedience which he hath performed, in that shall he live.</p>
               <p>If then we have an <hi>honest heart,</hi> and walk so as our <hi>own Conscience</hi> has nothing whereof to accuse us; we may meet Death with a good Courage, and go out of the World with comfortable Expectations. For if we have an honest and a tender heart, whensoever we sin willfully and against our Consciences, our own Souls will be our Remembrancers. They will be a witness against us both whilst we are in this World, and after we are taken out of it, and brought to Judgment. <hi>Mens Consciences,</hi> says the Apostle, <hi>shall accuse or excuse them, in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men according to my Gospel,</hi> Rom. 2.15.</p>
               <p>Indeed if men have <hi>harden'd their hearts in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and sin'd themselves out of the belief of their
<pb n="712" facs="tcp:66440:374"/>
duty, having come to call <hi>evil, good</hi>; and <hi>good, evil:</hi> then their Consciences having no further sense of sin, will have no accusations upon it. But if they really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Gospel, and study to know their duty, and desire to observe it, and are afraid to offend in any thing which they see is sinful; whilst thus their heart is soft, and their Conscience tender, they cannot ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon any sin with open Eyes, but that their own hearts will both check them before, and smite them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. They will have a witness against them in their own bosoms, which will scourge and awake them, so that they cannot approach death without a sense of their sin, nor go out of the World without discerning themselves to be guilty.</p>
               <p>If our own Conscience then cannot accuse us of the wilful and presumptuous breach of any of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and we know of none but what we have repented of; we have just reason to take a good heart to our selves, and to wait for death in hopeful expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations. <hi>If our own</hi>

                  <hi>hearts condemn us not,</hi> says Saint <hi>John, then have we confidence towards God,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.21. There is no sin that will damn us but a wilful one, and when we sin wilfully, if our heart is soft and honest, we sin willingly and against our Conscience; our own heart sees and observes it before, and will keep us in mind of it after we have committed it. So that if any man has a vertuous and a tender heart, a heart that is truly d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>An honest mans heart, I say, must condemn him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he have sufficient reason to condemn himself. And that too not for every <hi>idle word,</hi> or every <hi>fruitless lust,</hi> or every <hi>dulness of spirit,</hi> and <hi>distraction in prayer,</hi> and
<pb n="713" facs="tcp:66440:374"/>
                  <hi>coldness in devotion,</hi> or such other <hi>mistaken marks</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by too many are wont to judge of their title to salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. No, Heaven and Hell are not made to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these things, but although a man be guilty of them, he may be eternally happy notwithstanding them. But that accusation of his Conscience which may give an honest man just reason to condemn himself, must be an accusation for a <hi>wilful breach</hi> or <hi>deliberate transgression</hi> of some particular Law of <hi>Sobriety, Piety, Justice, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Peaceableness</hi>; it must accuse him of an unrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted breach of some of those Laws above mentioned, which God has plainly made the terms of life, and the condition of salvation.</p>
               <p>And the accusation for the breach of these Laws must be <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>express</hi>; not <hi>general</hi> and <hi>roving.</hi> For some are of so <hi>suspicious</hi> and <hi>timorous</hi> a temper, that they are still suspecting and condemning of themselves when they know not for what reason. They will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict themselves as men that have sinned greatly, but they cannot shew wherein; they judge of themselves, not from any <hi>reason</hi> or <hi>experience,</hi> but at a <hi>venture,</hi> and by <hi>chance</hi>; they speak not so truly their <hi>opinions</hi> as their <hi>fears</hi>; not what their <hi>understandings</hi> see and discern, but what their <hi>melancholy</hi> suggests to them. For ask them as to any one Particular of the Laws of God, and run them all over, and their Consciences cannot charge them with any <hi>wilful,</hi> which is withal an <hi>unrepented</hi> transgression of it. But let them overlook all Particulars, and pass a judgment of themselves on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in general, when they do not judge from particular instances, which are true evidence, but only from groundless and small presumptions; and then they pass a hard sentence upon themselves, and conclude that their sins are very great and their condition dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="714" facs="tcp:66440:375"/>But no man shall be sentenced at the last Day for Notions and Generalities: but it is our particular sins which must then condemn us. For God's Laws bind us all in single actions; and if our own Consciences can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not condemn us for any one wilful, which is withal an unrepented action; God will not condemn us for them altogether.</p>
               <p>If our own heart therefore doth not accuse us for the <hi>particular, wilful,</hi> and <hi>unrepented breaches</hi> of some or other of those Laws above mentioned, which God has made the indispensable condition of our acceptance; we are secure as to the next World, and may comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably hope to be acquitted in the last Judgment. Being conscious of no wilful sin but what we have repented of, and by mercy and forgiveness of other men, and our prayers to God, begging pardon for our involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary sins; we shall have nothing that will lye heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us at the last Day, but may go out of the World with ease, and dye in comfort. Our departure hence may be in peace, because our appearance at Gods Tribunal shall surely be in safety.
