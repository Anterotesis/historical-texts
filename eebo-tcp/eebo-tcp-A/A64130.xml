            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>1 Cor. 15. 19.</bibl>
               <q>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are
of all men most miserable.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WHen God in his infinite and eternal wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
had decreed to give to man a life of
labour and a body of mortality, a state of
contingency and a composition of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
elements; and having design'd to be
glorified by a free obedience, would also
permit sin in the world, and suffer evil
men to goe on in their wickedness, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
in their impious machinations, to vex the souls, and grieve
the bodies of the righteous, he knew that this would not only be
very hard to be suffered by his servants, but also be very difficult
to be understood by them who know God to be a <hi>Law-giver</hi> as
well as a <hi>Lord,</hi> a <hi>Iudge</hi> as well as a <hi>King,</hi> a <hi>Father</hi> as well as a
<hi>Ruler;</hi> and that in order to his own glory, and for the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of his goodness he had promised to reward his servants,
to give good to them that did good: therefore to take off all
prejudices and evil resentments and temptations which might
trouble those good men who suffered evil things, he was pleased
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35133:3"/>
to do two great things which might confirme the faith, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear
the services, and entertain the hopes of them who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
his servants, but yet were very ill used in the accidents of
this world.</p>
            <p>1. The one was that he sent his son into the world to take upon
him our nature, and him being the <hi>Captain of our salvation he would
perfect through sufferings;</hi> that no man might think it much to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
when God spared not his own son; and every man might
submit to the necessity when the Christ of God was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt;
and yet that no man should fear the event which was to
follow such sad beginnings, when <hi>it behoved</hi> even <hi>Christ to suffer,
and so to enter into glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The other great thing was, that God did not only by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
and the Sermons of the Prophets <hi>to his Church,</hi> but
even <hi>to all mankinde</hi> competently teach, and effectively per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
that the soul of man does not die; but that although
things were ill here, yet they should be well hereafter;
that the evils of this life were short and tolerable, and that to
the good who usually feel most of them, they should end in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and advantages. And therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> had reason on his
side to conclude, that there is to be a time and place after this
life wherein the wicked shall be punished and the vertuous well
rewarded, when he considered that <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Socrates, Palamedes</hi>
and <hi>Thraseas, Lucretia</hi> and <hi>Papinian</hi> were either slain or
oppressed to death by evil men. But to us Christians <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
(as <hi>Platoes</hi> expression
is) we have a necessity to declare and a demonstration to prove
it, when we read that <hi>Abel</hi> died by the hands of <hi>Cain,</hi> who was
so ignorant, that though he had <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>strength,</hi> yet he had
scarce <hi>art</hi> enough to kill him; when we read that <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi>
Christ himselfe and his Apostles and his whole army of martyrs
died under the violence of evil men; when vertue made good
men poor, and free speaking of brave truths made the wise to lose
their liberty; when an excellent life hastened an opprobrious
death, and the obeying God destroyed our selves; it was but
time to look about for another state of things where justice
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35133:3"/>
should rule and vertue finde her own portion: where the men
that were like to God in mercy and justice should also partake
of his felicity: and therefore men cast out every line, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
every stone, and tried every argument, and sometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it well, and when they did not, yet they believed strongly,
and they were sure of the thing even when they were not sure of
the argument.</p>
            <p>Thus therefore would the old Priests of the Capitol, and the
Ministers of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and the mystic persons at their Oracles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
when they made <hi>Apotheoses</hi> of vertuous and braver per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
ascribing every braver man into the number of their gods:
<hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Romulus, Castor,</hi> and <hi>Pollux, Liber Pater,</hi> him that
taught the use of Vines, and her that taught them the use of
Corne. For they knew that it must needs be, that they who like
to God doe excellent things, must like to God have an excellent
portion.</p>
            <p>This learning they also had from <hi>Pherecydes</hi> the Syrian, from
<hi>Pythagoras</hi> of Samos, and from <hi>Zamolxis</hi> the Gete, from the
Neighbours of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and the inhabitants by <hi>Ister</hi> who were
called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Immortalists,</hi> because in the midst of all
their dark notices of things they saw this clearly, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; that vertuous and good men do not die, but
their souls do go into blessed regions where they shall enjoy all
good things: and it was never known that ever any good man
was of another opinion. <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Themistocles, Epaminondas</hi>
and <hi>Cicero, Socrates</hi> and <hi>Cimon, Ennius</hi> and <hi>Phidias,</hi> all the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of mankind have preached this truth. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
               <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> The dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursings
and prophesyings of Divine men are much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and excellent then of others, because they do equal and good
things until the time comes that they shall hear well for them,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And this is the sign that when we die we
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35133:4"/>
have life and discerning, because though the wicked care not for
believing it, yet all the Prophets and the Poets, the wise and the
brave Heroes say so; they are the words of <hi>Plato.</hi> For though
that which is compounded of elements returns to its material
and corruptible principles, yet the soul which is a particle of
the Divine breath returns to its own Divine original, where
there is no death or dissolution: and because the understanding
is neither hot nor cold, it hath no moisture in it and no driness,
it follows that it hath nothing of those substances concerning
which alone we know that they are corruptible. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
corruptible that we know of, but the four elements and
their Sons and Daughters: nothing dies that can discourse, that
can reflect in perfect circles upon their own imperfect actions;
nothing can die that can see God and converse with spirits, that
can govern by laws and wise propositions. For fire and water
can be tyrannical but not govern; they can bear every thing
down that stands before them and rush like the people, but not
rule like Judges, and therefore they perish as tumults are dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>:
sayes <hi>Aristotle.</hi> But the soul only comes from abroad, from a
Divine principle (for so saith the Scripture) <hi>God breathed into
Adam the spirit of life,</hi> and that which in operation does not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with the body shall have no part in its corruption.</p>
            <p>Thus far they were right; but when they descended to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
they fell into error. That the rewards of vertue were to
be hereafter, that they were sure of: that the soul was to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
the calamities of this world and the death of the body; that
they were sure of; and upon this account they did bravely and
vertuously: and yet, they that thought best amongst them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
that the souls departed should be reinvested with other
bodies according to the dispositions and capacities of this life.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Orpheus</hi> who sang well should transmigrate into a Swan,
and the soul of <hi>Thamyris</hi> who had as good a voice as he, should
wander till it were confined to the body of a Nightingal; <hi>Ajax</hi>
to a Lion, <hi>Agamemnon</hi> to an Eagle, Tyrant princes into wolvs
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35133:4"/>
and Hawks, the lascivious into Asses and Goats, the Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
into Swine, the Crafty Statesmen into bees and pismires,
and <hi>Thersites</hi> to an Ape. This fancy of theirs prevailed much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the common people, and the uninstructed amongst the
Jews: for when Christ appeared so glorious in miracle, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>
presently fancied him to be the soul of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
body, and the common people said he was <hi>Elias,</hi> or <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mias,</hi>
or one of the old Prophets. And true it is, that although
God was pleased in all times to communicate to mankind noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the other world sufficient to encourage vertues, and to
contest against the rencontres of the world, yet he was ever spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in telling the secrets of it; and when St. <hi>Paul</hi> had his rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
into Heaven, he saw fine things and heard strange words,
but they were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, words that he could not speak,
and secrets that he could not understand, and secrets that he
could not communicate. For as a man staring upon the broad
eye of the Sun at his noon of Solstice, feels his heat and dwells
in light, and loses the sight of his eyes and perceives nothing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly,
but the Organ is confounded and the faculty amazed
with too big a beauty: So was S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his extasy; he saw that
he could see nothing to be told below, and he perceived the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
were too big for flesh and blood, and that the beauties of
separate souls were not to be understood by the soul in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction;
and therefore after all the fine things that he saw, we
only know what we knew before, <hi>viz.</hi> that the soul can live when
the body is dead; that it can subsist without the body; that
there are very great glories reserved for them that serve God;
that they who die in Christ shall live with him; that the body
is a prison and the soul is in fetters while we are alive; and that
when the body dies the soul springs and leaps from her prison
and enters into the first liberty of the sons of God. Now much
of this did rely upon the same argument upon which the wise
Gentiles of old concluded the immortality of the soul; even
because we are here very miserable and very poor: we are sick
and we are afflicted; we do well and are disgraced; we speak
well and we are derided; we tell truths and few believe us;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35133:5"/>
but the proud are exalted and the wicked are delivered, and evil
men reign over us, and the covetous snatch our little bundles of
money from us, and the <hi>Fiscus</hi> gathers our rents, and every where
the wisest and the best men are oppressed; but therefore because
it is thus, and thus it is not well, we hope for some great good
thing hereafter. For if in this life only we had hope, then we
Christians, all we to whom persecution is allotted for our por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we who must be patient under the Crosse, and receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
and say nothing but prayers, we certainly were of all men
the most miserable.</p>
            <p>Well then! in this life we see plainly that our portion is not:
here we have hopes, but not here only, we shall goe into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place, where we shall have more hopes: our faith shall
have more evidence, it shall be of things seen afar off; and our
hopes shall be of more certainty and perspicuity, and next to
possession; we shall have very much good, and be very sure of
much more. Here then are three propositions to be considered.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Servants of God in this world are very miserable,
were it not for their hopes of what is to come hereafter.</item>
               <item>2. Though this be a place of hopes, yet we have not our
hopes only here. <hi>If in this life only we had hopes</hi> (saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle)
meaning, that in another life also we have hopes; not
only <hi>metonymically,</hi> taking hopes for the things we hope for,
but <hi>properly</hi> and for the acts, objects and causes of hope. In
the state of separation the godly shall have the vast joyes of a
certain intuitive hope, according to their several proportions
and capacities.</item>
               <item>3. The consummation and perfection of their felicity,
when all their miseries shall be changed into glories, is in the
world to come, after the resurrection of the dead; which is
the main thing which S. <hi>Paul</hi> here intends.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. The servants of God in this life are calamitous and afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
they must live under the Crosse. <hi>He that will be my Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
let him deny himself and take up his Cross and follow me</hi> (said our
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35133:5"/>
Glorious Lord and Master.) And we see this Prophetic pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
(for it is both a Prophecy and a Commandment, and
therefore shall be obeyed whether we will or no) but I say, we see
it verified by the experience of every day. For here the violent
oppress the meek and they that are charitable shall receive
injuries. The Apostles who preach'd Christ crucified were
themselves persecuted and put to violent deaths; and Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
it selfe for three hundred years was the publick hatred; and
yet then it was that men loved God best, and suffered more for
him; <hi>then,</hi> they did most good, and least of evill. In this
world men thrive by villany, and lying and deceiving is accounted
just, and to be rich is to be wise, and tyranny is honourable,
and though little thefts and petty mischiefs are interrupted by
the laws, yet if a mischief become publick and great, acted by
Princes and effected by armies, and robberies be done by whole
fleets, it is vertue and it is glory: it fills the mouths of fools
that wonder, and imployes the pens of witty men that eat the
bread of flattery. How many thousand bottles of tears, and
how many millions of sighs does God every day record, while
the oppressed and the poor pray unto him, worship him, speak
great things of his holy Name, study to please him, beg for
helps that they may become gracious in his eyes, and are so, and
yet never sing in all their life, but when they sing Gods praises
out of duty with a sad heart and a hopefull spirit, living only
upon the future, weary of to day, and sustain'd only by the
hope of to morrows event? and after all, their eyes are dim
with weeping and looking upon distances as knowing they
shall never be happy till the <hi>new Heavens and the new Eearth</hi>
appear.</p>
            <p>But I need not instance in the <hi>miserabili</hi> in them that dwell in
dungeons and lay their head in places of trouble and disease:
take those servants of God who have greatest plenty, who are
incircled with blessings, whom this world calls prosperous, and
see if they have not fightings within and crosses without, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of accidents and perpetuity of temptations, the Devil
assaulting them and their own weakness betraying them; fears
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35133:6"/>
incompassing them round about lest they lose the favour of
God, and shame sitting heavily upon them when they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
how often they talk foolishly, and lose their duty, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
their greatest relations and walk unworthy of those glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
which they would fain obtain; and all this is besides the
unavoidable acc<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dents of mortality, sickly bodies, troublesome
times, changes of Government, loss of interests, unquiet and
peevish accidents round about them: so that when they consider
to what they are primarily obliged; that they must in some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
deny their appetite, in others they must quit their rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
in all they must deny themselves when their Natural or
Secular danger tempts to sin or danger; and that for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of their wills and the strengthening their resolutions against
the arguments and sollicitation of passions they have nothing but
the promises of another world; they will easily see that all the
splendour of their condition which fools admire and wise men
use temperately and handle with caution as they trie the edge of
a rasor, is so far from making them recompence for the sufferings
of this world, that the reserves and expectations of the next is
that conjugation of aids by which only they can well and wisely
bear the calamities of their present plenty.</p>
            <p>But if we look round about us and see how many righteous
causes are oppressed, how many good men are reproached,
how religion is persecuted, upon what strange principles the
greatest princes of the world transact their greatest affairs, how
easily they make wars and how suddainly they break leagues,
and at what expence and vast pensions they corrupt each others
officers, and how the greatest part of mankind watches to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
one another, and they that are devoured are commonly
the best, the poor and the harmless, the gentle and uncrasty,
the simple and religious; and then how many wayes all good
men are exposed to danger, and that our scene of duty lies as
much in passive graces as in active, it must be confessed that this
is a place of wasps and insects, of Vipers and Dragons, of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gres
and Bears; but the sheep are eaten by men or devoured by
Wolves and Foxes, or die of the rot; and when they do not,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35133:6"/>
yet every year they redeem their lives by giving their fleece and
their milk, and must die when their death will pay the charges
of the knife.</p>
            <p>Now from this I say, it was that the very Heathen, <hi>Plutarch</hi>
and <hi>Cicero, Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Hierocles, Plato</hi> and many others did
argue and conclude that there must be a day of recompences to
come hereafter which would set all right again: And from
hence also our B. Saviour himself did convince the <hi>Sadduces</hi> in
their fond and pertinacious denying of the resurrection: For
that is the meaning of that argument which our B. Lord did
choose as being clearly and infallibly the aptest of any in the old
Testament to prove the resurrection, and though the deduction
is not at first so plain and evident, yet upon neerer intuition,
the interpretation is easie and the argument excellent and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>For it is observed by the learned among the Jews that when
God is by way of particular relation and especial benediction
appropriated to any one, it is intended that God is to him a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder</hi>
and <hi>Benefactor,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; for
that is the first thing and the last that every man believes and
feels of God; and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> summes up the Gentiles
Creed in this compendium; <hi>He that commeth to God must believe
that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
[Heb.</hi> 11. 6.] And as it is in the <hi>indefinite</hi> expression, so it is in
the <hi>limited;</hi> as it is in the <hi>absolute</hi> so also in the <hi>Relative.</hi> God
is <hi>the</hi> rewarder; and to be <hi>their God</hi> is to be <hi>their rewarder,</hi> to be
<hi>their</hi> Benefactor and <hi>their</hi> Gracious Lord. <hi>Ego ero Deus vester,</hi>
I will be your God, that is, I will do you good sayes <hi>Aben Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra:</hi>
and <hi>Philo,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The Everlasting God,
that is, as if he had said, one that will do you good; not
sometimes some, and sometimes none at all, but frequently and
for ever: And this we finde also observed by St. <hi>Paul: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God is not ashamed to be called their God; [Heb.</hi> 11. 16.]
and that by which the Relative appellative is verified is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
benefit; He is <hi>called their God [for he hath provided for
them a city.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:35133:7"/>Upon this account the argument of our B. Saviour is this,
<hi>God is the God of Abraham, Isaac and Iacob;</hi> that is, the <hi>gracious</hi>
God, the <hi>Benesactor,</hi> the <hi>Rewarder;</hi> and therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> is
not dead, but is fallen asleep, and he shall be restored in the
resurrection to receive those blessings and rewards, by the title
of which God was called the <hi>God of Abraham.</hi> For in this world
<hi>Abraham</hi> had not that harvest of blessings which is consigned by
that glorious appellative; he was an exile from his Country,
he stood far off from the possession of his hopes, he lived an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulatory
life, he spent most of his dayes without an heir, he
had a constant piety, and at the latter end of his life one great
blessing was given him; and because that was allayed by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of his wife, and the expulsion of his handmaid, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of <hi>Ishmael,</hi> and the danger of the lad; and his great ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
about the matter of <hi>Isaac's</hi> sacrifice; and all his faith and
patience and piety was rewarded with nothing but promises of
things a great way off; and before the possession of them he
went out of this world; it is undeniably certain that God who
after the departure of the Patriarchs did still love to be called
[<hi>Their God</hi>] did intend to signifie that they should be restored
to a state of life and a capacity of those greatest blessings which
were the foundation of that title and that relation. God is not
the God of the dead, but of the living, but God is the God of
<hi>Abraham</hi> and the other Patriarchs; therefore they are not dead;
dead to this world, but alive to God; that is, though this life
be lost, yet they shall have another and a better; a life in which
God shall manifest himself to be their God to all the purposes
of benefit and eternal blessings.</p>
            <p>This argument was summed up by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the sense of it
is thus rendred by St. <hi>Clement</hi> the Bishop of Rome, as himself
testifies: <hi>si Deus est juslus, animus est immortalis,</hi> which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
rendred by the words of my text; <hi>if in this life only we
have hope, then are we of all men the most miserable;</hi> but because
this cannot be that God who is just and good should suffer them
that heartily serve him to be really and finally miserable, and
yet in this world they are so, very frequently; therefore in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35133:7"/>
world they shall live to receive a full recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>Neither is this so to be understood, as if the servants of God
were so wholly forsaken of him in this world, and so permitted
to the malice of evil men, or the asperities of fortune, that they
have not many refreshments and great comforts and the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
festivities of a holy Conscience: for <hi>God my Maker is he that
giveth songs in the night,</hi> said <hi>Elihu; [Iob</hi> 35. 10.] that is, God
as a reward giveth a chearful spirit, and makes a man to sing
with joy, when other men are sad with the solemn darkness and
with the affrights of conscience, and the illusions of the night.
But God who intends vast portions of felicity to his children
does not reckon these little joys into the account of the portion of
his elect. The good things which they have in this world are
not little, if we account the joys of religion and the peace of conscience
amongst things valuable; yet whatsoever it is; all of it,
all the blessings of themselves, and of their posterity, and of
their Relatives for their sakes are cast in for intermedial enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments;
but <hi>their good,</hi> and their prepared portion shall be
hereafter. But for the evil it self which they must suffer and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome,
it is such a portion of this life as our B. Saviour had;
injuries and temptations, care and persecutions, poverty and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
humility and patience: it is well; it is very well; and
who can long for, or expect better here; when his Lord and
Saviour had a state of things so very much worse then the worst
of our calamities: but bad as it is; it is to be chosen rather then
a better; because it is the high way of the cross; it is <hi>Iacobs</hi> lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
upon which the Saints and the King of the Saints did descend
and at last ascend to heaven it self; and bad as it is, it is the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
and the inlet to the best; it is a sharp, but it is a short step
to bliss: for it is remarkable in the parable of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi>
that the poor man, the afflicted Saint died first, <hi>Dives</hi> being
permitted to his purple and fine linnen, to his delicious fare,
and (which he most of all needed) to a space of repentance;
but in the mean time the poor man was rescued from his sad por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this life and carried into <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome; where he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35133:8"/>
who was denied in this world to be feasted even with the portion
of dogs was placed in the bosome of the Patriarch, that is, in
the highest room, for so it was in their <hi>discubitus</hi> or lying down
to meat, the chief guest, the most beloved person did lean upon
the bosome of the Master of the feast, so S. <hi>Iohn</hi> did lean upon
the breast of Jesus; and so did <hi>Lazarus</hi> upon the brest of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi>
or else <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>sinus Abrahae</hi> may be rendred,
[<hi>the bay of Abraham,</hi>] alluding to the place of rest where ships
put in after a tempestuous and dangerous Navigation; the
storme was quickly over with the poor man; and the Angel of
God brought the good mans soul to a safe port, where he should
be disturbed no more: and so saith the spirit; <hi>Blessed are the dead
which die in the Lord; for they rest from their labours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this brings me to the second great inquiry. If here we live
upon hopes, and that this is a place of hopes, but not this only;
what other place is there where we shall be blessed in our hope,
where we shall rest from our labour and our fear and have our
hopes in perfection; that is, all the pleasures which can come
from the greatest and the most excellent hope?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not in this life only</hi>] so my Text. Therefore hereafter: as
soon as we die: as soon as ever the soule goes from the body, it
is blessed. <hi>Blessed</hi> I say, but <hi>not perfect;</hi> it rejoyces in peace and
a holy hope: here we have hopes mingled with fear; there our
hope is heightned with joy and confidence; it is all the comfort
that can be in the expectation of unmeasurable joyes: it is only,
Not fruition, not the joyes of a perfect possession; but less then
that, it is every good thing else.</p>
            <p>But that I may make my way plain; I must first remove an
objection which seems to overthrow this whole affaire. S. <hi>Paul</hi>
intends these words of my text as an argument to prove the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection;
we shall rise again with our bodies; for <hi>if in this
life only we had hopes, then were we of all men most miserable;</hi> meaning,
that unless there be a resurrection, there is no good for us any
where else; but if <hi>they that dye in the Lord</hi> were happy before the
resurrection; then we were not of all men most miserable though
there were to be no resurrection; for the godly are presently
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35133:8"/>
happy. So that one must fail; either the resurrection or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedial
happinesse: the proof of one relies upon the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the other: and because we can no other wayes be happy,
therefore there shall be a resurrection.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, that if the godly instantly upon their disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
had the <hi>vision beatifical,</hi> it is very true, that they were
not most miserable though there be no resurrection of the dead,
though the body were turned into its original nothing: for the
joyes of the sight of God would in the soule alone make them
infinite recompence for all the sufferings of this world. But that
which the Saints have after their dissolution, being only the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of a holy hope, the argument remains good: for these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedial
hopes being nothing at all but in relation to the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
these hopes do not destroy, but confirme it rather; and
if the resurrection were not to be, we should neither have any
hopes here, nor hopes hereafter. And therefore the Apostles
word is [<hi>if here only we had hopes</hi>] that is, if our hopes only rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to this life; but because our hopes only relate to the life
to come, and even after this life we are still but in the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of an inlarged hope, this life and that interval are both but
the same argument to inferre a resurrection; for they are the
hopes of that state, and the joyes of those, hopes, and it is the
comfort of that joy which makes them blessed who die in the
love of God, and the faith and obedience of the Lord Jesus.
<q>And now to the proposition it selfe.</q>
In the state of separation the souls departed perceive the blessing
and comfort of their labours; they are alive after death, and
after death immediately they finde great refreshments. <hi>Iusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
animae in manu Dei sunt, &amp; non tanget illos tormentum mortis.
[Wisd.</hi> 3.] The torments of death shall not touch the souls of the
righteous because they are in the hands of God. And fifteen
hundred years after the death of <hi>Moses</hi> we finde him talking
with our Blessed Lord in his transfiguration upon the Mount
Tabor: and as <hi>Moses</hi> was then, so are all the Saints immediately
after death, <hi>praesentes apud Dominum,</hi> they are present with the
Lord, and to be so, is not a state of death, and yet of this it is,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35133:9"/>
that S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms it to be much better then to be alive.
And this was the undoubted sentence of the Jews before Christ
and since,and therefore our Blessed Saviour told the converted
thief that he should <hi>that day be with him in Paradise.</hi> Now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
peradventure he spake so as he was to be understood; mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by <hi>Paradise</hi> that which the Schools and Pulpits of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins
did usually speak of it. By <hi>Paradise</hi> till the time of <hi>Esdras</hi>
it is certain, the Jews only meant that Blessed Garden in which
God once placed <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve:</hi> but in the time of <hi>Esdras</hi> and
so downward when they spake distinctly of things to happen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this life, and began to signifie their new discoveries and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Philosophy by Names, they called the state of souls ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
the resurrection of their bodies by the name of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
the garden of Eden. Hence came that forme of comprecation
and blessing to the soul of an Israelite <hi>Sit anima ejus in horto Eden
Let his soul be in the garden of Eden;</hi>] and in their solemn pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
at the time of their death they were wont to say [<hi>let his soule
rest, and let his sleep be in peace untill the Comforter shall come; open
the gates of Paradise unto him</hi>] expresly distinguishing <hi>Paradise</hi>
from the state of the <hi>Resurrection.</hi> And so it is evident in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse
on the Crosse between Christ and the converted thief.
That day both were to be in Paradise: but Christ himself was
not then ascended into heaven, and therefore Paradise was no
part of that region where Christ now and hereafter the Saints
shall reign in glory. For <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> did by use and custome
signifie any place of beauty and pleasure. So the LXX. read
<hi>Eccles. 2. 5. I made me gardens and orchards,</hi> I made me a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
so it is in the Greek; and <hi>Cicero</hi> having found this strange
word in <hi>Zenophon</hi> renders it by [<hi>agrum conseptum ac diligentèr con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situm:</hi>]
a field well hedg'd and set with flowers and fruits. <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varium,
Gellius</hi> renders it, a place to keep birds and beasts alive
for pleasure. <hi>Pollux</hi> sayes this word was Persian by its original;
yet because by traduction it became Hebrew, we may best learn
the meaning of it from the Jews who used it most often, and
whose sense we better understand. Their meaning therefore
was this; that as <hi>Paradise</hi> or the <hi>Garden of Eden</hi> was a place of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35133:9"/>
great beauty, pleasure and tranquillity; so the state of separate
souls was a state of peace and excellent delights. So <hi>Philo,</hi> alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorically
does expound Paradise. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. For the trees that grow in Paradise are not like ours, but
they bring forth knowledge and life, and immortality. It is
therefore more then probable, that when the converted thief
heard our Blessed Saviour speak of <hi>Paradise</hi> or <hi>Gan Eden,</hi> he
who was a Jew and heard that on that day he should be there,
understood the meaning to be that he should be there where all
the good Jews did believe the souls of <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> to
be placed. As if Christ had said; Though you only ask to be
remembred when I come into my Kingdome, not only that shall
be performed in time, but even to day thou shalt have great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment;
and this the Hellenist Jews called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the rest of Paradise, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the comfort of
Paradise, the word being also warranted from that concerning
<hi>Lazarus</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>He is comforted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this we learn more perfectly from the raptures of S. <hi>Paul.
He knew a man</hi> (meaning himself) <hi>rapt up into the third heaven. And
I knew such a man how that he was caught up into Paradise. [2 Cor.</hi> 2. 3.]
The raptures &amp; visions were distinct; for S. <hi>Paul</hi> being a Jew and
speaking after the manner of his Nation makes <hi>Paradise</hi> a distinct
thing from <hi>the third Heaven.</hi> For the Jews deny any <hi>orbes</hi> to be
in Heaven; but they make <hi>three regions</hi> only; the one of <hi>clouds,</hi>
the second of <hi>starrs,</hi> and the third of <hi>Angels.</hi> To this third or
supreme Heaven was S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrapt; but he was also born to
Paradise; to another place, distinct and separate by time and
station. For by <hi>Paradise,</hi> his Countreymen never understood
the <hi>Third Heaven;</hi> but there also it was that he heard <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> unspeakable words, great glorifications of God, huge
excellencies, such which he might not, or could not utter here
below. The effect of these considerations is this, that although
the Saints are not yet admitted to the blessings consequent to a
happy resurrection, yet they have the intermedial entertainments
of a present and a great joy.</p>

               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:35133:10"/>To this purpose are those words to be understood. [<hi>To him
that overcomes will I give to eate of the tree of life which is in the midst
of the</hi> Paradise <hi>of God: [Revel.</hi> 2. 7.] that is, if I may have
leave to expound these words to mean what the Jews did about
that time understand by such words; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the
<hi>Tree of life</hi> does signifie the principle of peace and holiness, of
wisdome and comforts for ever. <hi>Philo</hi> expounding it calls it
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
The worship of God, the greatest of all vertues by which the
soul is made to live for ever; as if by eating of this tree of life in
the Paradise of God they did mean, that they who die well,
shall immediately be feasted with the deliciousness of a holy
Conscience: which the spirit of God expresses by saying <hi>They
shall walke up and down in white garments and their works shall follow
them;</hi> their tree of life shall germinate; they shall then feel
the comforts of having done good works; a sweet remembrance
and a holy peace shall caresse and feast them; and there they
shall <hi>walk up and down in white, [Revel.</hi> 3. 4, 5. &amp; 14. 13.] that
is, as candidates of the resurrection to immortality.</p>
            <p>And this allegory of the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> and <hi>Paradise</hi> was so
heartily pursued by the Jews to represent the state of separation,
that the <hi>Essens</hi> describe that state by the circumstances and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of a blessed garden. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a region that is not troubled with
clouds or shours, or storms, or blasts, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but a place which is perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
refreshed with delicious breaths. This was it which the
Heathens did dream concerning the Elysian fields: for all the
notices <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> concerning the regions of separate souls came
into Greece from the Barbarians (sayes <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi>) and
<hi>Tertullian</hi> observes; although we call that Paradise which is a
place appointed to receive the souls of the Saints, and that this
is separated from the notices of the world by a wall of fire, a
portion of the torrid zone (which he supposes to be meant by the
flaming sword of the Angel placed at the gates of Paradise) yet
(sayes he) the Elysian fields have already possessed the faith and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35133:10"/>
opinions of men. All comes from the same fountain; the
doctrine of the old Synagogue confirmed by the words of Christ
and the commentaries of the Apostles; viz. that after death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the day of judgment there is a Paradise for Gods servants, a
region of rest, of comfort and holy expectations. And therefore
it is remarkable that these words of the Psalmist, <hi>Nerapias me
in medio dierum meorum. [Psal.</hi> 102. v. 25.] Snatch me not away
in the midst of my dayes, in the Hebrew it is, <hi>Ne facias me ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,</hi>
Make me not to ascend or to goe upwards, meaning, to
the supernatural regions of separate souls, who after death are
in their beginnings of exaltation. For to them that die in the
Lord, death is a preferment; it is a part of their great good
fortune; for death hath not only lost the sting; but it brings a
coronet in his hand which shall invest and adorne the heads of
Saints till that day comes in which the Crown of righteousness
shall be brought forth to give them the investiture of an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Kingdome.</p>
            <l>But that I may make up this proposition usefull and clear,</l>
            <l>I am to adde some things by way of supplement.</l>
            <p>1. This place of separation was called <hi>Paradise</hi> by the Jews,
and by Christ, and after Christs ascension, by S. <hi>Iohn:</hi> because
it signifies a place of pleasure and rest; and therefore by the
same analogy the word may be still used in all the periods of the
world, though the circumstances, or though the state of things be
changed. It is generally supposed that this had a proper Name,
and in the Old Testament was called <hi>Abrahams bosome;</hi> that is,
the region where <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> did dwell till the
comming of Christ. But I suppose my selfe to have great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to dissent from this common opinion; for this word of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams
bosome,</hi> being but once used in both the Testaments, and
then particularly applied to the person of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> must needs sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the eminence and priviledge of joy that <hi>Lazarus</hi> had; for
all that were in the blessed state of separation were not in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
bosome, but only the best and the most excellent persons;
but they were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> with <hi>Abraham;</hi> and the analogy
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35133:11"/>
of the phrase to the manner of the Jewish feastings, where the
best guest did lye in the bosome of the Master, that is, had the
best place, makes it most reasonable to believe that <hi>Abrahams</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
does not signifie the general state of separation, even of
the blessed; but the choicest place in that state, a greater degree
of blessedness. But because he is the father of the faithful, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>to be with Abraham,</hi> or to <hi>sit down with Abraham</hi> (in the time
of the old Testament) did signifie the same thing as to be in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise;
but to be <hi>in Abrahams bosome</hi> signifies a great eminence
of place and comfort, which is indulged to the most excellent
and the most afflicted.</p>
            <p>2. Although the state of separation may now also and is by
S. <hi>Iohn</hi> called <hi>Paradise;</hi> because the Allegory still holds perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as signifying comfort and holy pleasures; yet the spirits of
good men are not said <hi>to be with Abrahams</hi> but <hi>to be with Christ;</hi>
and as being with <hi>Abraham</hi> was the specification of the more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
word of <hi>Paradise</hi> in the old Testament; so <hi>being with Christ</hi>
is the specification of it in the New. So S. <hi>Stephen</hi> prayed, <hi>Lord
Iesus receive my spirit;</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>I desire to be dissolved
and to be with Christ:</hi> which expression S. <hi>Polycarp</hi> also used in his
Epistle to the <hi>Philippians</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> they are in the place that is due to them, they are
with the Lord, that is, in the hands, in the custody of the Lord
Jesus; as appears in the words of S. <hi>Steven</hi> and S. <hi>Paul.</hi> So
S. <hi>Ierome. Scimus Nepotianum nostrum esse cum Christo &amp; sanctorum
mixtum choris,</hi> we know that our <hi>Nepotian</hi> is with Christ, ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the quires of Saints. Upon this account (and it is not at
all unreasonable) the Church hath conjectur'd, that the state of
separate souls since the glorification of our Lord is much better'd
and advanc'd and their comforts greater: because as before
Christs coming the expectation of the Saints that slept, was fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the revelation of the Messias in his first coming; so now
it is upon his second coming unto judgment, and in his glory.
This improvement of their condition is well intimated by their
being said to be <hi>under the Altar,</hi> that is, under the protection of
Christ, under the powers and benefits of his Priesthood, by
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35133:11"/>
which he makes continuall intercession both for them and us.
This place some of the old Doctors understood too literally,
and from hence they believed that the souls of departed saints
were under their material Altars; which fancy produced that
fond decree of the Councel of <hi>Eliberis (Can.</hi> 3. 4.) [that wax
lights should not by day be burnt in coemeteries <hi>inquietandi enim
spiritus sanctorum non sunt</hi>] left the spirits of Saints should by
the light of the diurnal tapers be disquieted: This reason, though
it be trifling and impertinent, yet it declares their opinion, that
they supposed the souls to be neer their reliques which were
placed under the altars * But better then this, their state is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in these words [<hi>therefore they are before the
throne of God, and serve him night and day in his Temple, and he that
sits upon the throne shall dwell among them</hi>] with which general
words, as being modest bounds to our inquiries, enough to tell
us it is rarely well, but enough also to chastise all curious que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,
let us remain content, and labour with faith and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
with hope and charity to be made worthy to partake of
those comforts, after which when we have long inquired, when
at last we come to try what they are, we shall finde them much
better and much otherwise then we imagine.</p>
            <p>3. I am to admonish this also, that although our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
is in the Creed said <hi>to descend</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> into hell (so we render
it) yet this does not at all prejudice his other words [<hi>this day shalt
thou be with me in Paradise</hi>] for the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifies indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
the state of separation whether blessed or accursed; it
means only <hi>the invisible place,</hi> or the region of darkness whither
who so descends shall be no no more seen. For as among the
Heathens the <hi>Elysian fields</hi> and <hi>Tartara</hi> are both <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Jews and Christians <hi>Paradisus</hi> and <hi>Gehenna</hi> are the
distinct states of <hi>Hades. Of the first</hi> we have a plain testimony
in <hi>Diphilus.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</l>
               </q>
In <hi>Hades</hi> there are two wayes, one for just men, and another for
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:35133:12"/>
the impious. <hi>Of the second</hi> we have the testimony of <hi>Iosephus,</hi>
who speaking of the Sadduces, says, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>they take away or deny the rewards and punishments respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively
which are in Hades,</hi> or in the state of separation: so that if
Christs soul was in Paradise, he was in <hi>Hades.</hi> In vain therefore
does S. <hi>Augustine</hi> torment himself to tell, how Christ could be
in both places at once; when it is no harder then to tell how a
man may be in <hi>England</hi> and at <hi>London</hi> at the same time.</p>
            <p>4. It is observable that in the mentions of Paradise by S. <hi>Iohn,</hi>
he twice speaks of <hi>the tree of life,</hi> but never of <hi>the tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
of good and evil: because this was the Symbol of secular knowledge,
of prudence and skill of doing things of this world which
we can naturally use; we may smel and taste them, but not
feed upon them, that is, these are no part of our enjoyment,
and if we be given up to the study of such notices and be immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the things of this world, we cannot attend to the studies
of religion and of the Divine service. But these cares and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
divertisements shall cease when our souls are placed in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise:
there shall be no care taken for raising portions for our
children, nor to provide bread for our tables, no cunning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
to be safe from the crafty snares of an enemy, no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement
at losses, no fear of slanderings, or of the gripes of
Publicans, but we shall feed on the tree of life, love of God,
and longings for the comming of Christ. We are then all spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and our imployment shall be symbolical, that is, spiritual,
and holy, and pleasant.</p>
            <p>I have now made it as evident as questions of this Nature will
bear, that in the state of separation the spirits of good men shall
be blessed and happy souls: they have an antepast or taste of
their reward: but their great reward it self, their crown of
righteousness shall not be yet; that shall not be, until the day
of judgement: and this was the third proposition I undertook to
prove; the consummation and perfection of the Saints felicity
shall be at the resurrection of the dead.</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>at his coming;</hi> so S. <hi>Iohn</hi> expresses the time,
<hi>that we may not then be ashamed. For now we are the sons of Gods, but
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35133:12"/>
it does not yet appear what we shall be. But we know that when he shall
appear we shall be like unto him and see him as he is. [1 Iohn 2. 28.
1 Iohn</hi> 3. 4.] At his glorious appearing, we also shall appear
glorious; we shall see him as he is; but till then, this beatific
vision shall not be at all; but for the interval, the case is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
<hi>Tertullian</hi> affirms <hi>puniri et foveri animam interim in inferis
sub expectatione utriusque judicii, in quadam usurpatione et candida
ejus; [lib. de anima, e. lib. adv. Marcion.</hi>] the souls are punished
or refreshed in their regions expecting the day of their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and several sentences: <hi>habitacula illa, animarum promptuaria
nominavit scriptura</hi> (saith S. <hi>Ambrose,) [de bono mortis cap.</hi> 10.]
The Scripture calls these habitations, the promptuaries, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positories
of souls. There is comfort, but not the full reward;
a certain expectation supported with excellent intervals of joy:
<hi>Refrigerium,</hi> so the Latins call it, a refreshment. <hi>Donec con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summatio
rerum resurrectionem omnium plenitudine mercedis expungat
tune apparitura coelesti promissione,</hi> saith <hi>Tertullian,</hi> until the
consummation of all things points out the resurrection, by the
fulness of reward and the appearing of the heavenly promise.
So the Author of the questions <hi>ad Orthodoxos [quaest.</hi> 75.] <q>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after death, presently there is a separation of the
just from the unjust;</q> for they are born by Angels <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> kept unto the day of resurrection and retribution.
But what do they in the mean time? How is it with them?
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, sayes <hi>Nazianzen.
[orat. funebr. Caesar. fratris.</hi>] They rejoyce and are delighted in
a wonderful joy. <hi>They see Angels and Archangels, they converse
with them, and see our B. Saviour Iesus in his glorified humanity; so Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin
Martyr. [ubi suprà</hi>] But in these great joys they look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greater.
They are now <hi>In Paradiso;</hi> but they long that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and soul may be in heaven together; but this is the glory of
the day of judgement, the fruit of the resurrection. And this
whole affair is agreeable to reason, &amp; the analogy of the whole
dispensation as it is generally and particularly described in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:35133:13"/>For when the greatest effect of the Divine power, the mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
promise, the hardest thing to Christan faith, that impossible
thing to Gentile Philosophy, the expectation of the whole
world, the New Creation, when that shall come to pass, viz.
that the souls shall be reinvested with their bodies, when the
ashes of dissolved bones shall stand up a new and living frame,
to suppose that then there shall be nothing done in order to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
but to publish the salvation of Saints of which they were
possessed before, is to make a great solemnity for nothing, to do
great things for no great end, and therefore it is not reasonable
to suppose it.</p>
            <p>For if it were a good argument of the Apostle, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarks
and Saints of the old Testament received not the promises
signified by Canaan and the land of promise, because <hi>God had
provided some better thing for us, that without us they should not be
made perfect;</hi> it must also conclude of all alike; that they who
died since Christ must stay till the last day, that they and we
and all may be made perfect together. And this very thing was
told to the spirits of the Martyrs who under the Altar cried <hi>How
long O Lord</hi> &amp;c. [<hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 10.] that they should <hi>rest yet for a little
season,</hi> untill their fellow servants also shall be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>Upon this account it is that the day of judgment is a day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence:
So said our Blessed Lord himself [<hi>Thou shalt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compensed
at the resurrection of the just] (Luke</hi> 14. 14.) and this is the
day in which all things shall be restored: for [the Heavens must
receive Jesus till the time of restitution of all things] [<hi>Acts</hi> 3. 7.]
and till then the reward <hi>is said to be laid up.</hi> So S. <hi>Paul. Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Iudge shall give me in that day:</hi> and that you may know he
means the resurrection and the day of judgment; he addes [<hi>and
not to me only, but to all them that love his coming: 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 8.]
of whom it is certain many shall be alive at that day; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cannot before that day receive the crown of righteousness:
and then also, and not till then, shall be his appearing; but till
then it is a <hi>depositum.</hi> The summe is this. In the world we
walk and live by faith: In the state of separation we live by
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:35133:13"/>
hope: and in the resurrection we shall live by an eternal chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Here we see God as in a glass darkly: In the separation we
shall behold him; but it is afar off: and after the resurrection
we shall see him face to face, in the everlasting comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of an intuitive beatitude. In this life we are warriors:
In the separation we are conquerors: but we shall not triumph
till after the resurrection.</p>
            <p>And in proportion to this is also the state of Devils and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
spirits. <hi>Art thou come to torment us before the time,</hi> said the Devils
to our B. Saviour; there is for them also an appointed time;
and when that is, we learn from S. <hi>Iud.</hi> 6. They are reserved
in chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.
Well therefore did S. <hi>Iames</hi> affirme, <hi>That the Devils believe and
tremble;</hi> and so do the damned souls, with an insupportable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement
fearing the revelation of that day. They know that
day will come, and they know they shall finde an intolerable
sentence on that day; and they fear infinitely, and are in amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and confusion, feeling the worme of conscience, and are
in the state of Devils who fear God and hate him; they tremble
but they love him not; and yet they die because they would not
love him; because they would not with all their powers and
strengths keep his Commandments.</p>
            <p>This doctrine though of late it hath been laid aside upon the
interest of the Church of Rome and for compliance with some
other Schools, yet was it universally the doctrine of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church; as appears out of <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> who in his dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues
with <hi>Tryphon</hi> reckons this amongst the <gap reason="foreign">

be a reward of works? because to the thief Paradise was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>that day.</hi>

But in Paradise the soul hath an intellectual perception
both of her self and of those things which were under her.</p>
            <p>Concerning which I shall not need to heap up testimonies;
this only: It is the doctrine of the Greek Church unto this day,
and was the opinion of the greatest part of the Antient Church
both Latine and Greek; and by degrees was in the West eaten
out by the doctrine of Purgatory and invocation of Saints; and
rejected a little above two hundred years agoe in the Councel of
<hi>Florence;</hi> and since that time it hath been more generally taught
that the souls of good men enjoy the beatific vision before the
resurrection; even presently upon the dissolution. According
to which new opinion it will be impossible to understand the
meaning of my text, and of diverse other places of Scripture
which I have now alledged and explicated; or at all to perceive
the Oeconomy and dispensation of the day of judgment; or
how it can be a day of discerning; or how the reapers, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
shall bind up the wicked in bundles and throw them into
the unquenchable fire; or yet how it can be useful or necessary or
prudent for Christ to give a solemn sentence upon all the world;
or how it can be that that day should be so formidable and full
of terrors, when nothing can affright those that have long enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the beatific presence of God; and no thunders or earthquakes
can affright them who have upon them the biggest evil in the
world, I mean, the damned who according to this opinion have
been in hell for many ages: and it can mean nothing but to them
that are alive; and then it is but a particular, not an universal
judgment; and after all, it can pretend to no piety, to no Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
to no reason; and only can serve the ends of the Church
of Rome; who can no way better be consuted in their invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Saints then by this truth, that the Saints do not yet enjoy
the beatific vision; and though they are in a state of ease and
comfort, yet are they not in a state of power and glory, and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
till the day of judgment.</p>
            <p>This also perfectly does overthrow the doctrine of Purgatory.
For as the saints departed are not perfect, and therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:35133:14"/>
not to be invocated not to be made our Patrons and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates:
so neither are they in such a condition as to be in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and it is impossible that any wise man should believe,
that the souls of good men after death should endure the sharp
pains of hell, and yet at the same time believe those words of
Scripture, <hi>Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord; from henceforth;
yea saith the spirit that they may rest from their labours, and their
works doe follow them. (Rev.</hi> 24. 13.) If they can rest in beds of
fire, and sing hymns of glory in the torments of the damned; if
their labours are done when their pains are almost infinite, then
these words of the spirit of God, and that doctrine of Purgatory
can be reconciled; else, never to eternal ages. But it is certain,
they are words that cannot deceive us, <hi>Non tanget eos tormentum
mortis:</hi> Torment in death shall never touch them.</p>
            <p>But having established the proposition and the intended sense
of the text, let us a while consider,</p>
            <p>1. That God is our God when we die, if we be his servants
while we live; and <hi>to be our God</hi> signifies very much good to us.
He will rescue us from the powers of hell; the Devil shall have
no part nor portion in us; we shall be kept in safe custody, we
shall be in the hands of Christ, out of which all the powers of
hell shall never snatch us, and therefore we may die with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
if we die with a good conscience: we have no cause of
fear, if we have just grounds to hope for pardon. The Turks
have a saying, that the Christians doe not believe themselves
when they talk such glorious things of Heaven and the state of
separation: for if they did, they would not be so afraid to die;
but they do not so well consider that Christians believe all this
well enough, but they believe better then they live; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they believe and tremble, because they do not live after the
rate of going to heaven: they knew that for good men glorious
things are prepared; but <hi>Tophet is prepared for evil Kings,</hi> and
unjust Rulers; for vitious men, and degenerate Christians:
there is a hell for accursed souls; and men live without fear
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:35133:15"/>
of it so long, till their fear as soon as it begins, in an instant
passes into despair and the fearful groans of the damned. It is
no wonder to see men so unwilling to die; to be impatient of
the thought of death; to be afraid to make their will, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with the solemn scarcrow: He that is fit to die must have
long dwelt with it, must handle it on all sides, must feel whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the sting be taken out; he must examine <hi>whether he be in
Christ,</hi> that is, whether <hi>he be a new creature.</hi> And indeed I do
not so much wonder that any man fears to die, as when I see a
careless and a wicked person descend to his grave with as much
indifferency as he goes to sleep, that is, with no other trouble
then that he leaves the world; but he does not fear to die; and
yet upon the instant of his dissolution he goes into the common
receptacle of souls where nothing can be addressed to him but
the consequence of what he brings along with him, and he shall
presently know whether he shall be saved or damned.</p>
            <p>We have read of some men who by reading or hearing
strange opinions have entred into desperate melancholy, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
who have perfectly despaired of the Divine mercy; who
feeling such horrid convulsions in their souls, such fearful expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations
of an Eternal curse that not finding themselves able to
bear so intolerable a fear have hang'd or drown'd themselves;
and yet they only thought so or feared it; and might have alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it if they would have hoped and prayed: but then let it be
considered; when the soul is stripp'd of the cloud her body,
when she is entred into strange regions and converses only with
spirits, and sees plainly all that is within her, when all her sins
appeare in their own natural ugliness and set out by their aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating
circumstances; then she remembers her filthy pleasures
and hates them infinitely as being such things to which she then
can have no appetite: when she perceives she shall perish for
that which is not, for that whose remembrance is intolerable;
when she sees many new secrets which she understood not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and hath stranger apprehensrons of the wrath of God then
ever could be represented in this life; when she hath the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of a spirit, and an understanding pure enough to see essences
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:35133:15"/>
and rightly to weigh all the degrees of things; when (possibly)
she is often affrighted with the alarums and conjectures of the
day of judgement; or if she be not, yet certainly knows, not
only by faith and fear, but by a clear light and proper know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that it shall certainly come, and its effects shall remain
for ever, then she hath time enough to bewail her own folly
and remediless infelicity; if we could now think seriously that
things must come to that pass, and place our selves by holy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
in the circumstances of that condition, and consider
what we should then think, how miserably deplore our folly,
how comfortless remember our ill gotten wealth; with how
much asperity and deep sighing we should call to mind our
foolish pride, our trifling swearing, our beastly drinkings, our
unreasonable and brutish lusts, it could not be but we must
grow wiser on a sudden, despise the world, betake our selves
to a strict religion, reject all vanity of spirit, and <hi>be sober and
watch unto prayer.</hi> *If any of us had but a strange dream, and
should in the fears of the night but suppose our selves in Hell,
and be affrighted with those circumstances of damnation which
we can tell of, and use in our imperfect notices of things, it
would effect strange changes upon a ductile and malleable spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
A frequent, severe meditation can do more then a seldome
and a phantastic dream; but an active faith can do more then
all the arts and contingencies of fancy or discourse.</p>
            <p>Now it is well with us, and we may yet secure it shall be
well with us for ever: but with in an hour it may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
with any of us all, who do not instantly take courses of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.
But he that does not, would in such a change soon
come to wish that he might exchange his state with the meanest,
with the miserablest of all mankind; with gallislaves and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
with men condemned to tortures for a good conscience.

Thou must leave thy rich land, and thy well built house, and
thy pleasing wife, and of all the trees of thy Orchard or thy
wood, nothing shall attend thee to thy grave, but oak for thy
Coffin, and Cypress for thy funeral: It shall not then be inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
how long thou hast liv'd but how well! None below will
be concerned whither thou wert rich or poor; but all the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of light and darkness shall be busie in the scrutiny of thy life;
for the good Angels would fain carry thy soul to Christ, and if
they do the Devils will follow and accuse thee there; and when
thou appearest before the righteous judge, what will become
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35133:16"/>
of thee unless Christ be thy advocate and God be merciful and
appeased, and the Angels be thy guards and a holy conscience
be thy comfort. There will to every one of us come a time
when we shall with great passion and great interest inquire,
how have I spent my days, how have I laid out my money,
how have I imployed my time, how have I served God, and
how repented me of my sins: and upon our answers to these
questions depends a happy or an unhappy Eternitie: and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
is he who concerning these things takes care in time; and of
this care I may with much confidence and comfort propound
to you the example of this good man whose reliques lie before
you: Sir <hi>George Dalston,</hi> of <hi>Dalston</hi> in <hi>Cumberland;</hi> a worthy
man, belov'd of his Country, useful to his friends, friendly to
all men, careful of his religion, and a true servant of God.</p>
            <p>He was descended of an Antient and a worthy house in <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland;</hi>
and he adorned his family and extraction with a more
worthy comportment; for to be of a worthy family and to
bring to it no stock of our proper vertue is to be upbraided by
our family; and a worthy Father can be no honour to his Son,
when it shall be said; behold the difference; this crab descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from a goodly apple-tree; but he who beautifies the eschut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon
of his Ancestors by worthy atchievements, by learning or by
wisdome, by valour and by great imployments, by a holy life
and an useful converlation; that man is the parent of his own
fame, and a new beginner of an Antient family: for as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
is a perpetual creation; so is the progression of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
in a line of worthy descendants, a dayly beginning of its
honour and a new stabiliment.</p>
            <p>He was bred in learning; in which <hi>Cambridge</hi> was his tiring
room, and the Court of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was his stage in
which he first represented the part of a hopeful young man: but
there he stayed not; his friends not being desirous that the levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of youth should be fermented by the liberties of a rich and
splendid Court, caused him to lie in the restraints and to grow
ripe in the sobrieties of a Country life and a married state: In
which as I am informed he behaved himself with so great wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35133:17"/>
thiness, and gave such probation of his love of justice, popular
regards of his Countries good, and abilities to serve them; that
for almost 40. years together his Country chose him for their
Knight to serve in all the intervening parliaments: <hi>Magistratus
indicatorium;</hi> imployment shews the man; he was a leading
man in Parliaments; prevailing there by the great reputation of
his justice and integrity; and yet he was not unpleasant and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at Court: for he had well understood that the true interest
of Courts and Parliaments were one; and that they are like the
humours of the body, if you increase one beyond its limit, that
destroys all the rest and it self at last; and when they look upon
themselves as enemies and that hot and cold must fight; the
prevailing part is abated in the conflict, and the vanquish'd part
is destroyed: but when they look upon themselves as varieties
serving the differing aspects and necessities of the same body,
they are for the allay of each others exorbitances and excesses,
and by keeping their own measures they preserve the man: this
the good man well understood; for so he comported himself
that he was loud in Parliaments and valued at Court: he was
respected in very many Parliaments; and was worthily regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the worthy Kings: which without an Orator commends a
man: <hi>Gravissimi principis judicium in minoribus etiam rebus conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui
pulchrum est;</hi> said <hi>Rliny.</hi> To be approved though but in les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
matters by the judgement of a wise Prince is a great orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the man. For as King <hi>Theodoric</hi> in <hi>Cassiodore</hi> said, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quen.
dignus est à quopiam redargui, qui nostro judicio meretur absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi:</hi>
No man ought to reprove him whom the King commends.</p>
            <p>But I need no artifices to represent him worthy; his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of probation were within in the magazines of a good
heart and represented themselves by worthy actions. For,
God was pleased to invest him with a marvailous sweet Nature;
which is certainly to be reckoned as one half of the grace of
God: because a good nature being the reliques and remains of
that ship wrack which <hi>Adam</hi> made, is the proper and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
disposition to holiness, as the corruption of <hi>Adam</hi> was to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
and peevish Councels. A good nature will not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:35133:17"/>
the more imperfect persons, will not deride the ignorant,
will not reproach the erring man: will not smite sinners on the
face, will not despise the penitent. A good Nature is apt to
forgive injuries, to pitty the miserable, to rescue the oppressed,
to make every ones condition as tolerable as he can: and so
would he. For as when good Nature is heightned by the grace
of God, that which was natural becomes now spiritual; so
these actions which proceeded from an excellent nature and
were pleasing and useful to men, when they derive from a new
principle of grace they become pleasant in the eyes of God: then
obedience to laws is duty to God; justice is righteousness, boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
becomes graciousness, and alms is charity.</p>
            <p>And indeed this is a grace in which this good man was very
remarkable, being very frequent and much in alms; tender
hearted to the poor; open handed to relieve their needs; the
bellies of the poor did bless him, he filled them with food and
gladness; and I have heard that he was so regular, so constant,
so free in this duty, that in these late unhappy wars being in a gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and neer the suffering some rude accidents, the beggars made
themselves his guard and rescued him from that trouble, who
had so often rescued them from hunger.</p>
            <p>He was of a meek and gentle spirit; but not too soft; he
knew how to do good, and how to put by an injury; but I have
heard it told by them that knew his life, that being by the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable
trouble of a great estate ingag'd in great suits at law,
he was never Plaintiffe, but always upon the defensive part;
and that he had reason on his side and justice for him, I need al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
no other testimony, but that the sentence of his Judges so
declared it.</p>
            <p>But that in which I propound this good man most imitable
was in his religion, for he was a great lover of the Church, a
constant attender to the Sermons of the Church; a diligent
hearer of the prayers of the Church, and and an obedient son to
perform the commands of the Church. He was diligent in his
times and circumstances of devotion; he would often be at
Church so early that he was seen to walk long in the Churh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:35133:18"/>
before prayers; being as ready to confess his sins at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
as to receive the blessing at the end of prayers. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he was so great a lover of Sermons, that though he knew
how to value that which was the best, yet he was patient of
that which was not so; and if he could not learn any thing to
improve his faith, yet he would finde something to exercise his
patience; and something for charity; yet this his great love of
Sermons could not tempt him to a willingness of neglecting the
prayers of the Church; of which he was a great lover to his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
day. <hi>Oves meae exaudiunt vocem meam</hi> (says Christ) my
sheep hear my voice; and so the Church says: my sheep hear
my voice, they love my words, they pray in my forms, they
observe my orders, they delight in my offices, they revere my
Ministers, and obey my constitutions: and so did he; loving to
have his soul recommended to God, and his needs represented,
and his sins confessed, and his pardon implored in the words
of his Mother in the voice and accent of her that nurs'd him up
to a spiritual life, to be a man in Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p>He was indeed a great lover and had a great regard for Gods
Ministers, ever remembring the words of God, keep my rest,
and reverence my Priests, he honoured the calling in all; but
he loved and revered the persons of such who were conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
keepers of their <hi>depositum,</hi> that trust which was committed
to them; such which did not for interest quit their conscience,
and did not to preserve some parts of their revenue, quit some
portions of their religion, He knew that what was true in
1639. was also true in 1644. and so to 57. and shall continue
true to eternal ages: and they that change their perswasions by
force or interest did neither believe well nor ill upon competent
and just grounds; they are not just, though they happen on the
right side. Hope of gain did by chance teach them well; and
fear of loss abuses them directly. He pitied the persecuted,
and never would take part with persecutors, he prayed for his
Prince and serv'd him in what he could: he loved God, and
lov'd the Church; he was a lover of his Countries liberties, and
yet an observer of the laws of his King.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:35133:18"/>Thus he behaved himself to all his superior relatives; to his
equals and descendants he was also just, and kinde and loving.
He was an excellent friend, laying out his own interest to serve
theirs; sparing not himself that he might serve them; as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
society to be the advantage of mans nature; and friendship
the ornament of society, and usefulness the ornament of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:
and in this he was known to be very worthy. He was
tender and carefull of his children, and so provident and wife,
so loving and obliging to his whole family, that he justly had
that love and regard, that duty and observance from them,
which his kindness and his care had merited. He was a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and carefull conductor of his estate; but farre from cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness;
as appeared toward the evening of his life; in which
that vice does usually prevail amongst old men, who are more
greedy when they have least need and, and load their sumpters
so much the more, by how much neerer they are to their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
end: but he made a demonstration of the contrary; for
he washed his hands and heart of the world, gave up his estate
long before his death or sickness to be managed by his only son
whom he left since, but then first made and saw him his heir;
he emptied his hands of secular imployment; medled not with
money but for the uses of the poor, for piety, for justice and
religion.</p>
            <p>And now having devested himself of all objections and in his
conversation with the world, quitting his affections to it, he
wholly gave himself to religion and devotion: He waken'd early
and would presently be entertained with reading; when he rose,
still he would be read to and hear some of the Psalms of <hi>David:</hi>
and excepting only what time he took for the necessities of his
life and health, all the rest he gave to prayer, reading, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
save only that he did not neglect, or rudely entertain the
visits and kinde offices of his neighbours.</p>
            <p>But in this great vacation from the world; he espied his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages;
he knew well according to that saying of the Emperor
<hi>Charles 5. oportet inter vitae negotia &amp; diem mortis spatium aliquod
intercedere; there ought to be a valley between two such mountains,</hi> the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35133:19"/>
businesses of our life and the troubles of our death; and he
stayed not till the noise of the bridegrooms coming did awaken
and affright him; but by daily prayers twice a day constantly
with his family, besides the piety and devotion of his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements,
by a monethly communion, by weekly Sermons and
by the religion of every day he stood in precincts, ready with
oyle in his lamp watching till his Lord should call.</p>
            <p>And indeed when he was hearing what God did speak to him
of duty, he also received his summons to give his account. For
he was so pertinacious an attendant to Gods holy word and the
services of the Church, that though he found himself sick, he
would not off, but stay till the solemnity was done; but it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God at Church to give him his first arrest, and since that
time I have often visited him; and found him alwayes doing his
work with the greatest evennes and indifferency of spirit as to the
event of life and death that I have observed in any. He was not
unwilling to live; but if he should, he resolved to spend his
life wholly in the service of God; but yet neither was he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to die; because he then knew he should weep no more,
and he should sin no more. He was very confident, but yet
with great humility and great modesty, of the pardon of his
sins; he had indeed lived without scandal, but he knew he had
not lived without error; but as God had assisted him to avoid
the reproach of great crimes, so he doubted not but he should
finde pardon for the less: and indeed I could not but observe
that he had in all the time of his sickness a very quiet conscience;
which is to me an excellent demonstration of the state of his life,
and of his state of grace and pardon. For though he seemed to
have a conscience tender and nice if any evil thing had touched
it, yet I could not but apprehend that his peace was a just peace,
the mercy of God, and the price and effect of the bloud of
Jesus.</p>
            <p>He was so joyfull, so thankfull, so pleased in the Ministeries
of the Church, that it gave in evidence where his soul was most
delighted, what it did apprehend the quickest, where it did use
to dwell, and what it did most passionately love. He discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:35133:19"/>
much of the mercies of God to him, repeated the blessings
of his life, the accidents and instruments of his trouble, he loved
the cause of his trouble and pardoned them that neither loved it
nor him.</p>
            <p>When he had spent great portions of his time of sickness in
the service of God and in expectation of the sentence of his life
or death, at last he understood the still voice of God, and that
he was to goe where his soul loved to be; he still increased his
devotion; and being admonished as his strength failed him, to
supply his usual forms, and his want of strength and words, by
short exercise of vertues, of faith and patience and the love of
God; he did it so willingly, so well, so readily, making his
eyes, his hands, and his tongue as long as he could the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of his minde, that as long as he was alive we would see what
his soul was doing. He doubted not of the truth of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
nor of the goodness of God, nor the satisfaction of Christ,
and the merits of his death, nor the fruit of his resurrection, nor
the prevalency of his intercession, nor yet doubted of his own
part in them, but expected his portion in the regions of blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with those who loved God and served him heartily and
faithfully in their generations.</p>
            <p>He had so great a patience in his sickness and was so afraid lest
he should sin at last; that his piety out-did his nature, and
though the body cannot feel but by the soul, yet his soul seemed
so little concerned in the passions of the body, that I neither ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
nor heard of him that he in all his sickness so much as
complained with any semblance of impatience.</p>
            <p>He so continued to pray, so delighted in hearing Psalms
sung, which I wish were made as fit to sing by their
numbers, as they are by their weight, that so very
much of his time was spent in them, that it was very likely
when his Lord came, he would finde him so doing, and he did
so; for in the midst of prayers he went away, and got to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as soon as they; and saw them (as we hope) presented to
the throne of grace; he went along with them himself, and
was his own messenger to heaven; where although he possibly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35133:20"/>
might prevent his last prayers, yet he would not prevent Gods
early mercy; which as we humbly hope, gave him pardon for
his sins, ease of his pain, joy after his sorrow, certainty for his
fears, heaven for earth, innocence and impeccability instead of
his infirmity.

Faith and justice, modesty and pure righteousness, made him
equal to the worthiest examples he was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a good
man, loving and humble, meek and patient, he would be sure
to be the last in contention, and the first at a peace; he would
injure no man, but yet if any man was displeased with him, he
would speak first and offer words of kindness; If any did dispute
concerning priority, he knew how to get it even by yeelding and
compliance; walking profitably with his neighbours and
humbly with his God, and having lived a life of piety, he
died in a full age, an honourable old age, in the midst of his
friends, and in the midst of prayer. And although the
events of the other world are hidden to us below that we might
live in faith, and walke in hope and die in charity, yet we have
great reason to bless God for his mercies to this our Brother, and
endeavour to comport our selves with a strict religion, and a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
repentance, with an exemplar patience &amp; an exemplar piety,
with the structures of a holy life, and the solemnities of a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
death, that we also may, as our consident and humble hope
is this our Brother doth by the conduct of Angels pass into the
hands and bosome of Jesus, there to expect the most mercifull
sentence of the right hand, <hi>Come ye blessed Children of my Father, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Kingdome prepared for you from the beginning of the world.</hi>

            <p>Grant this Eternal God for Iesus Christ his sake; to whom with thee O
Father, and the Holy Spirit, be all glory and honour, service and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,

Angels, and all men, and all the creatures this day, henceforth and for
evermore.</p>
