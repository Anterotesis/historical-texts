         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

reſtauration of the Liberty of
the <hi>Republique</hi> of the Vnited
<hi>Provinces</hi> of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi>
The High and Mighty Lords, our Lords,
the <hi>States</hi> Generall, their chiefeſt wiſhes
and deſires have ever beene to ſee, that the
Kings of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
might be perpetually maintained,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50157:3"/>
and preſerved in a good concord, Peace
and Vnion, by which nothing could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
them but all ſafety, and advantage, and
that for three principall reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that theſe Kingdomes, being the
greateſt &amp; the ſtrongeſt Body, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received and maintained the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the true Chriſtian Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and concerving it ſelfe ſo well, it
might alſo contribute much, yea by Fame
and reputation it ſelfe, to the conſervation
of States, Confederates and Friends, and
of all the other Proteſtant Churches, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
and ſpread through whole <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that theſe Kingdomes, by
their ſituation, commodities, traffique,
and Navigation, and their <hi>Republique,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo nearely combined by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Intereſt of State, and Religion, our
Lords might reſt aſſured, that the Intereſt
of the King, and theſe Kingdomes, being
ſo mightily advanced, and conſerved by
the ſame meanes, thoſe of the <hi>Netherlands</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:50157:3"/>
could not be but well conſerved.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, that this inteſtiue Peace,
Vnion and Concord, (which Proſperity
and Weale ordinarily accompanieth) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
here, that not onely the Kings and
Kingdomes ſhould be able to maintaine,
and preſerve themſelves; but that the
<hi>States</hi> Confederate, and Friends, or the
good Cauſe of the Proteſtant Religion, in
other parts unjuſtly ſuffering; (as formerly
it hath beene, and yet this day is too
much perceived) they might ever find their
refuge &amp; azile, their Succours &amp; their ayd
againſt all thoſe, who on the contrary
part of other States and Churches, ſhould
undertake to undermine the true Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the happineſſe of theſe flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>For your ſituation being well conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
you are in your ſelves as a World a
part, ſeparated from many inconveniences
of the other.</p>
            <p>You have your Commodities at home,
not onely which are neceſſary, and for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50157:4"/>
your pleaſure and delight, but alſo in ſuch
plenty that you are able to communicate
them to other Nations your Neighbours.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sea</hi> doth ſerve you for a ditch and
Bulwarke, and your Power by Sea is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to maintaine you in your filicity, and
to exempt and free you from all forraigne
injuries.</p>
            <p>So that the good of your owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
and the cauſe of your evill and
ruine, could not be ſuſcitated, nor found
elſewhere but at home, and within your
ſelves.</p>
            <p>And certainely the Kings and Queenes
formerly have done notable aſiſtances for
the maintenance and conſervation of the
true Religion, and of many States which
had need thereof, amongſt which Our
LORDS doe profeſſe themſelves as much
obliged and bound, as any other.</p>
            <p>And the King and theſe Kingdomes
ſhall yet in time be able to doe the like aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
as well for the preſent, (now
there is ſo great a neceſſity) as for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50157:4"/>
provided you conſerve your ſelves
in that Concord and Vnion, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
hath made, and ſhall ever make you
mighty and redoubted.</p>
            <p>From hence it is, that the common
Enemies of the Peace of Chriſtendome,
and their Agents, who (long ſince) have
framed and forged the Deſigne of an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
Monarchy of whole <hi>Europe,</hi> yea
of the whole World, ſeeing and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
with an envious and malicious eye
your former happineſſe, your flouriſhing
State, and your power, and that there was
nothing ſo contrary and dreadfull to
their vaſt conceptions, as your oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
            <p>To hurt and weaken, yea to ruine you,
if they had beene able, they have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
uſed all violence, and the ſtrength
of great Fleets and Armies, but in vaine
and without ſucceſſe.</p>
            <p>They have at laſt not beene able to act
a better play, then that which is moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
to them, and which often hath
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50157:5"/>
helpt them, to the ruine of many great
States, which have not bin ſo circumſpect
and prudent as you are:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Right Honourable,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſo, that quitting violence in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
peace, which they have with you,
and during the time of the ſame, they
have ſowne amongſt you the ſeedes and
weedes of Diſcord and diſſention, as
well in politique as Church buſineſſes,
and ſhall ever foment them: whence
they could aſſure themſelves of a certaine
profit, what end ſoever the ſaid diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
might take.</p>
            <p>And by theſe means and their accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
craft, they have propoſed to obtain
by inteſtine troubles, you ſhould weaken
your ſelves, and making you leſſe mighty,
and leſſe dreadfull, and no wayes conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
you might ſerve at laſt, (which God
avert) to the inglutting of their inſatiable
ambition, to the deſtruction of the true
Religion, and of all that which may be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50157:5"/>
deare and recommendable to you.</p>
            <p>As VVe ſee already brought to paſſe in
Ireland where the cruelties, murthers,
horrible and unheard of ſlaughters have
been perpetrated, with effuſion of ſo
much innocent bloud, to the totall deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the true Proteſtant religion there,
and to the great danger of the State it
ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Our Lords ſeeing theſe miſ-underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
troubles, and miſeries here already
growne to ſo great an extreamity: and
being ſo highly intereſsed in your well
being, have eſteemed fit and timely to
ſend Vs their Ambaſsadors to this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
to offer to the King and to his
Parliament Our Service and mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>To help (if acceptale) to remove and
take away the jealouſies which are and
might be, and to compoſe the diſsentions
by the milde wayes for an amiable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
            <p>And our ſaid Lords declare, that they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50157:6"/>
have not been moved hereunto by any
preſumption, or to intrude themſelves in
the buſines of a great King, and of theſe
mighty Kingdomes: But onely to acquit
themſelves of the Office and Duty of a
good friend, and alſo to acknowledge in
this occaſion the grat obligation which
the King, and theſe Kingdomes have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Republique.</p>
            <p>Our Lords further doe perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
that no other State in the world,
but theirs ſhall be found more fit and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable,
(in then opinion) to interpoſe
it ſelfe in the meditation of an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
and re-union between his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
and his Parliament, and to whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition
more credit might bee given
without all ſuſption: For the honour,
greatneſſe and proſperity of the King and
theſe Kingdomes, is by reflection the ſame
for our Republique; and on the contrary
your evill is to Vs a very great affliction,
and a moſt ſenſible evill.</p>
            <p>From thence may be taken this firm aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50157:6"/>
that the ayme of our mediation
ſhall not be to recommend an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
and reconciliation feigned and
painted without, not prejudiciall, and not
aſſured within. But to procure a true re-union,
ſincere and perfect, founded upon
the Baſis of the true Religion and Iuſtice,
which ſhall re-eſtabliſh reſpectively
the good correſpondence, confidence,
love, and the reſpects between the King
and his Parliament, and between all the
good ſubjects of theſe great Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>The King hath ſo much approved of
the reaſons and proffers of our ſaid Lords,
that his Majeſty hath accepted on his part
Our Interpoſition, and hath conſented to
a Conference between Commiſsioners
to be ſent from both parties, (if you find
it good) and that you ſhall chuſe the place,
the time, and the number of the perſons
who ſhall be imployed in this action.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Right Honourable,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Wee come unto you by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50157:7"/>
of Our Superiours to make the
ſame proffer of mediation, and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
whether alſo it may bee agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and acceptable unto you.</p>
            <p>VVe have alwayes obſerved that your
good inclinations have been carryed to
peace, if you receive ſatisfaction to your
juſt and reaſonable demands.</p>
            <p>Your wiſedomes alſo may well judge,
that the wayes of Armes are no alwayes
the ſureſt, their ſucceſſes being very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
and which changeth face in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The good Cauſe which is propoſed,
doth not alwayes promiſe an aſſured and
certain ſucceſſe, for we are all men, and
God ſometimes permits the good Cauſe
to ſuffer for our ſins.</p>
            <p>All warre is an affliction and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, in which we are not to take
del<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ght, when we can be freed of it, upon
honeſt and ſure termes and conditions,
that the wrath of God be not longer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
againſt us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:50157:7"/>
It is to be conſidered alſo, if no reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
accommodation be found that the
deciſion of your differences by Armes is
not to be expected ſo ſoon; but rather on
the contrary, that it ſhall bee the cauſe
of perpetuating the warres in theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
becauſe the King ſhall ever live in
his Royall Poſterity, and the Parliament
never dyes to ſuſcitate always the former
evill ſucceſſes by new warres, which at
length ſhall cauſe the totall ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of State and Religion, onely to
the great advantage of the common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of our Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Right Honourable,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it pleaſe you to make uſe of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion,
unto which the King conſented
