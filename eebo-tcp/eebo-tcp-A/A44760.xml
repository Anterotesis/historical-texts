            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Truely, Sir, you should have had an account of matters hence more amply and frequently, but that of late it hath beene usuall, and allowed by authority, to intercept and breake open any letters; but private men need not complaine so much, since the dispatches of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors, whose packets should be held as sacred as their persons, have beene commonly open'd, besides some outrages offered their houses and servants; nay, since their Majesties Letters under the cabine Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net have beene broke up, and other counterfeit ones printed and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in their names.</p>

               <p>Indeed I must confesse, the report hereof hath kept a great noyse abroad; and <hi>England</hi> hath suffered much in point of Nationall repute in this particular; for even among <hi>Barbarians</hi> it is held a kinde of sacriledge to open Letters; nay, it is held a baser kind of Burglary, than to breake into a House, Chamber, or Closet: for this is a plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of outward things only, but hee who breaks open ones Letters, which are the <hi>Idea's</hi> of the minde, may bee said to rip up his brest, to plunder and rifle his very braine, and rob him of his most precious and secretest thoughts.</p>

               <p>There is a saying, <hi>When your neighbours house is on fire, by its light you may see in what danger your owne stands.</hi> And was <hi>England</hi> so
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47342:4"/>
blinde, as not to take warning by so many fearful combustions abroad: When I took my leave last of her, I left her in such a compleat condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of happinesse, both in <hi>Court, Countrey, Citie</hi> and <hi>Sea,</hi> that she was the envie of all <hi>Europe,</hi> in so much, that that <hi>Golden</hi> Verse might be fitly applied to her <hi>then Golden</hi> times:
<q>Mollia securae peragebant otia Gentes.</q>
The <hi>Court</hi> was never so glorious, being hansell'd every yeer almost with a new Royall Off-spring; the <hi>Gentrie</hi> no where more gallant and sportfull; the <hi>Citizen</hi> never more gorgeous and rich, and so abounding with treasure, bullion and buildings, that no age can parallel; <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce</hi> inward and outward was never at that height; the <hi>Customes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing every yeer to admiration; the narrow <hi>Seas</hi> were never guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with braver Ships, nor the Navie Royall for number of Vessels and Magazines of all sorts of materials was ever so well replenished; the <hi>Universities</hi> had never such golden dayes; and lastly, the <hi>Church</hi> did so flourish, that amongst the rest of the Reformed Churches of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, I have heard her call'd the <hi>Church Triumphant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides, <hi>Ireland</hi> was arriv'd almost to the same degree of prosperitie, for all the Arrerages of the Crown were paid, and not a peny sent hence for many yeers to maintain the standing Armie there, or for any other publique charge, as formerly; <hi>Traffique</hi> came to that monstrous height, that in few yeeres the Crown-customes came to be five times higher. In fine, <hi>Ireland</hi> was brought not onely to subsist of her selfe, but inabled to contribute towards the filling of the <hi>English</hi> Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, and to make some retribution of those vast expences the Crown of <hi>England</hi> hath been at any time these 400 yeers, to reduce her to civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie; her bogs were almost all dri'd up, and made good land, her mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wals turn'd apace to Bricke in divers places; so that one Sommer that I fortun'd to be there, above 50. new Bricke-houses were built in one Town. But it hath been the fate of that Island to be oftentimes neer a condition of a setled happinesse, and yet to have some odde accident still intervene to crosse it.</p>
               <p>In conclusion, there wanted nothing to make <hi>England</hi> and her uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Crownes so exactly blessed, that she might have assumed the Title of one of the <hi>Fortunate Islands.</hi> Good Lord, how comes it to passe, that she is now fallen into such horrid distempers, and like a distracted bodie, laying hands upon her selfe, would thrust the sword of civill war into her own bowels? I beseech you, Sir, impart unto me the true
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47342:4"/>
cause of this change; for I know none so capable to do it as your selfe.</p>

               <p>First, Sir, in the generall you know, that it is with the Regions upon <hi>Earth,</hi> as it is with those of the <hi>Ayre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> sometimes we have a clear azur'd skie, with soft gentle ventilations, and a sweet serenitie throughout the whole Hemisphete; at other times we know the face of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens is overcast with frownes, with Frog vapours, and thicke cloudes of various shapes, which look like Monsters, hovering up and down, and break at last into thunder and fulgurations, and so disquiet and raise a kinde of war in the <hi>Aereal Common wealth.</hi> Just so in the Regions that are dispers'd up and down this earthly Globe, &amp; peopled with men (which are but a composition of the <hi>Elements)</hi> you have sometimes a gentle calme of peace and quietude, with a generall tranquillitie all the Countrey over; at other times you have ugly mishapen cloudes of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies, feares and discontentments do rise up, which break out at last into acts of disobedience, rebellion, and furie. And as those Aereall <hi>Meteors</hi> and <hi>Monsters</hi> above are ingendered of those watery fogges and mists which are drawn up out of fenny and rotten low grounds here upon earth; so in the <hi>Region of the minde,</hi> the ill vapours which ascend to the brain from rotten and impostumated hearts, from desperate and male-contented <hi>humorists</hi> are the causes of all civill commotions and distempers in State. But they have much to answer for in the world to come (though they escape it in this) who for any private interest or respect whatsoever, either of <hi>Promotion, Vain glorie, Revenge, Malice,</hi> or <hi>Envie,</hi> will embroyle and plunge their own native Countrey in any publike ingagement or civill war, by putting a partition-wall betwixt their soveraigne Prince and their fellow Subjects. Truly, in mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, these may be called the worst kinde of <hi>Betrayers</hi> of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: but I am too farre transported from satisfying your request in relating the true causes of these calamities: I will now fall to worke, and bring you to the very source of them.</p>
               <p>There is a packe of perverse People (composed for the most part of the scummy and simplest sort) multiplied in <hi>England,</hi> who by a kinde of naturall inclination, are opposite so point blanke to <hi>Monarchie</hi> in State, and <hi>Hierarchie</hi> in Church, that if they were in Heaven (whither 'tis to be feared they run a great hazard ever to enter, it being a Rule, that <hi>he who is rotten hearted to his King, can never be right hearted to his Greatour)</hi> I say, if these men were in Heaven, they would go near to 
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47342:5"/>
repine at the <hi>Monarchicall</hi> Power of God Almighty himselfe, and at the degrees of Angels, and the postures of holinesse in the Church Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant. They call every <hi>Crotchet</hi> of the brain, <hi>tendernesse of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi> which being well examined, is nothing else but a meer <hi>spirit of contradiction</hi> and disobedience (to all higher Powers) which posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them. There are no Constitutions either Ecclesiasticall or Civill can please them, but they could cast both into such a mould, which their crack'd braines would fain devise, yet are never able to bring to any perfection; they are ever labouring to bring Religion to the dock, to be new trimm'd, but they would take down her fore-caste, and scarce allow her the Kings Armes to adorn her; they are great listners after any Court newes, and pricke up their eares when any thing is spoken of King, Queen, or Privie Counsellour, and are alwayes ready though upon loose trust, to take up any report whereby they may whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper in Conventicles and corners, and so traduce the Government. These great <hi>Zealots</hi> use to look upon themselves most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly through multiplying glasses, which make them appear to be such huge <hi>Santons,</hi> that it renders them not onely uncharitable in their opinions of others, but Lucifcrian-like proud in their own conceit, insomuch that they seem to scorne all the world besides, believing that they are the onely Elect, whose soules worke according to the motion of the Spirit; that they are the Children of promise, <hi>whose faces alone look towards Heaven;</hi> they are more pleased with some new reach or fancie, (that may puzzle the <hi>pericranium)</hi> than a Frenchman is with some new fashion in cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; they are nearest to the nature of the Jew of any people upon earth, and will converse with him sooner than with some sort of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; and as in the Pharisaicall <hi>Disposition</hi> they symbolise with the <hi>Jew,</hi> so in some of their <hi>Positions</hi> they jumpe pat with the <hi>Iesuit;</hi> for though they are both in the extremes, and as contrary one to the other as the scales of a Diameter, yet their opinions and practices are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrique to depresse Regall power; both of them <hi>would binde their Kings in chaines, and the Nobles in linkes of iron;</hi> they both deny all <hi>passive obedience,</hi> and as the one would have the morter of the Temple temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with bloud, so the other would beat Religion into the brain with the Pole-axe. Their greatest master-piece of policie is to forge counterfeit newes, and to divulge and disperse it as farre as they can, to amuse the world, for the advancement of their Designes, and strengthening of their partie: but the <hi>Iesuit</hi> doth it more cunningly
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47342:5"/>
and modestly, for he fetcheth his newes from farre, so that before the falshood of it can be controll'd, his worke is commonly done, and the newes forgotten; but these later <hi>Polititians</hi> use to raise lyes hard by home, so that the grosnesse and palpablenesse of them is presently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. Besides, to avoid the extremes of the other, these <hi>later</hi> seem fall into flat prophanenesse, for they may be called a kinde of enemies to the very <hi>Name, Crosse,</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> of Christ. Touching the first, they repine at any reverence to be done unto it, though spontaneous, not coercive. For the second, which was held from the beginning to be the <hi>badge</hi> and <hi>banner</hi> of a Christian, they crie it up to be the <hi>marke of the beast;</hi> and for the last, they would have it to be neither <hi>beautifull, holy,</hi> nor <hi>amiable,</hi> which are the three main properties which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires in his House. To conclude, when any comes to be season'd with this sower leaven, he seemes to degenerate presently from the nature and garbe of a Gentleman, and fals to be of a sordid and low disposition, narrow hearted, and close handed; to be timorous, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and jealous, and farre from the common freedom, and sweetnesse of morall societie, and from all generous and loyall thoughts towards his King and Countrey.</p>
               <p>These, these have been the chiefest machinators, and engineers of these unhappy Divisions, who Viper like have torne the entrailes of their own mother, their dear Countrey; but there were other externe concurrent causes, and to finde them out, I must look <hi>Northward,</hi> for there the Cloud began to condense first;</p>
               <p>You know Sir, the <hi>Scotish Nation</hi> were ever used to have their King personally resident amongst them; and though his late Majestie by reason of his <hi>age, bountie,</hi> and <hi>long breeding</hi> there, with other advantages, drew such extraordinary respect from them, that they continued in good conformitie; yet since his death, they have been overheard to mutter at the <hi>remotenesse</hi> and absence of their King, and that they should become now a kinde of <hi>Province</hi> by reason of such a distance: some of their Nobles and Gentrie found not at the English Court, nor at his Majesties Coronation in <hi>Edenburgh</hi> that <hi>countenance, familiaritie, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,</hi> and <hi>honours,</hi> which haply they expected, and 'tis well known who he was, that having been denied to be <hi>lorded,</hi> took a pet, and went dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented to his Countrey, hoping that some Title added to the wealth he had got abroad, should have purchased him more respect. These discontented parties tamper'd with the mercenary Preachers up and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47342:6"/>
down <hi>Scotland,</hi> to obtrude to the People what Doctrines they put into their mouthes, so that the Pulpits every where rung of nothing but of invectives against certain obliquities and soloecismes (and I cannot tell what) in Government, and many glances they had upon the <hi>English</hi> Church; yet all this while there was not matter enough for an insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, nor to dispose the Peoples hearts to a mutinie, untill by the policie (as some affirmed) of the said <hi>discontented partie,</hi> the <hi>English Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie</hi> was sent thither: this by the incitement of those fiery <hi>Pulpiteers,</hi> was cried up to be the greatest Idoll that possibly could be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their <hi>Kirk,</hi> insomuch that when it was first offer'd to be read, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and baser sort of mechanickes threw stooles and stones at the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops heads, and were ready to tear them in pieces: and here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the storme. His Majestie having notice hereof, sent a most graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Proclamation, signifying, that whereas he had recommended that <hi>Book</hi> to be practic'd amongst them, wherein he himselfe served God Almightie twice a day, he did it out of a pious endeavour to breed an <hi>uniformitie</hi> of publike Divine Service in all his Dominions, specially in that his <hi>native</hi> Kingdom. But since it had produced such dangerous effects, he was contented to revoke it absolutely; for it was never his purpose to <hi>presse</hi> the practise of the said Book upon the consciences of any, he did onely <hi>commend,</hi> not absolutely <hi>command</hi> the use of it: therefore he exhorted and required that every one unto whom it had given any scandall, should returne to his pristine obedience, and serve God as formerly, offering here with a gracious pardon, and to passe an Act of <hi>Amnestia</hi> for an abolition of all faults passed.</p>

               <speaker>Peregr.</speaker>
               <p>And would not this suffice? In naturall motions we finde that the cause being taken away, the effect ceaseth, and will not this hold in civill Actions?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Patr.</speaker>
               <p>No, this would not serve the turne, but there was a further reach in it, and for an inch to take an ell: you know, the <hi>Scots</hi> since their <hi>single</hi> Lion came to quarter with our <hi>three,</hi> are much elevated in their spirits, more respected, employed and trusted abroad, and heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened in their resolutions and aimes, and will questionlesse be dayly more and more. You have heard of a mine that reach'd from our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>checquer to <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> And I beleive you have not forgot <hi>Boccolinies</hi> balance, that was shewed us in <hi>Italie,</hi> wherein <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the States of Christendom, and throwing in <hi>England</hi> amongst the rest, you know how much he made her to weigh lesse by this addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47342:6"/>
The former <hi>Proclamation</hi> I say, and <hi>Pardon</hi> would not suffice, but they took opportunitie to fish in those troubled waters, and vent their spleen further, by an utter extirpation of <hi>Episcopacie,</hi> and by trampling the <hi>Mitre</hi> under their feet, hoping <hi>to have some of the birds plumes, being pluckt, to feather their own nests;</hi> and they brought their worke about. Good Lord, what a deal of dirt was presently thrown into the <hi>Bishops</hi> faces by every rurall petty Clerke! what infamous Ballads were sung, what a thicke cloud of Epidemicall hatred hung suddenly over them, so farre, that a Dog with blacke and white spots was called a <hi>Bishop</hi> amongst them up and down the streets.</p>
               <p>The chiefest Contrivers of this uproar, finding their Designe to go on so well, and perceiving the whole Countrey so eagerly bent against <hi>Bishops,</hi> (and what artifices and suggestions were us'd to render them so odious is incredible) but finding withall his Majestic unwilling to alter the Government his father (of so fresh and famous Memorie) had left him, and to which he had been sworne at his Coronation, they put themselves in Armes, and rais'd Forces to beat down the <hi>Mitre,</hi> with the <hi>Sword,</hi> if the <hi>Scepter</hi> would not do it. To the frontiers they came with a great Armie, (not halfe so great as was bruited) pretending they came as Petitioners (though they brought their Petition upon their Pikes point.) Some of the great ones about the King grew cold in the action: and what a Pacification was then shuffled up, and how a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was called thereupon in <hi>Scotland,</hi> with other passages, is a fitter subject for a storie than a discourse.</p>

               <p>I could have wish'd two things, that either his Majestie had given them battail <hi>then,</hi> having the flower of his Nobilitie and Gentrie with him, who I understood came with all chearfulnesse and prompti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to attend him, or else that after the said Pacification, his Majestie had shaken off all jealousies, and with a royall freedom and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding confidence gone amongst them to hansell their new Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment House at <hi>Edenburgh;</hi> for it is probable, it had averted those showers and cataracts of miseries which have fallen upon us since: but I pray Sir, proceed.</p>

               <p>As they say, <hi>There is no winde but blowes some bodie good,</hi> so it was thought, this Northerne Cloud did <hi>England</hi> some advantage, for a Parliament was summon'd hereupon; a Parliament do I call it? It was rather an <hi>Embryo</hi> of a Parliament, an <hi>Ephemeran</hi> of 20 dayes. In this sitting his Majestie declared unto both Houses the indignities he 
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47342:7"/>
had received by his Scotch Subjects, and therefore purpos'd a supply to be made of 12 Subsidies to suppresse that Rebellion; and in lieu thereof he was willing to forbear and utterly abolish the Ship money, which he had reason to thinke legall at first, being advised thereunto by <hi>Noy</hi> his Attourney Generall, who had such a mighty repute in the Law; yet he would not rest there, but he advised further with his <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Councell,</hi> who concurred in opinion with <hi>Noy;</hi> nor would he rest there also, but he had the approbation of all the <hi>Iudges singly,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the <hi>major</hi> part of all the Twelve, <hi>joyntly</hi> upon a Demurre. This was enough to induce his conscience to hold it legall all this while; it was clearly proved that the monies levied this way, were employed to no other but the intended service, <hi>The guarding of the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Seas;</hi> and not onely for that, but to preserve his right of Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in them, being the fairest flower of his Crown, which was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discoursed of abroad, but began to be questioned: and touching danger, how could <hi>England</hi> be but in apparent dangers? considering how all her next neighbours were in actuall hostilitie, which made huge Fleets of Men of War, both <hi>French, Dunkerkers, Hamburgers</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> to sail ever and anon in her <hi>Channels,</hi> and hard before her royall <hi>Chambers:</hi> nor came there one penny of that publike Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his private Coffers, but he added much of his own Demeanes for the maintenance of a Royall Fleet every Sommer: yet he was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to passe any Bill for the utter abolishing of the said <hi>Ship money,</hi> and for redressing of any other grievances, provided they would enable him to suppresse this <hi>Scots</hi> Rebellion: some say the House was incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to comply with his Majesties demands, but (as the ill spirit would have it) that Parliament was suddenly broke up, and I would that they who gave that Counsell had been in <hi>Arabia,</hi> or beyond the Line, in their way to <hi>Madagascar,</hi> who neverthelesse have got to be in high re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest with this present Parliament.</p>
               <p>His Majestie being reduced to these streights, and resenting still the insolence of the <hi>Scot,</hi> proposed the businesse to his Privie Councell, who suddenly made up a considerable and most noble sum for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent supply, whereunto divers of his domesticke Servants and Officers did contribute. Amongst others who were active herein, the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> bestirr'd himselfe notably, and having got a Parliament to be called in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he went over, and with incredible celeritie raised 8000 men, who procured money of the Parliament to maintain them,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47342:7"/>
and got over those angry Seas again in the compasse of lesse than six weekes. You may infer hence to what an exact uncontrollable obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he had reduced that Kingdom, as to bring about so great a worke with such a suddennesse and facilitie.</p>
               <p>An Armie was also raised here, which marched to the North, and there fed upon the Kings pay a whole Sommer. The <hi>Scot</hi> was not idle all this while; but having punctuall intelligence of every thing that passed at Court, as farre as what was debated in the Cabinet Counsell, and spoken in the Bed-chamber, (and herein amongst many others, he had infinite advantage of us) He armed also, and preferring to make <hi>England</hi> the stage of the War, rather than his own Countrey, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade rather than to be invaded, He got over the <hi>Tweed,</hi> and found the passage open, and as it were made for him all the way till he came to the <hi>Tine,</hi> and though there was a considerable Armie of Horse and Foot at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> yet they never offered so much as to face him all the while. At <hi>Newburgh</hi> indeed there was a small skirmish; but the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Foot would not fight, so <hi>Newcastle</hi> gates flew open to the <hi>Scot</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any resistance at all, where it is thought he had more friends than foes, and who were their friends for this Invasion, I hope <hi>Time,</hi> and the <hi>Tribunall</hi> of Justice will one day discover.</p>
               <p>His Majestie being then at <hi>Yorke,</hi> summoned all his Nobles to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, to advise with them in this exigence: Commissioners were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed on both sides, who met at <hi>Rippon,</hi> and how the hearts and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of some of the <hi>English</hi> Barons did boil within them, to be brought to so disadvantageous a Treatie with the <hi>Scot,</hi> you may well imagine. So the Treatie began, which the <hi>Scot</hi> would not conforme himselfe unto, unlesse he were made first <hi>Rectus in Curia,</hi> and the Proclamation wherein he was declared Traitour, revoked; alleadging it would be dishonourable for his Majestie to treat with Rebels. This Treatie was ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ourned to <hi>London,</hi> where this present Parliament was summoned (which was one of the chiefest errands of the <hi>Scot,</hi> as some thinke, And thus farre by these sad and short degrees, have I faithfully led you along to know the true <hi>Originals</hi> of our calamities.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Peregr.</speaker>
               <p>Truly Sir, I must tell you, that to my knowledge these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy traverses with <hi>Scotland,</hi> have made the <hi>English</hi> suffer abroad very much in point of Nationall honour; therefore I wonder much that all this while there is none set a worke to make a solid Apologie for <hi>England</hi> in some communicable Language, (either in <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Latin)</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:47342:8"/>
to rectifie the world into the truth of the thing, and to vindicate her, how she was bought and sold in this Expedition, considering what a partie the <hi>Scot</hi> had here, and how his comming in, was rather an <hi>Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> than an <hi>Invasion,</hi> and I believe if it had been in many parts of the world besides, some of the Commanders had gone to the pot.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Patr.</speaker>
               <p>It is the practise of some <hi>States</hi> I know, to make sacrifice of some eminent minister, for <hi>publike mistakes:</hi> but to follow the thred of of my Discourse. The Parliament being sate, His Majestie told them, That he was resolved to cast himselfe wholly upon the affection and fidelitie of his People, whereof they were the Representative Bodie; therefore He wished them to go roundly on to close up the ruptures that were made by this unfortunate War, and that the two Armies, one domestique, the other forreigne, which were gnawing the very bowels of the Kingdom, might be dismissed. Touching grievances of any kinde (and what State was there ever so pure, but some corruption might creep into it?) He was very ready to redresse them: concerning the <hi>Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money,</hi> He was willing to passe a Bill for the utter abolition of it, and to establish the propertie of the Subject; therefore he wished them not to spend too much time about that. And for <hi>Monopolies,</hi> he desired to have a list of them, and he would damne them all in one Proclamation: Touching ill <hi>Counsellours,</hi> either in <hi>Westminster Hall,</hi> or <hi>White Hall,</hi> either in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> he was resolved to protect none, therefore he wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that all jealousies and mis-understandings might vanish: This, with sundry other straines of princely grace he delivered unto them, but withall he told them, that they should be very cautious how they shook the frame of Government too farre, in regard it was like a <hi>Watch, which being put asunder, can never be made up again, if the least pin be left out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So there were great hopes of a Calme, after that cold Northerne Storme, and that we should be suddenly rid of the <hi>Scot,</hi> but that was least intended, untill some Designes were brought about. The Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the <hi>Iudges,</hi> and divers <hi>Monopolists</hi> are clapt up, and you know who took a timely <hi>flight</hi> to the other side of the sea: and in lieu of these, the <hi>Bishop of Lineolne</hi> is enlarged, <hi>Bastwick, Burton,</hi> and <hi>Prynne</hi> are brought into <hi>London,</hi> with a kinde of <hi>Hosanna.</hi> His Majestie gave way to all this, and to comply further with them, he took as it were into his bosome, I mean, he admitted to his Privie Counsell those Parliament Lords, who were held the greatest Zelots amongst them, that they might be witnesses of his secretest actions;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47342:8"/>
and to one of them He gave one of the considerablest Offices of the Kingdom, by the resignation of another most deserving <hi>Lord,</hi> upon whom they could never fasten misdemeanour; yet this great new <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer</hi> will come neither to the same Oratorie, Chappell, or Church, to joyne in Prayer with his Royall Master, nor communicate with him in any publike exercise of devotion; and may not this be called a true <hi>Recusancie?</hi> To another he gave one of the prime and most <hi>reposefull Offices</hi> about his own person at Court, and thereby he might be said to have given a <hi>Staffe</hi> to beat himselfe. Moreover, partly to give his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects an Evidence how firmely he was rooted in his <hi>Religion,</hi> and how much he desired the strengthening of it abroad; the Treatie of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage went on 'twixt his <hi>eldest daughter</hi> and the young Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> Hereunto may be added as a speciall Argument of compliance and grace, the passing of the Bill for a <hi>Trienniall</hi> Parliament; and lastly, (which is the greatest evidence that possibly can be imagined, of that reall trust and confidence he reposed in them) He passed the Act of Continuance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Peregr.</speaker>
               <p>Touching the Trienniall Parliament, there come some wholesome fruit out of it, for it will keep all Officers in awe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the Nobilitie, and young Gentrie of the Kingdom to studie, and understand the Government of the Land, and be able to sit and serve their Countrey in this great Senate; but for this Act of Continuance, I understand it not; <hi>Parliaments are good Physicke, but ill meat;</hi> they say abroad that <hi>England</hi> is turned hereby from a <hi>Monarchie</hi> to a <hi>Democracie,</hi> to a perpetuall kinde of <hi>Dictatorship;</hi> and whereas in former times there was an <hi>Heptarchie</hi> of seven Kings in her, They say now she hath seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty times seven. But in lieu of these unparallell'd Acts of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>trust</hi> to the Parliament, what did the Parliament for the King all this while?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Patr.</speaker>
               <p>They promised, specially upon the passing of the last Act, <hi>That they would make him the most glorious, the best beloved, and richest King that ever reigned in England:</hi> and this they did with deep protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and asseverations. But there intervened an ill favoured accident which did much hurt, <hi>viz.</hi> A <hi>Discourse</hi> (for truly I thinke it was no more) which some green heads held to bring up the Northerne Armie, to checke the Puritan partie, and the rabble of the Citie: This kept a mighty noise, and you know who fled upon it, and much use was made of it to make that Cloud of Jealousie which was but of the breadth of an hand before, to appear as big as a mountain.

Secondly, that during the time of his Triall, he applied not himselfe with that compliance to his <hi>Iury</hi> as well as to his <hi>Iudges,</hi> for he was observed to comply onely with the Lords, and not with the House of Commons.</p>

I blush to tell you how much the rabble of the Citie thirsted after his bloud, how they were suffer'd to strut up and down the streets before the Royall Court, and the Parliament it selfe, with impunitie; they cried out, that if the <hi>Common</hi> Law fail'd, <hi>club</hi> Law should knocke him down, and their insolencie came to that height, that the names of those Lords that would not doom him to death, should be given them to fix upon posts up and down; and this was the first tumult that happened this Parliament, whereof so many followed after their example, being not onely conniv'd at, but backed by Authoritie, for there were prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions sent from the Parliament, to hinder all processe against some of them.</p>

               <p>The power of Parliament, when King, Peeres and Commons, which is the whole Kingdome digested into one volume, is indefinite; but what either of both Houses can do of themselves singly, or joyntly, without the King who is the life of the Law, <hi>I</hi> dare not determine: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially when a visible faction reignes amongst them.

But for mine owne opinion, <hi>I</hi> think it is as impossible for them to make a Law without the King, as it was for <hi>Paracelsas</hi> to make a man without coition, either for abolishment of old, or establishment of new Lawes. The results of Parliament without the Royall consent, are as matches without fire; And it is an incontroulable principle, that the old Law must be our guide, till new be made, nor is any Act of the Subject justifiable, but what is warrantable by the old. But to proceed in the true discovery of these Domestick scistures, my Lord of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> being gone, we hop'd faire weather would follow, (He who was the cause of the tempest, being throwne over-boord) but unluckie mists of jealousie grew thicker and thicker; Yet the <hi>Scots</hi> were dismist, having had Fidlers fare, meat, drinke, and money, for eleven long moneths together. So his Majestie went to <hi>Scotland,</hi> where the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there, did but aske and have any thing, though it be the unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable prerogative of Majestie to grant or denie Petitions, and to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his conscience before any Councell.</p>
               <p>But during his sojourne there, this formidable hideous Rebellion broke out in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which though it may be said to be but an old play newly reviv'd, yet the Scene was never so Tragicall and bloody as now: for the Barbarismes that have been committed there have been fo sanguinarie, and monstrously salvage, that I thinke posterity will hold them hyperbolicall. The <hi>Irish</hi> themselves affirm there concurr'd causes to kindle this fire. One was the taking off <hi>Straffords</hi> head, (who aw'd them more then any Deputy ever did) and that one of his Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations should be to have used the Papists there too favourably.

               <p>'Tis true, there is no Government upon earth, made up of men, but is subject to corruption, there is no Court of Judicature so cleane, but some cobwebs may gather in it, unlesse an Act of Parliament could be made to free and exempt men from infirmities and errour; It cannot be denyed, but <hi>Scotland</hi> might have something to complaine of (though <hi>I</hi> thinke least of any) and so leapt first into the poole to bee

cured; and what she fish'd besides in those troubled waters 'tis too well knowne. <hi>England</hi> also no doubt might have some grievances, which his Majestie freely offered, not only to redresse for the present, but to free her of all feares for the future, from falling into relapses of that kinde; but to redresse grievances by Armes, by plunging the whole Countrey into an intestine warre, this makes the remedy worse then the malady, it is as if one would goe about to cure a sick body by brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his head, or let him blood by giving him a dash on the nose; it is as mad a trick as his was who set the whol house a fire to roast his egs.

               <p>His Majestie being thus <hi>shut out</hi> of one Town, he might justly suspect, that an attempt might be made to <hi>shut him in,</hi> in some other; therefore he made a motion to the <hi>Yorke shire</hi> Gentlemen, to have a guard for the preservation of His Person, which was done according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

But when the Bill against Bishops was in agitation, which businesse lasted near upon 10 weekes, a crue of bold sturdie Mechanicks, and Mariners, came from the <hi>Citie</hi> and ruffled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>White-hall,</hi> and <hi>Westminster-hall,</hi> and would have violated the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie of <hi>Westminster,</hi> so that for many nights a Court of guard was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be kept in the bodie of that Church, (the chiefest <hi>Sanctuarie</hi> of the Kingdom.) Moreover, His Maiestie having impeached some of the Members of both Houses, of high Treason, and being denied to have them delivered up, he went himselfe to the <hi>Lower House</hi> to demand them, assuring the <hi>House they should have as fair and legall a triall as ever men had.</hi> But as it pleased God, they were not there, but retir'd to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> for refuge; the <hi>Londoners</hi> grew starke wilde thereupon, and notice being sent to all the adjacent Counties, this Act of the Kings (though it wanted no precedents of former times) was aggravated in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est degree that possibly could be. Hence you may easily inferre, what 
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47342:12"/>
small security his Majesty had at <hi>White-hall,</hi> and what indignities hee might have exposed himselfe unto, by that which had passed already from the Rabble, who had vilified and cryed <hi>tush</hi> at his Proclamations, and disgorg'd other rebellious speeches with impunity, therefore hee retired to <hi>Hampton</hi> Court (as we read, <hi>our Saviour withdrew himselfe once from the multitude)</hi> thence to <hi>Windsor</hi> Castle, whence accompanying her Majestie, with his eldest daughter to the sea side for <hi>Holland,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving commanded the Prince to attend him against his returne at <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> the Prince had beene surpriz'd and brought to <hi>London,</hi> had not the King come a little before.

               <p>It was penn'd, and injoyn'd by the Parliament for every one to take, and it consisted of many parts, the first was, to maintaine the true Protestant religion against all <hi>Popish</hi> innovations, which word <hi>Popish</hi> (as some think) was scrued in of purpose for a loop-hole to let in any other innovation) the second was to <hi>maintaine the Prerogative and honour of the King;</hi> then the <hi>power and priviledge of Parliaments;</hi> and lastly, the <hi>propriety</hi>

The pulse of the <hi>Parliament</hi> beat's yet higher, they send an <hi>Admirall</hi> to the sea, not onely <hi>without,</hi> but expresly <hi>against</hi> the Kings speciall command. They had taken unto them a Military gard from the Citie for their protection, without his Majesties consent, who by the advice of the Lord <hi>Keeper</hi> and others, had offered them a very strong gard of Constables and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officers to attend them, which the laws usually allow; yet the raising of that gard in <hi>Yorkshire</hi> for the safegard of his Majesties person, was interpreted to be levying of warre against the Parliament, and so made a sufficient ground for them to raise an <hi>Armie,</hi> to appoint a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi> with whom they made publike Declarations to live and die. And they assumed power to conferre a new <hi>appellation</hi> of honour upon him, as if any could conferre honour but the King! And this Army was to be maintained out of the next contribution of all sorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; so a great masse of money and plate, was brought into the <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> the Semstresse brought in her silver <hi>Thimble,</hi> the Chamber maid her <hi>Bodkin,</hi> the Cook his <hi>Spoones,</hi> and the Uintner his <hi>Bowles,</hi> and every one something to the advancement of so good a worke, as to wage war directly against the Sacred person of their Soveraigne, and to put the whole Countrey into a combustion.</p>

               <p>Touching your <hi>Lyturgie,</hi> I have heard it censured abroad by the rigidest <hi>Calvinists</hi> of <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Dort,</hi> yet I never heard any other Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter given of it, but that it is a most <hi>Pious, Pathetick,</hi> and perfect piece of devotion, both for the matter and forme of it, which I have beene a little curious to observe. It begins with some choise passages of holy Scripture, and a previous Declaration or Monitory to excite us to the worke in hand; The first addresse we make to God is by an humble and joynt Confession which is applyable to any conscience, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends in it all kind of sins. Then followeth a pronuntiation of Gods promises and pronesse to pardon and absolve us; Wee goe on to the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47342:15"/>
Lords Prayer, which having beene dictated by our Saviour himselfe, we often use, and is as <hi>Amber</hi> throwne in amongst our <hi>Frankincense,</hi> to make the Sacrifice more precious and pleasing unto God. Then we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to some choice Psalmes, and other portions of holy Scripture taken out of the old and new testament; Then we fall to the <hi>Symbole of saith,</hi> where of we make a solemne joynt confession in such a posture as shews a readinesse and resolution in us to defend it: and so to the <hi>Leta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> wherein the poore penitent peccant soule may be said to breath out her self into the bosome of her Saviour by tender ejaculations, by pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting groanes, and eviscerated ingeminations, and there is no sinne, no temptation whatsoever that humane frailtie is subject unto, but you shall finde a deliverance from it there; it is so full of Christian charity that there is no condition of people, but are remembred and prayed for there. Then we proceed by holy alternatif interlocutions (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we heare our selves speak as well as the minister) to some effectuall short prayers; because in long prayers the minde is subject to wander, as some Zelots now a dayes use to bring their Hearers into a <hi>Wildernesse</hi> by their <hi>Prayers,</hi> and into a <hi>Labyrinth</hi> by their <hi>Sermons.</hi> Then goe we on to the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> and if it be in a <hi>Cathedrall,</hi> there is time enough for the Hearer to examine himselfe, while the Musicke playes, where and when he broke any of Gods holy Commandements, and ask particular forgivenesse accordingly; Then after other choice portions of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and passages relating to our Redemption, and endearing unto us the merits of it, with a more particular Confession of our <hi>Faith,</hi> we are dismissed with a <hi>Benediction:</hi> so that this <hi>Lyturgie</hi> may be called an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of many strings, whereon the sighing soule sends up various notes unto heaven. It is a posie made up of divers flowers, to make it the more fragrant in the nostrills of God. Now touching your <hi>Bishops</hi> I never knew yet any Protestant Church but could be content to have them, had they meanes to maintaine the <hi>Dignitie,</hi> which the Churches of <hi>France</hi> with others have not in regard the Reformation began first among the people, not at <hi>Court,</hi> as here it did in <hi>England:</hi> For unlesse there be some Supervisers of Gods house, endowed with eminent au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to check the fond fancies, and quench the false fatuous fires of every private spirit, and unlesse it be such an authoritie that may draw unto it a holy kinde of awe and obedience, what can be expected but confusion and <hi>Atheisme?</hi> You know what became of the Israelites when the wonted reverence to the <hi>Ark,</hi> and the <hi>Ephod,</hi> and the <hi>Priest,</hi>

began to languish amongst them: For the braine of man is like a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, which unlesse it be senced about with a wall or hedge, is subject you know to be annoyed by all kinde of beasts which will be ready to runne into it; so the braine unlesse it be restrain'd and bounded in holy things by rules of Canonicall authority, a thousand wilde opinions, and extravagant fancies will hourely rush into it: nor was there ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny field so subject to produce Cockle and Darnell, as the braine is rank and ready to bring forth tares of Scisme and Heresie of a thousand sorts, unlesse after the first culture the sickle of Authority be applyed to grub up all such noisome weeds.</p>

foure false foundations, <hi>viz.</hi> That the King of whom they speake must be either a <hi>Minor,</hi> an <hi>Idiot,</hi> an insufferable tyrant, or that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome they mean, is <hi>Elective;</hi> None of all which is appliable, either to our most gracious and excellently quallified King, or to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Kingdom, which hath been alwayes reputed an ancient suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive Monarchie, governed by one supreme, undeposeable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Head, having the Dignitie, the Royall State, and Power of an Imperiall Crown, and being responsible to none but to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie and his own <hi>conscience</hi> for his actions, and unto whom a Bodie Politicke compacted of Prelates, Peeres, and all degrees of people is naturally subject; but this is a theme of that transcendencie, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a serious and solid <hi>Tractat,</hi> rather than such a slender Discourse as this to handle.</p>
               <p>But I pray excuse me Sir, that I have stept aside thus from the Road of my main narration; I told you before, how the clashing 'twixt the <hi>Commission of Array,</hi> and the <hi>Militia,</hi> put all things in disarray through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Kingdom; The Parliament as they had taken the first Militarie guard, so they began to arme first, and was it not high time then for his Majestie to do something think you? yet he assayed by all wayes imaginable to prevent a War, and to conquer by a passive forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, by <hi>cunctation,</hi> and <hi>longanimitie.</hi> How many overtures for an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation did he make? How many Proclamations of Pardon? How many elaborate Declarations breathing nothing but clemencie, sweetnesse and truth did drop from his own imperious invincible pen, which will remain upon Record unto all Ages, as so many Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to his eternall glorie? Yet some ill spirit stept still in, between his Grace and the abused Subject, for by the peremptorie Order of Parliament (O monstrous thing!) the said Proclamations of Grace, and other his Majesties Declarations were prohibited to be read, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the strength and truth of them would have had a virtue to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blinde, or rather unbewitch <hi>(for Rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft),</hi> the poor besotted people? What deep Protestations, and holy Vowes did he reiterate, that the main of his Designes was to preserve the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestant Religion, the known Lawes of the Land, and the just Priviledges of Parliament? How often did he dehort and wooe the Citie of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> (his <hi>Imperial Chamber)</hi> from such violent courses, so that she may justly be upbraided with the same words, as the <hi>Prince of peace</hi> upbraided <hi>Jerusalem</hi> withall: <hi>London, London, How often would I have gathered thee,</hi>

               <p>How often did He descend to acknowledge the manner of demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the one and five Members in his publike Remonstrances? And if there was an errour in his proceedings, how oft did he desire his Great Councell to direct him in a course how to go on in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment? which they never did, but would reserve the priviledge to themselves to be Judge and Partie.</p>

               <p>To my knowledge, these Nobles and Gentlemen are still the very same as they were in former Parliaments, wherein they were so cried up for the truest lovers of their Countrey, and best Common-wealths men; yet now they are branded, and Voted to be <hi>Seducers</hi> and Traitors, because according to their Oathes and consciences, they adhere to the King their Master and Liege-Lord, for maintenance of that Religion they were baptized and bred in. Those most Orthodox and painfull Divines, which till the Parliament began, were accounted the precisest sort of Protestants, are now cried down for Papists, though they continue still the very same men, both for opinions and preaching, and are no more <hi>Papists,</hi> than I am a <hi>Pytbagorean.</hi> In fine, a true <hi>English</hi> Protestant is put now in the same scale with a Papist, and made <hi>Synonyma's.</hi> And truly these unhappy Schismatickes could not devise how to cast a greater infamie upon the <hi>English</hi> Protestant, than they have done of late by these monstrous imputations; they would fasten upon him such opinions which never entred into his thoughts, they would know ones heart better than himselfe, and so would be greater <hi>Kardiognostickes</hi> than God Almightie.</p>
               <p>But to draw to a Conclusion; the Parliaments Armie multiplied apace in <hi>London,</hi> the Kings but slowly in the North, so that when he displayed his Royall Standard at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> his Forces were not any thing considerable, so that if the Parliaments <hi>Generall</hi> had then advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced towards him from <hi>Northamptou,</hi> he had put him to a very great
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47342:17"/>
strait; they encreased something at <hi>Derby</hi> and <hi>Stafford,</hi> but when hee was come to <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> the Welch-men came running downe the mountaines in such multitudes, that their example did much animate the English; so that his Army in lesse than a moneth that the Court continued in Shrewesbury, came to neere upon twenty thousand Horse and Foot; nor was it a small advantage to his Majesties affaires, that the <hi>Nephew-Princes</hi> came over so opportunely. The first encounter Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> had with the Parliaments forces was at <hi>Worcester,</hi> where he defeated the flower of their Cavalrie, and gave them a smart blow. At <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> his Majestie tooke a resolution to march with his whole Armie towards <hi>London,</hi> but after seven dayes march he understood the Parliaments forces were within six miles side long of him, and so many miles he went out of his road to find them out, and face them: Upon a Sunday morning he was himself betimes on Edge-Hill, where the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Colours plainly appear'd in the vale before Keinton; it was past two in the after-noon before all his Infantery could get to the bottom, who upon sight of the Enemies Colours ran as merrily down the hil, as if they had gone to a morris-dance. So his Majestie himselfe being Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralissimo, gave command the great Ordnance should flie for a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: so the battell began, which lasted above three houres; and as some French and Dutch Commanders told me, they never remembred to have seene a more furious fight for the time in all the German warres. Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> pursued the Enemies Horse like a whirle-winde neere up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on three miles, and had there beene day enough, when he came back to the infanterie, in all probabilitie a totall defeat had beene given them: So that the same accident may bee said to fall out here, as happened in that famous battell at <hi>Lewis,</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the thirds time, where the Prince of Wales (afterwards <hi>Edward</hi> the first) was so eager, and went so far (by excesse of courage) from the body of the Army in pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Londoners. His Majestie (to his deserved and never-dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glory) comported himself like another <hi>Caesar</hi> all the while, by riding about and encouraging the Souldiers, by exposing his person often to the reach of a Musket-buller, and lying in the field all that bleake night in his Coach. Notwithstanding that many lying pamphlets were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely printed here, to make the world believe, that he had retired him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe all the time of the fight; what partiall Reports were made in the <hi>Guild-hall</hi> to the <hi>Londoners,</hi> and by what persons, I am ashamed to tell you: But that his Majestie was victorious that day (a day which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47342:18"/>
I never thought to have seene in England) there be many convincing arguments to prove it; for besides the great odds of men which fell on their side, and Cannons they lost, some of their Ordnance were naild by the Kings Troopes the next morning after, in the very face of their armie. Moreover the King advanced forward the next day to his former road, and tooke Banbury presently after; but the <hi>Parliamenteers</hi> went backwards, and so from that day to this, His Majestie continueth Master of the field. 'Tis true, that in some places, as at <hi>Farnham, Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> and <hi>Chichester,</hi> they have prevailed since, but no considerable part of the Royall Army was there to make opposition; and I blush to tell you, how unworthily the Law of Armes was violated in all those places.</p>

               <p>I would be loth to exchange consciences with them, and bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle so with God Almighty; but these men by a new kind of <hi>Metaphysick</hi> have found out a way to abstract the <hi>Person</hi> of the King from his Office to make his Soveraigntie a kinde of <hi>Platonick Idea</hi> hovering in the aire, while they visibly attempt to asiail and destroy his person (and <hi>Progeny)</hi> by small and great shot, and seek him out amongst his Life Guard with fire, and sword; yet they give out they fight not only not against him, but for him, and that their army is more loyall to him than his owne; who, they say, fight only for the name <hi>King,</hi> though they have his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son really amongst them, commanding and directing: Thus they make him a strange kind of <hi>Amphibium,</hi> they make him in one instant a King and no King of the same <hi>Individuum;</hi> a power which the <hi>Casuists</hi> affirm God Almighty never assumd to himself, <hi>to do any thing that implys a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</hi>

               <p>Noble Sir, you make my heart to pant within me, by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetick relation you have beene pleased to make mee of these ruthfull times; But one thing seemes to me to be no lesse than a miracle, how his Majestie hath beene able to subsist all this while, considering the infinite advantages the adverse partie hath had of him; for they have all the tenable places and townes of strength, both by Land and Sea; They have the <hi>Navie Royall,</hi> they have all the Ammunition and Armes
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47342:18"/>
of the Crowne, they have all the imposts and Customes, Poundage and Tonnage (which they levie contrary to their former Protestation before the Bill be passed) they have the Exchequer at their devotion, and all the Revenue of the King, Queene and Prince, and lastly, they have the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> which may be called a Magazin of money and Men, where there is a ready supply and superfluitie of all things, that may feed, clothe, or make men gay to put them in heart and resolution: Truly considering all these advantages, with divers others on their side, and the disadvantages on the Kings, it turnes me into a lump of asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, how his Majestie could beare up all this while, and keepe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether so many Armies, and be still master of the field.</p>

               <p>I confesse Sir, it is a just subject for wonderment, and we must a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe it principally to God Almighty, who is the protectour of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, for his hand hath manifestly appear'd in the conduct of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, He hath beene the Pilot, who hath sate at the helme ever since this storme began, and will doubtlesse continue to steere his course till he waft him to safe harbour againe; Adde hereunto, that his Majestie for his owne part, hath beene wonderfully stirring, and indefatigable both for his body and minde; and what notable things Her Majestie hath done, and what she hath <hi>suffered,</hi> is fitter for a Chronicle, then such a simple <hi>Discourse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereunto may be added besides, that his Majestie hath three parts of foure of the Pceres, and prime Gentry of the Kingdome firme unto him, and they will venture hard, before they will come under a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar government and corporations; or let in <hi>Knox</hi> or <hi>Calvin</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this Church and State.</p>

               <p>Dear Sir, If you seriously resolve to crosse the Seas again so soon, I may chance bear you companie, for as you have since the short time of your sojourne here judiciously observed a nationall defection of reason in the people of this <hi>Island,</hi> which makes her so active in her own ruine; so by longer experience, and by infallible Symptomes, I finde a strange kinde of <hi>Vertigo</hi> to have seized upon her, which I fear will turne to the falling Sicknesse, or such a Phrensie, that will make her to dash out her own braines; Nor are her miseries, I fear, come yet to the full; It is the method of the Almightie, when he pleases to punish a people, to begin with <hi>roddes,</hi> to go on with <hi>scourges,</hi> and if they will not do, he hath <hi>Scorpions</hi> for them; therefore, I will breathe any where sooner than here: for what securitie or contentment can one receive in that Countrey, where <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Justice,</hi> the two grand <hi>Doriqne</hi> Columnes which support every <hi>State,</hi> are fallen down? which makes all conditions of men, all professions and Trades to go here daily to utter ruine. The <hi>Church man</hi> growes every day more despica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as if he had no propertie in any thing, nor is there any way left him to recover his Tithe, but by costly troublesome sutes. The <hi>Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> a brave learned profession, hath already made his last Will; and the <hi>Common</hi> Lawyers case is little better; the <hi>Courtier</hi> cannot get his Pension; the <hi>Gentleman</hi> cannot recover his rents, but either they are sequestred by an high hand of <hi>unexampted</hi> power, or else the poor Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is so heavily assess'd or plundered, that he is disabled to pay them in; all kinde of <hi>Commerce</hi> both domesticke and forraigne visibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes, and fals more and more, into the hands of strangers (to the no small dishonour of the wisedome of this Nation;) nor can the <hi>Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> recover his debts, Parliamentary Protections continue still in such numbers, so that it is a greater Priviledge now to be a Footman to the meanest of the Lower House, than to be of the Kings Bed-Chamber: <hi>Prentises</hi> run away from their Masters, and against their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers intent turne Souldiers, and for money, which is the soul of Trade, I believe since the beginning of this Parliament, above one halfe of the Treasure of the Kingdom is either conveyed to the other side of the Sea, or buried under ground, whence it must be new digg'd up again. Moreover, all things are here grown <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> (yet that <hi>word</hi> took off the Earle of <hi>Straffords</hi> head) <hi>Religion, Law,</hi> and <hi>Allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi> is grown <hi>Arbitrary;</hi> nor dares the <hi>Iudge</hi> upon the Tribunall (according to his Oath) do justice, but he is over-awed by <hi>Ordinance,</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:47342:19"/>
or else the least intimation of the sense of the Lower House is sufficient to enjoyne him the contrary, so that now, more than ever, it may be said here,—<hi>Terras Astraa reliquit. Peace</hi> also hath rov'd up and down this Island, and cannot get a place to lay her head on; she hoped to have had entertainment in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> by the agreement of the best Gentlemen in the Country; but an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of Parliament beat her out of doores, then she thought to rest in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> and by a solemne Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant she was promised to be preserved there; the principall Agents of that Covenant having protested every one upon the word of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and as they did desire to prosper, both themselves, their tenants and friends, should strictly observe it; but the like <hi>Ordinance</hi> of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment battered down that <hi>Agreement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then she thought to take footing in the West, and first in <hi>Dorsetshire,</hi> then in <hi>Cornwall</hi> and <hi>Devonshire,</hi> and by the holy tie of the blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, she was promised to be preserved there; but another Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Parliament is pursuing her, to dispense with the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the said Agreement for their Oathes. Lastly, his Majestie is mainly endeavouring to bring her in again thorowout the whole Land; but the furious, phrenetique Schismatickes will have none of her; for as one of them (besides a thousand instances more) preach'd in one of the most populous Congregations about the Citie, <hi>It were better that London streets ran with bloud, and that dead carkasses were piled up as high as the battlements of Pauls, than peace should be now brought in.</hi> And now that <hi>Peace</hi> is shut out, <hi>Learning</hi> is upon point of despair, her Colledges are become Courts of guard, and <hi>Mars</hi> lieth in <hi>Mercuries</hi> bed. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> also, with <hi>her Court,</hi> lieth in the dust; the <hi>Cobler</hi> may confront the <hi>Knight,</hi> the <hi>Boor</hi> the <hi>Baron,</hi> and there is no Judiciall way of satisfaction; which makes <hi>Monarchie</hi> fear she hath no long time of abode here, <hi>Publike faith</hi> also, though she had but newly set up for her selfe, is sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly become Bankrupt, and how could she choose? for more of the Kingdomes Treasure hath been spent within these thirty moneths, than was spent in four-score yeares before; but she hopes to piece up her selfe again, by the ruines of the Church; but let her take heed of that, for those goods have been fatall to many thousand families in this Kingdom: yet she thinkes much, that those publike summes which were given to suppresse one Rebellion (in <hi>Ireland)</hi> should be imployed to maintain another Rebellion (in <hi>England)</hi> And lastly, me thinkes, I see <hi>Religion</hi> in torne ragged weeds, and with slubber'd eyes, sitting upon <hi>Weeping Crosse,</hi> and wringing her hands, to see her chiefest Temple
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47342:20"/>
                  <hi>(Pauls Church)</hi> where God Almightie was us'd to be serv'd constantly thrice a day, and was the <hi>Rendezvouz,</hi> &amp; as it were the Mother Church, standing open to receive all commers and strangers, to be now shut up, and made onely a thorow-fare for Porters; to see those scaffolds, the expence of so many thousand pounds, to lie a rotting; to see her chiefest <hi>lights</hi> like to be extinguished; to see her famous learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines dragg'd to prison, and utterly depriv'd of the benefit of the Common Law, their inheritance: Me thinkes, I say, I see <hi>Religion</hi> packing up, and preparing to leave this Island quite, crying out, that this is a Countrey fitter for <hi>Atheists</hi> than <hi>Christians</hi> to live in; for God Almightie is here made the greatest <hi>Malignant,</hi> in regard his House is plunder'd more than any. There is no Court left to reforme Heresie, no Court to punish any Church Officer, and to make him at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his Cure, no Court to punish Fornication, Adulterie, or Incest; Me thinkes I hear <hi>Her</hi> crie out against these her Grand <hi>Reformers</hi> (or <hi>Refiners</hi> rather) that they have put division 'twixt all degrees of persons. They have put division 'twixt husband and wife, 'twixt mother and childe: the son seekes his fathers bloud in open field, one brother seekes to cut the others throat; they have put division 'twixt Master and Servant, 'twixt <hi>Land-lord</hi> and <hi>Tenant;</hi> nay, they have a long time put a sea of separation 'twixt King and Queen; and they labour more and more to put division 'twixt the Head and the Members, 'twixt his Majestie and his politicall <hi>Spouse,</hi> his Kingdom; and lastly, they have plung'd one of the flourishingst Kingdomes of <hi>Europe</hi> in a War without end; for though a <hi>Peace</hi> may be plaster'd over for the time, I fear it wil be but like a fire cover'd with ashes, which will break out again, as long as these fierie Schismatickes have any strength in this Island, so that all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses considered, if <hi>Turke</hi> or <hi>Tartar,</hi> or all the infernall spirits and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codaemons</hi> of Hell had broken in amongst us, they could not have done poor <hi>England</hi> more mischiefe. Sir, I pray excuse this homely imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect relation, I have a thousand things more to impart unto you when we may breathe freer aire; for here we are come to that slaverie, that one is in danger to have his very thoughts plundered; therefore if you please to accept of my companie, I will over with you by Gods helpe, as soon as it may stand with your conveniencie, but you must not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover me to be an <hi>Englishman</hi> abroad, for so I may be jear'd at and kickt in the streets; I will go under another name, and am fix'd in this reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, never to breathe <hi>English</hi> aire again, untill the <hi>King</hi> recovers his <hi>Scepter,</hi> and the <hi>People</hi> their <hi>Senses.</hi>

How I behaved my selse, while I was of your mind, and in that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, will be best judged by those, that know that from a Lieutenant I was soone preferred to be Captaine of a Troop raised to my hand: and shortly after, to be Sergeant-Major to the Earle of <hi>Stamfords</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of Horse: what prisoners I took, what contribution <hi>I</hi> brought in, what places and Townes I secured, appeares by the testimony gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of me, and the thankes I received from you.

It is not ambition, to forsake a certaine benefit for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine imployment, and (in justice) as doubtfull a pardon: it is not malice for any particular neglect or injury, for I must confesse no man received greater kindnesse from his superiour Officers, or more ample thankes from your selves then I have done; no civill humane respect, but a perfect discoverie of those false lights, that have hitherto misled me, and the deepe apprehension of the horrour which attends the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severing in such errours.</p>

and adultery, they make robbery, rebellion, sacriledge, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der become vertues, because they are in order to effect their designes; and truly I had not trusted my eares, if the same and much more had not beene confirmed by my eyes; for those few regiments then with us were a perfect modell of the whole Armie, and most certaine I am, that all the Officers of no one Company were all of the same opinion what Religion they fought for: some loved the booke of Common-Prayer and Bishops, others were zealous for extemporary prayers and Elders, another thought Bishops so many Elders, and Elders so many Bishops, and therefore they fought to set Jesus Christ in his Throne, meaning independencie: Some liked the Chaplaine of the Regiment, another thought his Corporall preached better; some had so much of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit they wanted courage, and when they should fight, thought it better to pray, or els declared it was revealed unto them they should be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and to fulfill the prophecy, threw downe their armes; and one would thinke, that every companie had been raised out of the severall Congregations of <hi>Amsterdam;</hi> who wanted not Scripture for every mutinie; who plunder and call it Gods providence, who if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove any of qualitie to be a Papist, yet as he is a Gentleman he shal want grace; and that is title enough to possesse the estates of all that are more richer than themselves: and in truth had it not beene for this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, you might have made riots, but not a war; for under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of malignants estates are included, not onely those that directly take part with the King, but all those too that shall not concur with you in all things: hence it is that those were thought merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, who voted Bishops out of the House of Peeres, but are become Malignants, because they will not put them out of the Church: hence some that contributed with a large hand to this war, received marks of favour, but are become Malignants, because they will not give all that they are worth: hence those that in tumults cried for justice were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of thanks, but are become Malignants, because they will not helpe to depose the King. I shall not need to tell what dishonourable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct meanes have beene used to these ends, what burdens have beene laid upon weak consciences of some men by Divines, what preferment have beene promised to some, what threatnings have beene used to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; the sending of Horses, Monie, Plate, shall expiate for past sins, or cover others which by their busie emissaries they have found out, and will otherwise discover: he that has power in his Countrie and will use

it for you may oppresse his neighbour, who must not sue him because he is in their service, and if he would be revenged; it is no hard thing to procure a warrant and the Sergeants man, and lay him up till he find an accusation, to produce one he never meanes to prove. I could instance in divers, who have beene by these allurements, invited to this war, and so to the ruine both of themselves and families; nor can I forget that more obvious artifice, which has made the Presse the fruitfull Mother of many Bastards; when the taking three Scouts in an Alehouse, has beene made at <hi>London,</hi> a Castle and the defeat of a Regiment, and <hi>Cler. Parl.</hi> has made the Pamphlet sell for a truth: when a defeat has beene voted a victory, and to amuse the People an Order has beene made, that God should be thanked for it, and indeed the Officers at last found that to tell truth when they had the worst, sometimes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered their casheering, alwaies procured them an ill opinion, and when they saved the labour of doing the contrary, they were the better used, and therefore of late have justly wracked betwixt this <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charibdis,</hi> while they rather complied with their humour then obeyed truth, so that Religion is but the reverent name for blood and ruine: and it is most evident, it was onely used as a disguise, that we might with the more ease devoure one another, which nature otherwise would forbid us to doe.</p>
            <p>Next to this nothing wrought more upon me, then that strange my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, that fighting for the safety of the King was shooting at Him; as at <hi>Edge-bill</hi> and elsewhere, where I thanke God I was not; for sure the apprehension is so horrid unto me, that had <hi>I</hi> been in that action, the wounds of my conscience would never have beene healed. <hi>I</hi> am told the lawes are very severe not only against those that raise armes against the Crowne, and offer violence to the person of the King, but extend e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the intentions, words and thoughts: certaine <hi>I</hi> am, Religion and Nature ranke Treason and Rebellion among the fowlest sinnes, and followes them with the worst of punishments; and doubtlesse <hi>Ravailliac</hi> might as well have excused his bloody fact, by saying the King was in his way, when he stabbed him, as those that justifie these late actions, by saying his <hi>Majestie</hi> was among their enemies, when he was on his owne ground and amongst his own Servants. And who ever shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what his Majestie has done before this war began, in reparation of these errours past, what calumnies and reproaches he hath suffered since (injuries not to be born by private spirits how beyond hope and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation

His Armie rise from being despised to be justly feared; and lastly, what royall promises, and sacred Protestations He has so oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and so solemnly made, cannot but renounce Charitie and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or else he must believe and trust His Majestie, resent his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and acknowledge the miraculous hand of God in his preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>But I confesse the reason of complaining against you for using the King no better, seemes to grow lesse, whilest the Subject is in a much worse condition. Lawes we have indeed, but they are so little exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, that shortly they will be buried in the places of those late risen Fundamentals, which no man yet could ere discover where they lay; when for the Libertie of the Subject, there is such good provision made, that whereas one Gaole was enough for a whole Countie, now there is more than one almost in every Parish; when the superscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Letter (and may be that fained too) the information of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious neighbour, a fear, a jealousie, deprives many of their libertie, some of their lives; most of their healths and fortunes; when the petitioning for Lawes established, and for Peace (without which we can enjoy neither Lawes nor Truth) are become (with the crime of Loyaltie) the onely things punished; and with such a severitie that as no condition, so no age is spared; the Youth entring into the world, and having undergone the labour of an Apprentiship, instead of being made free of the Citie, are to serve again in a prison; and those reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Aldermen, who have gone through the severall Offices of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> with honour, stooping under the weight of many yeares, and the infirmities thereof, have been drawn from their hospitable houses, (and some from their beds, where extreme age had kept them many yeares before) to loathsome prisons, from thence at midnight in cold and stormie weather, in a little Boat to <hi>Gravesend,</hi> and from thence to the unwholesome aire of some Port-town, that they might not live long, to bewayle that banishment from their dear wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>And herein I acknowledge the greatest Justice, for Proprietie has no Priviledge above Libertie; for being lately at <hi>London</hi> I found Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Plundering went hand in hand, and it is worth the observing how these Disbursements like hastie weeds, grew on a sudden to so great an height; as first a gentle Benevolence, then Subscription, then sending in Plate, next Taxations by an Order, at last the twentieth

part by an Ordinance; besides those smaller diversions of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and spending it in this War, of gathering for the distressed Protestants of that Nation, and bestowing that Charitie upon the Ministers of our own, whose seditious Sermons, had brought a just povertie upon them; of sequestring estates and Benefices, of taking Portions, and keeping Orphans upon Publique Faith, of seizing the Stockes of Churches, till by the same Publique Faith, they build or repair the same; and doubtlesse were not my thoughts more for the generall, than my private interest, I might easily and by authoritie grow rich with the spoiles of that Proprietie you seem to defend, and as others be gallant with the overplus taken for the twentieth part; who likewise by an Order take the Coach-horses of persons of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and use them afterwards in their visits, and to Tavernes for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>I had not made instance in so many particulars, but to justifie my selfe thereby to all the world for what I have now done, which upon these considerations will be rather approved than condemned, by any that have not wholly given up their reason unto Faction, for doubtlesse dishonour is fixt upon levitie, ambition, cowardize, upon the persist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that course which by conscience is declared unjust &amp; irreligious. The breach of Articles renders void all Covenants, much more when that which is contracted for, is not onely altered but subverted. They were but pretences not realities I have hitherto served under, &amp; Justice and Honour commands me to leave them. Some Souldiers take Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in so large a sense, that if they took pay under the <hi>Turke</hi> they would not desert him: the comparison is not amisse: but sure where there is such an indifferencie, as to serve any for pay, Religion is no part of their Honour, but if they be of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> perswasion, I shall not blame them to be true to that service, no more than I do those here, if their consciences tell them decencie and order is Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and Authoritie and Magistracie Heathenish: for certain I am, there is nothing more base and unworthy a Gentleman and a Christian, than to forsake the dictates of his own reason and conscience, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in an erroneous way, because he has already entred into it: If this false opinion of Honour should be received as Orthodox, it will be in the power of every subtle Sophister, and cheating Mountebanke, to ingage men for ever in ignoble actions, because they brought them once to an opinion that conduced thereunto. And lastly, whereas the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47342:23"/>
end of War is Peace, what hope can there be of a reconciliation, or that those that have got the Regal and supreme power into their hands, should ever leave that which they have usurped, to resume that which they were borne to; or that the Officers of that Armie should consent to a Peace as long as they can have supplies of money: since that then a great part from being Colonels and Captaines, must again betake themselves to their aprons and shops, and instead of receiving pay, must bethinke themselves how to satisfie their beguiled Creditours: for my part, I am borne to no inconsiderable fortune, and as I abhorre my name should be branded with Treason, or that forfeited by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscation, so am I as loath we should ever be reduced to have a paritie in either (which is aimed at) or have both buried in the ruines of this miserable Nation.</p>
            <p>I do protest, had none of these promises wrought upon me, yet the very sight of His Majesties Armie would have done it; the discipline, unanimitic, and exact obedience thereof, the excellent conversation of so many gallant and noble personages who know no other emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than that of Honour, who dare do any thing but what is base, and (on my soul) daily expresse heartie desires of Peace (not out of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the Armie) but to prevent the ruine, and procure the happinesse of their Countrey. To conclude, what <hi>English</hi> Gentlemen that ever heard of the ancient Honour of this Kingdom, or would preserve that of himselfe and familie, can tamely see our courage (terrible some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to forreigne Nations) basely degenerate into a Rebellion against our naturall Prince, to whom malice it selfe can object no crime, and therefore casts upon Him the faults of others, and since it cannot touch His Person, quarrels at his Crown: you see Him powerfull at the head of His Armie, and may see Him glorious in His Throne of Peace, you ought not to doubt His Justice, and (if you will) you may (as I have done) obtain His mercie.</p>
            <p>Sir, I have freely told you my sense, if it hath any proportion to yours and so incline you to that effect it hath wrought in me, I shall take it (next to the condition I am in) as the greatest happinesse, and if I be so fortunate, since in these dangerous times you cannot safely convey it by Letters, let me know it by your publishing this, whereby also you may happily benefit others, and certainly oblige</p>
