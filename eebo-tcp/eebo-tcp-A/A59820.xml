            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

DISCOURSE
Concerning the Object of Religious Worship.</head>
            <div type="introduction">
               <head>The INTRODVCTION.</head>
               <p>OF all the Disputes between us and the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> there is none of greater concernment, than
that about the Object of Religious Worship.</p>
               <p>We affirm, as the Scripture has taught us,<note place="margin">4. Mat. 10.</note> that <hi>we must
worship the Lord our God and serve him only;</hi> the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> teaches, that there is a degree of Religious Worship,
which we may give to some excellent Creatures, to Angels
and Saints and Images, and the Host, and to the Reliques
of Saints and Martyrs. If they are in the right, we may
be thought very rude and uncivil at least, in denying to pay
that Worship, which is due to such excellent Creatures, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
injurious to our selves in it, by losing the benefit of their
Prayers and Patronage. If we be in the right, the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> is guilty of giving that worship to Creatures
which is due to God alone, which is acknowledged on all hands
to be the greatest of sins; and therefore this is a dispute
which can never be compremised, though we were never so
desirous of an union and reconciliation with the Church of
<hi>Rome;</hi> for the Incommunicable glory of God, and the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Souls, are too dear things to be given away in
complement to any Church.</p>
               <p>And should it appear in the next world (for I believe it
will never appear to be so in this) that we were mistaken, that
we were over-nice and curious in refusing to worship Saints
and Angels, yet ours is a much more innocent and pardonable
mistake, than that which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is guilty of, if


<pb facs="tcp:45002:3"/>
they should prove to be mistaken. We are only wanting in
some Religious Courtship, which we might innocently have
given to Saints and Angels, but which we were not bound to
give, (as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will not say, that we are) by
any express Divine Law; and therefore it is no sin against
God not to do it; and when this neglect is not owing to any
designed contempt and dis-regard of those excellent Spirits,
but to a great reverence for God, and jealousie for his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable
glory, if it were a fault, we need not doubt but
that God would pardon it, and that all good spirits, who
have such a profound veneration for God, will easily excuse
the neglect of some Ceremonies to themselves upon so great
a reason.</p>
               <p>But if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be mistaken, and gives that
worship to Creatures, which is due only to the Supreme God,
they have nothing to pretend in excuse of it; neither any
positive Law of God, which expresly forbids all Creature-worship
(as I doubt not to prove, to the satisfaction of all
impartial Readers) nor the principles of Natural Reason;
which, whatever Apologies it may make for the worship of
Saints and Angels, can never prove the necessity of it; and
it highly concerns the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
to consider, whether if their distinctions and little
appearances of reason cannot justifie their worship of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
they will be able to excuse them from the guilt of so
great a sin.</p>
               <p>But not to insist on these things now; I shall divide this
discourse into three parts.</p>
               <p>1. I shall prove from the plain evidence of Scripture,
<hi>That God alone is to be worshipped.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. I shall examine what that worship is, which is proper
and peculiar to the Supreme God.</p>
               <p>3. I shall consider those distinctions, whereby the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> justifies her worship of Saints and Angels, and
Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <head>SECTION I.</head>
               <head type="sub">That GOD alone must be Worshipped.</head>
               <p>TO make good the first point,<note place="margin">Sect. 1.</note> that we must wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
no other Being, but only God, I shall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
confine my self to Scripture evidence,
which is the most certain authority to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
this matter. For though I confess, it seems to me
a self evident and fundamental principle in natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that we must worship none but that Supreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
who made, and who governs the world, yet I find
men reason very differently about these matters.</p>
               <p>The Heathen Philosophers, who generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
one Supreme and Soveraign Deity, did not think
it incongruous, nor any affront or diminution to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
God, to ascribe an inferiour kind of Divinity, nor
to pay an inferiour degree of Religious Worship, to those
excellent Spirits, which are so much above us, and have
so great a share in the government of this lower world,
no more than it is an affront to a Soveraign Monarch, to
honour and reverence his great Ministers of State, or
peculiar Favourites. And the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as she
has corrupted Christianity with the Worship of Angels,
and Saints departed, so she defends her self with the same
Arguments and Reasons, which were long since alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Celsus</hi> and <hi>Porphyrie,</hi> and other Heathen Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
in defence of their Pagan Idolatry.</p>
               <p>And it must be confest, that these Arguments are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
popular, and have something so agreeable in them, to
the natural notions of Civil Honour and respect, which


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45002:4"/>
admits of great variety of degrees, that I do not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that such vast numbers of men, both wise and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
have been imposed on by them.</p>
               <p>For there is certainly a proportionable reverence and
respect due even to created excellencies, and every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of power challenges and commands a just regard,
and we are bound to be very thankful not only to God,
who is the first cause, and the supreme giver of all good
things, but to our immediate Benefactors also. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if there be a sort of middle Beings, as the Heathens
believed, and as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> asserts, between us
and the Supreme God, who take particular care of us,
and either by their power and interest in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the world, or by their Intercessions with the
Supreme God, can and do bestow a great many Blessings
on us, it seems as natural and necessary to fear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
to honour and worship them, and to give them
thanks for their care and patronage of us, as it is to court
a powerful Favourite, who by his interest and authority
can obtain any request we make to our Prince; and the
first seems to be no greater injury to God, than the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is to a Prince.<note place="margin">2 Col. 18.</note> Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> observes, that there
is a shew of humility in worshipping Angels; that men
dare not immediately approach so glorious a Majesty as
God is, but make their addresses by those excellent spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
which attend the Throne of God, and are the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of his Providence.</p>
               <p>But then every one who believes that there is one Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
God, who made all other Beings, though never
so perfect and excellent, must acknowledge, that as there
is nothing common to God and Creatures, so there must
be a peculiar Worship due to God, which no Creatures
can challenge any share in. It is no affront to a Prince
to pay some inferiour degrees of civil honour and respect
to his Ministers and Favourites, because as the difference


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45002:4"/>
between a Prince and his Subjects is not founded in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but in civil order; so there are different degrees of
civil respect proportioned to the different ranks and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of men in the Common-wealth. There is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of preheminency which is sacred and peculiar to the
Person of the Prince, and no Prince will suffer his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Favourite to usurp the Prerogative honours which
belong to the Crown; but while they are contented
with such respects as are due to their rank and station,
this is no injury to the Prince; for all civil honour is
not peculiar to the Prince, but only a supereminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of it, and therefore inferiour degrees of honour
may be given to other persons.</p>
               <p>But though there are different degrees of civil honour
proper to different ranks and degrees of men, who all
partake in the same nature, and are distinguisht only by
their different places in the Common-wealth; yet in this
sense there are no different degrees of Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
All Religious Worship is peculiar to the Divine
Nature, which is but one, and common only to three
Divine Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, one God
blessed for ever, Amen. Civil honour and Religious
Worship differ in the whole kind and species of actions,
and have as different objects as God and Creatures; and
we may as well argue from those different degrees of
civil honour among men, to prove that there is an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
degree of civil honour due to Beasts, as that there
is an inferiour degree of Religious Worship due to some
men. For all degrees of Religious Worship are as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
and appropriate to God, as civil respects are to
men, and as the highest degree of civil honour is to a
Soveraign Prince.</p>
               <p>However should we grant, that some excellent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
might be capable of some inferiour degrees of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Worship; yet as the Prince is the fountain of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45002:5"/>
honour, which no Subject must presume to usurp,
without a grant from his Prince, so no Creature, how
excellent soever, has any natural and inherent right to
any degree of Religious Worship and therefore we must
not presume to worship any Creature without Gods
command, nor to pay any other degree of Worship to
them, but what God has prescribed and instituted; and
the only way to know this, is to examine the Scriptures,
which is the only external revelation we have of the
will of God.</p>
               <p>Let us then inquire, what the sense of Scripture is in
this controversie; and I shall distinctly examine the
testimonies both of the Old and New Testament, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the object of Religious Worship.</p>

               <p>1. TO begin with the Old Testament;<note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> and nothing
is more plain in all the Scripture, than that the
Laws of <hi>Moses</hi> confine Religious Worship to that one
Supreme God, the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who Created the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and the Earth. For,</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>Israelites</hi> were expresly commanded to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and to Worship no other Being;
as our Saviour himself assures us, who I suppose will be
allowed for a very good Expositor of the Laws of <hi>Moses.
It is written,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4 Matth. 10. 6 Deutr. 13. 10 Deutr. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him
only shalt thou serve.</hi> In the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, from whence
our Saviour cites this Law, it is only said, <hi>Thou shalt fear
the Lord thy God, and serve him,</hi> without that addition,
<hi>of him only.</hi> And yet both the Septuagint and the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45002:5"/>
Latine, read the words as our Saviour doth, <hi>him only
shalt thou serve;</hi> and the authority of our Saviour is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to justifie this Interpretation; and withal, gives
us a general rule, which puts an end to this controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie;
that as often as we are commanded in Scripture to
worship God, we are commanded also to worship none
besides him.</p>
               <p>For indeed the first Commandment is very express in
this matter, and all other Laws which concern the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Worship, must in all reason be expounded by
that. <hi>Thou shalt have none other Gods before me.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">20 Exod. 3.</note> The
Septuagint renders it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> besides me; so does the
<hi>Chaldee, Syriack,</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> to the same sense. And it
is universally concluded by all Expositors that I have
seen, that the true interpretation of this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is, that we must Worship no other God, but the
Lord <hi>Jehovah.</hi> To pay Religious Worship to any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
does in the Scripture notion, make that Being our
God, which is the only reason, why they are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not <hi>to have any other Gods.</hi> For there is but one true
God, and therefore in a strict sense, they can have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Gods, because there are no other Gods to be had;
but whatever Beings they worship, they make that their
God by worshipping it; and so the Heathens had a
great many Gods, but the <hi>Jews</hi> are commanded to have
but one God, that is, to worship none else besides him.</p>
               <p>In other places God expresly forbids them to worship
any <hi>strange Gods, or the Gods of the people, or those Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that were round about them.</hi> And least we should
suspect,<note place="margin">6 Deutr. 14.</note> that they were forbid to worship the Gods of
the people, only because those Heathen Idolaters wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
Devils and wicked Spirits, the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi>
gives us a general notion, who are to be reputed false
Gods, and not to be worshipped. <hi>Thus shall ye say unto
them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">70 Jere. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>the Gods that have not made the Heavens and the


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45002:6"/>
Earth, even they shall perish from the Earth, and from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
these Heavens.</hi> So that whatever Being is worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
whether it be a good or a bad Spirit, which did not
make the Heavens and the Earth, is a false God to such
Worshippers: and I suppose the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will
not say, that Saints or Angels, or the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> (as
much as they magnifie her) made the Heavens and the
Earth. And then according to this rule they ought not
to be worshipt.</p>
               <p>But to put this past doubt, that the true meaning of
these Laws is to forbid the worship of any other Being
besides the Supreme God, I shall observe two or three
things in our Saviours answer to the Devils temptation,
which will give great light and strength to it.</p>
               <p>1. That our Saviour absolutely rejects the worship of
any other Being together with the Supreme God. The
thing our Saviour condemns, is not the renouncing the
worship of God for the worship of Creatures, (for the
Devil never tempted him to this) but the worship of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Being besides God, though we still continue to
worship the Supreme God. <hi>It is written, thou shalt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</hi>
Which is a plain demonstration, that men may believe &amp;
worship the Supreme God, and yet be Idolaters, if they
worship any thing else besides him. The Devil did not
desire our Saviour to renounce the worship of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
God, but was contented, that he should worship
God still, so he would but worship him also. And
therefore it is no reason to excuse the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
from Idolatry, because they worship the Supreme God,
as well as Saints and Angels; this they may do, and be
Idolaters still; for Idolatry does not consist meerly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
the worship of the Supreme God, but in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
any thing else, though we continue to worship
him. When the <hi>Jews</hi> worshipt their <hi>Baalims</hi> and false


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45002:6"/>
gods, they did not wholly renounce the worship of the
God of <hi>Israel;</hi> and the Heathens themselves, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the wisest men amongst them, did acknowledge one
Supreme God, though they worshipt a great many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Deities with him.</p>
               <p>2. Our Saviour in his answer to the Devils temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
does not urge his being a wicked and Apostate Spirit,
an enemy and a rebel against God, but gives such a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why he could not worship him, as equally excludes
all Creatures, whether good or bad Spirits, from any right
to Divine Worship. <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,
and him only shalt thou serve.</hi> Him and none else, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be good or bad Spirits, for our Saviour does
not confine his answer to either, and therefore includes
them both.</p>
               <p>When we charge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with too plain
an imitation of the Pagan Idolatry in that worship they
paid to their inf<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>riour Daemons, which was nothing
more, than what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now gives to
Saints and Angels; they think it a sufficient answer, that
the Heathens worshipt Devils and Apostate Spirits, but
they worship only the Friends and Favourites of God,
blessed Saints and Angels.</p>
               <p>Now I shall not at present examine the truth of this
pretence, but shall refer my Reader to a more Learned
person for satisfaction in this matter; but if it were true,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Stilling fleet<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s</hi> Defence of the discourse of Idolatry.</note>
yet it is nothing to the purpose, if our Saviours answer
to the Devil be good.</p>
               <p>For let us suppose, that the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> who calls
himself Christs Vicar, had at this time been in Christ's
stead to have answered the Devils temptations, and let
us be so charitable for once as to suppose that (saving al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
his indirect power over the Kingdoms of this world
in or line ad spiritualia) he would not worship the Devil
to gain all the Kingdoms of the World and the Glory of


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45002:7"/>
them. Consider then, how the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> could an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
this Temptation; <hi>All this I will give thee, if thou
wilt fall down and worship me:</hi> could he answer as our
Saviour does? <hi>It is written, thou shalt worship the Lord
thy God, and him onely shalt thou serve.</hi> How easily might
the Devil reply, Is this indeed your infallible Opinion,
and the judgment and practice of your Church <hi>to serve
God onely?</hi> do you not also serve and worship St. <hi>Paul</hi>
and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> besides a great
many other obscure and doubtful Saints? This is
down right Heresie to confine all Religious Worship
to God; Here now is matter of fact against the Pope,
that he does worship other Beings besides God, and if he
will shew any reason for his not worshipping the Devil,
he must quite alter our Saviours answer, and not plead
for himself, that he is bound to worship God and him
onely, but that he is bound to worship onely God and
good Spirits; and therefore the Devil being a wicked
and Apostate Spirit, it is not lawful to worship him. So
that if our Saviour gave a sufficient answer to the Devils
temptation, it must be equally unlawful to worship good
and bad Spirits; there may be some peculiar aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in having communion with Devils, but the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of worshipping good and bad Spirits is the
same.</p>
               <p>3. Our Saviours answer to the Devil, appropriates
all kinds and degrees of Religious Worship to God alone.
The Devil was not then so good a School-man, as
nicely to distinguish &amp; dispute the degrees of Religious
Worship with our Saviour, but would have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with any degree of Religious Worship. He did
not pretend to be the Supreme God, nor to have the
disposal of all the Kingdoms of the world in his own
right; but acknowledges,<note place="margin">4 Luke 6.</note> that <hi>it was delivered to him,</hi>
and now by vertue of that grant, <hi>he gives it to whom he


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45002:7"/>
will.</hi> Now it is impossible in the nature of the thing to
worship any Being as Supreme, whom at the same
time, we acknowledge not to be Supreme. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Devil asks no more of our Saviour, than that <hi>he
would fall down and worship him;</hi> which is such an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
degree of Worship, as Papists every day pay to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
and Saints; and yet this our Saviour refuses to
do, and that for this reason, that we must worship God
only, which must signifie, that we must not give the
least degree of Divine Worship to any Creatures; or
else it is not a satisfactory answer to the Devils Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who did not require any certain and determinate
degree of Worship, but left him at liberty to use what
distinctions he pleased, and to pay what degree of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
he saw fit; whether absolute or relative, supreme
or subordinate, terminative or transient, so he would
but fall down and worship him any way, or in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
he left him to be his own Schoolman and Cas<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ist;
but of this more presently.</p>
               <p>11. As the Laws of <hi>Moses</hi> in general, appropriate all
Religious Worship to God, command us to worship God,
and him only, so the whole Jewish Rellgion was fitted
only for the worship of the Lord <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I suppose our Adversaries will not deny, that the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
and Temple at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was peculiarly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
to the honour and worship of the Lord <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah:</hi>
this was the house where he dwelt, where he plac<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> his
Name, and the Symbols of his presence. It was a
great profanation of that holy place, to have the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of any strange Gods set up in it; and yet this was
the only place of Worship appointed by the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
they had but one Temple to worship in, and this
one Temple consecrated to the peculiar worship of one
God; which is a plain demonstration, that they were
not allowed to worship any other God, because they
had no place to worship him in.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:45002:8"/>
And this I think is a plain proof, that all that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
which was confined to their Temple, or related to
it, was peculiar to the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> because that was
his house, and then all the Jewish worship was so, which
was either to be performed at the Temple, or had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
and dependance on the Temple worship.</p>
               <p>Sacrifice was the principal part of the Jewish worship,
and this we know was confined to the Temple. <hi>Moses</hi>
expresly commands <hi>Israel, Take heed to thy self, that
thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou
seest.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">12 Deut. 13, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>But in the place which the Lord shall choose in one
of thy Tribes, there shalt thou offer thy burnt offerings, and
there shult thou do all that I command thee.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
indeed, especially before the building of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
did erect Altars at other places for occasional Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
for as God reserved a liberty to himself to dispense
with his own Law in extraordinary cases, so it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed,
that what was done by Prophets, was done by a
Divine command; but there was to be no ordinary or
standing Altar for Sacrifice, but at the Tabernacle or
Temple; this we may see in that dispute which had like
to have hapned between the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> and the
Tribes of <hi>Reuben</hi> and <hi>Gad,</hi> and the half Tribe of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseh,</hi>
about the Altar of Testimony, which these two
Tribes and a half built on the other side of <hi>Jordan.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">22 Joshua.</note> It
was agreed on all hands, that had it been intended for
an Altar for Sacrifice, it had been Rebellion against the
Lord to have built any Altar beside the Altar of the
Lord,<note place="margin">v. 16. 19. 22, 23.</note> though they had offered no Sacrifice but to the
Lord <hi>Jehovah.</hi> The same is evident from Gods dislike
of their offering Sacrifices in their high places, though
they sacrificed only to the God of <hi>Israel.</hi> So that all
Sacrifices were to be offered at the Temple on the Altar
of God, and therefore were offered only to that God,
whose Temple and Altar it was. And indeed this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45002:8"/>
provided for in the Law.<note place="margin">22 Exod. 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <hi>He that sacrificeth to
any God, but to the Lord only, shall be utterly destroyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as their Sacrifices were appropriated to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
so in some sense were their Prayers, which were
offered up in vertue of their Sacrifice. And therefore
this is a peculiar name for the Temple, that it was <hi>the
House of Prayer.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">56 Isai. 7. 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Matth. 13. 1 King 8.</note> Here God was more immediately
present to hear those Prayers which were offered to him,
according to <hi>Solomons</hi> Prayer at the Dedication of the
Temple. It is true, the devout <hi>Jews</hi> did pray to God
where ever they were, though at a great distance from
the Temple, whether in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> or out of it,
but then there are two things, which shew that relation
their Prayers had to the Temple Worship. 1. That
their stated hours of Prayer were the hours of Sacrifice,
which plainly signified, that they offered up their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in conjunction with those Sacrifices, which were at
that time offered in the Temple; and therefore that
they prayed only to that God to whom they sacrificed;
for we must consider, that the constant morning and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
Sacrifices, were not particular Sacrifices, but
were offered for the whole Congregation of <hi>Israel;</hi> and
therefore every man had a share in them. Hence the
time of offering the Sacrifice, is called the hour of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
Thus <hi>Peter and John went up together into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
at the hour of Prayer, being the ninth hour;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3 Acts 1.</note> that is
the time of the Evening Sacrifice. Hence are such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
as that of the Psalmist, <hi>Let my Prayer be set
before thee as Incense, and the lifting up of my hands, as the
Evening Sacrifice.</hi> Nay, it is most probable, that when
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> and the Temple were destroyed, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
carryed captive into <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the daily Sacrifice
ceast, yet the devout people observed the hour of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for their Prayers. Thus <hi>Daniel</hi> prayed three times
a day, which most likely were Evening and Morning,


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45002:9"/>
and Noon.<note place="margin">6 Dan. 10. 55 Psalm. 17.</note> Where Evening and Morning no doubt
signifie the time of the Evening and Morning Sacrifice;
and we are told, that the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> came to <hi>Daniel</hi>
while he was praying,<note place="margin">9. Dan. 21.</note> and touched him about the time
of the Evening oblation. But 2ly besides this, when
they offered up their Prayers to God in other parts of
the Nation, or in other Countries, they prayed towards
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the Temple of God, as we now lift up
our eyes to Heaven, where God dwells. Thus <hi>Solomon</hi>
in his Prayer of Dedication, does not only beg of God
to hear those Prayers, which were made to him in
that house, but those also which were made towards it, as
the words must signifie in several places. In general he
prays,<note place="margin">1 Kings 8. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>Hearken thou to the Prayer of thy servant, and of
thy people</hi> Israel, <hi>when they shall pray towards this place;</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may signifie both in and towards this place,
and here includes both, as appears from the following
instances, which refer both to Prayers made in the
Temple, and to those Prayers which were made towards
the Temple by persons who were at a distance. Thus
in what ever part of the Nation they wanted rain, which
might be at a great distance from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> they were
to pray towards this place.<note place="margin">v. 35.</note> The same was to be done
in case of Famine and Pestilence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or if they were
besieged in any of their Cities, when they could not go
to the Temple to pray.<note place="margin">v. 37.</note> Nay, <hi>What Prayer or supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
soever shall be made by any man, or by all thy people</hi> Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
<hi>which shall know every man the plague of his own heart,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 39.</note>
                  <hi>and spread forth his hands towards this house, then hear
thou in Heaven thy dwelling place and forgive.</hi> Thus
when they went out to battle, they were to pray to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 44.</note> and towards the Temple.
And when they were carryed captive into their enemies
land, they were to pray to God toward the land which
God had given them, towards the Holy City, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45002:9"/>
the Temple. And accordingly it was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
practice of <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 48.</note> when he was in <hi>Babylon,</hi> to pray
three times a day to God, with his windows open in his
chamber toward <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">6. Dan. 10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>So that though the Temple were not the onely place
where they might lawfully pray to God; yet all their
Prayers were to be directed to the Temple, and receive
their vertue and acceptation from their relation to the
Temple and the Temple-Worship. This was a standing
rule for the whole Jewish Nation, that whenever they
prayed, they offered up their prayers in the Temple or
towards it; and this is generally observed by them to
this day: For the reason why they generally now turn
themselves towards the East when they pray, is not out
of any respect to the rising of the Sun, but because they
live in Western Countries;<note place="margin">Bu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>torsii Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag. Jud. p. 222</note> and so by turning to the
East, they look towards <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the place where
the Temple stood. And this is as plain evidence, that
all their Prayers as well as Sacrifices, were to be offered
onely to that God who dwelt in the Temple. And
therefore as they are commanded to pray to God,<note place="margin">65. Psalm. 2. 23 Joshua 7<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> and
this is made the peculiar attribute of God, <hi>that he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
prayers, and therefore unto him shall all flesh come;</hi> so
they are expresly commanded <hi>not to make mention of the
name of the Heathen gods;</hi> that is, not to pray to them;
the prayers of the Heathens consisting of a frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
of the names of their gods, as we see in the
priests of <hi>Baal,</hi> who cried from morning till evening,<note place="margin">1 Kings 18. 26.</note>
saying, <hi>O Baal hear us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Jews were commanded to bring all their
Vows, first Fruits, Tythes, and Offerings, to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which is a plain sign to whom they were offered.
The Seventh-day-Sabbath was a sign that they worshipt
that God who created the world in six days, and rested
on the seventh, and delivered them from their Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45002:10"/>
Bondage, and gave them rest in that good Land, both
which reasons are assigned by <hi>Moses,</hi> and therefore God
commands them by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">20 Ezek. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Hallow my sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,
and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye
may know that I am the Lord your God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They had but three solemn Festivals every year, and
they were all in remembrance of the great Works of
God, and all the Males were to go up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to
keep these Feasts; and therefore all these were the
Feasts of the Lord <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as they were to pray onely to God, so they were
onely to swear by his Name, which is another part of
Religious Worship;<note place="margin">10 Deut 21. 19 Isai. 18.</note> and therefore to swear by the Lord
of Hosts is called the Language of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that all the parts of the Jewish Worship were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to the Lord Jehovah, he was the onely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of their dread and fear, and religious Adorations.
And when we consider that God had chosen them to
be a peculiar people to himself, that the Land was a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Land, Gods peculiar Inheritance, which he gave by
promise to their Fathers, and the Temple was his House
where he dwelt among them, it cannot be expected that
any other Gods might be worshipt by such a people, in
such a Land, and in such a house, as God had appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to himself.</p>
               <p>3. It is very considerable, that we have no approved
example under the Law, of any worship pay'd to Saints
or Angels, or any other Being, but God alone. We have
too many sad examples of the Idolatry of the Jews both
in worshipping the Molten Calf which <hi>Aaron</hi> made, and
<hi>Jeroboams</hi> Calves, and <hi>Baalim</hi>'s, and other Heathen
gods; but had it been allowed by their Law to have
pay'd any inferiour degree of Religious Worship to
Saints and Angels (which is now asserted by the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be a matter of such great benefit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45002:10"/>
to mankind) it is very strange, that we should not
have one example of it throughout the Scripture, nor
any authentick Records among the Jewish Writers: All
the Psalms of <hi>David</hi> are directed to God alone, and yet
we cannot think but such a devout man would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
some Hymns upon his Patron and tutelar Saints,
had he worshipt any such, as well as the Papists do now.</p>
               <p>This the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> sees and acknowledges, and
thinks she answers too, when she gives us the reason why
it could not be so under the Law; because those Old
Testament-Saints were not then admitted into Heaven,
to the immediate vision and fruition of God; Heaven-gates
were not opened till the Resurrection and Ascensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Saviour, and therefore those blessed Spirits were
not in a condition to be our Intercessors and Mediators,
till they were received into Heaven; but now Saints
and Martyrs ascend directly into Heaven, and reign with
Christ in Glory, and it seems share with him in his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Worship and Glory too.</p>
               <p>Now 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whether this be so or not, the Scriptures assign
no such reason for it; and therefore it is likely there
might be other reasons, and I think I have made it very
plain that there was. We are not enquiring for what
reasons the Jewish Church did not worship Saint and
Angels, but whether they did worship them or not; and
it appears that they never did; so that we have neither
precept nor example for this, during all the time of the
Jewish Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which is all we intend to prove by
this argument.</p>
               <p>2. But yet it is evident, that this is not a good reason
why the Jews did not worship Angels under the Law.
For certainly Angels were as much in Heaven then, as
they are now, whatever Saints were. They are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
in the Old Testament, as the constant Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
and Retinue of God, and the great Ministers of his


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45002:11"/>
Providence, and therefore they were as capable of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worship in the time of the Law, as they are now,
nay, I think, a little more. For the Law it self was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by the Ministry of Angels, and their appearances
were more frequent and familiar, and the world seemed
to be more under the Government of Angels then, than
it is now, since Christ is made the Head of the Church,
and exalted above all principalities and powers.</p>
               <p>And therefore sometimes the Advocates of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> make some little offers to prove the worship of
Angels in those days: to this purpose they alledge that
form of Benediction, which <hi>Jacob</hi> used in blessing the
Sons of <hi>Joseph:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Gen. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>The Angel which redeemed me from all
evil, bless the Lads.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But 1. This is not a direct prayer to the Angel, but
onely his committing of them to the care and patronage
of that Angel, with a prayer to God for that purpose:
And if he by experience had found that God had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Angel to defend and protect him, it was but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to pray to God, that the same Angel might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
his posterity.</p>
               <p>2. But yet according to the sense of the Antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
this was no created Angel and Spirit, but the Son
and Word of God, the Angel of the presence, who is
so often in Scripture stiled <hi>Jehovah,</hi> a name which can
belong to no created Spirit. And it is no hard matter
to make it highly probable, that this is that Angel who
redeemed <hi>Jacob</hi> out of all his troubles. But it is strange
if Angels were worshipt under the Old Testament, we
should have no clearer and plainer evidence of it, than
such a single Text, which was never expounded either
by any Jewish or Christian Writers to this sense, till of
late days; and here the Priests of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
are to be put in mind of their Oath to expound Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
according to the unanimous consent of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Fathers.</p>

what they teach us concerning the object of our

these considerations.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That they could not do it. Had they ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to set up the worship of any other Beings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the One Supreme God, the Lord</hi> Jehovah, <hi>the</hi> Jews
<hi>were expresly commanded by their Law not to believe
them, nor hearken to them, whatever signs and wonders
and miracles they had wrought.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">13 Deut. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> If there arise among
you a Prophet or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a

hearken unto the words of the Prophet, or that dreamer of
dreams; for the Lord your God proveth you, to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with
all your Soul. Ye shall walk after the Lord your God, and
fear him, and keep his Commandments, and obey his voice,
and you shall serve him, and cleave unto him. And that
Prophet or dreamer of dreams shall be put to death, <hi>&amp;c.

               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:45002:12"/>
1. When they are forbidden to hearken to any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
who seduces them to the worship of any other
Gods, this must be extended to all those instances of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous
worship, which are forbid by the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
whatever is opposed to the worship of one Supreme
and Soveraign Being, the Lord <hi>Jehovah.</hi> And therefore
whether these Prophets seduced them from the worship
of the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> to the worship of other Gods; or
perswaded them to worship other Gods besides the Lord
<hi>Jehovah,</hi> whether they were any of those Gods which
were at that time worshipt by other Nations, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Gods, whom the ignorance and superstition of the
people should create in after ages, whether good or bad
Spirits, the case is the same; whoever perswaded them
to worship any other Being with or besides the Supreme
God, was to be rejected by them; for this is the sense of
the Mosaical Laws concerning the worship of one Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
God, as I have already proved, and the serving
other Gods in this place, is opposed to the worship of
one God, and therefore must include whatever accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> is contrary to the worship of
one Supreme Being.</p>
               <p>2. This Law makes the worship of one God eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and unchangeable. There is no way of altering any
Divine Laws, but by a new revelation of Gods will, and
there is no way to give Authority to such a revelation,
but by Miracles or Prophesie; but in this case Miracles
and Prophesie it self can give no authority, because God
himself has expresly forbid us to hearken to any Prophet,
whatever signs or wonders are wrought by him, who
teacheth the worship of any other Being besides the one
Supreme God. So that the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
forbid the worship of any other Being besides God,
and as expresly forbid us to hearken to any Prophet,
though a worker of Miracles, who teaches any other


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45002:12"/>
worship, it is impossible, that this Law should ever be
altered, because we are before-hand warned by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
not to give credit to any Prophet, whatever he be,
or whatever he do, who attempts any alteration of it.
And therefore had Christ or his Apostles taught the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of Saints and Angels, it had been a just reason for
the unbelief of the <hi>Jews,</hi> notwithstanding all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
that were wrought by them; and it is well the
<hi>Jews</hi> never had any just occasion to make this objection
against our Saviour; for if they had, I know not how it
would have been answered. I say a <hi>just occasion,</hi> for the
<hi>Jews</hi> did urge this very Law against him before <hi>Pilate.
We have a Law, and by our Law he ought to die,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">19. John 7.</note> 
                  <hi>because
he made himself the Son of God.</hi> In which they refer to
that discourse of our Saviour, 10. <hi>John</hi> 29, 30. where he
affirms that God is his Father, and plainly tells them, <hi>I
and my Father are one,</hi> for which saying they attempt to
stone him for Blasphemy, and that being a man, he made
himself a God. <hi>v.</hi> 33. But though he did indeed (as the
<hi>Jews</hi> rightly inferred) make himself a God by this say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yet he did not preach any new God to them, but
affirmed himself to be one with his Father, that same
Supreme God, the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> whom they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to worship by their Law; he made no alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the object of their worship, but only did more
clearly and distinctly reveal the Father to them, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesting
himself in and by his only begotten Son. And
therefore he did not offend against this Law, by sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
them to the worship of any other Gods besides the
Lord <hi>Jehovah;</hi> which if he had done, their accusation
had been just, and all the Miracles which he did, could
not have secured him from the guilt and punishment of
an Impostor.</p>
               <p>Which shews us, what force there is in that Argument,
which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> urges from those Miracles:


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45002:13"/>
which have been wrought at the Tombs of Martyrs, to
prove the Religious invocation of them; if such Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
were ever wrought, it was in testimony to the
truth of Christianity, for which they suffered, not to
betray men to a superstitious and idolatrous worship of
them; ten thousand Miracles should never convince me
of the lawfulness of praying to Saints departed, while I
have such a plain and express Law against believing all
Miracles upon any such account.</p>
               <p>Nor can it reasonably be said, that this Law was given
only to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and therefore obliges none but them;
for we must remember, that Christ was originally sent
to the <hi>Jews,</hi> to the lost sheep of the house of <hi>Israel;</hi>
and therefore by this Law, he was bound not to teach
the worship of any other Beings, under the penalty of
death; and they were bound not to own and receive
him if he did; and therefore it was impossible for the
true Messias to introduce the worship of any Being, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the one Supreme God; and if Christ could not
teach any such Doctrine, I know not how the worship
of Saints and Angels should ever come to be a Doctrine
of Christianity. For what Christ himself cannot do, none
of his Followers may, who had no other Commission
but to teach those things which they had learnt from
him; and he could not give commission to preach such,
Doctrines, as he himself had no authority to preach.</p>
               <p>So that though this Law was not originally given to
the Gentiles, but only to the Jews; yet it equally obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
the Christian Church, whether Jews or Gentiles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Christ himself, who was the Author of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
was obliged by it. The worship of one Supreme
God, and of none else, is as fundamental to Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as it is to Judaism; for Christianity is now, or ought
to be, the Religion of the Jews, as well as Gentiles;
and yet the Jews are expresly forbid by this Law ever to


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45002:13"/>
own any Religion, which allows the worship of any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
besides God: and therefore the worship of one God
and none else, must be fundamental in Christianity, if
the people of the Jews are, or ever were bound to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the Faith of Christ.</p>
            </div>

               <head>SECT. IV.</head>
               <p>2. ANd therefore I observe in the next place, that
Christ and his Apostles have made no alteration
at all in the object of our worship. Christ urges, that
Old Testament Law in answer to the Devils Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<hi>It is written,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4 Matth. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and
him only shalt thou serve.</hi> Which it seems, is as standing
a Law after the appearance of Christ, as it was before.
He gives no other direction to his Disciples, but to pray
to their Heavenly Father, and in that form of prayer
which he gave them, he teaches them to address their
prayer neither to Saints nor Angels, but to God onely.
<hi>Our Father which art in heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When St. <hi>Paul</hi> charges the Heathens with Idolatry, he
does it upon this account, that they joyned the worship
of Creatures, with the worship of the Supreme God.
<hi>Because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as
God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Rom. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>neither were thankful, but became vain in their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
and their foolish heart was darkned.</hi> Where the
Apostle acknowledges, that they did know God, that
they did own that Supreme and Soveraign Being who
made the world; and does suppose, that they did wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him also. For he does not charge them with renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the worship of that God who made the world; but
that they did <hi>not glorifie him as God;</hi> which only taxes
the manner of their worship. And wherein that was
faulty he declares in the following verses. As that they
made mean and vile representations of him, that <hi>they


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45002:14"/>
changed the glory of the uncorruptible God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>into an Image
made like to corruptible man, and to birds and four footed
beasts, and creeping things.</hi> And thus <hi>changed the truth
of God into a lie.</hi> But this was not the only fault, but they
also gave his incommunicable worship to Creatures,
<hi>and worshipped and served the Creature more than the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 25.</note>
                  <hi>who is blessed for ever, Amen.</hi> Which words do
plainly suppose, that they did worship the Creator of all
things, but besides the Creator, (for so <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may signifie)
they worshipped the Creature also; which proves that
the worship of the Supreme God will not excuse those
from Idolatry, who worship any thing else besides him.
For the opposition lies between the Creator, and the
Creature, be it a good or a bad Creature, it matters not
as to Religious Worship, which must be given to neither.
Or if we render the words, as our Translators do, <hi>more
than the Creator,</hi> (for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is often used comparatively)
yet so it supposes, that they did worship the Creator, and
when they are said to worship the Creature <hi>more,</hi> that
cannot signifie a higher degree of worship, but more
frequent addresses; and thus the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> more than the Creator; for they
say ten prayers (if they be prayers) to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>
for one to God; ten <hi>Ave Maries</hi> for one <hi>Pater noster.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The same Apostle determines this matter in as plain
words as can be:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>For though there be, that are called
Gods, whether in Heaven or in Earth, as there be Gods ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and Lords many; but to us there is but one God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
of whom are all things, and we in him, and one Lord
Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.</hi> Where
in opposition to the Pagan Idolatry, who worshipt a
great many Gods, not as Supreme Independent Deities
(for they acknowledged but one Supreme God, who
made all the other Gods) but either as sharers in the
Government of the World, or Mediators and Intercessors


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45002:14"/>
for them with the Supreme God, the Apostle plainly
asserts, That to us Christians there is but one God the
Maker of all Things, and one Lord Jesus Christ our
great Mediator and Advocate with God the Father; that
is, that we must worship none else. And that none of
the distinctions, which are used by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
to justifie that Worship, which they pay to Saints and
Angels, can have any place here, is evident from this
consideration: For either these distinctions were known,
or they were not known, when the Apostle wrote this,
and in both cases his silence is an argument against them.
If they were known, he rejects them, and determines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them; for he affirms absolutely without the <hi>salvo</hi>
of any distinctions, that we have but one God, and one
Mediator; that is, that we must worship no more. If they
were not known (as it is likely they were not, because
the Apostle takes no notice of them) it is a plain argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that these distinctions are of no use, unless they
will say, that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was guided by an Infallible
Spirit, was ignorant of some very useful and material
notions about the object of Worship. If the Apostle
did not know these distinctions, it is evident they are of
a late date, and therefore can have no authority against
an Apostolical determination: If he did not know them,
he could have no regard to them, and therefore made
no allowance for such exceptions.</p>
               <p>Nay, the same Apostle does not only give us such ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
rules, as necessarily exclude the worship of Saints
and Angels, but does expresly condemn it, and warns
the Christians against it. He foretels of the Apostasie
of the latter days,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 1.</note> wherein <hi>some shall depart from the
Faith, giving heed to seducing Spirits, and the doctrine of
Devils,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, The doctrine of Daemons, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of worshipping Daemons, or some new inferiour
Deity, Saints, or Angels, or whatever they are, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45002:15"/>
and Intercessors between God and men. This
is the true notion of the doctrine of Daemons amongst
the Heathens,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Joseph Medes</hi> Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times.</note> and the Apostle tells us, the time shall
come, when some Christians (for it is evident he speaks
here of the Apostasie of Christians) shall fall into the
same Idolatry; which is an exact prophecy of what we
now see done in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who have the same
notion of their Saints and Angels, and pay the same
worship to them, which the Heathens formerly did to
their Daemons or inferiour Gods.</p>
               <p>3. And as a further confirmation of this, I observe,
that the Gospel of our Saviour forbids Idolatry,
without giving us any new notion of Idolatry; and
therefore it has made no alteration at all in this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
of the worship of one God, which <hi>Moses</hi> so
expresly commanded the Jews to observe. For the
Gospel was preacht to the Jews as well as to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;
nay, the Jews had the first and most undoubted
right to it, as being the posterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to whom
the promise of the Messias was made; and therefore
as the Law was at first given them by <hi>Moses,</hi> so it did still
oblige them in all such cases, wherein the Gospel did not
in express terms make a change and alteration of the
Law; and therefore since there was no such alteration
made, and yet the Law against Idolatry renewed and
confirmed by the authority of the Gospel, what could
the Jews understand else by Idolatry, but what was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
Idolatry by the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> that is, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of any other Being besides the Supreme God, the
Lord <hi>Jehovah.</hi> And since it is evident, that there are
not two Gospels, one for the Jews, and another for the
Gentiles, all Christians, whether Jews or Gentiles, must
be under the obligation of the same Law, to worship on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one God.</p>
               <p>The notion of Idolatry must alter as the object of


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45002:15"/>
Religious Worship does. If we must worship one God,
and none besides him, then it is Idolatry to worship any
other Being but the Supreme God; for Idolatry consists
in giving Religious Worship to such Beings, as we ought
not to worship; and by the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> they were to
worship none but God; and therefore the worship of
any other Being was Idolatry. But if the object of our
worship be enlarged, and the Gospel has made it lawful
to worship Saints and Angels, then we must seek out
some other notion of Idolatry, that it consists in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
wicked Spirits, or in giving Supreme and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
worship to inferiour Deities, which the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> thinks impossible in the nature of the thing,
for any man to do, who knows them to be inferiour
Spirits. But if Idolatry be the same under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
that it was under the Old, the object of our
worship must be the same too; and we have reason to
believe, that it is the same, when we are commanded to
keep our selves from Idols, and to flie from Idolatry,
but are no where in the New Testament expresly told,
what this Idolatry is; which supposes, that we must learn
what it is, from some antecedent Laws, and there were
no such Laws in being but the Laws of <hi>Moses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The only thing that can be said in this case, is, that
the Apostle refers them not to any written Law,
but to the natural notions of Idolatry: but with
what reason this is said, will soon appear, if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to whom the Apostle writes; and they were
both Jewish and Heathen Converts. As for the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
they had corrupted all their natural notions of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry,
and had no sense at all of this sin till they were
converted to Christianity; and therefore they were not
likely to understand the true notion of Idolatry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being taught it; and it is not probable the Apostles
would leave them to guess what Idolatry is. As for the


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45002:16"/>
Jews, God would not from the beginning trust to their
natural notions, but gave them express Laws about Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
which though they are the same Laws which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
reason dictates to us, as most agreeable to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and worship of God, yet since the experience of the
world, which was over-run by Idolatrous worship, did
sufficiently prove, that all men do not use their reason
aright in these matters, God would not trust to the use
of their reason in the weighty concernments of his own
worship and glory, but gives them an express positive
Law about it; and Christ and his Apostles having done
nothing to repeal this Law, they leave them under the
authority of it; and when they warn them against Idols
and Idolatry, without giving them any new Laws about
it, must in all reason be presumed to refer them to those
Laws, which they already had.</p>

               <head>SECT. V.</head>
               <p>4. AS a farther proof of this, I observe, that Christ
and his Apostles did not abrogate, but only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete

great zeal and earnestness disowns any such intention or
design.<note place="margin">5. Mat. 17.</note>

given any new Laws contrary to the Laws of <hi>Moses,</hi> it had
justified the Jews in their unbelief, for God by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Isaiah,</hi> had given them this express rule to examine
all new Doctrines by;<note place="margin">8. Isai. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>To the law and the testimony, if
they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no
light in them;</hi> and that Christ himself is not excepted
from this rule, appears in this, that this is joyned with
the prophesie of the Messias, both before and after; as
you may see in 8 <hi>Isai.</hi> 13, 14. and 9 <hi>Chap.</hi> 6, 7. and
therefore Christ and his Apostles always make their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals
to the writings of the Old Testament, and St. <hi>Paul</hi>
in all his disputes with the Jews urges them with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
authority but the Scriptures; and thô the Miracles
which were wrought by the Apostles did move the Jews
to hearken to them, and greatly dispose them to believe
their Doctrine, yet it was the authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
whereon their Faith was founded. As St. <hi>Peter</hi>
tells those to whom he wrote, that though they preacht
nothing to them concerning the coming of Christ, but
what they were eye-witnesses of; and though God had
given testimony to him by a voice from Heaven, which
they heard, when they were with him in the holy Mount,
yet he adds, <hi>We have also a more sure word of prophesie,
whereunto ye do well,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 16, 17, 18, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>that ye take heed, as to a light, that
shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star
arise in your hearts.</hi> That is the Scriptures of the Old
Testament; and therefore the Jews of <hi>Berea</hi> are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commended for their diligence in searching the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
and examining St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine by them;<note place="margin">17. Acts 10, 11.</note> and
this is assigned as the reason why many of them belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>To apply this then to our present purpose, I observe,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:45002:17"/>
1. That if Christ did not make any new Laws in
contradiction to the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> then he could make
no alteration in the object of Religious Worship. He
could not introduce the worship of Saints and Angels
without contradicting that Law, which commands us
to worship no other Being but the one Supreme God,
For the worship of Saints and Angels together with the
Supreme God, is a direct contradiction to that Law,
which commands us to worship God alone; though we
should suppose, that in the nature of the thing, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of Saints and Angels were consistent with the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the Supreme God, yet it is not consistent with
that Law, which commands us to worship none but God.
So that let this be a natural or positive Law, or whatever
men please to call it, it is a very plain and express Law,
and Christ never did contradict any express Law of
God.</p>
               <p>It is true, that Typical and Ceremonial Worship,
which God commanded the Jews to observe, is now out
of date under the Gospel, and does no longer oblige
Christians; but the reason of that is, because it has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
its accomplishment and perfection in Christ. Christ
has perfected the Jewish Sacrifices, and put an end to
them, by offering a more perfect and meritorious sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
even the sacrifice of himself. The Circumcision,
Washings, Purifications of the Law, are perfected by the
Laws of internal purity. The external Ceremonies of
the Law cease, but they are perfected by an Evangelical
righteousness. But this I say, that Christ never repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any Mosaical Law, but by fulfilling and perfecting it.
He came not to destroy the Law, but to fulfil. Now
methinks I need not prove, that the worship of Saints
and Angels is not a fulfilling, but a destroying that Law,
which commands us to worship none but God. And it
is not enough to say, that these are positive Laws given


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45002:17"/>
to the Jews, (though that be said without any reason)
for let them shew me any positive Law relating to the
Worship of God, which Christ has wholly abrogated
without fulfilling it.</p>
               <p>2. Yet as a farther proof, that Christ has made no
alteration in the object of our worship, that he has not
introduced the worship of Saints or Angels, or Images,
into the Christian Church, which was so expresly forbid
by the Jewish Law, I observe that according to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
own rule, that <hi>he came not to destroy the Law and
the Prophets, but to fulfil;</hi> these Laws of worshipping
one God, and none besides him, were not lyable to any
change and alteration, because there was nothing to be
perfected or fulfilled in them. He made no change or
alteration but by way of perfecting and fulfilling; and
therefore those Laws which had nothing to be fulfilled,
must remain as they were without any change.</p>
               <p>To perfect or fulfil a Law, must either signifie to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
what was prefigured by it, and thus Christ ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
all the types and prophesies of the Law, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to his Person, or his undertaking, as the Jewish
Priesthood, and Sacrifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or to prescribe that real
righteousness which was signified and represented by the
outward ceremony, and so Christ fulfilled the Laws of
Circumcision, Washings, Purifications, Sabbaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by
commanding the Circumcision of the heart, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of mind and spirit: or by supplying what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective;
and thus he fulfilled the moral Law by new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of vertue, by requiring something more perfect
of us, than what the letter of the Mosaical Law enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
These are all the ways that I know of, and all that
we have any instances of in Scripture of fulfilling Laws.</p>
               <p>Now I suppose, no man will say, that the first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
which forbids the worship of any other Gods
besides the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> is a Typical Law, for pray


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45002:18"/>
what is it a Type of? nor can any pretend that the first
Commandment is a Ceremonial Law, for it prescribes
no rite of worship at all, but only determines the object
of worship.</p>
               <p>As for the third way of fulfilling Laws, by perfecting
them with some new instances and degrees of vertue, it
can have no place here, for this Law is as perfect as it can
be. For it is a Negative Law, <hi>Thou shalt have none other
God.</hi> Now that which is forbid without any reserve or
limitation, is perfectly and absolutely forbid. There are
no degrees of nothing, though there are several degrees
of perfection in things which have a being; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though there are degrees in affirmative Laws, for
some Laws may require greater attainments than other;
and one man may do better than another, and yet both
do that which is good; yet there are no degrees in not
doing a thing, and no Law can do more than forbid
that, which the Law-giver will not have done.</p>
               <p>And besides, this way of fulfilling Laws, does not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
any command, but adds to it; it may restrain
those liberties which were formerly indulged, but it
does not forbid any thing which was formerly our duty
to do; for when God requires greater degrees of vertue
from us, he does not forbid the less. And therefore in
this way, Christ might forbid more than was forbid by
the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> but we cannot suppose that he gave
liberty to do that which the Law forbids, which is not
to perfect, but to abrogate a Law.</p>
               <p>But to put an end to this dispute; if Christ have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
these Laws by indulging the worship of Saints
and Angels under the Gospel, which was so expresly
forbidden by the Law, then it seems the worship of Saints
and Angels is a more perfect state of Religion, than the
worship of the one Supreme God alone.</p>
               <p>If this be true, then though the Heathens might mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45002:18"/>
in the object of their Worship, yet the manner of
their worship was more perfect and excellent, than what
God himself prescribed the Jews. For they worshipt
a great many inferiour Deities, as well as the Supreme
God; and if this be the most perfect and excellent wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
it is wonderful to me, that God should forbid it in
the worship of himself; that he should prescribe a more
imperfect worship to his own people, than the Heathens
paid to their Gods.</p>
               <p>For to say that God forbade the worship of any Being
besides himself, because this liberty had been abused by
the Heathens to Idolatry, is no reason at all. For though
we should suppose that the Heathens worshipt evil spirits
for Gods, this had been easily prevented, had God told
them what Saints and Angels they should have made
their addresses to; and this had been a more likely way
to cure them of Idolatry, than to have forbad the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of all inferiour Deities; for when they had such
numerous Deities of their own, to have made their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to, they would have been more easily weaned
from the Gods of other Countries.</p>
               <p>And we have reason to believe, so it would have been,
had God been pleased with this way of Worship, for he
would not reject any part of Religious Worship, meerly
because it had been abused by Idolaters. The Heathens
sacrificed to Idols, and yet he commands the Jews to
offer Sacrifices to himself, and so no doubt he would have
commanded the worship of Saints and Angels, had he
been as well pleased with this, as he was with Sacrifices;
had it been a more perfect state of Religion than to
worship God only, and without any Image.</p>
               <p>When God chose the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> and separated
them from the rest of the world, to his own peculiar
worship and service, we cannot suppose that he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to forbid any acts of worship, which were a real


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45002:19"/>
honour to the Divine Nature, much less to forbid the
most excellent and perfect acts of worship; for he who
is so jealous of his glory, will no more part with it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
then he will give it to another; and therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
the Typical nature of that dispensation, the whole
intention of the Mosaical Law was to correct those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses,
which the rest of the world was guilty of in their
Religious Worship, which either respected the object or
the acts of worship; that they worshipt that for God,
which was not God; or that they thought to honour
God by such acts, as were so far from being an honour,
that they were a reproach to the Divine Nature. And
whatever is forbid in the worship of God, unless there
be some Mystical and Typical reasons for it, must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to one of those causes. This account God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
gives, why he forbids the worship of any Being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
himself, or the worship of graven Images. <hi>I am
the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">42. Isai. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>that is my Name, and my glory will I not give to
another, nor my praise to graven Images.</hi> Whatever is
his true glory, he reserves to himself, and therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
did forbid any act of worship which was truly so;
but he will not give his glory to another, and for that
reason forbids the worship of graven Images, or any
thing besides himself; and if this was not his glory then,
much less the most perfect and excellent part of worship,
I know not how it should come to be his glory now, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the Divine Nature changes and alters too.</p>
               <p>So that Gods having forbid by the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> the
worship of any other Being besides himself, is a very
strong presumption, that the worship of Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
(whatever fine excuses and Apologies may be made
for it, yet at least) is not a more perfect state of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
than to worship God alone. For though God may
not always think fit to command the highest degrees of
perfection, yet there never can be any reason to forbid


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:45002:19"/>
it. But let us now consider the nature and reason of the
thing, whether it be a more perfect state of Religion to
worship God alone, or to worship Saints and Angels,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> together with the Supreme God. Now the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of any acts of Religion must either respect God or
our selves, that they signifie some greater perfections
in God, or more perfect attainments in us, and a nearer
union and conjunction with the Deity. Let us then
briefly examine the worship of Saints and Angels, both
with respect to God and our selves, and see whether we
can discover any greater perfection in this way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
than in the worship of the Supreme Being alone,
without any Rival or partner in worship; and if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that it is neither for the glory of God, nor for the
happiness and perfection of those, who worship, we may
certainly conclude, that our Saviour has made no alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in the object of our worship, for he made no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
for the worse but for the better; he fulfils and
perfects Laws, which, I suppose, does not signifie making
them less perfect than they were before.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="section">
               <head>SECT. VI.</head>
               <p>1. THen let us consider, whether the worship of
Saints and Angels be more for the glory of
God, than to pay all Religious Worship to God alone.
Now if Religious Worship be for the glory of God, then
all Religious Worship is more for Gods glory than a part
of it; unless men will venture to say, that a part is as
great as the whole. And yet whoever worships Saints
and Angels, though he be neve so devout a worshipper
of God also, yet he gives part of Religious Worship to
Creatures, and therefore God cannot have the whole,
unless they can divide their worship between God and
Creatures, and yet give the whole to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:45002:20"/>
If it be objected, that those who worship Saints and
Angels, do not give that worship to them, which is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
and appropriate to the Supreme God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they reserve that worship which is due to God,
wholly to himself, though they pay an inferiour degree
of Religious Worship to Saints and Angels. I answer,
what that worship is, which is peculiar to the Supreme
God, I shall consider more hereafter; but for the present,
supposing that they give only an inferiour degree of
worship to Creatures, is this Religious Worship, or is it
not? if it be, is a degree of Worship a part of Worship?
if it be, then God has not the whole, and therefore is
not so much honoured, as if he had the whole; as to shew
this in a plain instance.</p>
               <p>Those who pray to Saints and Angels, though they
do not pray to them, as to the Supreme God, but as to
Mediators and Intercessors for them with the Supreme
God, yet they place an inferiour degree of hope and trust
and affiance in them, or else it is non-sence to pray to
them at all; so that though God may be the Supreme
Object of their relyance and hope, yet he is not the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Object; he has part, and the greatest part, but not the
whole, for they divide their hope and trust between God
and Creatures; and if it be a greater glory to God to
trust wholly in him, than to trust in him in part, then
it is a greater glory to God to pray to him only, than to
pray also to Saints and Angels.</p>
               <p>Nay it is more than probable, that those who pray to
Saints and Angels, as trusting in their merits and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
for them, do not make God, but these Saints and
Angels, to whom they pray, the Supreme Object of
their hope. This it may be will be thought an extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
charge against men who profess to believe, that God
is the Supreme Lord of the world, and the sole giver of
all good things; but this is no argument to me, but


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45002:20"/>
that notwithstanding this belief, they may trust more in
Saints and Angels, than in God, and consequently give
the Supreme Worship to them. For men do not always
trust most in those who have the greatest power, but in
those by whose interest and intercession, they hope to
obtain their desires of the Soveraign power. Thus I
am sure it is in the Courts of earthly Princes; though
men know, that the King only has power to grant what
they desire, yet they place more confidence in a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Favorite than in their Prince, and when they have
obtained their requests, pay more solemn acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to their Patron; for let the power be where it
will, our hope and trust is plac't there where our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations
are. And when mens expectations are not from
the Prince, who has the power, but from the Favourite,
whose interest directs the influences of this power to
them, which otherwise would never have reacht them,
such Favourites have more numerous dependants, more
frequent addresses, more formal courtships, than the
Prince himself. And when men model the heavenly
Court according to the pattern of earthly Courts, and
expect the conveyance of the Divine Blessings to them
as much from the intercession of Saints and Angels,
as they do to obtain their desires of their Prince, by the
mediation of some powerful Favourite, no wonder, if
they love, and honour, and fear, reverence and adore,
trust and depend on Saints and Angels, as much or more
than they do on the Supreme God. For there is not a
more natural notion, than to honour those for our Gods,
from whose hands we receive all good things, whether
we receive it from their own inherent power or not,
<hi>Deus nobis haec otia fecit,</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>Namque erit ille mihi semper Deus, illius aram</l>
                  <l>Saepe tener nostris ab ovilibus imbuet agnus.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Men may acknowledge God to be the Supreme Being,


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45002:21"/>
and ascribe incommunicable perfections to him, and yet
may pray more frequently, more devoutly, more ardent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
with greater trust and affiance to Saints and Angels,
than to God, as it is apparent many Devotoes of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<hi>Mary</hi> do; and this is to give Supreme and Soveraign
Worship to them, without acknowledging them to be
Supreme Beings.</p>
               <p>Indeed it is morally impossible, but our Religious
Worship, trust and affiance, must be at least equally sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
between the Supreme God and our Mediator, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he be, as men do not less trust in the interest of
their Patron, than in the power of their Prince; for it
is not meer power but favour, which is the immediate
object of our trust; and therefore God appointed his
only begotten Son to be our Mediator, as for other great
and wise reasons, so to prevent Idolatry by giving us a
God incarnate, who is a proper object of Religious ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
to be our Mediator, that seeing men will worship
their Mediator, they may have a God for their Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to worship. The sum is this: If it be more for the
glory of God to have all Religious Worship appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to himself, than to have only a part of it, and it may
be the least share and part too, then the worship of
Saints and Angels cannot be for Gods glory.</p>
               <p>But besides this, the worship of Saints and Angels,
together with God, does mightily obscure and lessen
the Divine perfections, and therefore it cannot be for his
glory. It represents him indeed like a great Temporal
Monarch, but it does not represents him like a God.</p>
               <p>That which we ignorantly think a piece of state and
greatness in earthly Monarchs, to administer the great
affairs of their Kingdoms, to receive Petitions and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses,
to bestow Favours, to administer Justice by other
hands, to have some great Ministers and Favourites to
interpose between them and their Subjects, is nothing


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45002:21"/>
else, but want of power to do otherwise. He would be
a much greater Prince, more beloved and reverenced,
who could do all this himself; but no Prince can be
present in all parts of his Kingdom, nor know every
particular Subject, much less their particular cases, and
conditions, deserts and merits; and therefore is forc't to
divide this care into many hands, and in so doing shares
his power and honour with his Subjects. But whoever
imagines any such thing of God, denies his omnipresence,
his omnipotence, his omniscience, and his particular care
and providence over his Creatures. God indeed does not
always govern the world by an immediate power, but
makes use both of the Ministry of Angels &amp; Men; but he
governs all things by his immediate direction, or at least
by his immediate inspection. He overlooks every thing
himself, while all Creatures either obey his commands,
or submit to his power. If this be the true notion of
Gods governing the world, that he has the concernments
of the whole Creation under his eye, and keeps the
disposal of all things in his own hands, so that nothing
can be done, but either by his order or permission; then
the most perfect and glorious Angels, the greatest Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the Divine Providence, can challenge no share
in Religious Worship, cannot be the objects of our trust
or hope, because they are only Ministers of the Divine
Will, can do nothing from themselves, as civil Ministers
of State, and Officers of great trust can in Temporal
Kingdoms, but are always under the eye, and always
move at the command of God. In such a state of things
all the peculiar rights of Soveraign Power and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God reserves wholly to himself, as any wife Prince
would, among which the receiving the Prayers and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
of his Creatures is none of the least; to hear
Prayers is made the peculiar attribute of God in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<hi>Thou art a God that hearest, prayers, therefore unto


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45002:22"/>
thee shall all flesh come.</hi> And reason tells us, that it is
the most eminent part of Soveraignty and Majesty;
and the reason why Temporal Princes do not reserve
this wholly to themselves, is because they cannot do it;
but God can, and he challenges it to himself, and will
not allow any Creature to do it; and there is no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
to pray to any Creature, when we know, that
they cannot help us, that they must receive their orders
and commands from God, and not act by their own will
and inclinations.</p>
               <p>Thus Princes have their Eavourites, to whom they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
a very partial fondness and respect, to whom they
will deny nothing that they ask, nor hardly shew any
grace or favour to their Subjects without them; and
this forces Subjects to address themselves to their Prince
by them; but it is a reproach to the Divine Goodness
and universal Providence, to conceive any such thing of
God; which yet is the foundation of the worship of
Patron Saints and Angels, as persons so dear to God, that
he cannot deny their requests, and will not grant our
Petitions without them, or at least, that it is the most
certain and effectual way to obtain what we desire, to
offer up our Prayers and Petitions to God by their hands.</p>
               <p>No doubt but all good men on earth, much more
Blessed Saints and Angels in Heaven, as being more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and excellent Creatures, are very dear to God; but
yet God is not fond and partial in his kindness, as earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Princes are, but has an equal regard to all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and delights in doing good to them, and needs not
to be importuned by any powerful Favourites to hear
their cryes and prayers; he will as soon attend to the
Prayers of an humble penitent sinner, as of the most
glorious Saint, and is more ready to grant than they
are to ask.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:45002:22"/>
A Mediator of Redemption is very consistent with
all the perfections of the Divine Nature, and does migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
recommend both the goodness and wisdom of God
to the world. When Manking had transgressed the
Laws of their Creation, they forfeited their natural right
and interest in the care and goodness of their Maker;
The Divine Justice, and the wisdom of God in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the world, required an atonement and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation
for sin; and it was an amazing demonstration of
the Divine goodness to sinners, that he found one him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that he gave his Son to be a propitiation for our sins.
When men by sin had forfeited their original innocence
and happiness together, they could expect nothing from
God, but by way of Covenant and promise; and every
Covenant between contending parties, must be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
in the hands of a Medaitor, and none so fit to be
our Mediator, as he who is our ransome too.</p>
               <p>And a Mediator must be invested with power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to see the terms of this Covenant performed,
and this is his Mediatory Intercession. He intercedes
not meerly as a powerful Favourite, but as the Author
and Surety of the Covenant, not meerly by intreaties
and prayers, but in vertue of his blood, which sealed
the Covenant, and made atonement and expiation for
sin.</p>
               <p>Thus Christ is our Mediator of redemption, who
hath redeemed us by his blood; and we must offer up
all our Prayers to God in his name and powerful inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
because we can expect no blessings from God, but
by vertue of that Covenant, which he purchast and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with his Blood.</p>
               <p>But now a Mediator of pure intercession, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to any atonement made for sin, or any Covenant
of redemption (such as Saints and Angels and the blessed
Virgin are made by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) is a mighty


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45002:23"/>
reproach to the Divine Nature and perfections. It
cloaths God with the passions and infirmities of earthly
Princes; represents him as extreamly fond of some of
his Creatures, and very regardless of others; as if his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to some favourite Saint, were a more powerful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to him to do good, than his own love to goodness;
as if he knew not when, nor to whom, to shew mercy
without their direction or counsel, or would not do it
without their importunity; as if some of his Creatures
had as much the ascendant over him, as some favourites
have over their Princes, who can with a words speaking
have any thing of them, and extort favours from them,
even against their wills and inclinations. No man can
think there is any need of such Intercessors and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
with God, who believes him to be infinitely wise,
and to be infinitely good; to know when it is fit to hear
and to answer, and to be always ready to do, what his
own wisdom judges fit to be done. There can be no
place for such intercessions and intreaties, to an infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perfect Being; for they always suppose some great
weakness or defect in him who wants them, for even a
wise and a good man wants no Mediators to perswade
him to do that good, which is fit to be done. The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
against this is very obvious, and the Answer, I
think, is as easie. The Objection is this: If God be so
good, that he needs not such Prayers and Intercessions
to move him to do good, Why do we pray for our
selves? Why do we pray for one another? Why do we
desire the Prayers of good men here on earth? Why
is it a greater reproach to the Divine Perfections to beg
the Prayers of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or St. <hi>Peter,</hi> now they are in
Heaven, than to have begged their Prayers, while they
had been on Earth?</p>
               <p>To this I Answer: When we pray for our selves, I
suppose, we do not pray as Mediators, but as Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants,


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45002:23"/>
and nothing can be more reasonable, than that
those, who want mercy, or any other blessing should ask
for it. It is certainly no reproach to the Divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that God makes Prayer the condition of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
which is a very easie condition, and very neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to maintain a constant sense and reverence of God,
and a constant dependance on him. And when we
pray for one another on earth, we are as meer suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants,
as when we pray for our selves, and to pray as
supplicants is a very different thing from praying as Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates,
as Mediators, as Patrons. The vertue of the
first consists only in the power and efficacy of Prayer;
the second in the favour and interest of the person.
This the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her self owns, when she al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
no Mediators and Advocates, but Saints in Heaven,
which is a sign, she makes a vast difference between the
prayers of Saints on earth, and Saints in Heaven.</p>
               <p>There are great and wise reasons, why God should
command and encourage our mutual prayers for each
other while we are on earth; for this is the noblest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of universal love and charity, which is a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
qualification to render our prayers acceptable to God;
this preserves the unity of the body of Christ, which
requires a sympathy and fellow-feeling of each others
sufferings, this is the foundation of publick worship
when we meet together to pray with, and for each other
to our common Father; and it gives a great reputation
to vertue and Religion in this world, when God hears
the prayers of good men for the wicked, and removes
or diverts those judgments which they were afraid of;
this becomes the wisdom of God, and is no blemish to
his goodness, to dispence his mercies and favours in such
a manner as may best serve the great ends of Religion
in this world.</p>
               <p>God does not command us to pray for our selves or


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45002:24"/>
others, because he wants our importunities and solicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to do good, but because it serves the publick ends
of Religion and Government, and is that natural ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
and worship, which Creatures owe to their great
Creator and Benefactor, and Soveraign Lord. But to
imagine, that God needs Advocates and Mediators to
solicite our cause for us in the Court of Heaven, where
none of these ends can be served by it, this is a plain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
of his wisdom and goodness, as if he wanted
great importunities to do good, and were more moved
by a partial kindness and respect to some powerful fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites,
than by the care of his Creatures, or his love
to goodness.</p>
               <p>Erom hence it evidently appears, how inconsequent
that reasoning is, from our begging the prayers of good
men on earth, to prove the lawfulness of our praying
to the Saints in Heaven to pray and interceed for us;
the first makes them our fellow supplicants, the second
makes them our Mediators and Intercessors; and how
little the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> gains by that distinction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a Mediator of Redemption, and Mediators of
pure Intercession<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for though they pray to Saints and
Angels only as Mediators of Intercession, yet this is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
reproach to the nature and government of God; a
Mediator of Redemption is very consistent with the
Divine glory and perfections, a Mediator of pure inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
is not. And the sum of all is this, That it is so
far from advancing the Divine glory to worship Saints
and Angels together with God, that it is a real reproach
and dishonour to him; and therefore this can be no Law
nor Institution of our Saviour, who came not to abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
the Divine Laws, but to fulfil and perfect them.
Some think there is no danger of dishonouring God by
that honour they give to Saints and Angels, because they
honour them as Gods Friends and Favourites, as those


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45002:24"/>
whom God has honoured and advanced to great glory;
and therefore whatever honour they do to them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
back again on God, and this may be true, while
we give no honour to Saints and Angels, but what is
consistent with the Divine glory; but when the very
nature of that honour and worship we pay to them, is a
diminution of Gods glory, and a reproach to his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
perfections, as I have made it appear, the worship
of Saints and Angels is, surely it cannot be for Gods
glory to advance his Creatures by lessening himself.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="7" type="section">
               <head>SECT. VII.</head>
               <p>2. LEt us now consider, whether the worship of Saints
and Angels together with God, be a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
state of Religion than the worship of God alone,
with respect to our selves; whether it puts us into a
more perfect and excellent state. It does indeed migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
gratifie the superstition of mankind to have a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Advocates and Mediators to address to, but
there are three considerations which may satisfie any
man, how far this is from a perfect state of Religion.</p>
               <p>1. That it argues very mean and low conceits of God,
for did men believe God to be so wise, so good, and so
powerful, as really he is, they would be contented with
one infinite God, instead of ten thousand meaner Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates.
The worship of Saints and Angels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
proved, is a great reproach to the Divine perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and therefore such worshippers must have very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
and childish apprehensions of the Supreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which is a plain proof what an imperfect state of
Religion this is; for the perfection of Religion is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
proportioned to that knowledge we have of God,
who is the object of it.</p>
               <p>2. This worship of Saints and Angels is a very ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45002:25"/>
state, it subjects us to our fellow-creatures, who are
by nature but our equals, however are not our Gods.
It is a state of liberty, freedom and honour, to be subject
to God, who is our natural Lord and Soveraign, but to
fall down to our fellow Creatures, and to worship them
with Divine honours, with all humility of address, and
sacred and awful regards, is to debase our selves as much
below the dignity of our natures, as we advance them
above it. The excellency and perfection of reasonable
Creatures principally consists in their Religion, and that
is the most perfect Religion, which does most advance,
adorn, and perfect our Natures; but it is an argument
of an abject mind, to be contented to worship the most
excellent Creatures, which is a greater dishonour than to
own the vilest Slave for our Prince. Mean objects of
worship do more debase the Soul, than any other the
wilest submissions; and the more our dependancies are,
and the meaner they are, the more imperfect our State
and Religion is.</p>
               <p>3. The greatest perfection of Religion, consists in the
nearest and most immediate approach to God; which
I think, these men cannot pretend to, who flye to the
patronage and intercession of Saints and Angels, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their Petitions of him. Though we should allow
it lawful to pray to Saints and Angels to mediate for us
with God, yet we cannot but own it a more perfect state
to do as the Saints and Angels themselves do, go to
God without any other Advocate but Christ himself.
It is a great happiness to have a freind at Court, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
us to our Prince, when we have no interest of our
own, but it is a greater priviledge to go immediately
to our Prince when we please, without any Favourite
to introduce us. This is the perfect state of the Gospel,
that we have received <hi>The adoption of sins,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4 Gal. 5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we are sons, God hath sent forth the spirit of his Son


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45002:25"/>
into our hearts, crying Abba Father.</hi> That is, this Holy
Spirit which dwells in us, teaches us to call God Father,
and to pray to him with the humble assurance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of Children. This is the effect of Christ inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession
for us,<note place="margin">4 Hebr. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>That we may now come boldly unto the
throne of Grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to
help in a time of need.</hi> The throne of Grace certainly
is not the shrine of any Saints, but the immediate throne
and presence of God, whether we may immediately di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
our Prayers through the merits and intercession of
Christ. Upon the same account the whole body of
Christians are called <hi>a Spiritual house,</hi> that is, the Temple
of God, where he is peculiarly present to hear those
Prayers which are made to him, <hi>An holy priesthood,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2 5, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>to
offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus
Christ.</hi> And <hi>a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy
nation, a peculiar people:</hi> This is a priviledge above what
the Jews enjoyed, they had a Priesthood to minister
in holy things, and to offer their Sacrifices for them, but
the whole Nation was not a Priesthood, nor had such
immediate access to God; but now every Christian has
as near an access to God as the Priests themselves under
the Law had; can offer up his Prayers and Spiritual
Sacrifices immediately to God; and that very acceptably
too, through Jesus Christ our great High Priest and
Mediator; and if our Prayers be acceptable to God by
Jesus Chrrist, we need no other Mediators or Advocates.
This is the onely direction our Saviour gave his Disciples
a little before his death, to ask in his name, with this
promise, <hi>If ye ask any thing in my name,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">14 Joh. 13, 15. 16 Joh. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>I will do it. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to have you asked nothing in my name, ask and ye shall
receive, that your joy may be full.</hi> And to give them the
greater assurance of acceptance, he acquaints them with
Gods great and tender affection for them, such as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
has for his Children. <hi>At that day ye shall ask in my


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45002:26"/>
name;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">26, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father
for you, for the Father himself loveth you because ye have
loved me, and have believed, that I came out from God;</hi>
a reason which equally extends to all those who shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Christ, to the end of the world. And can we
now imagine, that when our Saviour has purchast for
us this liberty of access to God, he should send us
round about by the shrines and Altars of numerous and
unknown Saints to the Throne of Grace. When he will
not assert the necessity of his own Prayers for us, while
we pray in his name, because our heavenly Father hath
such a tender affection for all the Disciples of Christ, can
we think it necessary to pray to St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
and the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to pray for us. This is none of our
Saviours institution, nor can it be, because Christ by his
death and sufferings and intercessions brings us nearer to
God,<note place="margin">10 Hebr. 19, 20, 21, 22.</note> as the Apostle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> speaks, <hi>Having
therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the
blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
for us through the vail, that is to say, his flesh, and
having an high Priest over the house of God, let us draw
near with a true heart, in full assurance of Faith.</hi> But
the worship of Saints and Angels removes us at a great
distance from God, as not daring to approach his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
without the mediation of some Favourite Saint.
And though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does sometimes pray
directly to God only, in the Name and Mediation of
Christ, as the Pagans themselves sometimes did to their
Supreme Deity, yet it seems this is what they dare not
trust to, and therefore joyn the Meditation of Saints
with their Prayers to God, and never pray to God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="8" type="section">
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:45002:26"/>
               <head>SECT. VIII.</head>
               <p>5. THat the Gospel of our Saviour has made no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
in the object of our worship, appears
from that Analogie which there is, and ought to be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Jewish and Christian Worship. The Jewish
and Christian Church are but one Church, and their wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ship
the same worship, only with this difference, that the
Jewish worship was in Type and Figure, and Ceremony,
the Christian worship in Truth and Substance. And
therefore if this legal and Evangelical worship be the
same it must have the some object, for the object is the
most essential part of worship.</p>
               <p>So that if it appear, not only from the express letter
of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> but from all the Types and Figures
of the Law, that God only was to be worshipt by the
Jewish Church; if Christ was to fulfil all these Types
and Figures in his own person, and in the Evangelical
worship, then it is certain, that the object of our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
must be the same still; for if the Type was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in its nature and signification to the worship of One
God, then the whole Christian worship, which was sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyed
and praesigured by these Types, must be peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
and appropriate to the same One Supreme God.</p>
               <p>As for instance. I have already proved at large, that
the Jews were to worship but One God, because they
had but one Temple to worship in, and all their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
had some relation or other to this one Temple, and
therefore all their worship was appropriated to that One
God, whose Temple it was; now we know Gods dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Temple at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was only a Type and
Figure of Gods dwelling in Humane Nature, upon
which account Christ calls his body the Temple; and
St. <hi>John</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">2 Joh. 19. 21. 1 Joh. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>That the word was made flesh and dwelt


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45002:27"/>
among us,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> tabernacled among us; as God
formerly dwelt in the Jewish Tabernacle or Temple,
and St. <hi>Paul</hi> adds,<note place="margin">2 Coloss. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>That the fulness of the Godhead dwelt
in Christ bodily,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> really, substantially, as an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of Gods dwelling by Types and Figures, and
shadows in the Jewish Temple.</p>
               <p>Now if all the Jewish worship was confined to the
Temple, or had a necessary relation to it, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
proved, and this Temple was but a figure of the
Incarnation of Christ, who should dwell among us in
humane nature, then all the Christian worship must be
offered up to God through Jesus Christ, as all the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
worship was offered to God at the Temple; for
Christ is the only Temple (in a strict and proper sense)
of the Christian Church, and therefore he alone can
render all our services acceptable to God. So that God,
who is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, is the only
object of our worship, and Christ considered as God In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate,
as God dwelling in humane nature, is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Temple where all our worship must be offered to God,
that is, we shall find acceptance with God only in his
name and mediation: we must worship no other Being
but only the Supreme God, and that only through Jesus
Christ.</p>
               <p>Thus under the Law the Priests were to intercede for
the people, but not without Sacrifice; their Intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was founded in making atonement and expiation for
sin; which plainly signified, that under the Gospel we
can have no other Mediator, but only him, who expiates
our sins, and intercedes in the merits of his Sacrifice;
who is our Priest and our Sacrifice, and therefore our
Mediator;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 1, 2.</note> as St. <hi>John</hi> observes. <hi>If any man sin, we have
an Advocate with the Father Jesus Christ the righteous, and
he is the propitiation for our sins.</hi> The Law knew no
such thing as a Mediator of pure intercession, a Mediator,


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45002:27"/>
who is no Priest, and offers no Sacrifice for us, and
therefore the Gospel allows of no such Mediators nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who mediate onely by their Prayers, without a
Sacrifice, such Mediators as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> makes
of Saints and Angels and the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> but we have
onely one Mediator, a Mediator of redemption, who
has purchased us with his Blood, of whom the Priests
under the Law were Types and Figures.</p>
               <p>Thus under the Law, none but the High Priest was
to enter into the Holy of Holies, with the blood of the
Sacrifice; now the Holy of Holies was a Type of
Heaven, and therefore this plainly signified, that under
the Gospel,<note place="margin">1. Heb. 12.</note> there should be but one High Priest and
Mediator, to offer up our Prayers and Supplications in
Heaven, He and He onely, who enters into Heaven
with his own Blood, as the High Priest went into the
Holy of Holies with the blood of the Sacrifice. There
may be a great many Priests and Advocates on Earth to
interceed for us, as there were under the Law, great
numbers of Priests, the Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> to attend the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and Ministry of the Temple, but we have, and can
have, but one Priest and Mediator in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Whoever acknowledges that the Priesthood and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
of the Law was Typical of the Evangelical Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
and Worship, cannot avoid the force of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and whoever will not acknowledge this, must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
most of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles, especially the Epistle to
the Hebrews, which proceeds wholely upon this way
of reasoning: Now this manifestly justifies the worship
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as true Christian worship, for
we worship One God through one Mediator, who offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself a Sacrifice for us, when he was on Earth, and
interceeds for us as our High Priest in Heaven, which
answers to the One Temple, and the One High Priest
under the Law: But though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45002:28"/>
what we do, worship the Supreme God through Jesus
Christ, yet she spoils the Analogie between the Type and
the Antitype, the legal and Evangelical worship, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more; when she sends us to the Shrines and Altars
of so many several Saints, surely this cannot answer to
that one Temple at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where God alone was to
be worshipped, there are as many Temples and Mercy-seats
now, as there are Shrines and Altars of Saints and
Angels, by whose Intercession we may obtain our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
of God. When she advances Saints and Angels
to the Office of Mediators and Interceslsors in Heaven,
this contradicts the Type of One High Priest, who alone
might enter into the Holy of Holies, which was a type
of Heaven; for there is some difference between having
one Mediator in Heaven, (and there can be no more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Gospel to answer to the Typical High Priest
under the Law) and having a hundred Mediators in
Heaven together with our Typical High Priest. To
have a Mediator of pure Intercession in Heaven, who
never offered any Sacrifice for us, cannot answer to the
High Priest under the Law, who could not enter into the
Holy of Holies without the blood of the Sacrifice. The
High Priests entring but once a year into the Holy of
Holies, which was typical of Christs entring once into
Heaven to intercede for us, cannot be reconciled with a
new succession of Mediators, as ofter as the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>
pleases to cannonize them. So that either the Law was
not typical of the state of the Gospel, or the Worship of
Saints and Angels, which is so contrary to all the types
and figures of the Law, cannot be true Christian Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, I shall add but one thing more, that Christ
and his Apostles have made no alteration in the object of
worship, appears from hence, that <hi>de facto</hi> there is no
such Law in the Gospel for the worship of any other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45002:28"/>
besides the One Supreme God. There is a great
deal against it, as I have already shewn; but if there had
been nothing against it, it had been argument enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
any such alteration, that there is no express po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Law for it. The force of which argument does
not consist meerly in the silence of the Gospel, that there
is nothing said for it, (which the most Learned Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> readily grant, and give their
reasons, such as they are, why this was not done, why
we are not directed to pray to Saints and Angels, and
Images, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> but the argument lies in this, that there
can be no alteration made in the object of worship with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an express Law; and therefore there is no alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
made, because there is no such Law in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</p>
               <p>The Jews were expresly commanded to worship no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Being, but the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> as I have already proved,
which Law appropriates all the acts of Religious Worship
to one God; and therefore all those, who were under the
obligation of this Law (as to be sure all natural Jews
were) could not without the guilt of Idolatry give any
Religious Worship to any other Being, till this Law
were expresly repealed, and express leave given to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
some other Divine Beings besides the Supreme God;
so that at least our Saviour himself, while he was on
Earth, and subject to the Law, and his Apostles, and all
believing Jews, were obliged by this Law to worship
none but God, unless we can shew where Christ by his
Legislative Authority, or his Apostles by Commission
from him, have expresly repealed this Law; nay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
unless we can shew, that Christ himself repealed
this Law, and taught the worship of Saints and Angels,
the Apostles themselves could have no authority to do
it,<note place="margin">28. Mat. 20.</note> for their Commission was onely to teach what Christ
had commanded them, which though it does not extend


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45002:29"/>
to matters of order and discipline, and the external cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of worship, yet it does to all the essentials of
Faith and Worship, and I think the right object of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is the most essential thing in Religious Worship.</p>
               <p>From hence it appears, that at least all the Jewish
Christians in the Apostles days, and all succeeding Ages
to this day, cannot Worship Saints and Angels without
Idolatry, because the Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was given to them,
and never yet repealed, commands them to worship none
but God; and if Gentile Converts were received into
the Jewish Christian Church (and Christ has but one
Church of Jews and Gentiles) they must also be obliged
by all those Laws, which were then, and are still obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
to all believing Jews, and therefore Gentile as well
as Jewish Christians, are still bound to worship none but
God.</p>
               <p>Now I think I need not prove, that an express Law
can be repealed onely by an express Law. That Law
which commands us to worship God, and him onely,
must continue in full force, till God do as expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that he allows us to pay some degree of Religious
Worship to other Beings besides himself: When a Law-giver
has declared his will and pleasure by a Law, it is
not fit that Subjects should be allowed to guess<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at his
mind, and dispute away an express Law by some sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mizes
and consequences, how probable soever they may
appear; for at this rate a Law signifies nothing, if we
may guess at the will of our Law-giver, without and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
an express Law. And yet none of the Advocates
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (though they are not usually
guilty of too much modesty) ever had the confidence to
pretend an express Law for the worship of Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and though they sometimes alledge
Scripture to prove this by, yet they do not pretend that
they are direct proofs, but onely attempt to prove some


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45002:29"/>
other Doctrines from Scripture, from which they think
they may prove by some probable consequences that
which the Scripture no-where plainly teaches, nay the
contrary to which is expresly taught in Scripture. And
if this may be allow'd, I know no Law of God so plain and
express, but a witty man may find ways to escape the
obligation of it. This is a consideration of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and therefore I shall discourse more particularly
of it.</p>
               <p>The Law of <hi>Moses</hi> expresly commands us to worship
God, and him onely; Our Saviour Christ owns and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
the authority of this Law in the Gospel; the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> notwithstanding this Law, gives Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Worship to Creatures; the question then is; how
she avoids the force of this Law, since it is no where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
repealed, and she does not pretend that it is. Now
the Patrons of Creature-worship think to justifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the breach of this Law, these three ways.
1. By consequences drawn, as they pretend, from other
Scripture-Doctrines. 2. By distinctions. And 3. By
authority. Let us then examine, whether all this have
any force against an express Law, which was never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
repepealed.</p>
               <p>1. By consequences drawn, as they pretend, from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Scripture-Doctrines; and I shall discourse this with
a particular reference to the Invocation of Saints. For
when they would prove the lawfulness of praying to
Saints, they alledge no direct proof of this from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
But because they must make a shew of saying
something from Scripture, when they are to deal with
such Hereticks as will be satisfied with no less authority,
they endeavour to prove something else from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
from whence they think by an easie consequence,
they can prove the lawfulness of praying to Saints.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:45002:30"/>
Thus they very easily prove, that we may and
ought to pray for one another, and to desire each others
prayers while we are on Earth; and from hence they
presently conclude, that we may as lawfully pray to
Saints in Heaven to pray for us, as beg and desire their
prayers, while they are on Earth.</p>
               <p>And to confirm this, they endeavour to prove, that
some extraordinary Saints, whose merits are very great,
do directly ascend up into Heaven into the immediate
presence of God, and a participation of his Glory; and
hence they conclude, that they have authority and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to help us and to intercede for us, and that they are
so far advanced above us in this mortal state, that they
deserve some kind of Religious Honour and Worship
from us, as being <hi>Dii per participationem,</hi> Gods by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation,
that is, by partaking in the Divine Nature and
Glory by their advancement to Heaven.</p>
               <p>And if after all this they can prove, that the Saints in
Heaven do pray and intercede for us on Earth, they
think the demonstration is complete
and perfect, that therefore<note n="*" place="margin">Bonum atque utile esse supplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sanctos invocare, &amp; ab bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficia impetranda <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Now how they prove all this, is not my business at
present to enquire; but my inquiry is, whether such ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
as these be sufficient to oppose against the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of an express Law; and if they be, truly I
think it a very vain thing, either for God or men to
make any Laws. For,</p>
               <p>1. I desire to know, what these Gentlemen would


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45002:30"/>
prove by such kind of arguments as these. Suppose we
should grant them, that the Saints are received into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
before the Resurrection, and are actually possest of
all that Glory and Happiness, which they say they are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
suppose we should grant them, that by some means un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to us, Saints and Angels are acquainted with all
that we do and suffer in this world, hear all our vocal
or mental prayers, which we offer to God or to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and that they do actually pray and intercede for
us, what follows from hence? That therefore we may
pray to Saints? not I hope if there be an express Law
against it, These arguments at most can onely prove,
that in the nature of the thing it might be fitting and
reasonable to pray to Saints if God thought fit to allow it,
not that we must pray to Saints, though God has forbid
it. For those are powerful reasons indeed, which can
justifie Saint-worship against the express Law and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
Will of God. Could they first prove one of
these three things: Either 1. that there is no such Law
against the worship of any other Being besides God. Or
2. that this is not the sence of this Law, that they must
not pray to Saints or Angels, that the Law, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
us to worship any Being but God, does not forbid
the worship of Saints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Or 3. that though there was
such a Law, and this were the sence of it, and this Law
were never formally repealed by God, yet it disappears
of it self, and obliges no longer since the discovery of such
reasons as these for the worship of Saints and Angels.
I say, could they prove any thing of this in the first
place, then there would be as much reason for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of Saints, as there is strength and validity in their
Arguments; but no Reason can take place against an
express Law, till it be as expresly repealed. For,</p>
               <p>2. If an express Law may be disobeyed, as often as
men fancy they see reason to do, what the Law forbids,


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45002:31"/>
this overthrows the whole authority of making Laws,
and makes every Subject a Judge, whether the Laws of
a Soveraign Prince shall be obeyed or not. At this rate
he has the greatest authority, who has the best reason;
and since every man believes his own reason to be best,
every man is the Soveraign Lord of his own actions.
It is to be presumed, that no Prince makes a Law, but
what he apprehends some reason for, and to oppose any
mans private reason against a Law, is to set up a private
mans reason against the publick reason of government:
and yet it is much worse to oppose our reason against a
Divine Law, which is to oppose the reason of Creatures
against the reason of God, unless we will say, that God
makes Laws without reason, and those who can believe
that, may as easily imagine, that God will expect, that
those Laws which he makes without reason, should be
obeyed without reason also, and then to be sure all their
reasons cannot repeal a Law, nor justifie them in the
breach of it. It becomes every Creature to believe the
will of God to be the highest reason, and therefore
when God has declared his will by an express Law; while
this Law continues in force, (as it must do, till it be as
expresly repealed) it is an impudent thing to urge our
reasons against the obligations of it. So that since God
has expresly forbid us to worship any Being besides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
unless we can prove, that God has repealed this
Law, it will never justifie the worship of Saints and
Angels, though we could by the plainest and easiest ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
prove to the conviction of all Mankind, that
Saints and Angels are very fit objects of our Religious
Worship, and that it is no diminution to the glory of
God to pay some degree of Religious worship to them.</p>
               <p>3. Especially, when the matter of the Law is such,
that whatever reasons may be pretended on one side or
the other, it must still be acknowledged to be wholly at


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45002:31"/>
the will and pleasure of the Law-giver, which side he
will choose. As for instance, suppose there were no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and necessary reason against the worship of Saints
and Angels, yet there is no natural and necessary rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for it neither, and therefore God may either allow or
forbid it, as he himself pleases, without assigning any
reason why he does either. And when it appears that
God might forbid it if he pleases, and that he has actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
forbid it by an express Law, it is time to leave off
reasoning about it: natural reason can give us no assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of any thing, which it cannot prove to be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
whatever in the nature and reason of things may be,
or may not be, can never be proved either to be, or not
to be, by meer reason; for it is a contradiction to say,
that there is no necessary reason why such a thing should
be, and yet that I can prove by reason, that it must be,
which supposes, that there is a necessary reason, why it
should be; for I cannot prove, that it must be, unless I
can prove, that it must necessarily be; that is, that there
is a necessary reason, why it should be.</p>
               <p>To apply this then to our present Case. The Law
expresly forbids us to worship any other Being besides
the Supreme God, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> prays to Saints
and Angels and Images, which is an essential part of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worship; and without ever attempting to prove
this Law to be repealed, she justifies her worship by such
reasons and consequences, as I have now cited from their
most celebrated Doctors, and some of which are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
whereon the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> founds their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Saints and Angels. I ask then, whether these ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
whereby they endeavour to justifie the worship
of Saints and Angels, prove that we must worship them,
that such worship is their natural right, and our duty.
No, this the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will not own; the most
the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> says, is, that it is <hi>bonum &amp; utile,</hi> good


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:45002:32"/>
and profitable to do it; but, say I, if they do not prove
it to be necessary, they prove nothing; for if Saints and
Angels have not a natural right to our worship, though
we should suppose them to be very fit objects of some
degrees of worship, yet it is at Gods choice, whether
he will allow it or not, and they can challenge no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and we must give none, if God forbids it; and
therefore since God has forbid the worship of any Being,
but himself (and therefore of the most excellent Saints
and Angels) by an express Law; and it no-where ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
where or when, or in what manner this Law was
repealed, a hundred such arguments as these cannot
prove it lawful to worship Saints and Angels against an
express Law not to do it. Though we should grant
that God, if he pleased, might allow us to worship Saints
and Angels, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does, without any
deminution of his own Glory, which is the most that
all their arguments can pretend to prove, yet it does not
hence follow, that we may worship them, when God by
an express Law has declared, that he will not allow it.
No arguments nor consequences can prove, that God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
us to do that, which by an express Law he has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
us to do. No reason can prove that to be Gods will,
which he has publickly declared in his Law to be against
his will.</p>
               <p>4. That no reason or arguments can absolve us from
our obedience to an express Law, till it be as expresly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed,
appears from this, that our obligation to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
does not depend meerly upon the reason of the
Law, but upon the authority of the Law-giver, and
therefore though the reason of the Law should cease, yet
while it is inforced by the same authority, it obliges still.
Thus I am sure, it is in humane Laws, and it is very fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it should be so; meer reason cannot make a Law,
for then every thing which is reasonable, would be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:45002:32"/>
duty; that which is reasonable may be fit mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for a Law, but it is the authority of the Law-giver
which makes the Law, and the same authority which at
first made it a Law, continues it to be a Law while the
authority lasts, though the particular reason for which
it was enacted into a Law, may cease.</p>
               <p>So that though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> could prove, that
there is no reason now against the worship of Saints
and Angels, that all those reasons for which God forbad
the Jews to worship any one but himself, were now cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
yet till the Law be repealed too, it is utterly unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to worship any Being besides the Supreme God, and
yet this is the most that all their reasonings come to,
that there is not the same reason for this Law under the
State of the Gospel, that there was under the Jewish Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy.</p>
               <p>They suppose, that God forbad the Jews to worship
any one but himself, because they were in great danger
of falling into Pagan Idolatries, and worshipping the
Gods of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and other Neighbour-Nations,
and that this was the case also of the Christian Church
at the first planting of the Gospel; but now there is
no danger of worshipping false Gods, we may very
securely worship the Friends and Favourites of God.</p>
               <p>They suppose, that all the ancient Patriarchs who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
before the Resurrection of Christ, were not received
into Heaven, and therefore not being in a state of Bliss
and Glory themselves, were not yet capable of Divine
Honours, could neither know our Prayers, nor intercede
for us. But now at last some eminent Saints and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
ascend directly into Heaven, and are the <hi>beati,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to such a state of Happiness and Glory, that they
are fit objects of Religious Worship, and are so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in the Court of Heaven, that God denies them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which they ask; and so tender and compassionate


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45002:33"/>
to us, that they readily undertake our Cause, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
for us, and therefore it is very good and profitable
now to invoke their aid and assistance by solemn and
devout Prayers.</p>
               <p>Now though the learnedst men among them are put
to miserable shifts to prove the least part of all this, yet
let us for argument-sake, suppose all this to be true, that
things are mightily changed since the making of this
Law, and that there is not the same reason now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
all Religious Worship to God alone, that there was
in the time of <hi>Moses,</hi> what follows from hence, that
therefore we may now worship Saints and Angels, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
this Law which forbids it? by no means,
unless they can prove that the Law is repealed too, as
well as the reason ceased: Here is the authority of the
Law-giver still, though we should suppose, that we had
lost the reason of the Law; till the Law is as expresly
repealed as it was given, it is Gods Will still, and that is
reason enough to bind the Law upon us, though other
reasons fail. The reason (if we speak of such reasons as
these, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> assigns, for it is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
case, if we speak of eternal and necessary reason,
which is nothing else but the eternal &amp; immutable nature
and will of God, which is an eternal Law) did not make
the Law, and the change of the reason cannot repeal it.
And since we see, that God has not repealed this Law,
we rather ought to conclude, that we are mistaken in
the reasons, for which God made this Law, or that there
are other reasons, which we know not of, for which he
continues it: we may indeed reasonably suppose, that
God will repeal a Law, when the reason, for which it
was given, ceases, though earthly Princes may not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
do so; but still the Law binds till it be repealed;
and it is more reasonable to conclude, that the reason of
the Law continues, while we see God does not repeal it,


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:45002:33"/>
than first to perswade our selves, that the reason of the
Law is changed, and thence infer the repeal and abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Law, when we see no such thing done.</p>
               <p>5. That these arguments which the Roman Doctors
urge, to justifie their worship of Saints and Angels, are
of no force to repeal that Law, which forbids the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of any other Being besides the Supreme God, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from this, that they had no force in them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the making of this Law, and therefore much less
can they repeal it now it is made: The reasons which
they use, had the same force then, which they have now,
and if notwithstanding all these reasons, God thought fit
to forbid the worship of all Created Beings, it is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to imagine, that these reasons should supersede the
obligation of that Law, which is made in contradiction
to all such reasonings: as to shew this brie<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly.</p>
               <p>They prove, that we may pray to Saints and Angels
to pray for us, because we may desire good men on
earth to pray for us. Now suppose we could not assign
the difference between praying to Saints in Heaven, and
desiring the prayers of Saints on earth, yet I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to know, whether good men did not pray for one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
and desire each others prayers, before and after
God gave this Law on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> which forbids the
Religious worship and invocation of any other Being but
himself: if good men did in all ages pray for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and desire one anothers prayers, and God allowed
and approved of this, then it seems God did not think
this a good reason for praying to Saints and Angels in
Heaven, because good men might beg each others pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
on earth, for if he had, he would not have made that
Law, which forbids such a Religious Invocation of any
Creature. And if notwithstanding this reason, which
had as much force then, as it has now, God made and
promulged this Law, this reason can never repeal it, nor
dissolve the obligation of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:45002:34"/>
Thus if the Saints &amp; Angels being in Heaven be a good
reason why they should be worshipped, this was as good
a reason at the giving of the Law, as it is now; for thô
we should suppose with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that Saints
departed were not in Heaven then, yet certainly the
Angels were, and if their being in Heaven made them
fit objects of our worship, why did God so expresly
forbid it; and if he forbad it then, when there was as
much reason to allow the worship of those heavenly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
as there is now, this argument cannot prove,
but that God forbids it still.</p>
               <p>The same may be said of the Intercession of Saints
and Angels. The Papists suppose, that the Saints and
Angels pray and intercede for us in Heaven, and obtain
for, and convey many blessings to us, and therefore it is
good and profitable to pray to them, and to flie to their
patronage; now though indeed they date the Intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Saints, (as they do their admission into heaven)
from the Resurrection of our Saviour, yet there is as
much evidence for the aids and intercessions of Angels
before and under the Law, as there is now; nay, I think
somewhat more; for the government of the world was
much more under the administration of Angels, in the
time of the Law, then it is now; and yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, God did by an express Law forbid the worship
of any Being but himself, and therefore of these Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
powers, who are somewhat superiour to Saints in
Heaven; and if this were no good reason against ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
this Law, it can be no good reason to prove the
abrogation of it.</p>
               <p>2. The next way they take to evade the obligation
of this Law of worshipping God only, is by distinctions.
As to name the chief of them.</p>
               <p>They tell us, that this Law is only opposed to the
worship of false Gods, such Gods as the Heathens wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped,


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45002:34"/>
not to the worship of Saints and Angels, who
are the Friends and Favourites of God.</p>
               <p>And then they distinguish about the nature of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
they confess there is a worship which is peculiar to
God, Supreme and Soveraign worship, which is peculiar
to the Supreme Being, and this, for what reason I know
not, they call <hi>Latria;</hi> but then there is an inferiour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of worship, which they call <hi>Dulia,</hi> which may be
given to excellent Creatures, to Saints and Angels, who
reign with Christ in Heaven.</p>
               <p>They farther distinguish between absolute and relative
worship. Absolute worship is, when we worship a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for its self, and thus God onely is to be worshipped;
but relative worship is, when we worship one Being out
of respect to another, and thus we may worship Saints
and Angels upon account of their relation to God.</p>
               <p>Now I shall have occasion to examine these distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
more particularly hereafter, my business at present
is to examine, how far these distinctions can justifie the
worship of Saints and Angels against an express Law,
which commands us to worship God only. And I have
three things to say on this argument. 1. That the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Law will admit of no such distinctions as
these. 2. That the Scripture no where allows of any
such distinctions, And 3. That no distinctions can justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
our acting against the letter of a Law, which have
not the same authority which the Law has.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>The letter of the Law will admit of no such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctious
as these. The Law is,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">20 Exod.</note> Thou shalt have none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Gods before me. <hi>The explication of this Law is,</hi>
Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God,<note place="margin">10 Deut. 20.</note> him shalt thou serve,
and to him shalt thou cleave and swear by his name. <hi>Or as
our Saviour expounds it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4 Matth 10.</note> Thou shalt worship the Lord thy
God, and him only shalt thou serve.</p>
               <p>Now these words do plainly exclude the worship of


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45002:35"/>
all other Beings besides the Supreme God: They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
indeed the worship of all the Heathen Gods,
which were at that time worshipped in the world, but
they are not confined to the worship of the Heathen
Gods, nor meerly to the worship of those Gods who
were at that time worshipt, but should any new Gods
start up in after Ages, whether among Jews or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
the words extend to all that are, and all that ever
shall be worshipped. <hi>Thou shalt have none other Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Me,</hi> Signifies, that we must worship no other Being
but the Supreme God, for <hi>to have a God,</hi> is to give reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
worship to some Being; as appears from that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
which both <hi>Moses</hi> and our Saviour Christ
gives of it. <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him
onely shalt thou serve.</hi> For it is impossible to have any
God besides the Supreme God, in any other sense than
as we worship some other Being, besides the Supreme
God, with Divine honours; and whatever Being we so
worship, become our God, and therefore this Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
the worship of any Being, which is not God, be it
Saint or Angel, or the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> how excellent
and perfect Creatures soever they be, they are not our
God, and therefore must not be worshipped. If we
must worship and serve God <hi>onely,</hi> as our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
tells us, that we must worship no Creature what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be, the worship of Saints and Angels is as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
forbid by this Law, as the worship of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Gods, for that Law which commands us to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God <hi>onely,</hi> excludes the worship of all Creatures,
whatever they be.</p>
               <p>But may not the meaning of this Law be onely this:
That we must not give Supreme and Soveraign wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to any other Being, but the Supreme God, but we
may give an inferiour degree of worship to some excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Spirits, who under God have the care of us. And


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:45002:35"/>
is not this plainly signified in the very letter of the Law,
when it says, <hi>Thou shalt have none other Gods before me.</hi>
For no other worship makes any Being a God, but that
which is Supreme and Soveraign, peculiar and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
to the One Supreme God; and therefore not to
have any other Being for our God, is not to give Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
and Soveraign worship to it. Now what that
worship is, which is peculiar and appropriate to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
God, I shall discourse particularly in the second
part; our present inquiry is, whether this Law makes
any such distinction. The Laws says, <hi>Thou shalt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the Lord thy God, and him onely shalt thou serve:</hi>
Here is no distinction between Supreme and Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
worship; whatever is an Act of worship must be
given to God onely. But the Law says, <hi>Thou shalt have
no other gods before me,</hi> and therefore it must signifie Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
&amp; Soveraign worship, for no other degree of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
makes a God. Did the Heathens then worship no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
gods? did those who worship ped so many several
Gods, look upon them all as supreme and absolute? or
were they so senseless as to give supreme and sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
worship to inferior Deities? or does not this
Law forbid the worship of those Gods, whom the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
worshipped as inferior Daemons, but onely the
worship of those Gods, whom they accounted supreme
and soveraign? If this Law forbids the worship of all
Heathen Gods, and it is certain, that they worshipped a
great many Gods, whom they did not account supreme,
then there can be no place for this distinction here, for
such an inferiour worship as makes an inferiour God, is
as well forbid, as Supreme and Soveraign worship.</p>
               <p>The Law says, <hi>Thou shalt have none other Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me:</hi> or besides me; which as I observed before,
does not exclude the worship of the Supreme God, but
forbids the worship of any other Being together with


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:45002:36"/>
him. The meaning is not, Thou shalt not renounce
my worship, for the worship of any other Gods, but
thou shalt worship me, and no other God besides me:
now I would onely ask this question, Whether a Jew
who worshipped the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> who declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be the Supreme God, could give Supreme wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to any other God? This is contrary to the sense of
all mankind, to worship him as supreme, whom they do
not believe to be supreme. And therefore when
God forbad them to joyn the worship of any other
Gods with the worship of himself, he must forbid all
kinds and degrees of worship, even the most inferiour
worship, which the Heathens paid to their inferiour Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>If you say, that God did indeed forbid all kinds and
degrees of worship to be paid to the Heathen Gods,
which were impure and wicked Spirits, but still it is
lawful to pay an inferiour worship to Saints and Angels,
who are the friends of God. I answer, the law makes
no distinction between the worship of good and bad
Spirits, and therefore as far as this Law is concerned, we
must either deny this inferiour worship to all, or grant
it to all. If this Law does not forbid giving inferiour
degrees of worship to other Beings, then it does not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
the inferiour worship of Heathen Gods; that may
be faulty upon other accounts, but is no breach of this
Law, and then the Heathens were not guilty of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
in worshipping their inferiour Daemons with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
worship. If this Law does forbid even this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
degree of worship, then it forbids the worship of
good Spirits too, though with an inferiour worship,
which transforms true Saints and Angels into false and
fictitious Deities.</p>
               <p>But I have another argument to prove, that this
Law can have no respect to the different degrees of


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45002:36"/>
worship. The <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors themselves grant, that
the difference between supreme and subordinate or infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
worship, does not consist in the outward Act, that
all or most of the external Acts of worship may belong
to both kinds, they except indeed Sacrifice, but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the sense of all men; for the Heathens offered Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to their inferiour Deities, as well as to the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme;
and there is no imaginable reason to be assigned,
why Sacrifice, as well as Prayer, may not be an act of
inferiour, as well as of supreme worship. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
then between supreme and inferiour worship, is
onely in the intention and devotion of the worshippers,
and no man can by the external act know whether this
be supreme or inferiour worship. Now from hence I
thus argue: if the worship forbidden by this Law be
such, as can be known by the external act, then this
Law can have no regard to the degrees of worship, for
the degrees of worship are not in the external acts, but
in the mind of the worshipper, which cannot be known
by external acts. Now that the Law did forbid the
external acts of worship, without any regard to the
intention of the worshipper, appears in this, that this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous
worship was to be punished with death,<note place="margin">13 Deuter. 6, 7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> and
therefore it must be such external Idolatry as falls under
the cognizance of humane Judicatures. Had there been
any regard to the degrees of worship, no man could
have been convicted of Idolatry by the external act, and
could not have been liable to punishment, unless he had
confessed his intention of giving supreme worship to a
false God, and so this Law of putting such Idolaters to
death had signified nothing, because it had been impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for them to convict any man of Idolatry, but by
his own confession; but when the external act which is
visible to all men, is sufficient to convict any man of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry,
it is next to a demonstration, that the Law


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:45002:37"/>
had no respect to the degrees, but to the acts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
               <p>And that our Saviour in that Law, thou shalt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the Lord thy God, and him onely shalt thou serve,
had no regard to the different degrees of worship, I have
already proved at large, for allowing that distinction, he
had not given a good answer to the Devils temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Thus as for their distinction between absolute and
relative worship, that though we must not worship any
Creature, the most excellent Saints and Angels, for
themselves, yet we may worship them upon account of
that relation they have to God; that is, we may wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
them for Gods sake, though not for their own; I
find no intimation of any such distinction in the Law.
We are there commanded to have no other Gods, to
worship God and him onely, which excludes Saints and
Angels from being the object of our worship, as well as
Devils.</p>
               <p>2. But possibly it may be said, that though the Law
takes no notice of such distinctions, yet the Scripture in
the explication of this Law may make allowances for it.
Now in answer to this, I onely desire to know, where
the Scripture has made any such distinction between
worshipping good and evil Spirits, the enemies and
Rivals, or the Friends of God, between supreme and
subordinate, absolute or relative worship; I can find no
such distinctions in Scripture, &amp; I have a material reason
to believe no such can be found, <hi>viz.</hi> because there was
no occasion for them. The Scripture no-where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
us to give any kind of worship to any Creature,
and therefore there was no need to distinguish between
the kinds and degrees of worship.</p>
               <p>The most material thing that can be said in this cause
is this: that when the Scripture mentions this Law of


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:45002:37"/>
worshipping One God, it opposes it to the worship of
the false Gods of the Heathens;<note place="margin">6 Deut. 13, 14. 13 Deut. 7.</note> from whence some
may conclude, that God forbade the worship only of
these false Gods. But we must consider, that the Law
is conceived in such general terms, as to exclude the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of all Beings besides the Supreme God; but it could
not be thought, that God should at that time immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apply this Law against the worship of any other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
but those which were at that time worshipped in
the world. If God gives a Law, which forbids the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of all Beings besides himself; and particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
this Law to prohibite the worship of all those Gods
which were then worshipped in the world, will any one
in their wits hence conclude, that if the folly and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition
of men should set up a new race and generation of
Gods in after ages, that the worship of these new Gods is
not as well forbidden by this general Law, as the worship
of those gods which were worshipt at that time when this
Law was given? if this were true, possibly Pagan <hi>Rome</hi> it
self was not guilty of Idolatry; for most, if not all of their
Gods might be of a later date than the giving the Law.</p>
               <p>3. Now since no such distinctions as these appear in
Scripture, it is impossible they should justifie the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of Saints and Angels, which is so expresly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by the Law, if we will acknowledge them to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Beings from the Supreme God; for if they are
not the Supreme God, we must not worship them, for we
must worship none but God. No distinctions can justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
us in this case, but such as God himself makes; for
otherwise it were easie to distinguish away any Law of
God. Humane Laws will admit of no distinctions, but
such as they make themselves; for a distinction does
either confine and streighten, or enlarge the Law, and
he who has power to distinguish upon a Law, has so far
power to make it. If the Law says, that we shall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45002:38"/>
no other Being besides God, and we have power; if
we have but wit enough, to invent some new distinctions,
between the worship of good and bad spirits, between Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
and Subordinate, absolute and relative worship,
this makes a new Law of it; for it is one thing to say,
thou shalt worship God only, and quite contrary to say,
thou shalt worship God only and good Spirits, God
with a Supreme and absolute, good Spirits with a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
and relative worship. This I think is sufficient
to shew, that we must admit of no distinctions upon a
Divine Law, but what the Scripture it self owns, and
therefore since those distinctions, with which the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> justifies her worship of Saints and Angels, are
no where to be found in Scripture, they have no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
against an express Law.</p>
               <p>3. The next course the Papists take to justifie their
Creature-worship, in contradiction to that Law, which
expresly commands us to worship none but God, is an
appeal to such authorities, as they think sufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
this matter.</p>
               <p>Now I shall not say much to this, for I believe all
Mankind will acknowledge, that no Authority less than
Divine, can repeal a Divine Law; and therefore unless
God himself, or such persons as act by a Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
have repealed this Law, no other Authority can
do it. That Christ and his Apostles have not repealed
this Law, I have already proved, that the whole Church
in after Ages had any Authority to repeal this Law, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
them to prove.</p>
               <p>For the authority of the Church, as to the essentials
of Faith and Worship, is not the authority of Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
but of Witnesses. The Church never pretended in
former Ages to make or to repeal any Divine Laws, but
to declare and testifie what the belief and practice of the
Primitive and Apostolick Churches was; and it is unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:45002:38"/>
to think, that they should have any such Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
for then Christ and his Apostles preached the
Gospel to little purpose, if it were in the power of the
Church to make a new Gospel of it when they pleased.</p>
               <p>But indeed could it appear, that the Apostles did teach
the Christians of that Age, and the Church in those A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
which immediately succeeded the Apostles, did pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
the worship of Saints and Angels, we should have
reason to suspect, that we, and not they, are mistaken
in the sense of that Law, which commands us to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
none but God.</p>
               <p>But then none can be admitted as competent witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of this matter, but those who did immediately suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the Apostles, or conversed with Apostolical men
and Churches. And thanks be to God, there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Creature worship in those Ages, we dare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to the testimony of Fathers and Councils for above
three hundred years; and those who come after, come
a little too late to be witnesses of what was done in the
Apostolick Churches; especially, when all the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Ages knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>I shall not fill up this discourse with particular Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which learned men know where to find; since the
Roman Doctors can find nothing in the Writings of the
first Fathers to justifie the worship of Saints and Angels,
and the Protestant Writers find a great deal in those A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
against it.</p>
               <p>Indeed at the latter end of the fourth Century, some
of the Fathers used some Rhetorical Apostrophes to the
Saints and Martyrs in their Orations, which the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> interprets to be Prayers to them;<note place="margin">See Bishops <hi>Ushers</hi> Answer to the Jesuits Challenge.</note> but though
other Learned men have vindicated those passages so far,
as to shew the vast difference between them, and solemn
and formal Invocations, which is not my business at
this time, yet there are several things very well worth


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:45002:39"/>
our observation towards the true stating of this matter.
As,</p>
               <p>1. That these Fathers came too late to be witnesses of
the Apostolical practise, which they could know no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
than we might know it, if there had been any
such thing, <hi>viz.</hi> by the testimony and practise of the
Church, from the Apostles till that time: This was no
where pretended by them, that the Invocation of Saints
had been the practise of the Catholick Church in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and they could have no proof of this, unless they
had better Records of former times, than we have at
this day, and such as contradicted all the Records which
we now have of the Apostolick and Primitive Churches,
and I believe few men will be so hardy, as to assert this;
and methinks there should be as few, who are so credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
as to believe it, and I am sure, there is no man living
who is able to prove it.</p>
               <p>2. Nay, the particular sayings of these Fathers, by
which the Romanists prove the Invocation of Saints, do
not prove, that it was the Judgment and practise of the
Church of that age. They no where say, that it was,
and it does not appear to be so by any other Records.
Let them shew me any Council before, or in those times,
when these Fathers lived, that is in the fourth Century,
which decreed the worship of Saints and Angels. Let
them produce any publick offices of Religion in those
days, which allows this worship; and if no such thing
appears, those men must be very well prepared to believe
this, who will without any other evidence judge of the
practice of the Church, only from some extravagant
flights of Poets and Orators: and if even in those days,
the worship of Saints was not received into the publick
offices of the Church, methinks we may as well live
without it still, and they must either grant, that these
Fathers, whose authority they alleadge, meant no such


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:45002:39"/>
thing by these Rhetorical flourishes, as they extract out
of them, or else that they introduced a new and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
worship into the Christian Church; and then
let them prove, that some few Fathers of the fourth
Century, without the publick authority of the Church,
had authority enough of their own to change the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of worship, contrary as the Church in former Ages,
believed, to an express Divine Law, which commands
us to worship none but God.</p>
               <p>3. Nay, I further observe, that these Fathers, whose
authority is urged for the invocation of Saints by the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> do no-where dogmatically and posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
assert the lawfulness of Praying to Saints and
Angels, and many Fathers of the same Age do positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deny the lawfulness of it, which is a plain argument,
that it was not the judgement and practice of the
Church of that Age, and a good reasonable presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that these Fathers never intended any such thing
in what they said, how liable soever their words may be
to be expounded to such a sense.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> indeed in his Book against <hi>Julian</hi>
the Apostate, speaks to the Soul of <hi>Constantius,</hi> in this
manner: <hi>Hear O thou Soul of great</hi> Constantius <hi>(if thou
hast any sense of these things,)</hi> &amp;c. But will you call this
a Prayer to <hi>Constantius?</hi> does this Father any where
assert in plain terms that it is lawful to pray to Saints
departed? a hundred such sayings as these, which are
no Prayers to Saints, cannot prove the lawfulness of
praying to Saints against the constant Doctrine of the
Fathers of that Age. Thus in his Funeral Oration for
his Sister <hi>Gorgonia,</hi> he bespeaks her to this purpose, that
if she knew what he was now a doing,<note place="margin">Greg. Naz. <hi>Orat. 2. in</hi> Gorg.</note> and if holy Souls
did receive this favour from God to know such matters
as these, that then she would kindly accept that Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which he made in her praise, instead of other Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:45002:40"/>
Obsequies. Is this a Prayer to <hi>Gorgonia</hi> to intercede
for him with God? by no means! He onely desires if she
heard what he said of her (which he was not sure she did)
that she would take it kindly. Whereas in that very
Age the Fathers asserted, that we must pray onely to
God, and therefore they define Prayer by its relation to
God;<note place="margin">Basil, Orat. in <hi>Julit.</hi> Martyr. <hi>Greg. Naz.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. 1. de Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione. Chrys. in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Homil. 30. Aug. De Civit Dei, l. 22. cap. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>That Prayer is a request of some good things, made
by devout Souls to God,</hi> that <hi>it is a conference with
God, that it is a request offered with supplication to God.</hi>
Which is a very imperfect definition of Prayer, were it
lawful to pray to any other Being besides God.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Austin</hi> tells us, that when the names of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
were rehearsed in their publick Liturgies, it was
not to invoke them, or pray to them, but onely for an
honourable remembrance; nay, he expresly tells us, that
the worship of dead men, must be no part of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
for if they were pious men, they do not desire
this kind of honour, but would have us worship God:
<hi>honorandi ergo sunt propter imitationem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Id. de vera re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligione, Cap. 55</note> 
                  <hi>non adorandi prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
religionem,</hi> they are to be honoured for our imitation,
not to be adored as an act of Religion.</p>
               <p>The Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> condemned the Worship of
Angels; and so does <hi>Theodoret, Oecumenius,</hi> and others of
that Age. It is notoriously known, that the <hi>Arrians</hi>
were condemned as guilty of Idolatry for worshipping
Christ, whom they would not own to be the true God,
though they owned him to be far exalted above all Saints
and Angels, and to be as like to God, as it is possible for
any Creature to be: and those who upon these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
condemned the worship of the most perfect and
excellent Creature, could never allow the worship of
Saints and Angels.</p>
               <p>So that though the worship of Saints and Angels, did
begin about this time to creep into the Church, yet it
was opposed by these pious and learned Fathers, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45002:40"/>
in the first and smallest appearances of it; which
shows, that this was no Catholick Doctrine and Practice
in that Age, much less that it had been so from the
Apostles; and I think, after this time there was no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in the Church to alter the object of worship,
nor to justifie such an Innovation as the worship of
Saints and Angels, in opposition to the express Law of
God.</p>
               <p>The sum of this Argument is this: Since there is an
express Law against the worship of any other Being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the supreme God, the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which never
was expresly repealed, whatever plausible reasons may
be urged for the worship of Saints and Angels, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
justifie us in acting contrary to an express Law of
God.</p>
