            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The First Apparition of
Bishop Goodman's Ghost,
BEING
A New strange Sight, Or: A Late strange Vision.
Making a wofull Repetition, of his former Confession; in 1653.
Upon the Extirpation of Bishops: in 1642.
Now Occasionally Revewed, and seasonably Renewed. 1681. For an Adhortatory Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
to all Bishops, and their Courts.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Confess, that God would never have permitted us, to have Suffer'd in such a manner, as we have
done, had we not provoked Him with our Sins. And that I may be our own Accuser, I think
our greatest Offence did consist in these two things.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> That many of Us, did not spend our <hi>Church-means</hi> in a Church-like manner; but
converted them to our own private <hi>Vses:</hi> Or otherwise, Misimploy'd them: Therefore, God
justly takes them away; and permits <hi>Sacriledge:</hi> we our <hi>Selves</hi> having first Offended in the same
kinde. For certainly, Church-means should have relation as well to the <hi>Vses</hi> as to the <hi>Persons:</hi> and a Church-man
in mispending them, commits <hi>Sacriledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas many excuse it, in regard of their Wives, and Children; God forbid, but regard should be had
to <hi>Them:</hi> yet still with moderation.</p>
            <p>I cannot excuse the Excess of <hi>Apparel,</hi> and some other courses of Expence. Yet, This I must testifie for a Truth,
that speaking privately with some Bishops, they told me, and I believed them; that they laid not up, one Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of their Bishopricks: and This may appear, for many of them, died very Poor: As <hi>Worcester, Hereford,
Peterborough, Bristol:</hi> and not unlike, but others will do so.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Another great fault in the Church, was the intollerable Abuse, of the <hi>Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction:</hi> therefore God
hath made us now Uncapable of Any <hi>Iurisdiction.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>So just and wonderful is God in all his Iudgements.</q>
            <p>I confess, in mine own particular, I did as much desire, and labour to reform it, as any man could do; yet I
could never prevail. Herein a little to excuse the Church; I have it, and can produce it at this time, under the
Kings own Hand, and Seal: wherein he forbids, that any Church-man, or Priest in Holy Orders, should be a
<hi>Chauncellour:</hi> and This was the Occasion, of all the Corruption, in the <hi>Spiritual Courts.</hi> For the Judges at the
<hi>Common Law</hi> have their Pensions, and Allowances: but Chauncellours have none at all: They live only upon
the <hi>Fees</hi> of the Court: and for Them to Dismiss a Cause; it was to lose so much blood. Now if they be naught
in Themselves; then they must for their own Advantage and Profit, have Instruments and Agents accordingly:
so the <hi>Registers, Proctors, Apparators;</hi> they were—</p>
            <q>Pessimum genus hominum.</q>
            <p>While the <hi>Spiritual Court</hi> was only Govern'd by Church-men and Priests; [as it ought to be, and hath ever
been so heretofore:] they had their Spiritual Benefices, and Dignities to live upon; and did scorn the Fees of
the Court. Besides the Holiness of the Profession, kept them from Bribing, and Corruption.</p>
            <p>Little do men think, how much they suffer, by this own Position;—That Church-men should not Interpose
in Civil and Moral Affairs: whereas formerly, Bishops, and Church-men were only trusted with <hi>Last Wills</hi> and
<hi>Testaments;</hi> and granting out <hi>Administrations:—</hi>and certainly, if there be any Honesty amongst men; it must
be supposed to be rather in them, then in others. But there having been such an <hi>Abuse;</hi> it must be <hi>acknowledged,</hi>
that God is most Just in all his wayes: and what hath befallen us, it is according to the Deserts of our <hi>Sin.</hi>
