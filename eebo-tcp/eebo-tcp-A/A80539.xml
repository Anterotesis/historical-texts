            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>WE make bold being preſt in ſpirit, to repreſent to you, as the ground of our fears, ſo the matter of our deſires. It hath pleaſed God after much plottings and endeavours of the old and New Malignants, to Crown the Army under your conduct with great ſucceſſe; and although God by that calls for juſtice, little or none is done, to the great grief as to the Kingdom in general, ſo unto us in particular; and leſſe is like to be done, unleſſe your Excellency preſently appear to do ſomething, and the Army with you, to be a leading cauſe to us; we wait for it. Inſtead of Iuſtice, behold a Treaty with them for Peace, that God ſpeaks no Peace to: and inſtead of owning juſt Petitions, they are laid aſide, and not countenanced; ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Treaty not long ſince voted the Army Rebels; what that prognoſticates in the future, when they have power, we leave to your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency to judge. VVe can hardly forbear but Petition the Parliament, (remembring our engagement at New-market Heath,) but we are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to do any thing without your Excellencies pleaſure, being deſirous in all good things to be led by you: and being confident (as formerly, ſo ſtill) you will ſtand by the Kingdom and the Army in their juſt Rights. So hoping you will ſo far honour us, as to make a favourable conſtruction of our expreſſions, and give an anſwer to encourage us to joyn with the well-affected, in their Petitions, for their juſt Rights and Priviledges, We ſubſcribe our ſelves in the behalf of the Officers and Souldiers of this Gariſon and Tinmouth.</p>

               <p>SEing it hath pleaſed God to exalt you into a place of Eminency and Truſt in the Common-wealth of England, for the Redemption thereof from Captivity and Bondage, and to that End God having alſo bleſt You and us with proſperous Succeſs and Conqueſts, (beyond the ey of humane ſenſe) both in the late and preſent Wars, over Yours and the Peoples moſt inveterate Enemies; and ſeeing that we and all the well-affected of the Land ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured our lives, and all that was deer unto us, not ſparing cheerfully and faithfully to paſs through all dangers and difficulties with you attending that Engagement; we are emboldened now at laſt (having looked round about us, and finding neither Your Excellency, the Army, nor the People yet anſwered as to thoſe ends) to make our humble Addreſs unto Your Excellency in this Juncture of time, wherein we apprehend, that the bloud that hath bin ſpilt, the Conqueſts that God hath crowned us withal, the treaſure and wealth of the People expended, is all upon the point of being rendred in vain and of none effect: For, to the ſorrow of our hearts, we find that even thoſe particulars of Common Right and Freedom, for which we took up Arms and ſtill continue them, are not regarded, though by way of humble Petition lately preſented to the Houſe of Commons by the wel-affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in and about London; and inſteed of anſwering thoſe their juſt Deſires of Freedom and Safety to the People, we find a Treaty with our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Enemy (who hath not ſo much as himſelf to Treat for, and on whom we muſt, and that of right, lay the guilt of all the bloud that hath bin ſpilt in theſe wars) is now choſen, and vigorouſly purſued; and Compoſitions at eaſie rates made with the new Delinquents for their late Rebellions and Treaſons againſt the Common-wealth; though we juſtly expected that their Lands ſhould be made over to us; and the whole Souldiery for our Arrears: and no Juſtice likely to be done to perfideous <hi>Hambleton,</hi> or to his Adherents, who invaded our Land, and made war upon us; nor yet upon thoſe Lords and Commons, Aldermen, and Common Councel men of London, whom that Invador profeſt to invite him in: Nor yet upon the Earl of Holland, whom the Houſe of Lords lately and moſt unjuſtly voted out of his Impriſonment in Warwick Caſtle: nor yet upon the Lord <hi>Goring,</hi> Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> Lord <hi>Louthbury, Laughorne, Powel, Poyer,</hi> &amp;c.
