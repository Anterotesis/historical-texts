            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

uſes nothing but Policy and Stratagems to bring about its Amorous Intrigues and Deſigns. Yet, notwithſtanding this vaſt difference, <hi>Mars</hi> is ſeldom ſeen to take the Field, but that Love is perceived to follow in the Rear, not without hopes of obtaining as conſiderable Conqueſts there, as the other can hope for in the firſt ranks of Honour. We are not without divers examples of this kind; but this which I here preſent to the publick, is of ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern a date, and ſo remarkable in our days, that I thought I ſhould not a little oblige the World in giving it this Piece of Gallantry, in which one of our own Nation, was one of the principal Heroes, both as to War and Love.</p>
            <p>We will diſguiſe him under the Name of <hi>Peregrine,</hi> of a conſiderable Family in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> though a younger Brother, who being come to <hi>London,</hi> (that famous place for framing of Youth to Virtue, as well as to Vice,) there he ſell in Company with ſome Officers of the Conſederates, who had left their <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Winter-Quarters, to ſpend ſome days in ſeeing the <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Court.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:58987:4"/>His natural tendency to Arms put him on the deſign of ſeeing a Campaigne, or two; and though he had ſome thoughts at firſt, to make his firſt Eſſay in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> yet the Friendſhip which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with theſe <hi>German</hi>-Officers, made him to proffer to accompany them back, to ſerve with them in quality of Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier in the Army of the Allies, in hopes they would continue their Friendſhip to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. They readily imbrac'd his offers, with aſſurances of not only their Services out of their Friendſhip; alſo, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially Count <hi>Zinzendorf,</hi> who had a conſiderable Poſt, took him into particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Protection, aſſuring him, That he would write to him, and ſend him word where he ſhould find him at the opening of the Campaigne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peregrine</hi> having laid ſo good a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, to build his war-like Reſolution upon, thinks of no more but getting, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Seaſon, ſuch an Equipage as might ſute with his Deſigns, and the quality of thoſe that honoured him with their Friendſhip; wherefore ſo ſoon as theſe <hi>German</hi> Gentlemen had ſatisfied their Curioſities, in all that was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in this great City, and the adjacent
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58987:5"/>
places to it, (in which <hi>Peregrine</hi> did aſſiſt them, not only with all his Intereſt, but that of his Friends alſo,) they took leave of him, and imbarked for <hi>Holland,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their return in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>Now is <hi>Peregrine</hi> buſied to the utmoſt, to get himſelf provided with Horſes, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, Monies, and other neceſſaries, to appear like a Gentleman, being reſolved to ſignalize himſelf by ſome brave action to render himſelf worthy of the honour of theſe brave Strangers, who had ſo free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken him into their Friendſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peregrine</hi> had left in the Country, a young Gentlewoman, who was deeply in love with him; but his Mind having been for a conſiderable time, before he could perceive her affections, poſſeſt with the deſires of Travelling, he had avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as much as he could, her Company, for fear of being diverted by her from his beloved deſign. This Gentlewoman hearing of <hi>Peregrine</hi>'s ſuddain leaving of <hi>England,</hi> writ to him a Letter, which was extraordinary full of Paſſion, which he received the day before his departure; the contents of which I ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

            <p>There is nothing like a willing mind to diſpatch Buſineſs; his deſires were ſo great, that in a ſhort time he had got ready an Equipage ſuitable to his worth; with which, after having taken leave of his particular Friends, in the Month of <hi>March</hi> he ſet forward for <hi>Harwich,</hi> where having found the Pacquet-Boat ready for ſail, he went in it for <hi>Holland;</hi> where he ſafely arrived the third day after <gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

            <p>There had fallen ſuch a vaſt quantity of Rain, during a whole day and night, that all the Roads were covered with Waters, and the ſmall Rivers ſwollen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58987:6"/>
Torrents: He was to paſs on through a Ford that was at a ſmall diſtance from an ancient Caſtle, by whoſe Walls the River run, taring up, and hurrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with its Streams, Trees, and pieces of Rocks.</p>
            <p>There was a Lady on the other ſide of the River, who leaning over ſome Rails on the Banks, beholding the ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſion which this medly of things made; <hi>Peregrine</hi> having made an halt, while he had ſent one of his Men for a Guide, he, mean time, had leaſure to conſider that Perſon, who with her ſumptuous Dreſs, and delicate Beauty, had fix'd his Eyes in admiration of her; when on the ſuddain, the Earth ſhe ſtood upon, gave way, and ſhe, with the Rails, fell head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the Torrent; ſhe gave a moſt vehement out-cry, which was ſeconded by <hi>Peregrine,</hi> and his Servants. He Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſet Spurs to his Horſe, and having gon beyond where ſhe was floting on the Currant, being buoy'd up by her Cloths, and the rapidneſs of the Stream, he plung'd into the River, and with much ado, got hold of her; but finding his Horſe might hurt her, while he dragg'd her along, he quitted him, not without
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58987:6"/>
receiving a hurt in the Leg, which made it the more difficult for him to reach the ſhore, with his drowning Prize: At laſt he got hold of ſome Roots of Trees, by which he hung, 'till he had recovered Breath, holding the Lady's Head, as much as poſſible he could, above Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, 'till his Man reaching ſome Branches to him, which they had haſtily lopp'd off of Trees; he got hold of them, and was pulled to ſhoar, with the Lady: She laid for dead, on the Graſs; and he with ſmall ſigns of life.</p>
            <p>By this time, the out-crys that had been made at the Lady's fall in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, had brought ſome of the Servants of the Caſtle to the Rivers ſide, where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beheld the ſad Spectacle, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed the out-crys; but above all, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana, Clarinda</hi>'s Kinſwoman, tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted beyond her ſelf, at the ſight of her dead Friend, did fling her ſelf violently upon her Body, making the greateſt La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations imaginable; at the ſhock of theſe two Bodies, <hi>Clarinda</hi> coming a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to her ſelf, open'd her Eyes, and fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſhort ſigh, gave viſible ſigns that there was ſome Life in her. <hi>Peregrine,</hi> who was come to himſelf a little before,

This ſaid, was ſoon obey'd, ſhe being abſolute Miſtreſs in that Caſtle, by her Father's detention, her Brother's abſence in the Wars of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and the Death of her Mother; 'tis true, there was an old Aunt liv'd with her, but ſo antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that ſhe was rather a burden, than an aid. <hi>Peregrine</hi> was preſently laid in a good warm Bed, in a decent Apartment; great excuſes made for having defered ſo long the performance of thoſe things, ſo juſtly due to his Merits, laying the whole fault on the care they had taken of their young Miſtreſs's recovery. Then inquiry was made how he felt his Leg: He told them, that he found he ſhould want the uſe of ſome expert Chyrurgeon, becauſe he felt the pain to increaſe, and to ſpread it ſelf upwards: there was preſently a Chyrurgeon ſent for; as alſo a Phyſician to look to <hi>Clarinda</hi>'s, as well as to <hi>Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grine</hi>'s Health; they were both blooded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

ſome ſlight Remedies, <hi>Clarinda</hi> was in a ſhort time perfectly recovered; but it was not ſo with <hi>Peregrine;</hi> for what with having his Contuſion ſo long bathed in cold Water, at a Seaſon when the Air was ſomething ſharp, there was ſome apprehenſion of a Gangrene, which ſhew'd it ſelf by the lividity, and inſenſibility of the part. So ſoon as <hi>Clarinda</hi> underſtood the danger, ſhe doubled her diligence in attending him: She was no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to let him have all that the Caſtle and Neighbourhood could afford of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and refreſhment, but ſhe thought her ſelf oblig'd to adminiſter them her ſelf: while <hi>Peregrine</hi> dy'd for Love of <hi>Clarinda,</hi> and ſlighted his own illneſs.</p>
            <p>It is an old ſaying, <hi>That Love will creep where it cannot go;</hi> and it is as true as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. At firſt <hi>Clarinda</hi> did all theſe pieces of ſervice to her Deliverer, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent Duties on thoſe Obligations ſhe was ingag'd to him for her Life. But little, by little, ſhe found that there was ſome other motive, though ſhe knew nor what, that led her on; ſhe was more concern'd, and more inquiſitive after <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrine</hi>'s well-fare, every day, though he daily increaſed in health: She would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58987:8"/>
find her ſelf in his Room, yet forget how ſhe came there, and for what purpoſe; which would ſometimes ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſe her, that <hi>Peregrine</hi> could not but obſerve it, and ſhe perceiving his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of it, that would put her in the greater diſorder. Once, amongſt the reſt, <hi>Clarinda</hi> having entred his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, with a preſerving Pan, with young Chickens in it, did not know that ſhe had miſtaken his Room for hers, 'till <hi>Peregrine</hi> ask'd her aloud, Whether ſhe had brought him a Pan full of Caudle for his Brakefaſt? That indeed put her into ſuch a confuſion, that not having a ready excuſe, ſhe ſpeedily went<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out of the Chamber again, without replying one word: whereupon <hi>Peregrine</hi> offered to riſe, and run after her, but found he had attempted beyond the power of his Leg: I cannot follow you Madam, cry'd he, but it ſhall be for the next time. When ſhe was got to her own Chamber, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to conſider her condition, and how inſenſibly Love had drawn her into his Net, was very much troubled at it, but much more, that ſhe had given <hi>Peregrine</hi> ſo great an inſight into the affairs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of her Heart: She endeavoured to frame ſome
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58987:9"/>
excuſes a thouſand ways, but all to no purpoſe; ſhe could not find any thing in the whole Magazine of her Wit, that could attone for that Error<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe ſhe knew that <hi>Peregrine</hi> had taken particular notice of it, and that her ſuddain, and ſilent retreat, had confirmed him but too much of her miſtake. In this great perplexity ſhe abſtain'd from viſiting him all that day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when it began to grow duskiſh, in hopes to conceal the diſorders ſhe ſhould be in, at the ſight of him, ſhe adventured into his Chamber, not being able to abſtain any longer from the ſight of a Perſon who had made a greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in her Heart, than ſhe expected. I come, Sir, ſaid ſhe, not to make an Applogy for entring your Chamber this Morning, but for my obrupt return, without ſhewing you thoſe pretty little Creatures I had in my Pan, and not ſo much as making any excuſe for my rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

Theſe Words check the brisk thoughts which <hi>Clarinda</hi>'s late Action, had raiſed in his mind, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it was his offer to go after her in the morning, that had deprived him of her preſence all that day; ſo that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently turned the deſign he had made to rally her, into a profound reſpect.

Nay, Sir, ſhe ſaid, then I can take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what I owe you, which I muſt acknowledge to be great, being oblig'd to you for no leſs than my Life, with the addition of the great hazard you put yours in, in that worthy Action; and I am not ſo deſtitute of Gratitude, as not to own that I have nothing to preſent you with, proportionable to ſo ſignal a piece of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; but when all is done, I can but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you thoſe ſmall means that I have at preſent at my own diſpoſal, being yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Tuition of a Father, and a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both unfortunately abſent now that I want them here, to add their Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments, where mine are deficient Oh!

With that uncovering her Face, and perceiving <hi>Peregrine</hi> ſtanding before her, ſhe gave a ſhriek, and preſently clouding her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance with ſome marks of Diſpleaſure, in another Accent, ſhe ſaid; It was not fair, Sir, thus to intrude upon my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, and become a ſpie to my moſt ſecret Actions; it muſt needs leſſen you in my thoughts, and that which mere Gratitude had made me to expreſs to your Advantage, may by ſuch proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Count, who <hi>Peregrine</hi> had thought to be gone, was returning again upon his ſteps, but was met by <hi>Mariana</hi> at the Chamber Door, who having ſeen the poſture of theſe two Lovers, judg'd it convenient to prevent the Count from the ſame Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; but yet not ſo well but that he had time to perceive, as ſhe was ſhutting the Door, how Courteouſly <hi>Clarinda</hi> was raiſing <hi>Peregrine</hi> from the Floor. Hell and Confuſion, cried the Count, Can I ſee this tamely? It muſt not, it ſhall not be, one of us two muſt yield to the other, by a ſuddain Death; with that he went haſtily out again, grumbling to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Mariana</hi> did attempt to appeaſe him, and called to him, but he had no Ears left but for revenge, which preſs'd him forward to ſome fatal Enterpriſe.</p>

and in order to bring my ſelf to this frame of Temper, I will have the vileſt Thoughts of my ſelf, and the moſt honourable of the Count, that I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in my Imagination: as for your Excellencies, I am already ſatisfied, that they put you above the aſpiring of the moſt accompliſhed Monarchs on Earth. <hi>Mariana</hi>'s coming in to acquaint them with what the Count had ſeen, and ſaid, made them to change their Diſcourſe; and ſome time after, <hi>Peregrine</hi> ſeeing it grow late, took his leave of <hi>Clarinda,</hi> in order to go to his Bed; at which <hi>Clarin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> thought fit (to ſweeten his reliſh after the bitter Potion ſhe had given him,) with ſome kindneſſes, to ſay, that ſhe had a great deſire to ſee his Leg, which ſhe fear'd was not ſo well as ſhe could wiſh, by his favouring it ſo much. I have attained, added ſhe, to ſome skill in Wounds and Bruiſes, from ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations which I have made in my Mother's, and my Aunt's charitable pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe amongſt the Poor of the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. <hi>Peregrine</hi> would have excuſed himſelf from giving her that trouble.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:58987:16"/>But <hi>Clarinda,</hi> who deſign'd to ſweeten him again, ordered <hi>Mariana</hi> to ſend for thoſe things with which he dreſs'd his Leg, that ſhe might ſee it opened her ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peregrine</hi> muſt have been more than blind, not to diſcern that all <hi>Clarinda</hi>'s pretended actions of gratitude, were the meer effects of Love. But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his knowledge, he was to ſeem ignorant: He therefore conſented to all her deſires, and permitted his Leg to be dreſs'd by his two new Chyrurgeons. <hi>Clarinda</hi> perceiving ſome blackneſs ſtill remaining on the bruiſed part, appeared much concerned at it, and ſaid, ſhe fear'd very much that he was not yet paſt all danger. <hi>Peregrine</hi> proteſted all was well; that he felt no other inconveniency at that preſent, but a little weakneſs which attended his Ankle, which he attributed to the want of uſing his Leg, and the fall of ſome humours upon that part. <hi>Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> who knew it would pleaſe <hi>Clarinda,</hi> did ſecond her in what ſhe ſaid, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it was fit to ſend for the Chyrurgeon very early in the Morning, before he ſhould be gone forth: ſo that <hi>Peregrine,</hi> for fear of offending, had not a word to

reply. This being concluded on, and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrine</hi>'s Leg ſwadled up again, he took his leave once more of his two Doctreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and by the aid of one of his Servants, retir'd to his own Chamber.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peregrine</hi> was no ſooner got thither, but <hi>Clarinda</hi> went into hers, attended by her Faithful <hi>Mariana;</hi> where, while <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi> was undreſſing, they had a large diſcant upon that Evenings Tranſactions; wherein <hi>Mariana</hi> endeavoured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince <hi>Clarinda,</hi> That ſeeing ſhe her ſelf was grown to that paſs, as not to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of concealing her Paſſion towards <hi>Peregrine,</hi> ſhe ought to take other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods with him, and not deny ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, that which ſhe could not conceal from him in the day, and from her at night, in her Dreams and paſſionate Tranſports, at her awaking. <hi>Clarinda</hi> confeſs'd, that ſhe could not well palliate her Paſſion much longer, it was grown to ſuch a heighth, but that ſhe was reſolved not wholly to declare in favour of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrine</hi> neither, 'till ſhe had got her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's conſent to diſingage herſelf from the Count; and that ſhe would loſe no time, nor leave no means unattempted to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh her deſigns; wherefore ſhe had

The Count hearing of this, cauſed the Chyrurgeon to bleed him in the left Arm; after which he took the opportunity of this Meſſenger to convey a Challenge into <hi>Peregrine's</hi> hand, and to receive an anſwer by the ſame way, unknown, and unſuſpected by any Perſon of the Caſtle.

them; all this did but ſtill more, and more inſnare <hi>Clarinda,</hi> who could not but be highly pleas'd at her Lover's great Paſſion and Bravery, which very much ficted her Maſculine Spirit; but ſhe had deſign'd to prevent all miſchief, for this time, with a reſolution to give her ſelf to him, ſo ſoon as the Meſſenger ſhe had ſent to her Father, were return'd, what anſwer ſoever he brought, in order to prevent all future quarrels, in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that being once his, all other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions would be at an end, and fall of themſelves,</p>
            <p>The Day drawing to an end, <hi>Clarinda</hi> pretended her ſelf ſomewhat indiſpoſed, that ſhe might the ſooner retire to perfect the deſign, which ſhe, and <hi>Mariana</hi> had laid, to diſappoint <hi>Peregrine</hi> of his Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: <hi>Peregrine</hi> alſo, to take time to pack up all things, without noiſe, was glad of that opportunity to retire.</p>
            <p>He had not been long alone in his Chamber, but he thought he heard the ſound of ſome Inſtrument, at a diſtance, which made him give an Attention to it; he ſhifted to all ſides of the Room, to find from whence it came; at laſt, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opened a Cloſet Door, he was ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58987:20"/>
that it proceeded from behind that Wall: He laid his Ear as cloſe as he could to it, and diſcern'd 'twas a Lute; after which he heard ſome body ſay, Here, take this Inſtrument, it ſuits not now my too diſtracted Thoughts, come lets to reſt: I think 'twill be convenient, anſwer'd another, that we may not fail of encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the Count early enough, to defeat his Deſigns. 'Twill be a ſtrange Surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, anſwer'd the other, to him, and to our Gueſts, who little think how faſt he is ſecure. After this, there was a ſilence which made him give over hearkning, to break their Meaſures, not doubting but 'twas <hi>Clarinda</hi> and <hi>Mariana,</hi> who had had ſome Intelligence of the Duel: He was alone in his Chamber, having order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Servants to their reſt; he went to open his Chamber-Door, to call one of them, but found he was double lock'd in. This made him to diſtruſt the more, but knew not how to remedy it; in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity walking up and down, he at laſt thought of getting out at the Window; he takes what he thought fit with him, looks every where for his Sword, but finds it not; ſo gets out of the Window without it, and finds himſelf near to the

Stable-Yard, he makes towards the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, where he finds his Man getting the Horſes in a readineſs, according to order, inquires after his Sword, but no News of it, ſo was forc'd to take one of his Servants Weapons, and that he might not be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by <hi>Clarinda,</hi> cauſes his Servants, to turn all the Horſes looſe, out of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, except his own, believing it too far a Journey for her to walk. Now, he grows very impatient, thinks the time long, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns not to his Chamber, but waits for the tedious hour by his Horſes; and ſo ſoon as day began to peep, he gets his Horſes ſadled our, without noiſe, and he follows himſelf, without being diſcover'd. That Servant who had been ſent to find where the Gravel pits were, leads the Van, <hi>Peregrine</hi> followed; after Five or Six Miles riding, the Guide told his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that they were within half a Mile of the Pits; there <hi>Peregrine</hi> makes a halt, and perceicing a thick Wood, on the right, commands his Men to go wait for him there; after which, he rides on with his Guide, who leads him to the Pits; there he orders his Man, that ſo ſoon as he ſhould ſee a Gentleman appear, he ſhould retire homewards, in the Road,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58987:21"/>
at ſome convenient diſtance, a little out of the way, not to be ſeen, and there wait his coming.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarinda,</hi> full of Thoughts and Fears, could not Sleep, nor ſuffer <hi>Mariana</hi> to take reſt; but ſo ſoon as Day began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, they did ariſe, and calling up ſome Servants, gave Orders to have three Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſadled, her own, and <hi>Marianas,</hi> and another for a Groom, and they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to get themſelves ready. The Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger preſently returned, ſaying, That there was not an Horſe in the Stable; this did alarum <hi>Clarinda:</hi> What, ſaid ſhe, are not our Gueſt's Horſes there neither? The Perſon anſwered, that there was not one; this put <hi>Clarinda</hi> in a great plunge, and <hi>Mariana</hi> was ſent immediately down, with the Key of <hi>Peregrine</hi>'s Chamber-Door, to ſee after him; ſhe paſſing by that Window, out of which <hi>Peregrine</hi> had got, perceiving it open, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing white lying on the ground, ſhe took it up, and feared he had got out that way, ſhe haſtily run to his Chamber-Door, and having opened it, found that the Bird was flown; ſhe immediately run back to acquaint <hi>Clarinda</hi> of it, and both in great ſurpriſe, run to the Stables,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58987:22"/>
half dreſſed, and half undreſſed; there <hi>Clarinda</hi> met a Groom, leading her own Pad, who ſaid, He, nor his Fellows, could find no more Horſes, as yet, ſhe cauſed him immediately to be ſaddled, mean time, ſends <hi>Mariana</hi> for <hi>Peregrine</hi>'s Sword, which ſhe had laid out of the way; and ſo ſoon as her Horſe was ready, gets up, orders <hi>Mariana</hi> to follow her, ſo ſoon as poſſible ſhe could, and rides towards the Pits, as faſt as her Horſe could carry her.</p>
            <p>By this the Count was come, <hi>Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grine</hi> had left him for dead, and at his fall, having perceived a blue Ribbon hang out of his Pocket, he had the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to pluck it out, at the end of which, he found a Picture, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving to be <hi>Clarindas,</hi> he put it in his own Pocket, and run back to find his Man and Horſe, to make his eſcape. He had not gon far, before he met with an Horſe, on which hung <hi>Clarinda,</hi> by the Foot in the Stirrup, and her Head drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging on the ground, crying out for help. He preſently knew her by her voice, and perceiving that the Horſe was fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he gently drew near him till he got hold of the Bridle; and by that means
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58987:22"/>
was a ſecond time the Preſerver of his dear Miſtreſſes Life. He diſingaged her, and knowing he could not be far from his Servant, he whiſtled, at which he preſently came: <hi>Clarinda</hi> had been cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bruiſed, all about the Head and Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and receiv'd a dangerous Wound, on her Arm, with a tread of the Horſe, which cauſed her to ſwound, ſo ſoon as ſhe had been layd in <hi>Peregrine</hi>'s Lap, who with both his Hands, hill'd her Head, and endeavour'd to ſtop the Blood which ran very faſt. He was in this poſture, when <hi>Mariana</hi> came full ſpeed, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Diſaſter, leapt off of her Horſe, and ran to <hi>Clarinda,</hi> who ſhe found coming to her ſelf; and who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to return thanks to <hi>Peregrine</hi> for his timely Aſſiſtance. He preſently enquir'd how ſhe found her ſelf, which was ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Mariana. Clarinda,</hi> not ſenſible then of her pain, told them, She hop'd it would be nothing, and that the fright was the moſt: But <hi>Peregrine,</hi> who knew better than her ſelf, in what a Condition ſhe was, deſired that ſhe ſhould immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately be carried back to her Bed, and Chirurgeons ſent for to take Care of her Wounds, and Bruiſes; ſhe would not
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58987:23"/>
conſent to be remov'd, till ſhe had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd whether <hi>Peregrine</hi> had any hurt? And what was become of the Count? He anſwer'd, He was perfectly well, except the grief that he conceiv'd at her diſaſter; ſhe ask'd him again earneſtly, What is become of the Count? You have not kill'd him, I hope? Added ſhe, I know not what he is, Madam, replied <hi>Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grine,</hi> I left him unable to perſue my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. If he's in danger, replied <hi>Clarinda,</hi> there's no ſtaying here; he has powerful Friends, that will revenge his Death: Flie <hi>Peregrine,</hi> added ſhe, and preſerve that Life, which twice has ſav'd mine: This is no place for us to ſtay in any longer; Let us, at leaſt, retire from the Road: And are you ſure, you are not hurt? Continued ſhe, looking on <hi>Peragrine</hi> with a paſſionate air. With that, not ſtaying for his Anſwer, ſhe made offer to riſe, which with the aid of <hi>Peregrine,</hi> and <hi>Mariana,</hi> ſhe perform'd: They led her into a thick Wood, which was cloſe by, where they ſet her down; and ſhe having once more inquired whether <hi>Peregrine</hi> was not hurt, and he aſſured her no; ſhe related, how galloping down a Hill, her Horſe had ſtumbl'd, flung her over his
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58987:23"/>
Head, and dragg'd her all along, and had undoubtedly kill'd her, had not the Heavens ſent him to her Relief. <hi>Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grine</hi> knew well in what danger he ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, but could not leave his dear <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda,</hi> all wounded as ſhe was, which made him very Reſtleſs; ſhe ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd it, and dreading the worſt; I fear, ſaid ſhe, you have more cauſe to flie, than to ſtay here; 'twas my Misfortune, and your too great Raſhneſs, has brought you into danger: Flie, Sir, to ſave that Life, which I muſt prize above my own Content. Where e'er you go, think of <hi>Clarinda,</hi> Sir; She's yours by Acquiſition, The Heavens will have it ſo; but when you're ſafe, fail not to let me know where e'er you are; my Prayers to Heaven ſhall be to keep you ſafe, as ſafe as I ſhall keep you in my Thoughts. <hi>Peregrine</hi> was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reply, but hearing a great noiſe of Horſe paſſing by; and <hi>Mariana</hi> having perceiv'd ſome of the Count's Liveries, they gueſt it was in purſuit of <hi>Peregrine;</hi> he therefore had no longer time, then to kneel, take her Hand, and kiſs it; Adieu ſweet Angel, ſaid he to <hi>Clarinda,</hi> Death only ſhall drive thee out of my Thoughts; I am, forever thine: Adieu, kind <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:58987:24"/>
added he, ſupply my place in the Preſervation of this fair one, I may live to return to ſee you both. This Farewel drew Tears from all their Eyes; he got on Horſe-back, and with his Man, went to ſeek after the reſt of his Equipage, ſtill looking behind him, going with a ſlow pace, and heavy Heart, till he had loſt the ſight of them. He met with his other Servants, with whom he got into a croſs Road, with all the ſpeed he could.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who had paſs'd by in ſuch haſte, were purſuers of <hi>Peregrine,</hi> who having found the Count, as they thought, expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, followed him, while the reſt were conveying the poor Count home, in whom, they had found ſome ſigns of Life. They were running with all ſpeed towards the Caſtle, where not being contented to inquire after the Stranger (whom they believ'd had done the Deed, by what they had gather'd from the Chirurgeon, who had began to ſuſpect the Contents of thoſe Letters he had carried,) they alſo ſearch all over the Caſtle, but finding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, were returning home; (not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which way to go,) when they were met by <hi>Clarinda,</hi> on her Horſe, ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Mariana,</hi> on one ſide, and by the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58987:24"/>
Groom, on the other, who had follow'd as faſt as he could get a Horſe, and make him go; they knew her, though muffl'd up, and all in Blood; but the Buſineſs they had been about, and their rude Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour in the Caſtle, made them unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take notice of her, ſo they poſted by, without any further notice.</p>
            <p>Poor <hi>Clarinda</hi> was thus brought home, laid in her Bed, her Heart more full of Grief for <hi>Peregrine's</hi> Abſence, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the ſafety of his Life, than her Body was of pain, by the Wounds ſhe had receiv'd; they were ſoon made whole again, by the Care and Diligence of her Phyſicians, and Chirurgeons; but it was not ſo with that of her Heart, no Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician was capable of curing thoſe Wounds which <hi>Peregrine's</hi> Dangers and Abſence had made there; nothing but time, and his dear Preſence, could be a fit Salve for thoſe great Evils. As ſhe lay penſive in her Bed, after ſhe had been dreſs'd, a Servant brought in the Letter which ſhe had found upon <hi>Peregrine's</hi> Pillow; ſhe bid <hi>Mariana</hi> open it, and read it to her, which drew Tears from her Eyes; and this having put <hi>Mariana</hi> in mind of the Papers ſhe had found in the morning,

            <p>Theſe things did but add fuel to that amorous Fire, which flam'd in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted <hi>Clarinda</hi>'s Breſt. Why were the Heavens ſo kind, ſaid ſhe, to provide ſo worthy a Preſerver of my Life, and ſo cruel again, as to ſnatch him from me, before I could let him know the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of my Heart! His firſt brave action had ſufficiently engag'd me to him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being twice made beholden for my Life; but, as if that was not yet enough, to make me his Debtor beyond hopes of redemption, he alſo cruel proves in his paſſionate Expreſſions, and brave Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances. <hi>Mariana,</hi> who did all ſhe could to divert her from thoſe Reflections, told her, that ſhe had a great fancy to give the Verſes to ſet, to her Maſter of the Lute, the next time he ſhould come, that ſhe might ſing and play them both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Clarinda</hi> ſaid, that would but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe her ſorrow for the abſence of the Compoſer; yet do, continued ſhe, ſince I cannot have his ſweet preſence, let me
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58987:27"/>
injoy what I can, of the Fruits of his Love; my greateſt comfort, in all my afflictions is, to find he loves me. No, ſaid ſhe again, that is rather grief upon affliction; as circumſtances are, it had been better had he prove unkind. Thus was poor <hi>Clarinda</hi> afflicting her ſelf, and her dear <hi>Mariana</hi> comforting of her, when news were brought, her Muſick-Maſter waited in the Parlor. <hi>Clarinda</hi> would have him ſent back, ſaying, ſhe was not in condition to hear Muſick; but <hi>Mariana</hi> did ſo ſtrongly plead, in hopes it would aid to compoſe her Spirits, that he was ſent for up, and part of the accident that had befallen her, related to him, as it had been to the reſt of the Houſhold, to put a ſtop to their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curious Inquiſitions. He took up her Lute, which having tun'd, he plaid on it ſuch Leſſons as vs'd to delight her moſt; but ſhe ſeem'd not to hearken to them. Ask of <hi>Mariana</hi> the Verſes which ſhe began to read; then returning them to her again, there, ſaid ſhe, do what you will with them. <hi>Mariana</hi> taking this as a <hi>tacit</hi> conſent, to what ſhe had propos'd, ſhew'd them to the Muſick-Maſter, and deſir'd him to ſet them to a Tune, ſo as that they
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58987:28"/>
might be ſung, and play'd upon the Lute; he promiſed ſo to do, and to bring them with him the next day; and having play'd two or three Tunes more, he took his leave, and retired.</p>
            <p>Then had <hi>Mariana</hi> leaſure, and not before, to unfold the other Paper which ſhe had taken up; but ſhe found it writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a Language ſhe did not underſtand. Here is, I know not what, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Clarinda,</hi> giving her the Paper; (which was that Letter which <hi>Peregrine</hi> received from that Lady I mentioned before, the day before he left <hi>England:) Clarinda</hi> was as far to ſeek, as <hi>Mariana;</hi> ſhe fancied it to be a Woman's hand, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in that Opinion, ſo ſoon as ſhe had read at the bottom of it, the word <hi>Iſabella;</hi> her Heart ſtarted at it, as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the ſorrows which it would cauſe her; ſhe dreaded the contents, yet was impatient to know them; ſhe doubted not but this was a Letter to him from ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman, writ in that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and therefore was the leſs in hopes of having it decyphered: they both beat their Heads very much about it, but to no purpoſe; 'till at laſt it came into <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi>'s mind, that ſhe had heard her old
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58987:28"/>
Aunt ſay, That preſently upon the death of her Husband, who had died at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> ſhe had been forc'd to go thither, to recover ſome conſiderable Sums of Mony, that were due to her Husband, which ſhe could not recover but by long and coſtly Suits at Law, which had caus'd her to remain in that Kingdom, near two years, in which time, ſhe had got ſome imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge of that Language. <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi> ſent <hi>Mariana</hi> immediately with the Letter to her Aunt, to deſire her that ſhe would Tranſlate it for her, as well as ſhe could poſſible.

He was impatient of the Groom's return, that he might further examine him, and find whither he might intruſt him with his Deſigns; in the mean time,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58987:34"/>
he buſied himſelf in reading all <hi>Peregrine</hi>'s Writings; after which, he took his Lute, Play'd and Song to it thoſe Verſes, which his Muſick-Maſter had given him, that ſame day he had ſet forth for <hi>Mentz,</hi> which he had got very perfect, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating them continually, as he daily did, but not with that pleaſure he had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done. Of Truth, this had been the greateſt of his Diverſion ever ſince his coming to that place, where he had liv'd retire, without any Communication even at his Meals, ſo that he paſſed under the Notion of the Woman hater, becauſe there were divers Gentlewomen in the ſame Houſe, Boarders, whoſe Company <hi>Frederick</hi> did avoid, as if they had had the Plague; and when any one came to make his Bed, or clean his Chamber, he would all that time retire into a Cloſet, at the further end of his Chamber, which contained all his Trunks, Boxes and Cheſts, and where he would frequently retire to play on the Lute, or to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on thoſe Writings once ſo precious to him, that he might ſtill be the leſs heard, and thought on. There he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think in what perplexities <hi>Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grine</hi> would have been in, had he been

true, at his not hearing any News from him, which made him think the time very long before the Groom's return, who at laſt came. <hi>Frederick</hi> brought him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Cloſet; after he had ſhut the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Door, where he examin'd ſo cloſly the Groom, that he confeſt to him, he had pretended to be a Deſerter, when he had been taken by the Enemy, only that he might have the better opportunity to get to that Caſtle, where they had been made ſo much on by the good Lady of that place, on his Maſters Account, he was ſure; for he had heard his Fellow-Servants, who were oftner within Door, than he, whoſe whole Buſineſs was in the Stable, talk ſtrange things of them: And do they believe, ſaid <hi>Frederick,</hi> that your Maſter does really Love that Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? Love her, anſwered the Groom, doats upon her, ay, and will e'en run ſtatk-ſtaring Mad for her, to, it's believ'd; for a does neither eat, drink, nor ſleep; but all Night he's a ſighing and ſobbing, as if his own Hearts Blood and Guts, would burſt aſunder: By'r Lady, I could not live ſo, for my part, continued he. Well, honeſt Friend, replied <hi>Frederick,</hi> ſince thou haſt been ſo faithful to thy Maſter,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58987:35"/>
and doſt deſign to continue ſo, here is to encourage thee to go on, in ſerving him truly; and now I will tell thee that I am nearly related to that Lady, to whom thou were going with the Letter, and that if thou wilt venture to carry back a Letter to thy Maſter, I ſhall reward thee well for thy pains: Odds-buds, Maſter, anſwered the honeſt blunt Groom, I did fancy ſo much ſo ſoon as I ſaw you, though I never ſaw her, and might my Girdle never hold, if I do not venture my Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle, at any time for any of you Three; trie me elſe, continued he, do ye but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive, and drive me forwards, and trie if I don't go.

Said poor <hi>Peregrine;</hi> my Maſter, Sir, I think, anſwered the Fellow, but I think ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chang'd. I'll go ask what is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, added he, with that he ſlipt out of the Chamber, and left <hi>Peregrine</hi> alone, to deſcant upon that ſevere Letter, where we will leave him for ſome ſmall ſpace, to inform you of what was become of the Count, and of <hi>Mariana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Count he had been ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully look'd after, that he was perfectly recovered of his Wound, but not of that extream Weakneſs, which that vaſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Blood he had loſt, had brought upon him; he, and his Friends, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to give over that Buſineſs ſo, but to have a full revenge, ſo ſoon as they could but hear where <hi>Peregrine</hi> was retired; to that purpoſe, they had made all the inquiries they could poſſible, from the Servants at the Caſtle; as alſo, of the Chirurgeon. They had learnt, that he was an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, <hi>Peregrine</hi> by Name, that he deſign'd to paſs the Campaign, in the Confederates Army, and they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58987:38"/>
that without doubt, he was retired there; but they would not attempt any thing againſt him, to the prejudice of the Count's Honour; wherefore, they but ſtaid till the Count was in Condition to call <hi>Peregrine</hi> to an Account himſelf.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Mariana,</hi> ſhe had been ſo afrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the old Lady alſo, by a Party from the Confederates, who had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a world of Rudeneſs, that they were retired, Servants and all, to a place Twenty Miles off of the Caſtle; <hi>Mariana</hi> having concluded that it would be as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to ſend any News to <hi>Clarinda,</hi> as ſhe fear'd <hi>Peregrine</hi> had found it difficult to ſend to her, at the Caſtle; ſhe ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in that Confidence, ſhe had of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrine</hi>'s Virtues; wherefore, was willing to attribute his ſilence, to any other Cauſe than his Inconſtancy.</p>
            <p>Things were at that paſs, amongſt the Lovers Conſerns, when that the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate's Army had made their Approaches, very near to the Town, at 450 Paces from the Counterſcarp, where the Saxons, (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which, <hi>Peregrine</hi> was a Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiere) had taken their Poſt, on which the Enemy did Fire continually all that day; and one of their Shot, out of a Falcon,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58987:38"/>
unfortunately killed, the Prince Palatine, <hi>Frederick William,</hi> who was come, as a Voluntiere, in the Camp; and was, that day, with <hi>Peregrine,</hi> at the head of the <hi>French;</hi> where, alſo, were the Prince Elector, his Brother, and the Grand Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Tutonick Order. The Body of that unfortunate Prince was carried to <hi>Francfort,</hi> there to be embalmed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peregrine,</hi> who notwithſtanding all his Afflictions and Grief, would not let paſs any opportunity of ſhewing that he was not come ſo far only to ſee, and to be ſeen, did not omit this occaſion of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Prince, at the head of the <hi>French,</hi> but did wiſh, a thouſand times, that the Bullet had met with his Head, in liew of the Princes; ſince he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that fatal Letter, there had not been any dangerous Enterpriſe, but he had been in it, with a purpoſe Deſign of not out-living his dear <hi>Clarinda,</hi> whom he concluded Dead, of which, he counted himſelf the Cauſe; but ſtill he did come off with Honour, his better Fortune reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him to injoy his Hearts Deſires: How often did he call himſelf negligent Fool, for not having burnt that fatal <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Letter, to which he attributed all
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58987:39"/>
his Misfortunes, as was intimated, in that which he had received, from an unknown Hand? He was reſolved, with the firſt opportunity, to get into the Town, to inform himſelf, more at large, and to find out that unknown Perſon, who had been ſo ſevere in his Cenſure of him. That, of Truth, had been the Occaſion of his going on all Parties; but, as yet, he had not met with any opportunity, of accompliſhing his Deſign, which ſtill did diſtract him more, and more, in ſo much, that his Friends, and eſpecially, the Count <hi>Zinzendorf,</hi> had divers times inquired what was the matter with him? What Cauſe of Diſcontent he had had, which appeared ſo viſibly in his Countenance? And that made him ſo deſperately throw himſelf into all kind of Dangers? Deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to manage himſelf a little better? But to all theſe Interrogatories, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, he would make no Anſwer, nor give his Friends (who were really high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned for him) any Satisfaction, ſo that they were forced to let him take his own Courſe, giving him over for a loſt Man. He ſtill continued deaf, to all their Advices; and he, moſt impatiently, watch'd for an opportunity of deſerting,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58987:39"/>
with a Reſolution, in caſe he found <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi> gone, to throw himſelf head long, amongſt the Enemies, and there be ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed, a Victim to her Memory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarinda,</hi> or <hi>Frederick,</hi> rather, on the other hand, had a thouſand times wiſh'd he had not ſent ſo ſevere a Letter, which he feared would produce <hi>Peregrine</hi>'s death, his Innocence daily getting ground over <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Indignation; at laſt, not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him, it brought <hi>Frederick</hi> into ſuch an impatiency, that he could no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reſt, without learning ſomething of his once ſo dearly beloved Preſerver; he had been brought into that violent deſire by the frequent Reflections he had made, on <hi>Peregrine</hi>'s Bravery; concluding with himſelf, that it was impoſſible ſo gallant a Perſon, who had done ſo much for him, could be guilty of ſo horrid a Crime, as he had taxed him with, in his Paſſion: He had tried all means imaginable to ſend ſome body to him, but had found it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, which had made him take up the brave Reſolution to join in the next Party that ſhould go out, and to get over to the Army, or periſh in the attempt. To accompliſh this, he went a Voluntiere, and joined himſelf to the Horſe-Guard,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58987:40"/>
that the Town had ſent forth to front that of the Confederates; and there being no other Action, on that time, on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates ſide; <hi>Peregrine,</hi> rather then do nothing at all, was got amongſt their Horſe Guard. Towards Night, there were ſome Pickeerings, in which divers were killed, on both ſide, amongſt which was one <hi>D' Andlau,</hi> Captain in <hi>Palfe</hi>'s Regiment, and divers made Priſoners, on both ſides, amongſt which, <hi>Frederick</hi> was the beſt pleaſed.</p>
            <p>It proved luckily for <hi>Frederick,</hi> that he was the Priſoner of one of <hi>Peregrine</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Friends. For this Gentleman, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not heard what was become of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrine,</hi> had ſent to inquire after him; News was brought that he was ſuppoſed to be killed, for his Horſe was found dead, which was known again by his own Groom, but his Body was not yet to be found; ſo it was concluded, that he had quitted his Horſe, and having fought on Foot, and that he might be dropt amongſt the Enemies. This hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been told in the preſence of <hi>Frederick,</hi> it cauſed ſuch a ſuddain change in him, that notice was taken of it; and preſently after, he retired into that Room which
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58987:40"/>
had been allotted for him (for his Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom had already been ſet to an hundred Piſtols, to which he had readily agreed,) where having flung himſelf upon a Couch, he gave way to all that paſſion could move in a ſenſible Breaſt. He called himſelf, a thouſand times, a Murtherer, in having writ that cruel Letter, which doubtleſs, was the cauſe of his becoming ſo Careleſs of his Life, as he was reported to be; ſome Servants having taken notice of this great paſſion, in the young Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they went and acquainted the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer with it, who, coming near to the Tent Door, heard <hi>Frederick</hi> ſay, unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Woman. The Officer entered haſtily, and going to the Bed, What Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man do you mean? Said he, And what is the cauſe of that great Paſſion you have fallen into, ſince the News of my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Friend's Death?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frederick</hi> thought himſelf now abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ruin'd, and remained ſilent for a conſiderable time, not knowing what to ſay. This made the Officer to add, were you acquainted with him? If ſo, let me know it? If he was a Friend of yours, I aſſure you, you ſhall fare the better for it? <hi>Frederick,</hi> that deſired no
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58987:41"/>
longer to live, now he thought <hi>Peregrine</hi> was dead; with a deſign to urge the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer to do him ſome Miſchief, thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, If you was <hi>Peregrine</hi>'s Friend, you can not do his Memory a greater piece of Service, than to Sacrifice me to it? For, I declare, I was his mortal Enemy, that I writ to him a Letter, which put him into that Diſpair, which made him ſo little to manage his Life, to which I add, that I let my ſelf be taken Priſoner, (as the poſture I was found in, might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſhew), being alighted, and amongſt your own Party, that I might have his Blood, for having been the Death of a Gentlewoman to whom I am related. Now, Sir, continued he, If you have any reſpect for your Friend's memory, do what he himſelf would have done to me, or I had been his Executioner? And ſeeing the Officer ſtand as amazed, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, If it is the loſs of my Ranſome, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains you from doing that piece of Juſtice, to your Friend, here is that which will be worth better than an 100 Piſtols to you? And with that drew a Jewel out of his Boſome, which he preſented to the Officer, but he refuſed it; and being ſtill more and more ſurpriſed, at theſe ſtrange
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58987:41"/>
things, knew not what to think, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had remained a little ſilent, he thus ſaid, I know not, Young Man, what to think of you; I find you are in a kind of Deſpair, which makes you ſeek for relief, in Death, but I am not a Perſon to take Advantage of any-one's Misfortunes. I do not know but that my Friend may have been taken Priſoner, ſeeing, that though his Horſe has been found ſlain, his body has not been yet diſcovered; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I would have you manage your ſelf, till we have a certainty of the matter; not doubting, but that if my Friend lives, he will give you all the Satisfaction that you can receive from a gallant Perſon: forbear but ſpeaking ill of my worthy Friend, and injoy here all the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies that my Quarters will afford; I will leave you to your ſelf, a dieu, with that the Officer went out of the Tent.</p>
            <p>Thus was the poor afflicted <hi>Frederick</hi> left, a Prev to all his Sorrows, with the only ſmall glimpſe, which <hi>Peregrine</hi>'s Friend had left him, by ſaying, he might be made a Priſoner; <hi>Frederick,</hi> reſolv'd to know the truth of it, out of hand, by eſcaping into the City, though with the hazard of his Life; with a firm Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58987:42"/>
to die, if he found not <hi>Peregrine</hi> there a live; he began to be extraordinary ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the evil Effects of his Raſhneſs, in ſending that fatal Letter, which had been the certain cauſe of all the Evils that followed upon it, ſo accounted himſelf the Murtherer of him, who had twice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his Life, and whom he now veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed to be true, and conſtant, by the ſtrange effects which thoſe curſed Lines had wrought in him, which made him ſo careleſsly to proſtitute his Life, in the greateſt dangers, as believing it not worth preſerving, after the loſs of his <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda;</hi> thus did <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Boſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in favour of the unfortunate <hi>Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grine,</hi> which made him to conclude to kill himſelf, if he found him not in <hi>Mentz,</hi> deſigning to get thither the next Night, or to die in the attempt; but the Heavens had ordained otherwiſe of him, as I am going to relate.</p>
            <p>The Confederates did throw abundance of Bombs, every Night, into the City, which fired many Houſes; that in which poor wounded Priſoners lay, having been ſet on Fire, they were forced to be removed, as faſt as they could, and they put a wounded Gentleman into a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,

they might paſs him unregarded; but, as the company<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was got cloſe to him, he thought he knew one of their Voices, he looked ſuddainly up, and perceiving that it was Count <hi>Mansfeilt,</hi> he preſently tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his Head another way, and obſerved which way they were marching, and ſaw them go into that Tent which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Officer that had taken him. The Count being now perfectly recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his Wounds, and Weakneſs, and having learnt where <hi>Peregrine</hi> was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, had been with his Kinſman, Count <hi>Zinzendorf,</hi> to demand Juſtice of him, againſt a Stranger, who had wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and taken ſomething from him, whom he protected. The Count, who was related to <hi>Mansfeilt,</hi> received him very Courteouſly, and aſſured him of all the Services that lay in his power; but told him, withal, that he had had ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Proofs of that Gentleman's bravery, and generous Temper, whom he accus'd, that none but his Kinſman could ſuſpect, without offending him; that he hoped he was miſtaken in the Perſon, and that to be ſatisfied in that, he himſelf would conduct his Kinſman, to his Friends Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, having not heard of him in two
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58987:43"/>
days: They were going to ſeek after <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrine,</hi> when <hi>Frederick</hi> did take notice of them. It enter'd into <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Head, that the Count came not there for any good to <hi>Peregrine,</hi> which made him (though <hi>Peregrine</hi> was far from thence, if he was at all) to have a Deſire of knowing the nature of the Count's Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He therefore walks back, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and getting in by the back way of the Tent, waited to hear what would be ſaid.</p>
            <p>He had looked on the young Count, as the firſt Cauſe of all his, and of <hi>Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grine</hi>'s Misfortunes, and even of his Death, if he was ſlain: This had bred ſuch an hatred in his Breaſt, rowards the Count, that he wiſhed he could be the Death of him; wherefore, very far from ever receiving him into Favour again. Being thus prepoſſeſt, he heard the Officer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late how <hi>Peregrine</hi> had been loſt, and that he had a young Priſoner, who he had taken that Night, that had declared he had permitted himſelf to be taken, but to be brought where <hi>Peregrine</hi> was, that he might kill him, for being the Death of a Kinſwoman of his. He is very deſperate, added the Officer, and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58987:44"/>
Careleſs of his Life, expreſſes much Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, though very young. Upon this, the Count ſaid, That it was not he alone who complained of <hi>Peregrine</hi>'s Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs; and that beſides that Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, for whoſe Death he was accuſed, he believed, that the Death of another Lady might be laid to his Charge alſo, of whom no News was to be had, and who doubtleſs he had made away, it may be, after he had had his Pleaſure of her. Here, <hi>Frederick</hi> could not any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er forbear, but ruſhing into the Tent, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed himſelf to the Count, with a ſtern Countenance, and his Hand upon his Sword. Thou lieſt Count, cried he, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, in the Relation thou giveſt of <hi>Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grine,</hi> and becauſe he is not here to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie himſelf of thoſe baſe and falſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations, I come to vindicate him in the preſence of all theſe; therefore draw, added he, and with that, drew his Sword, and run at the Count: The Count had but time to draw, and making a paſs, gave a ſlight Wound to <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Hand, and diſarmed him, before any could come into them. They were parted, and <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> put out of the Tent, and every Body remained in a maze, at the raſh,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58987:44"/>
and deſperate Actions, of ſo young a Youth; but, above all, the Officer was ſtrangely ſurpriſed to ſee one who had declar'd was come to kill <hi>Peregrine,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſe, with ſo much fierceneſs, his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, in ſo raſhly expoſing his Life to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Peregrine</hi>'s Reputation.</p>
            <p>Mean time, <hi>Frederick</hi> was glad he had been put out, before he had been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by any there; and for fear of being called to an account, for this Action, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Count, who might, at laſt, know him, he went his way, telling ſome Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, he met, that he was going to ſeek ſome Chirurgeon to dreſs his Hand. Of Truth, the Count began to entertain ſome Ideas of that Face, which perſuaded him he had ſeen it ſomewhere before; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that he had deſired that Perſon ſhould be brought in again, that he might have a more full view of him; but he was gone, and was not found by any at that time. All this did ſtill breed more Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Count, and Wonders in the Beholders; he, at laſt, with pondring much upon the knowledge of that Face, did really conclude, that this was none but <hi>Clarinda,</hi> in a Diſguiſe; but, on what account, could not imagine; he had but
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58987:45"/>
too well found that <hi>Peregrine</hi> had render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf abſolute Maſter of <hi>Clarindas</hi> Heart, he fear'd, beyond all the Art he had to reclaim it again; yet, he was loth to abſolutely give over the purſute; he found he ſtill had the ſame Love and Affection for her, but had great reaſon to believe ſhe hated him, witneſs her late Action; in this Agitation of Spirit, he knew not what to reſolve, nor indeed, what to ſay to his Friends: He thought that if he could but once more ſet his Eye upon her, he would haunt her Day and Night, rather than not receive ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable anſwer from her: In this Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, he takes his leave of Count <hi>Zinzen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf,</hi> and of the other Officer, and with thoſe Friends that he had brought along with him, returns, with a deſign to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, and all go in ſearch after her, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways, and in caſe <hi>Peregrine</hi> was dead (as it was believed) never to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don her, till he had gained her good Will; but in caſe he ſhould ſtill be living, either to kill, or be killed, by him, finding it impoſſible for him to live, without the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Clarinda.</hi> He thus ſent his Friends ſeveral ways to ſeek her, amongſt her own Relations, and at the Caſtle, but
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58987:45"/>
reſerves to himſelf, to ſearch the whole Camp after her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frederick</hi> having got as far as the <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> Attack, he perceived a <hi>French</hi> Party, of about 400 Foot, that appeared within a mile of the Trenches, he deſigned, at firſt, to have run amongſt them, but they preſently diſappeared again, ſo remain'd fruſtrated of that deſign; ſome time after, it rained very hard, which made <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risk</hi> to ſeek for ſome ſhelter; as he was ſo doing, he perceived a Woman, at ſome diſtance, that crept on all four, whom he concluded to be ſome Spie, or ſome Carrier of Intelligence; he, after the ſame manner, got to her, before ſhe had eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; when, finding it was too late for her to endeavour her eſcape, ſhe tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned towards him, fell on her Knees, and beſought him to ſpare her Life, promiſing that ſhe would never more ſtir out of the Town; this ſhe did, believing verily that ſhe was diſcovered to be a Spie, and that <hi>Frederick</hi> had come that way, and had ventured ſo near the Shot of the Town, but to ſeize on her. Some few Shots, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, were made at them, while <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> bid her not to fear, that he would do her no hurt. So ſoon as ſhe had his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58987:46"/>
ſhe called to a black Dog of hers, that was not far from thence, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perceived by thoſe on the Ramparts, that had Shot at them before, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ceaſed firing. <hi>Frederick</hi> asked the Woman how he might get into the Town, ſhe judging, by that, that he was ſome Deſerter, plucked up a good Heart, and told him, that if he pleaſed to have patience a while, he ſhould ſee her get in, and-that he might after do the like, if he pleaſed; all this time they being got into a little hollow, that covered them from the Camp, though not from the Town; ſhe told him that ſhe had uſed this Trade daily, ever ſince the Town had been Beſieged, and that ſhe had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been ſurpriſed; that in caſe ſhe ſhould be at any time taken, that nothing might be found about her, that could prejudice her, ſhe roll'd up her Intelligence, in a piece of Parchment, and put that Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a piece of Gut, which ſhe gave to her Dog to carry, and that he had been uſed to follow her, at a great diſtance; that when ſhe came near the Gate, ſhe would ſlip her ſelf into her little H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, that was cloſe by the Centry, by the back Door, and open the fore Door, in which
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58987:46"/>
her Dog would come; that ſo ſoon as he was got in, ſhe would lock him up, feed him well, and then would go, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her Intelligence to the Governour; and that, by ſo doing, ſhe had got the Character of being a Witch, that uſed to go in, and out of the Town, in the ſhape of a black Dog; that ſhe had a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol every time, and that all that mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Guard, had Orders not to Shoot any Dog. Not long after this, at a ſign that was given, ſhe went ſidling towards the Town, her Dog ſtill remaining in the ſame place; ſhe bid <hi>Frederick</hi> to follow the Dog, who would not go faſt, ſo ſoon as he ſhould ſee him move. It proved as the Woman had ſaid, when ſhe was got about an hundred yards, from the Dog, the Dog took up the piece of Gut, which lay by him, and followed the Woman, ſtill keeping the ſame diſtance behind her. <hi>Frederick,</hi> perceiving this, began to follow the Dog, thereby, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf wholly to the Towns Shot, but there was not one made at him; thus little by little, taking a ſmall compaſs, ſtill tending towards the Gate <hi>Gaw;</hi> where, at laſt, being come, they were both let in; at the Foot of the Rampart, ſhe had
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58987:47"/>
made a halt, at which the Dog had done the like; but <hi>Frederick</hi> advanced, after ſhe had given him a ſign. Thus did <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> get into the Town again, without any great hazard; he gave the Woman a Piſtol, and then went towards his old Lodgings, which were almoſt at the other end of the Town: They had ſeen ſix or ſeven <hi>French</hi> Officers, well mounted, who had endeavoured to get into the Town, at a conſiderable diſtance from them; <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> at firſt, though on Foot, wiſh'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf amongſt them, but ſeeing two of them drop, he took the Woman's Advice, and did not follow the reſt, who got ſafe in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frederick,</hi> after his wonted Cuſtom, ſo ſoon as he got into that Houſe, where he lodged, was going into his Chamber, without ſpeaking to any body; but his Landlady called, and told him, that his Chamber was taken up, by ſuch an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, which ſhe related to him, but that the Party ſhould preſently be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; mean time, a Servant was gone to bid the wounded Gentleman prepare to be removed, which News he received with much diſguſt, fearing the prejudice which another diſturbance would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58987:47"/>
to his Wound; he deſired therefore, that he might firſt ſpeak with the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that owned the Chamber; <hi>Frederick,</hi> hearing that, went in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sir, ſaid the Sick Man, to him, You ſee, a poor wounded Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner; I am a Gentleman, continued he, and if, beſides the Ranſom I am to pay, I can purchaſe my ſtay here, till I am in a better Condition to remove, ſpake but your demands, and I will procure it you. <hi>Frederick,</hi> pittying the poor Gentleman's Condition, whom he gueſt to be very ill, by the faintneſs of his Voice, made anſwer, that he knew how to be civil even to his Enemies, that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main there ſo long as he pleaſed, and trouble himſelf no further; with that, <hi>Frederick,</hi> ſhutting the Bed-Curtains cloſe, bid him take his reſt, and went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately out of the Houſe again, in the deſign of employing ſome Perſons, to go in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of the Town, and inquire after a Gentleman Priſoner, taken ſuch a day, and ſuppoſed to be brought in wounded, his Horſe having been ſhot under him. <hi>Frederick</hi> having reſolved to remain in the Cloſet, all that day, and the next, where there was a little Couch; he got
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58987:48"/>
a Bottle of Wine, another of Water, and ſome Bisket, with which he retired into the Cloſet, without having been percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of any Body, no not ſo much as by the Sick Man, who knew of no Cloſet, and when he heard any noiſe, ſuppoſed it to be ſome Servant, who was going in and out; thus did <hi>Frederick</hi> lock himſelf into his Cloſet, for that time, having told the Perſons whom he had employed, on the ſearch after <hi>Peregrine,</hi> that he would meet them, at ſuch a certain place, two days after.</p>
            <p>In the Night time, as <hi>Frederick</hi> lay on his Couch, he heard great complaints, and having hearkened to them, he found it was the Sick Man, who was lamenting his hard Fate. What vaſt difference, ſaid he, do I find, betwixt the Wounds of the Body, and thoſe of the Mind! How inſenſible I am of the firſt, when, my Miſeries preſent themſelves to my thoughts! And, what Balm have I to allay the ſmart of the laſt, but this poor Relick of that fair Saint, which my Soul did Adore! How dare I look on it? What Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage can I expect from it? After what I have made the Original to ſuffer; Thou ſweet repreſenter of all my paſt Joys, I
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58987:48"/>
would not part with thee for leſs than the Original; the whole World is of leſs value to me, than this dead Idea of that which with me was all in all. Why do I live ſtill, ſo long as ſhe's no more? Well, a ſhort time ſhall put an end to all my Miſeries; I will follow in death, ſhe who I have ſent before, by my inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and ſeeing I am deprived of her dear Converſation in this Life, I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to injoy it in the next, ſo ſoon as my ſlight Wound will but permit me to ſacrifice my life to thoſe dear Aſhes; mean time I muſt continue miſerable. Oh Heavens! After this there was a great ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which continuing, <hi>Frederick</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd the Cloſet Door, without the leaſt noiſe, and approaching little by little, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Bed, and finding that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was fallen faſt aſleep, he ventur'd to ſearch upon it for the Picture that had lately been mention'd; but hearing ſome noiſe at the Chamber-Door, that made him to retire again, to lock himſelf up, and to defer his curioſity, till ſome other convenient time.</p>
            <p>It was that Officer who had taken <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrine</hi> Priſoner, who having learnt that day, by a Deſerter, that the Beſiegers
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58987:49"/>
deſigned very ſuddainly to give a general Aſſault, was come to bid his Priſoner provide the 100 Piſtoles for his Ranſome: To which the Chyrurgeon that was with him, added, That now he was almoſt well, he deſired he ſhould alſo ſend for Money to pay his Charges. This was ſomething ſurpriſing to <hi>Peregrine,</hi> who made no anſwer; which made the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Maſter ſay, That he did not know how Fortune might order the day; and that he was loath to loſe ſo much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which might ſerve for a Ranſome for himſelf, ſhould he have the Fortune to be made a Priſoner; and bidding <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrine</hi> imploy ſome body about it, the next day at the fartheſt, he went huffing out of the Chamber. <hi>Peregrine,</hi> who had not ſpoke one Word all the while, but anſwered with Sighs, then ſaid, Here is ſome comfort yet, this want of a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome may invite this greedy man to ſend me to my dear <hi>Clarinda.</hi> Oh! that Name has ſtill ſuch Charms in it, that it puts life in me when I hear it ſound: She was too forward, too credulous, too—Ah! Fatal <hi>Iſabella;</hi> Thou haſt carried home thy Revenge againſt me, for ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thy Love; my time to Love

               </gap> to gather the firſt Fruits of my Affections; but how dear ſhe has paid for it, is the ſubject of my eternal Grief. After theſe, and divers others regrets, he remained ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frederick,</hi> who had heard all, being now intirely convinced, that this Perſon was her dear <hi>Peregrine,</hi> and that he was blameleſs, and never lov'd any other but him, he reſolved to put an end to both their Afflictions in a ſhort time, but would do it with the greateſt ſurprize that could be imagined, having ſo fair an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to do it; and to begin, he roll'd up two ſeveral Papers, containing each an hundred Piſtoles, then writ what follows.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

                  <p>Your good Angel, to preſerve your Life, and compoſe your Spirits, has provided what Gold you have occaſion for; and in requital of it, has deprived you of the renewer of your grief. Still live in hope it is <hi>Clarin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da's</hi> Ghoſt will have it ſo.</p>

            <p>After this, having watched till he was aſleep, he came ſoftly to the Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and having laid the two Papers of Gold cloſe to his Pillow, was groping for

What's that I hear? cry'd out <hi>Peregrine,</hi> in a ſtrange ſurpriſe, having he knew not how got ſitting in the Bed, which he had not done e'er ſince his Wound before; the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> he hearkned very attentively for a time; after which he laid himſelf down again, ſaying, with a great ſigh, 'twas but a Dream, but very pleaſing to me; after which, he again remain'd ſilent. So ſoon as Day began to permit him to ſee, he was again at his exerciſe of ſighing, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to order his Pillow, he felt ſomething heavy, lye cloſe to his Head; he laid his hand upon it, took it up, and found it to be the rolls of Gold, lapt up in a ſheet of Paper, in which <hi>Frederick</hi> had writ thoſe few Lines. <hi>Peregrine,</hi> in great ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58987:50"/>
open'd the ſheet of Paper, and there read what had been writ: This did won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully amaze him; he could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how this relief ſhould come ſo unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to him; he buſied his Thoughts a thouſand ways to find out the right cauſe; and all he could imagine that came nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to it was, that Count <hi>Zinzendorf,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſound out that he was a Priſoner in <hi>Mentz,</hi> had (he knew not how) convey'd that Relief to him: But then, how ſhould he come to the knowledge of his concerns with <hi>Clarinda,</hi> and that he had her Picture, he having never diſcovered to any Perſon one title of the whole Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaction, that he could not dive into; he only conjectur'd that <hi>Mariana</hi> might have ſent a Letter to him, which men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd all thoſe particulars; and that in his abſence his Friends might have open'd it, to learn how far it concern'd him: then feeling for the Picture, and finding it gone, he was in as great a concerne at all theſe ſurpriſing things unknown to him, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring how it was poſſible he ſhould be ſeiz'd with ſo profound a Sleep, as not to be awaken'd; then ſure, ſaid he, theſe People will come again when I am not aſleep, and give me ſome Information of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58987:51"/>
the whole Event: He was thus canvaſſing the buſineſs in his Mind, when he heard the tuning of an Inſtrument, as it were in ſome other Room of the Houſe; he liſtened, and was ſurpriſed more than ever, to hear thoſe Verſes he had made on his accidental ſaving of <hi>Clarinda,</hi> ſung to a Theorbo-Lute. Theſe were all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments to him; and the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable conjecture he could make of it, was that certainly it was <hi>Mariana</hi> who had done all this; but how ſhe ſhould come there, find him out, learn his particular wants, and all the reſt, was a Miracle to him. So ſoon as the Song was ended, he ſtrove ſo much that he reach'd a Shooe, with which he made a ſhift to knock ſo loud, that ſome of the Servants came to him. He ask'd them who had been there? They anſwered him, they were certain no body had been in the Chamber ſince the Quarter-Maſter and the Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon had been there; becauſe the laſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out had double-lock'd the Door, and given the Key to his Miſtreſs, from whom he had juſt now received it, to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:58987:51"/>This could not but ſtrangely diſorder <hi>Peregrine,</hi> who ask'd the Fellow whether there was not ſome other way into his Chamber. The Fellow, who was but newly in that ſervice, anſwered, he knew not, that he did not believe there was, and that he would ſee: with that he walk'd round the Chamber, then told him he could ſee no other Door: with which anſwer poor <hi>Peregrine</hi> was forc'd to reſt ſatisfied; and the Servant having ask'd him what he wanted; <hi>Peregrine</hi> told him, He wanted now the Quarter-Maſter to pay him his Ranſome, and the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon alſo, to diſcharge him, and all the reſt of his Ingagements; for I have been ſufficiently ſupply'd this Night, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, but by what means. Then he purſued, Has no Gentleman been lately entertained in this Houſe? No, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Servant; but there were two went yeſterday away. So <hi>Peregrine</hi> finding himſelf, after all theſe Interrogations, as much in the dark as ever, he ſent the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frederick</hi> was once giving himſelf to be plainly diſcovered, and was in great fears when the Fellow walk'd about the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but when he found he was gone, he
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58987:52"/>
reſolved to purſue his deſign to the laſt: he, upon that, concluded to continue one Night longer in his concealment, though he began to be very weary of living on Bisket and Sweet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Meats, which was all the Food he had had ſince his retirement, with the addition of a Glaſs of Wine, with which he ſometimes refreſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>Some time after, the Quarter Maſter return'd with the Chyrurgeon, and were encountred by the Miſtreſs of the Houſe, who giving them the Key of <hi>Peregrine</hi>'s Chamber, told them, That now they needed not to fear the Priſoner, for he had Gold enough to ſatisfie all demands, as the Servant had informed her, but that no body knew how it came to him, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had been lock'd up ever ſince they had laſt been there. The Quarter-Maſter began to prick up his Ears, and ſaid, all that is mine; for when I took him, all he had was mine, and he muſt needs have concealed all that Gold about him: He muſt provide for another Ranſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, continued he, for this I will ſeize on as my due. Hold there, reply'd the Chyrurgeon, I will not loſe my ſhare of it, be he ten times your Priſoner; while
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58987:52"/>
he has Money I will be ſatisfied for my Pains, Cares, and all the Charges I have been at. And why ſhould I loſe any thing, ſaid the Landlady, he has had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, and all the Houſe could afford, I am ſure, ever ſince he was removed here; and it is but reaſonable I ſhould be paid. The Quarter-Maſter, to avoid thoſe broils, being greedy of the Money, went into <hi>Peregrine</hi>'s Chamber, but was follow'd cloſe at the Heels by the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon, and the Land-lady. I am glad, cry'd <hi>Peregrine,</hi> (ſeeing them come in,) that you are here, for now I have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to ſatisfie you all. Hold a little, pray not ſo faſt, ſaid the Quarter-Maſter, all you have is mine, continued he, as being conceal'd about you, when I made you Priſoner. If you could prove that, ſaid <hi>Peregrine,</hi> it were ſomething, though not quite as you would have it neither; for there has an agreement paſt ſince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us, that I ſhould have my full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in paying you an hundred Piſtoles, which I am now ready to do; but beſide, I can aſſure you, that I have received it of late. You could not, ſince I was here, ſaid the Quarter-Maſter; you did not mention yeſterday that you had any ſuch
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58987:53"/>
thing in readineſs: How came you by this Money? To which <hi>Peregrine</hi> made Anſwer, that he had parted with a Rich Picture, for that Money, that he might be ſet at Liberty; which Picture, you have ſeveral times ſeen me ſigh over, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he, addreſſing to the Chyrurgeon, and which I priſed much more than all this Gold. I remember, ſaid the Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, that I have often chid you, for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your ſelf into paſſions, with gazing too much on it; and really, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſeeing it was left you ſo long after you had been here, I think you may in Juſtice make the beſt Advantage you can of it. The Quarter-Maſter, perceiving that they were all againſt him, yielded, for the preſent, and was contented to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the hundred Piſtols, but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving a Diſcharge to his Priſoner, which he did at laſt, with great difficulty; that being done, <hi>Peregrine</hi> paid off his Chyrurgeon, upon Condition, that he ſhould, from time to time, viſit him, and furniſh him with ſuch Plaiſters and Salves, as he ſhould want, till he was able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Camp; this was freely aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to: Next, the Landlady was ſattisfied, in all ſhe demanded, and <hi>Peregrine</hi> inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58987:53"/>
after the Gentleman, who had ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly quitted his Chamber to him. The Woman told him, ſhe had not heard from him ſince, but that ſhe knew he would return again, becauſe he had a great many Goods ſtill in the Houſe. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrine</hi> ſaid, he long'd to return him Thanks; and ask'd the Chyrurgeon how long it would be before he might riſe, and ſet His Foot to the Ground. I was going to tell you Sir, reply'd he, That if you find your ſelf without great pain when you move it in Bed, or when you feel it with your hand, you may venture to riſe, and for ſome time keep it upon a Stool, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reſting it on the Floor. Very well, reply'd <hi>Peregrine;</hi> upon which they all took leave of him, and left him to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>I told you how the young Count <hi>Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feilt</hi> had ſeparated himſelf from all the reſt of his Friends, in order to ſearch the whole Camp after <hi>Clarinda;</hi> for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that ſhe muſt needs be there; he thought ſhe could not be far neither, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had unfortunately wounded her. He therefore deſign'd to act as a Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, and to ingage in ſome warm Action. He was in ſome deſpair alſo, ſince he had
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58987:54"/>
ſeen with what fierceneſs <hi>Clarinda</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Peregrine</hi>'s Intereſt; he was vext for having ſpoken ill of him before her. The hurt he had given her was not much to his advantage neither; he had no other hopes therefore, but in what the Officer had related; That his young Priſoner confeſs'd he hated <hi>Peregrine,</hi> and was come into the Camp, on purpoſe to kill him: He built his hopes barely upon that weak bottom, which in time he hoped might again reclaim her.</p>
            <p>The whole Army was getting in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs for a general Aſſault, which they deſign'd to begin at the covered way; the ſignal being given by the diſcharge of three Canons, and one Bomb that broke in the Air. The young Count took this opportunity to do ſome Action worthy himſelf, and the fair <hi>Clarinda;</hi> ſo he put himſelf amongſt the Voluntiers: They all March to the Aſſault, with that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedneſs end courage, that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my not being able to endure the on-ſet, immediately gave way, at the Imperial, the Saxon, and the Bavarian Attacks. The Enemy, a while after, having ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied, and taken new Poſts on both ſides, as well as in Front, their Firing was ſo
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58987:54"/>
great and continual, during ſome Hours, that it is impoſſible to apprehend the leaſt Idea of it. The Confederate Army was near two Hours expoſed to all their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Shot, without any covering on the Glacis, joining to the Palliſadoes, not being able to ſhelter it ſelf, by reaſon of the Enemies continual Firing upon them, which they endured with a world of bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; till at laſt, the Beſieged being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and preſſed upon on all ſides, they were forced to give way, but not till they had ſprung a Mine, which involv'd a great number of Men, and four Colours in its Mines; whereupon the Beſiegers took their Poſt on the very brink of the Ditch.</p>
            <p>All the following Night was taken up in continual Skirmiſhes; the Count had behaved himſelf ſo bravely, that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular notice had been taken of him, but he was not to be found neither amongſt the living nor the dead: He was changing Ground to come where the warmeſt Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes was, he over-took two Horſe-men that were running from him towards the Gate <hi>Altmunſter;</hi> he diſmounted the one, and took the other Priſoner, who readily yielded upon Quarters for Life. The Count
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58987:55"/>
was going to deliver his Priſoner into Cuſtody, that he might have ſome more Skirmiſhes, when he was ſurrounded with a ſmall party of Horſe, that were getting into the Town, who took him along with them, and his Priſoner alſo, and beſtowed them both ſafe for the reſt of that Night.</p>
            <p>The Count had not been much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, had he had the charming <hi>Clarinda</hi> with him: But the other Priſoner ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very much concerned, and did all he could not to be ſeen; they had a Room alotted them, with a Bed in it, and a Centry ſat over them. The Count threw himſelf on the Bed, and asked his Fellow Priſoner, whither he would do the ſame, adding, that if he had not been retaken from him, he had found him a Generous Enemy; the other returned him thanks, ſaying, he had more a mind to ſit up, ſtill turning his Face, that the Count might not ſee it. The Count, a while after, cried out, ha! dear <hi>Clarinda,</hi> that you were but here ſafe and well. Thoſe Words confirmed the other Priſoner, in the opinion, that he knew the Count, ſo that afterwards he was more ſhie than ever of ſhewing his Face; there we will
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58987:55"/>
leave them for a ſhort time, to return to the amazed <hi>Peregrine,</hi> that could not yet reconcile himſelf to thoſe ſurpriſing Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, that ſo lately had happened to him; ſtill did his mind run on <hi>Marianas</hi> being there, concealed, unwilling he ſhould know of her, concluding, that none but ſhe, or his dear <hi>Clarinda,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the dead, could act as had been done. <hi>Clarinda,</hi> dear <hi>Clarinda</hi> 
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then cried he out, If it is thy Spirit that is ſtill ſo Officious to me after Death, bleſs me but with one ſhort ſight of thee, I am ſure thou canſt not aſſume any ſhape can affright thy diſtracted <hi>Peregrine;</hi> but if I could behold thee with all thoſe real Charms about thee, which thou once wore, though they were now but mere Deluſions, I ſhould die with Exceſs of Joy! Thus was he continuing in his Tranſports, when News was brought him that divers Priſoners had been taken in the laſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, but that the Enemy had poſted themſelves very Advantagious, and had repulſed the beſieged very far. <hi>Peregrine,</hi> who had given thoſe Orders, that when they heard of any Priſoners, they ſhould give him notice; ſent the Servant to make inquiry of their Names, as well as
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58987:56"/>
he could, and that to oblige them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their Names, they ſhould ſay it was one <hi>Peregrine</hi> deſired it.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the other places, that this Meſſenger was at, he came to that, where the Count was, with his Fellow Priſoner, where he found them both very unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to tell their Names, till after he had named <hi>Peregrine,</hi> he obſerved the Count to riſe off of the Bed, and ſay, how, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrine?</hi> Where is that Perſon? Who anſwered, not far in the Town, and then began to tell the Count all that he knew of him, adding, that certainly he was a Devil, or ſome Conjurer, for, ſaid he, when he was locked up in his Chamber, without one farthing towards his Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of an hundred Piſtols. The next Morning, when the Door was opened, he had two hundred Piſtols, with which he diſcharged all he owed, and now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains full of Gold, which it is thought the Devil brings to him, by the Window, or down the Chimney. This did not a little trouble the Count, but the other Priſoner, was not leſs concerned at this Narrative, yet would not diſcover his Surpriſal before the Count, but taking the opportunity, when the Meſſenger was
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58987:56"/>
going out, he deſired him to tell the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, that there was a Priſoner, who belonged to a Lady, named <hi>Clarinda,</hi> that would be glad to ſee him, if he could contrive it. The Meſſenger, well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with what he had done, returned home, and gave <hi>Peregrine</hi> an Account of his diſcovery: <hi>Peregrine,</hi> had no ſooner heard the charming word <hi>Clarinda,</hi> but he immediately ſent back the Meſſenger, rewarding him well, and charged him to know what Ranſome was ſet upon that Priſoner; he went, and returned not long after, to tell <hi>Peregrine,</hi> that fifty Piſtols, payed preſently, would ſet him free; they were immediately ſent, and the Priſoner ſet at Liberty, to go where he pleaſed, who went along with the Meſſenger, to <hi>Peregrine's</hi> Lodging; and the Count ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt his Companion, was left Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate, all alone. The fear of having the Town taken by Storm, was the Cauſe of this Priſoner's going off with ready Money; for it was verily believed that ſuch another Aſſault would certainly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it.</p>
            <p>The late Priſoner being brought into <hi>Peregrine's</hi> Chamber, he got to his Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and began to return him thanks,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58987:57"/>
for the Ranſome he had been ſo kind to pay for him; aſſuring him, that ſo ſoon as <hi>Clarinda</hi> ſhould come to the knowledg of it, ſhe would return it him with hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thanks, becauſe he was a Servant, for whom <hi>Clarinda</hi> had always a particular Kindneſs. At this, <hi>Peregrine,</hi> fetching a deep ſigh from the bottom of his Heart, anſwered, Then do your Office, repay me of your Ranſome, in ſending me im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to wait on that fair Saint, you juſt now named; and to invite you the more to do that piece of ſingular Service, to the Memory of your dear Miſtreſs, know, I have murthered her, at that the Perſon ſtarted, and cried, Heavens forbid! Yes, replied <hi>Peregrine,</hi> I am an expert Murtherer, I need no Weapons, nor Poiſons, to act with all, I can do it with a bare Letter, nay, even when I have no ſuch Thoughts, Miſchief is ſo natural to me. Pray recollect your ſelf, replied <hi>Clarindas</hi> Servant, you ſpeak as if you were not well, in your Mind; Whence do you derive that fancy of <hi>Clarindas</hi> Death? Is it becauſe you have not heard from her lately? Or, do you believe that you are dead in her Heart, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ſhe may be counted dead as to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58987:57"/>
you? If any ſuch thing were, I yet might live and hope; <hi>Peregrine</hi> anſwered, but ſhe is really: dead; Oh, unſpeakable Grief! I have it from good Hands, a Friend of the unfortunate Count; therefore, an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to me, has certified it to me; and, upon that, has vowed my Death, but is not ſo kind as to come and give it me; but now, you are here, do that which Juſtice, Revenge, and Duty, ought to prompt you to, Kill, kill, that miſerable Wretch, that has had the Confidence to ſurvive her ſo long. <hi>Clarindas</hi> Servant, at theſe Words, let himſelf fall upon the Bed, ſaying, in a low voice, unfortunate <hi>Clarinda,</hi> and miſerable <hi>Mariana;</hi> Die <hi>Mariana,</hi> why ſhouldſt thou live to hear ſuch doleful News, with that, he ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed quite away; at thoſe laſt Words, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrine,</hi> who was ſet up, in his Bed, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtedfaſt on the Perſon's Face, <hi>Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> ſaid he, take a little of this to ſtay thee, till thou takeſt me along with thee, giving her a little Cordial, out of a Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, which he had by him; after which, he did all he could beſides, to recover her, without the Aſſiſtance of any body elſe, becauſe of her Sex. <hi>Frederick</hi> had over-heard all, and was ſo moved at his
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58987:58"/>
dear <hi>Marianas</hi> Trouble, that he was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out to diſcover himſelf, when he heard her fetch a great ſigh; after which, ſhe came to her ſelf again, ſaying, Pray Heavens you may have been abuſed; that Happineſs cannot be hoped for, replied <hi>Peregrine,</hi> I ſhould certainly have heard of her, I that have ſought her in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. At this, <hi>Mariana</hi> did ſhed a flood of Tears, and <hi>Peregrine</hi> ſent forth whole gales of Sighs; after which, <hi>Peregrine</hi> gave <hi>Mariana</hi> an Account of all his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſince his Abſence; and how oft he had ſought Death, but was not ſo happy as to meet with it: Heavens forbid, ſaid <hi>Mariana,</hi> poor <hi>Clarindas</hi> Death, added ſhe, is more to be attributed to her Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and Raſhneſs, than to your Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and I muſt confeſs, that my Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, has been Inſtrumental alſo; with that, ſhe gave him an Account of all that had happened to <hi>Clarinda,</hi> and to her ſelf, ſince <hi>Clarindas</hi> departure. Thus, after a long Diſcourſe, what with Grief, and Wearineſs, poor <hi>Mariana,</hi> fell a ſleep, at <hi>Peregrine's</hi> Beds Feet, which obliged him to do the like, not long after.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:58987:58"/>This ſilence did ſomewhat appeaſe <hi>Frederick's</hi> diſturbed Mind, at both thoſe dear Friends Afflictions: He was very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to Accompliſh what he had begun, and did hope that they would continue their Sleep, till Night, at which time, he intended to perform the laſt act of his Tragicomedy; and from that time, he began to prepare himſelf for it, and it luc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kily happened that they both did ſleep, till there was Candles brought into the Chamber, that did awake <hi>Peregrine,</hi> who gave order that no noiſe ſhould be made, and that a Fowl ſhould be got ready for Supper; as for <hi>Mariana,</hi> ſhe ſlept on till Supper was brought up, ſhe having had no ſleep, in two Nights before; and <hi>Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grine</hi> would by no means diſturb her, but let her awake of her ſelf. He invited her to cat, but ſhe excuſed her ſelf, telling him, that ſhe never more ſhould enjoy her ſelf; he could not ſo much as make her drink a Glaſs of Wine; thus they both ſate, <hi>Peregrine,</hi> in the Bed, and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> on the ſide of it, looking doleful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, on each other, not knowing what to ſay; Ah! That my dear <hi>Clarinda</hi> was here at laſt, ſaid <hi>Mariana,</hi> then you would have no cauſe to invite me to eat,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58987:59"/>
or drink; that is a bit ſhe uſed to love, added ſhe, pointing at ſome part of the Fowl; her Ghoſt, would ſuffice me, ſaid <hi>Peregrine,</hi> or, at leaſt, that ſweet Picture, which is vaniſhed from me. <hi>Frederick,</hi> hearing this, came ſoftly, and laid the Picture upon the Bed; a little while after, <hi>Peregrine,</hi> having leaned towards <hi>Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> till his Arm ak'd, turn'd, to ſit up, and ſaw the Picture lie before him; he takes it up, kiſſes it, and cried, ſee <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> the Heavens grow kind, and have ſent me my Deſires: Heavens! How comes this to paſs? Replied, poor <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> as affrighted, ſure, you had not look'd for it well! 'Tis like, it has never been off of the Bed, but ingaged in ſome of the foldings of the Bed-Cloths; none of all that, dear <hi>Mariana,</hi> replied <hi>Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grine,</hi> this Paper left in the room of it, with the Gold, expreſſes otherwiſe, read it; he gave her the Paper, in which ſhe read, as he had done before; then, ſhe added, ſure, this is her own hand, or I am the moſt miſtaken in the World! Why may not her Hand be imitated, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Peregrine,</hi> as well as Bodies be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by kind obliging Spirits, and appear? The one is as feaſible, as the other; thoſe
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:58987:59"/>
are ſtrange things, <hi>Mariana,</hi> continued he: they much ſurpriſe me, ſaid <hi>Mariana,</hi> who ſtood in a kind of Amazement; How would you be then, ſaid <hi>Peregrine,</hi> if her ſweet Ghoſt, ſhould inſtantly appear? Ah! would it would; yet, no, added he, it would affright you too much: No, I believe not, anſwered <hi>Mariana,</hi> I know not what it might do, if I was alone, but you being here:—Drink to me, <hi>Mariana,</hi> drink her Health, I'll pledg it, though 'twas Poiſon, ſaid <hi>Peregrine,</hi>—He was going to proceed, when <hi>Clarinda,</hi> appeared, coming up cloſe to the little Table, by the Bed-ſide, on which the Supper was laid.</p>
            <p>She had put a Linnen Cloth, over her Head, which hung over her Face, down to her upper Lip; and ſhe had put over that, a large white Sheet, which ſhe had tied of a bunch, at the top of her Head, which covered her all over, but the Face; ſhe had, beſides, a Glaſs of Wine, in each Hand; ſhe ſtood a while, without moving, before them, at which, <hi>Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> wrapt her ſelf round, in the Curtain, making a great ſhriek; but <hi>Peregrine</hi> ſat gazing, with a Countenance that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a great diſorder; after that, <hi>Clarinda,</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:58987:60"/>
who had ſtood without motion, ſtooped towards <hi>Peregrine,</hi> offering one of the Glaſſes of Wine, which he refuſed to take, pulling himſelf back; with that, ſhe ſat one of the Glaſſes on the Table, then ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up ſtreight, Is this the Man, ſaid ſhe, would drink my Health, in Poiſon? Why have I diſturbed my ſweet reſt, in hopes to ſee ſuch conſtancy, after Death, in one I loved, and be thus diſappointed? I muſt return again, with this certain Truth, there is no Faith in Man; Adieu, fond Morrals, adieu, for ever more; at theſe laſt Words, as ſhe was turning, Hold, cried <hi>Peregrine,</hi> Though thou canſt not be <hi>Clarindas</hi> Ghoſt, for that would know me better, I will drink the Poiſon, give me the Glaſs; Ghoſt, ſtay, added he, and take me with you, or go tell Divine <hi>Clarinda,</hi> how thou ſeeſt me take that Paſs which is to convey me to her; with ſaying this, he took the Glaſs from <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda,</hi> and raiſing his voice, Here's to <hi>Clarinda,</hi> whom I ſtill Adore, ſaid he, and drank up the Wine. I ſhould not have pronounced that Name, continued he, after drinking, it may prove an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote, beyond the power of the moſt virulent Poiſon, and prevent my flight
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58987:60"/>
to her; it has, for certain, much better'd the Taſte. <hi>Clarinda,</hi>—added he, at which, ſhe lifting off the Sheet, and Cloth, which covered her Face, ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, in a Dreſs, which <hi>Peregrine</hi> had formerly ſeen. Conſtant, and Faithful, <hi>Peregrine,</hi> here is thy <hi>Clarinda,</hi> ſhe is wholly thine, ſaid <hi>Clarinda;</hi> with that, inclining on the Bed, ſhe took him by the Hand, preſſing it hard, and kiſſed his frighted Cheeks; feel, ſaid ſhe, I am thy warm <hi>Clarinda,</hi> living ſtill, to die in thy ſweet Boſome: But where's dear <hi>Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na?</hi> Alas, poor Soul, frighted, I fear, too much; Come, my dèar <hi>Mariana,</hi> and enjoy, once again, thy poor <hi>Clarinda.</hi> Fear not, I am really ſhe, with that, ſhe unfolded the Curtains, which <hi>Mariana,</hi> held no longer ſo hard: <hi>Mariana;</hi> it is ſhe, cried out <hi>Peregrine,</hi> the living <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda;</hi> What Wonders do I ſee! What Joys poſſeſs my Heart! They crowd in here too faſt, with that, he ſunk down in a ſwoon: <hi>Clarinda</hi> having embraced her dear <hi>Mariana,</hi> and aſſured her of her life, with a thouſand warm Kiſſes, which the ſtill diſcompoſed Girl, returned again, ſo well as her late fears would permit her: <hi>Clarinda,</hi> caſting an Eye, on <hi>Peregrine,</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:58987:61"/>
and perceiving him fallen backwards, with his Eyes cloſed, help, <hi>Mariana,</hi> cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe, aſſiſt me to preſerve my ſecond Life, <hi>Peregrine</hi> is not well; they both bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied themſelves, to raiſe him up again, at which, he came to himſelf: That Men ſhould die, with too much Joy, ſaid he.</p>
            <p>I beg your Pardon my dear <hi>Peregrine,</hi> ſaid <hi>Clarinda,</hi> for that great ſhare I have had in producing all your Sorrows and Griefs, when you'l pleaſe to conſider 'twas the effects of my Paſſions towards you, which plung'd me into a ſevere Jealouſie, and deep Deſpair, at the ſight of that fatal <hi>Engliſh</hi> Letter: You will, I know, be ſo good as to pardon the reſults of that Rage, which had ſo intirely poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt me. <hi>Peregrine</hi> made anſwer, That his imprudence in keeping that Letter, (which he ought to have burnt, ſince he valued it not,) being the firſt cauſe of all thoſe Miſeries he had ſuffered ſince, he ought to paſs by other leſſer Errors. But, added he, How came you to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of it? Who was your Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? I fear he did not do me Juſtice. <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi> anſwered, When I have eat and drank with you, to confirm you further
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58987:61"/>
I am no Ghoſt, (though I have almoſt liv'd like one theſe two Days,) then I ſhall give my <hi>Peregrine</hi> that ſatisfaction, with a full account of all has happened to me ſince you went from us: With that they ſate themſelves to eat, which <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi> did very heartily. They had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral little pickeerings of Wit with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, which diverted them during Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; after which, <hi>Peregrine,</hi> contriving within himſelf how <hi>Clarinda</hi> and <hi>Mariana</hi> ſhould be diſpoſed on that Night, <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi> took notice of his muſing; What poſſeſſes your Thoughts now? ſaid ſhe; To know where you and <hi>Mariana</hi> ſhall lye this Night; or rather where I ſhall retire, anſwered <hi>Peregrine,</hi> for i'll quit you my Bed, I find it now grows late. It does, ſaid <hi>Clarinda;</hi> wherefore I ſhall leave my Narrative till Morning. <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> and I, will leave you to your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which I hope will now be ſweet and long to you; and we will retire to that <hi>Elizium,</hi> where I kept, while thought dead; there is a little Couch will hold us both. Not ſo, reply'd <hi>Mariana;</hi> do you go into Bed, and i'll ſit up: But where is this Inchanted place, ſo near, yet ſo inviſible? Here, ſaid <hi>Clarinda,</hi>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:58987:62"/>
(ſtepping towards the Cloſet, and taking up the Hanging,) within the reach of all you ſaid: Come <hi>Mariana,</hi> added ſhe, and ſee the Grave in which I was buried alive: They both went into the Cloſet, where after they had remained a while, <hi>Peregrine</hi> having ſlipt on his Gown, and leaning on a Stick, came halting in, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, He was reſolved that Night to lye in <hi>Clarinda</hi>'s Grave: with that he laid himſelf down on the Couch, and by no intreats nor perſuaſions could be got off again; telling them, That he would paſs the reſt of that Night in that place. <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi> finding him obſtinate, took out of the Cloſet all that was convenient for her and <hi>Mariana,</hi> that Night, with a Night-Gown for <hi>Mariana,</hi> and one of her Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua's for her to put on the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>No Servants had come near them all that Evening and Night, becauſe <hi>Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grine</hi> had frequently given ſtrict Orders that no body ſhould come to him, except they heard him knock; ſo that they had no diſturbance on that ſide; and having took leave of one another, they all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed themſelves to ſleep.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:58987:62"/>The next Morning, <hi>Clarinda</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> being up, and in their Night-Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, went to ſee how <hi>Peregrine</hi> had paſt the Night; they found by his chearful looks, and hearty anſwer, that he was much improved as to his Health and Strength. How could I do amiſs, ſaid he, having my Titular Angel ſo near me; and lying in my <hi>Clarinda</hi>'s ſweet Monument? After a while, as they were returning into the Chamber, <hi>Mariana</hi> making a falſe ſtep, fell down, but did not hurt her ſelf; one of the Servants hearing the noiſe, and believing <hi>Peregrine</hi> knock'd, came into the Chamber, where eſpying no Man in Bed, and two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen dreſſing themſelves, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently run down again; telling the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, that certainly the Devil haunted that Chamber; for in lieu of finding a Lame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Man in Bed, there was two fine Gentlewomen dreſſing themſelves at their Glaſſes; let who will go there for me hereafter, added he, i'll not go to the Devil ſo often. A while after, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies wanting Water, knock in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, but no body came to them; they repeated the knocking, and finding it was to no purpoſe, <hi>Mariana</hi> ſtept to the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:58987:63"/>
Stair-head, and aloud ask'd, Whether there was no body in the Houſe? At which the People below Stairs were all mute, but one Maid bolder than the reſt, ſaid, ſhe would ſee theſe Hobgoblings, at what rate ſoever, ſo went up Stairs, and <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> returning into the Chamber, where the Maid following her, ſhe was told they wanted Water, and deſired they ſhould be a little better attended, aſſuring her, the Servants ſhould not loſe their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. The Maid made her excuſes, and laid the fault upon the impertinency of a ſilly Fellow in the Houſe, who ever ſince the Gentleman that lay there before, had the Gold brought to him ſo ſtrangely, did take all that was done in that Room for Inchantments; that he had run down Stayrs, ſo ſoon as he had peep'd into the Chamber, and ſaid, he had ſeen there, he knew not how many Devils in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's Apparel, dreſſing themſelves: which made <hi>Clarinda</hi> ſmile to her ſelf: Then did the Maid tell them, that at the leaſt Call ſhe would run up to wait on them, or the Gentleman either, if he was there ſtill, as ſhe ſuppoſed he was not, there being but one Bed. <hi>Clarinda,</hi> to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her, and to take away all ſuſpitions,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58987:63"/>
brought her to the Cloſet, where ſhe ſhewed her <hi>Peregrine</hi> in Bed: This is the place, ſaid ſhe, out of which came the Gold, and all the other Inchantments, I being in it all that while, who came here at firſt, in the habit of a Gentleman, to paſs with more ſafety through the Army, that then was gathering about this place: Pray ſatisfie your Miſtreſs, and all other Perſons of this Truth. The Maid, making a Courteſie, went away well ſatisfied, and did according as <hi>Clarinda</hi> had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her; ſo that the next time they knock'd for any thing, they were waited upon by the Miſtreſs of the Houſe, who made a great many Apologies, and gave great Aſſurances of her future attendance. <hi>Clarinda</hi> informed her of all ſhe thought fit ſhe ſhould know, and ſo diſmiſt her.</p>
            <p>The Confederates great advantage which they had got over the Beſieged, in the late Aſſault, caus'd the Governour, who was the Marqueſs of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xelles,</hi> to call a grand Council of War; in which it was concluded, That conſidering the great loſs which they had ſuſtained in this laſt Attack, the great Advantages with which the Enemies had poſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which was very difficult to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:58987:64"/>
and the great want of Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they were in, having not above 4 C<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> weight of Powder left, together with the great number of Sick and Wounded, and the ſmall hopes of Relief, that the white Flag ſhould be hung out, which was done that very Morning, about eight of the Clock, and a Parley was beaten, in order to Capitulate. Prince <hi>Albert</hi> of <hi>Saxe-Cornbourg,</hi> who Commanded that Day in the Trenches, on the ſide of the Imperial Attack, ſent a Trumpet to the Beſieged, to know their meaning. To which was anſwered, That the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was inclin'd to give up the Gariſon; that if the Duke of <hi>Loraine</hi> would be pleaſed to ſend the Governour a Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Collonel, with an other Officer; to diſcourſe with them about Conditions, he would ſend into their Camp Hoſtages of the ſame quality. Whereupon the Prince ſent his aid Major to conſult with the Duke of <hi>Loraine,</hi> and they agreed to the Governour's deſires, upon condition, that he ſhould firſt ſend his two Officers. Whereupon the Duke of <hi>Loraine</hi> ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City the Prince <hi>de Commercy,</hi> and Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Princj;</hi> after which there was a Ceſſation of Arms betwixt
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58987:64"/>
both-Parties, and the Treaty fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded before Night.</p>
            <p>Count <hi>Mansfeilt</hi> all this while had not remained Idle, by the aid of divers Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers he had found out <hi>Peregrine</hi>'s Lodgings, and had got the Servant, who was with him before, to come to him again: He inquired of him how <hi>Peregrine</hi> did? What Company he had with him? And whether he ſtirr'd abroad yet? The Fellow, who was the ſame that had been ſo frighted, told him, That now all the Devils which haunted him before, were all turn'd into Gentlewomen, that were very tame and gentle indeed, wonderous fine and handſome; and that, that very Priſoner, whoſe Ranſome he had paid, by the wounded Gentleman's Orders, was turned to a Gentlewoman alſo. This account gave the Count cauſe to conſider, he apprehended that this was <hi>Clarinda,</hi> who he had taken, which he had not known in the dark; he began to think how ſhye that Perſon was of ſhowing his Face, how he refuſed lying down with him, with abundance more; from all which he fully concluded it was <hi>Clarinda,</hi> that he had ſo tamely parted with, to his Mortal Enemy; this put him into
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58987:65"/>
ſuch a rage, that he was almoſt diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he lay continually ſighing and groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Bed, and would neither eat nor drink. While the Fellow was ſtill with him, the Perſon who had took him, came to tell him, He muſt find out a ſuddain way to pay his Ranſome, which he reſolved not to loſe. To which the Count made no anſwer, but that he was his Priſoner, he might do what he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with him. That gave but little ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the Officer, who was grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling very hard; which made the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low run home as faſt as he could; he told his Miſtreſs, that the other Priſoner that had been taken with the Man-Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, that was above Stairs, was like to be kill'd by him who had taken him, for want of his Ranſome. The Miſtreſs of the Houſe, fancying that he might be known by the Gentlewoman, went up Stairs to give notice of it: At which <hi>Mariana</hi> cry'd out, alas! this is the Count, who I told you was taken with me. How, a Count, ſaid the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, that will bring a good lump of Mony. No, no, reply'd <hi>Clarinda,</hi> it is a Voluntier, whoſe Name is <hi>le Count:</hi> ſo it was turn'd off, and the Land-lady
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58987:65"/>
was deſired to know what Ranſome was demanded for him. Mean time <hi>Clarinda</hi> and <hi>Mariana</hi> went into the Cloſet to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult about it with <hi>Peregrine,</hi> ſaying, now you have a fair opportunity to rid your ſelf of your Rival, the Count; ſo told him to what a ſad condition he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd. Why ſends he not to his Friends in the Camp, to let them know his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſaid <hi>Peregrine.</hi> There's the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of it, ſaid <hi>Mariana,</hi> with what this Fellow has put in his Head, that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he had taken was a Woman in man's Apparel, and believing it was you doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, (ſpeaking to <hi>Clarinda</hi>) he is in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, for having parted ſo tamely with you. Heavens forbid, that we ſhould not aſſiſt him, if we can, ſaid <hi>Peregrine;</hi> though he will not help himſelf, the more need has he of our aid. Still ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken like generous <hi>Peregrine.</hi> He ſhall be releaved, and preſently too, ſaid <hi>Clarin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> ſince my dear Friend has ſaid it. Some time after the Fellow return'd, ſaying, he refus'd all aid, aſſiſtance, or comfort, except he knew from whom it came. This made <hi>Peregrine</hi> ſay, unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Gentleman! There is nothing but this rich Jewel, but I would part with, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58987:66"/>
he, taking <hi>Clarinda</hi> by the hand, to ſerve him with: But what is his Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome? The Fellow ſaid, The Office<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> both ſides, he would be contented with what he could get. Then ſaid <hi>Clarinda</hi> I muſt get you <hi>Mariana</hi> to go with For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Piſtoles, which I will give you; and give twenty for his Ranſome, and give him the reſt to defray his preſent Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, as if all this came from your ſelf, taking no notice in the leaſt of us two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> otherwiſe, peradventure he would refuſe it. <hi>Mariana</hi> readily accepted the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and prepared to go with the Fellow, after <hi>Clarinda</hi> had given her the Gold. Mean time did <hi>Clarinda</hi> give <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrine</hi> an account of all her misfortunes, ſince they had been ſeparated, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting his Friend's Civility towards her, and her Rancounter with the Count.</p>
            <p>While ſhe was thus relating her Story to him, News was brought that there was one below, who would ſpake with <hi>Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grine;</hi> he ordered him to be brought up,

and it proved to be his honeſt Groom. So ſoon as the Articles had been ſigned, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry had been made about the Priſoners of Note, and Count <hi>Zinzendorf,</hi> having notice thereof, had ſent this Fellow to learn News of his Maſter: The Fellow being come, and perceiving his Maſter ſmile; 'Tis well you're found, at laſt, Maſter, ſaid he, there has been a foul ſtir about you, no body knew what was become of you; and after I told your Friends how I had found poor Crop, meat for Crows, they all concluded you dead; dead, ſaid I, he has other Fiſh to frie, I warrant you; D'you think that a Man has nothing elſe to do, that has a Sweet-Heart? He's gone to Ferret her out, I'll warrant you; and now I find I gueſt well, faith Maſter, or ſhe has ſerrited you out. Well, I'm glad to ſee thee again, old Boy, anſwered <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrine;</hi> How does all things whence you come? With that, he gave him this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; Your three Horſes, and three Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, are all well, as you ſee, at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and all preſent their Service to you; and Count <hi>Zinzendorf</hi> ſend me to tell you, that you ſhould ſend him word, whither you were dead or alive; iſ ſo, that he would order all your Trinckoms to be

She having turned it, and he having eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Plaſter; there's the mark of the Beaſt, cried he, that's he (though now turn'd to a Woman) that let himſelf be taken, on purpoſe, as he declared, to cut your Throat, as I have been well infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, by the Officer's Man; and for rage, he could not find you, had like to have made a Scieve, of a Count's Belly, but that a was a little too nimble for him, and

gave him that Remembrance, which he carries yet; Pray Maſter, let's ſearch him, I ſay?

               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:58987:68"/>
               <hi>Mariana,</hi> mean time, was come to the Count, who was much ſurpriſed at the ſight of her; he forced himſelf to be civil to her; ſhe told him, ſhe had heard of his Misfortune, and was come to offer him all the aid, and aſſiſtance, that lay in her Power; he thanked her, coldly, and told her, he ſhould not be long there; for either, in the Capitulations, the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners would be exchanged, or releaſed, on both ſides, or a Ranſome paid for him; mean time, that he was reſolved to ſuffer, for he did not care what became of him; this he concluded, with a deep ſigh, which drew Tears from <hi>Marianas</hi> Eves. But, Sir, ſaid ſhe, I come with a Ranſome, from the Perſon you had taken, who thinks it due to you, though he was after that retaken with you alſo: I know, I had <hi>Clarinda</hi> in my Poſſeſſion, but not ſo fortunate as to keep her; the Croſsneſs of my Stars, do ſtill purſue me, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their fatal Influences, 'twixt me, and my Happineſs. In that particular, you are miſtaken, Sir, you never had her in your Power, 'twas I, Sir, you purſued, took, and then loſt again: How! ſaid the Count, and was it not <hi>Clarinda?</hi> No Count, anſwered <hi>Mariana,</hi> I can give
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58987:68"/>
you ſuch an exact account of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of the Buſineſs (beſides the killing of her Servant) as would convince you: And is ſhe not in <hi>Mentz?</hi> Anſwer'd the Count: Sir, I ſay not ſo:—There he interrupted her, ſaying, and in my happy Rivals Poſſeſſion: No, I aſſure you Count, anſwered <hi>Mariana,</hi> ſhe is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Miſtreſs of her ſelf ſtill: If I was ſure of that,—he there was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, by the inſolent Officer, who had taken him, who came to inſult over-him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with two or three more, like himſelf: I come for Money, Sir, ſaid he, going up to the Count: Prithy Friend, take my Life, thou wouldſt do me a Kindneſs, for 'tis a Burthen to me, ſo heavy, as I am not able any longer to bear: <hi>Mariana,</hi> ſeeing the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap>ere going to apply themſelves to the Count, ſhe pulled the Officer by the Sleeve; and having told him, it did not become him, nor thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to inſult ſo, over a Perſon in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction: What will content you? Here, ſaid ſhe, take this, and deliver me your Priſoner: The Officer (having felt in his Hand the weight and bulk of twenty Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols) made no anſwer, but coming up to the Count, Sir, you are free, ſaid he,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58987:69"/>
and I am your humble Servant: Come, added he, to his Friends, I have no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger any concern with him; let us depart, and let him go where he pleaſes, with that they went their way. You, <hi>Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> are kind, ſaid the Count, but much more you would be, in letting me have a ſight of fair <hi>Clarinda.</hi> Sir, all that is in my Power, you may command, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Mariana; Clarinda</hi> is Miſtreſs of her own Actions, and of ſo good a temper, that I'll engage, ſhe will do you all the Juſtice ſhe can poſſible, ſo ſoon as things are ſettled; mean time, Sir, I earneſtly intreat you to take Care of your ſelf; and, in order to that, be pleaſed to make uſe of thoſe few Piſtols; with that, for fear of farther Interrogations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe went her ways, giving the Count<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Compaſſionate Look, and left the Piſtols on the Table, and the Count to do what he pleaſed with them.</p>
            <p>The Count, ſo ſoon as <hi>Mariana</hi> was gone, took the Gold, and with it went to an Inn, where he got a Meſſenger to go to Count <hi>Zinzendorf</hi> in the Camp. He after that, began to reflect with a more compos'd mind, than ever he had done before, on all his Concerns; he dwelt
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58987:69"/>
much on <hi>Mariana</hi>'s kindneſs to him; he believed that ſhe had all along been his Friend; he fancied he could make that out from her Actions, and ſomething in her looks: Of truth, <hi>Mariana</hi> was of a very compaſſionate Temper, apt to ſide with any Perſon in Affliction; ſhe had look'd on the Count, when ſhe left him, with a Countenance full of tenderneſs, in the Opinion that the Count had no hopes left now of ever poſſeſſing <hi>Clarinda;</hi> for though ſhe had ſaid true, that ſhe was ſtill at her own diſpoſal, yet ſhe knew her thoughts ſo well, that ſhe was certain none but <hi>Peregrine</hi> would carry her. <hi>Clarinda</hi> and ſhe were near related, had been brought up, and Educated together; and her Portion, which had been left in <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi>'s Father's hands, at the Death of her Father and Mother, while ſhe was yet very young, had increas'd to very near the Sum of <hi>Clarinda</hi>'s, and her Beauty not much inferiour; ſo that ſhe was as <hi>Clarinda</hi>'s Companion, and they lov'd one another intimately. All theſe things running in the Count's mind, he thought himſelf oblig'd to <hi>Mariana</hi>'s Bounty, and that he ought to requite all her Favours in an handſome manner, and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58987:70"/>
in that reſolution he remained, till the Town was Surrendered.</p>
            <p>The Articles were;<hi> That the next day the Confederates ſhould have poſſeſſion given them of St. </hi>Jacob's<hi> Tower, and of the </hi>Gau-Gate;<hi> that they ſhould ſend five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men to poſſeſs themſelves of it; that the next Day after, early in the Morning, the </hi>French<hi> Gariſon ſhould march out of the place, with ſix pieces of Cannon, two Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, with the Arms of </hi>France,<hi> and as many Carts and Waggons as were neceſſary to carry their Baggage, with their Colours flying, Drums beating, lighted Matches, and to be guarded to </hi>Landau,<hi> with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy of ten Thouſand Men of the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Articles did very much diſpleaſe the Soldiers, who had all along been very deſirous to take the City by Storm, to be reveng'd of thoſe perfidious Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries the <hi>French,</hi> as they term'd them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peregrine</hi>'s Men were got into the Town, and had given an account of theſe things to him from Count <hi>Zinzen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf,</hi> who had ſent him word alſo, that he ſhould be with him the next day:
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58987:70"/>
whereupon <hi>Peregrine</hi> fearing ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders might happen, as there is uſually in ſuch Affairs, ſo ſoon as <hi>Mariana</hi> was returned, he cauſed the Chamber-Door to be continually locked, and his Three Men to be in conſtant waiting at it. He after that endeavoured all he could to ſtand upon his Leg, and he found that he gathered much ſtrength by it, ſo that by the next day he was able to walk, with the aid of a Staff. Both he and <hi>Clarinda</hi> inquired of <hi>Mariana,</hi> how the Count did, and how he had received their Civilities, or yours rather, ſaid <hi>Clarinda:</hi> very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, anſwered <hi>Mariana;</hi> I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to leave the Gold on the Table before him, and to go abruptly from him, for fear he ſhould have returned it me: How does he look? Said <hi>Peregrine;</hi> very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed, anſwered <hi>Mariana,</hi> full of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo that I could not but pity him very much: I wiſh, ſaid <hi>Clarinda,</hi> you had the Power, dear <hi>Mariana,</hi> to change all his Sorrows into Love, of thee I mean: I fear, ſaid <hi>Peregrine,</hi> that who ever has once lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Clarinda,</hi> can never be capable of any other Love: I am of your mind, replied <hi>Mariana:</hi> I am not, ſaid <hi>Clarinda;</hi> he never loved to an exceſs; and I believe
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58987:71"/>
there has been more of Obſtinacy and Revenge, in his Conduct towards me, than o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſincere Affection, ſo that he will eaſily be diverted by ſome other Object, when he is once paſſed all hopes: Pray wave this Diſcourſe, replied <hi>Mariana,</hi> and let us ſpeak of other things: Agreed, ſaid <hi>Peregrine;</hi> but firſt give me leave to ſay, that next to ſeeing my dear <hi>Clarinda</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely mine, paſt all Diſputes, I heartily could wiſh, the Count ſo happy as to be in full Poſſeſſion of the obliging <hi>Mariana;</hi> from this they fell into various Diſcourſes, with which they paſſed the reſt of that Morning: After Dinner, they deſired <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> to give them, in a continued Story, the Courſe of her Life, ſince they had been ſeparated, which they had not heard yet, but by pieces; <hi>Mariana,</hi> having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to their Requeſt, thus began.</p>
            <p>After you had been two days gon, and that the Servants you had ſent back, had aſſured me of your ſafe getting into the Town, and of your Father's Death, and Burial; I every moment expected, with great impatiency, to hear from <hi>Peregrine,</hi> in what place of ſafety he was retired, that I might ſend you word, if poſſible, which I much diſpaired to do, when I heard how
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:58987:71"/>
difficult it was for any one to get into the Town, ſince the Confederates had laid a formal Siege before it. I was out of all hopes of hearing from him alſo, and was very willing to lay the fault on any thing elſe, than on his neglect, though I believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it more eaſily to have heard from him, than to have ſent to you; this made me apprehend that he might have fallen into ſome Diſaſter. I was in thoſe fears, when a Party of the Imperialiſts, came to the Caſtle, where they acted a great deal of Rudeneſs, not only towards my old Aunt, and my ſelf, but every one of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were made ſenſible of their Inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; and the worſt was, that when I had made my Complaints to the Officer, under pretence of taking me into his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; he offered things to me, beyond what I could tamely endure, ſo that I was forced to Repulſe him with fury: mean time: the Soldiers did ranſack all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, taking what they thought convenient to carry along with them, not ſparing my poor Aunts Chamber, which put her into ſuch a fright, that I verily believe much contributed to her Death preſently after. They were not contented with that, but went to the Stables, where they exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58987:72"/>
their worſe Horſes for ours, and took away the reſt. When they had done all the miſchief they could, except firing, they left us to condole our Misfortunes; I found my poor Aunt in ſo lamentable a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſhe looked then as if ſhe had been dead; ſo ſoon as ſhe was recovered from her fright, ſo much as would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her to ſpeak, ſhe ſaid, Let us begon, good Niece, as far as we can from theſe mercileſs Devils, before another Party of them come to make an end of us; Where ſhall we go, dear Aunt? I anſwered her; to my Farm, ſaid ſhe, which is Twenty miles further from <hi>Mentz;</hi> I told her ſhe would ſcarce be able to endure the fatigue of ſo long a Journey, eſpecially on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and there was then no other conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency to be had; but ſhe ſaid, ſhe had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choſe to die by the way, than be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain frighted, as ſhe had been before, which would certainly procure her Death: We therefore, the very next morning, very early, ſet forwards, with all they had left us, that was carriable; but though we went but ſlowly, conſidering we fled, my poor Aunt was ſo much fatigated, that ſhe fell ſick of a Fever, of which ſhe died, the day after we came to the Farm; ſhe
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58987:72"/>
by her Will, parted all ſhe had betwixt us two; ſhe left to my Couſin, your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a Legacy, in caſe he were alive, which, if he was not, was to return to us. I took Care to have her decently buried, according to her Quality, as well as I could; after which, I gave my ſelf up to lament her loſs, and your Abſence. I remained ſo, till hearing no News of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of you, and being in Deſpair of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any, I inquired of all the Men Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, which would be ſo Couragious, as to attempt the getting into <hi>Mentz,</hi> with me, to learn what was become of their young Miſtreſs; your own Groom was the readieſt to anſwer, but your Brother's Faulkner was the moſt forward to attend me; he only asked, When I would ſet forward? I told him, the next day; he ſaid no more, but got all things in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, both for me, and himſelf, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to me the next morning: Are you ready, Madam? Said he: Why? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered I, Have you got every thing, as it ſhould be?

ſo many rude Men, without receiving ſome Affronts: I readily accepted his Kindneſs, aſſuring him I ſhould gratifie, him for that, and all his other Troubles and Civilities; and in Concluſion, I got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Horſe-back, accoutred like an abſolute Cadett, and he like my Servant, both well provided with Arms.</p>
            <p>Our Deſign was to get into the Camp, where we were to inquire after <hi>Peregrine,</hi> and ſo to have converſed with him, how to have proceeded; but when, after a long ſearch, we had no other News of him, but that it was believed he was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, becauſe his Horſe had been found dead, with a Shot; we then reſolved to attempt the getting into the Town, as Deſerters, ſo ſoon as poſſible we could; to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, we were in the Night time, getting as cloſe as we could to the Wall, when we were eſpied by a ſingle Horſeman, who making after us, ſhot at us, and kill'd the poor Faulkner; I perceiving him fall, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that my turn would be next, ſlack'd my pace, and turning my Horſe, cried, I yield, ſave my Life, and you ſhall have a Ranſome; my purſuer ſeem'd ſatisfied with that, and was going to ſecure me, from an eſcape, when we were preſently
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58987:73"/>
ſurrounded with a Party of Horſe, that was retiring into the Town, which took us along with them. You have heard ſince, how it proved to be the Count, that had taken me Priſoner, but how he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened on me, or what he was doing there, I am ſtill to learn.</p>
            <p>Thus did <hi>Mariana</hi> put an end to her Narrative; they ſpent the reſt of the day, in contriving how <hi>Peregrine</hi> ſhould meet with his Friends, and how they ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of themſelves, after things were ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iled again in the Town; <hi>Mariana</hi> ſaid, That ſhe long'd to ſee them all ſafe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their own homes: What ſay you to it, Madam, ſaid <hi>Peregrine,</hi> Muſt I return to my own home alſo? That would be too far a Journey for you to perform at once, replied <hi>Clarinda;</hi> you ſhall reſt your ſelf ſome time, at the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; and then I muſt begon, added <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrine:</hi> Goodneſs, cried <hi>Clarinda,</hi> you are ſuch a troubleſome Man, you ſhall ſtay there till you are ſent away: That may be the next day after, Madam, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Peregrine,</hi> or ſo ſoon as your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther returns, if you do not anticipate him in that employ: Shall I propoſe an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, ſaid <hi>Mariana,</hi> that will ſalve all?
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58987:74"/>
Let's hear it, anſwered <hi>Clarinda:</hi> Nay, will you ſtand to it, added <hi>Mariana,</hi> I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, before hand, it ſhall be to both your Likings, and Advantages? I will ſtand to it, cried <hi>Peregrine,</hi> irrevocably: What ſay you, Madam? added he, to <hi>Clarinda:</hi> Upon <hi>Marianas</hi> aſſurance, I care not if I do: Give me your Hands to the Bargain, ſaid <hi>Mariana;</hi> with that ſhe took both their Hands, and joined them together, ſaying, Marry, without delay: Spoken like an Angel, cried out <hi>Peregrine,</hi> with Joy; and finding <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi> to pull back her Hand, and to look ſurpriſed: Nay, Madam, added he, it is too late to draw back, we have your conſent: I did not think, ſaid <hi>Clarinda,</hi> that <hi>Mariana</hi> would have ſerved me ſo; I believed her more firm to my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts: Can I be more firm to <hi>Clarindas</hi> Intereſt, anſwered <hi>Mariana,</hi> than to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote them to the outmoſt of my Power? What can be more your Intereſt, than to be inſeparably united to what you Love; What is there more Advantagious for you, than to once be fixed in <hi>Peregrine's</hi> Arms? So fix'd, as not to be remov'd but by Death: All this is true, Madam, added <hi>Peregrine,</hi> If your Heart does not gain-ſay

your Mouth, add the laſt of your Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, in aſſenting to what our dear <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> has ſo juſtly propoſed? Nay, ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny me for ſhame, ſaid <hi>Mariana;</hi> of ſhe ſhould, I ſhould for ever diſ-own her for my Friend; but I know ſhe will not, ſhe has too much of Juſtice, of Senſe, and of Love for me, beſides what ſhe has for you, Sir, to act againſt her own Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and Quiet; Come, I muſt have it ſo, added ſhe, bringing <hi>Clarinda,</hi> near to <hi>Peregrine,</hi> and giving her Hand to him once more; Tell him, you are his, and that you will confirm it, by Marriage, with the firſt opportunity: Well, replied <hi>Clarinda,</hi> on Condition that you ſhall not refuſe to do that which I ſhall propoſe to you, <hi>Mariana,</hi> I will: Then ſpake <hi>Clarinda,</hi> anſwered <hi>Mariana;</hi> ſpake to <hi>Peregrine,</hi> then next to me: Well then, ſaid <hi>Clarinda,</hi> with a ſoft ſigh, ſince it muſt be ſo, <hi>Clarinda</hi> is yours, Sir, here is my Hand to it, and ſo ſoon as opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſhall offer it ſelf, I will be Married to you: I leave you to gueſs at <hi>Peregrine</hi>'s Tranſports, for I cannot expreſs them: Now, added <hi>Clarinda;</hi> let me ſpeak to you, <hi>Mariana,</hi> Love the Count, and endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to make him yours: Very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partied,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:58987:75"/>
I'll ſwear, ſaid <hi>Peregrine;</hi> and I add, may you by that means be the cauſe of our perfect Reconciliation: <hi>Amen,</hi> ſaid <hi>Clarinda;</hi> nay, if you will all have it ſo, I ſay <hi>Amen</hi> too. After this, Supper was ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in; they cat and drank, and were merry; <hi>Peregrine</hi> walked about the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and after they had tired themſelves, with Mirth, <hi>Clarinda,</hi> at <hi>Peregrine</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, took her Lute, and Sung thoſe Lines, which <hi>Peregrine</hi> had made; and when it came to the two laſt, they all in Conſort Sang,</p>

            <p>Thus they concluded the Evening, after which, they went to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>The next Morning, was the Day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Garriſon to March out, and the Confederates to March in, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Capitulation that had been made: The Imperialliſts drew up their Army, in two Ranks, by Six in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to receive their Enemies; divers of the Imperial Cavalry, poſted themſelves, on the Right of the <hi>Gaw-Gate;</hi> on the

            <p>Beſides, there were put into Boats, which had been ſent from <hi>Straſbourg,</hi> with Ammunition for the <hi>French,</hi> 6 Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Cannon, 2 Mortars, 2 Hawbitz, and 1500 Sick, whereof, ſome died con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, which they threw over into the <hi>Rhine.</hi> As the Marquiſs <hi>D'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xelles</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out of the Garriſon, he took his leave of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> of the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and of that of <hi>Bavaria;</hi> as alſo, of all the reſt of the Princes, and Generals; The <hi>French</hi> declared, that before the Siege, the Garriſon conſiſted of 11000 Men.

            <p>The Count, on the other hand, upon mature Conſiderations, had taken now Meaſures; he was reſolved to ſlight thoſe who ſlighed him, and to eſteem thoſe who vallued him; ſo that now his whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns were altered, which put him upon writing this Letter to <hi>Mariana.</hi>

This Letter was, by his Direction, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately conveyed into <hi>Marianas</hi> own Hands, by a Maid Servant of the Houſe, who promiſed to return an Anſwer ſafe, if ſhe pleaſed to give her one: <hi>Mariana</hi> was ſtrangely ſurpriſed, at the reading of this Letter, ſhe did not know well what to make of it, ſhe was loth to flatter her ſelf too much, and as unwilling to take advice of her beſt Friends, for fear they ſhould think her too conceited of her ſelf, and apt to receive Amorous Impreſſions; ſhe therefore concluded to conſider very maturely on the Buſineſs, and then ſend an Anſwer as ſuitable, as ſhe could, to her Modeſty, and her Deſires; ſhe fancied that her Kindneſs towards the Count, when abandoned of all, and the commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerating Looks, ſhe caſt on him, when ſhe left him laſt, might have had ſome kind Influence over his Mind, that ſeeing he had reſolved to take off his Affections from <hi>Clarinda,</hi> as he ſeemed to intimate, he might as well have ſome Thoughts of her, as he had had of <hi>Clarinda,</hi> to whom, ſhe thought not her ſelf Inferiour in Birth, nor not much in Eſtate, except her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould chance to die: Theſe, and

When the Count received this, he was in a great perplexity, as to the Nature of <hi>Marianas</hi> Anſwer, till he had read it; he opened it, and read, with that Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that made him repeat it over again, though he ſaw a world of good Nature in it; and he reſolved by one Letter more to know the bottom of <hi>Marianas</hi> Heart; he was in haſte, becauſe he believed that his late Miſtreſs, and his Rival, was ſo to; and he deſigned to be before hand with them, that his new choice might appear as a contempt; not doubting of <hi>Marianas</hi> Diſcretion, in keeping the Buſineſs Secret, at the leaſt notice, that he deſired it ſhould be ſo; he therefore, gratifying well the Meſſenger for what he had already done, and promiſing him a farther Bounty, he ſent him immediately back, with this Anſwer.</p>

            <p>The Count was ſo fully ſatisfied, with this ſhort, but full Anſwer, from <hi>Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> that he now went about to contrive how he ſhould make this Secret March break out to his greater Credit and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, as well as to his Antagoniſts Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſal; ſo ſoon as his Kinſman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Count <hi>Zinzendorf,</hi> was marched into the Town, he repaired to him, and the better to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe his Intentions, he began to harp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain on the Picture, which he believed <hi>Peregrine</hi> had taken from him; <hi>Zinzen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf</hi> told him, that he had found out where <hi>Peregrine</hi> lay, that he would go and acquaint <hi>Peregrine</hi> with what he had ſaid, and he would bring him back his
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:58987:79"/>
Anſwer, being very deſirous to make a thorough Reconciliation bet wixt them, as being Friend to both, telling him beſides, he thought that the beſt expedient to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe all diſputes, between them, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Clarinda,</hi> would be to have them both ſtand to her Deciſion, in making choice of whom ſhe liked beſt: The Count ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to give his conſent, by ſaying, Do what you pleaſe: So Count <hi>Zinzendorf</hi> went immediately to find out <hi>Peregrine,</hi> and to diſcourſe the buſineſs with him; he found his Friend in company with <hi>Clarinda</hi> and <hi>Mariana:</hi> After the firſt Embraces and Compliments to the Ladies, as well as to his Friend, who had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with their Qualities, he took <hi>Peregrine</hi> aſide, to let him underſtand what Count <hi>Mansfeilt</hi> had ſaid to him. As for the Picture, ſaid <hi>Peregrine,</hi> I own I took it from him, and ſhall reſtore it him again, when e'er he requires it; but I know of no wrong I ever did him; I had engag'd my Affections to this Lady, added he, before I knew any thing of his pretenſions, and had had obliging returns from her; and therefore I find not in what I have incurr'd his diſpleaſure; but if he is pleaſed to let the Lady decide our

Count <hi>Zinzendorf,</hi> whoſe buſineſs in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Quarters, call'd him another way, made what haſt he could back to Count <hi>Mansfeilt,</hi> and acquainted him with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrine</hi>'s Anſwer, and did further bring the Count to pitch on a certain Hour the next Day, to meet all together, and there make up all Diſcords. The Count, who thought himſelf ſure of <hi>Mariana,</hi> agreed to all; whereupon Count <hi>Zinzendorf</hi> left him, to ſend an account to <hi>Peregrine</hi> of the Hour and Place the Count had nam'd for the Rendezvouz.</p>
            <p>The next Day, at the Hour appointed, all Parties met at Count <hi>Zinzendorf</hi>'s Quarters, where <hi>Mariana</hi> was ſure to make one. Count <hi>Zinzendorf</hi> broke the Ice, ſaying, That ſeeing both Parties were agreed to ſtand to the Lady's Deciſion, he humbly intreated her to determine, which of thoſe Gentlemen ſhe would pleaſe to make choice of for her Husband. At this Count <hi>Mansfeilt</hi> cryed out, Which Lady do you mean? And ſtepping up to <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> taking her by the Hand, This is the

Yes Sir, anſwered <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> if you pleaſe to conſent to my choice. With that, the Count kiſs'd her, and ſaid, Bear Witneſs all, that I take this Gentlewoman, my dear <hi>Mariana,</hi> to be my Wife; and that I will Marry her ſo ſoon as I can get any one to do that Office for us: And now Madam, ſaid he, addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Clarinda,</hi> I have been before-hand with you, you may now make choice of whom you pleaſe. Count <hi>Zinzendorf,</hi> after this, ſaid, All things go very well hitherto; I ſhould be glad to ſee the reſt proſper ſo well alſo: My Friend <hi>Peregrine,</hi> you are now to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect what that Lady will declare.

At which <hi>Peregrine</hi> return'd her his moſt humble Thanks.</p>
            <p>There are but two things more to be done, ſaid Count <hi>Zinzendorf;</hi> you Sir, are to make Reſtitution of that Picture, which
