            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>YOur Lordships of the ninth, I received the twelfth instant, and therein have I your Lordships invitation to a conjunction with your self (I suppose) as Lord lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and with others now united with the Irish, and with the Irish themselves also.</p>
                  <p>As I understand not how your Lordship should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested with that power pretended, so am I very well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, That it is not in the power of any without the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> to give and assure pardon to those bloodie Rebels, as by the Act to that end passed may appear more fully. I am also well assured that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>England</hi> would never assent to such a Peace (such as is that your Lordships with the Rebels) wherin is little or no provision made either for the Protestants or the Protestant Religion Nor can I understand how the Protestant Religion should bee setled and restored to its puritie by an Armie of Papists, or the Protestant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests maintained by those very enemies by whom they have been spoiled and there slaughtered: And very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it is that both the Protestants and Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are in that your Lordships Treaty, left as in the power of the Rebels to be by them born down, and rooted out at pleasure.</p>
                  <p>As for that consideration by your Lordship offered of the present and late proceedings in <hi>England,</hi> I see not how it may be a sufficient motive to mee (or any other in like trust for the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> in the service of this Kingdome) to joyn with those Rebels upon any the pretences in that your Lordships letter mentioned, for therein were there a manifest betraying that trust repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in me in disserting the service and work committed to me in joyning with those I should oppose, and in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing whom I am obliged to serve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:99462:21"/>
Neither conceive I it any part of my work and care to take notice of any whatsoever proceedings of State forreign, to my charge and trust here, especially, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found hereunto apparently destructive.</p>
                  <p>Most certain it is, and former ages have approved it, that the intermedling of Governors and parties in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, with sidings and parties in <hi>England,</hi> have been the very betraying of this kingdom to the Irish, whiles the Brittish forces here had bin thereupon called off, and the place therin laid open, and as it were given up to the common enemie.</p>
                  <p>It is what your Lordship might have observed in your former Treatie with the Rebels, that upon your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships thereupon withdrawing, and sending hence into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> the most considerable part of the English army then commanded by you; thereby was the remaining Brittish party, not long after over-poured, and your quarters by the Irish over-run to the gates of <hi>Dublin,</hi> your self also reduced to that low condition, as to be besieged in this very Citie (the Metropolis and princpall cittadell of the Kingdom) and that by those very Rebels, who till then could never stand before you; and what the end hath bin of that party, also, so sent by your Lordship into <hi>England,</hi> (although the flower &amp; strength of the English army here both officers and souldiers) hath bin very observable.</p>
                  <p>And how much the dangers are at present (more then in former ages) of hazarding the English interest in this Kingdom, by sending any parties hence into any other Kingdom upon any pretences whatsoever is very appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, as in the generalitie of the Rebellion, now more then formerly; So considering your Lordships present conclusions with, and concessions to the Rebels, wherein they are allowed the continued possession of all the cities, forts, and places of strength, whereof they stood posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99462:21"/>
at the time of their Treatie with your Lordship, and that theyare to have a standing force (if I well remember of 15000 foot, and 2500 horse (all of their own party officers and souldiers) and they (with the whole kingdom) to be regulated by a Major party of Irish Trustees cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen by the Rebels themselves, as persons for their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests and ends to be by them confided in, without whom nothing is to be acted. Therein I cannot but mind your Lordship of what hath been sometimes by your self deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, as your sence in this particular; that the English interest in <hi>Ireland</hi> must be preserved by the English, and not by Irish, and upon that ground (if I be not deceived) did your Lordship then capitulate with the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> from which cleer principle I am sorrie to see your Lordship now receding.</p>
                  <p>As to that by your Lordship menaced us here, of blood and force, if dissenting from your Lordships waies and designes, for my particular I shall (my Lord) much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuse to suffer in so doing (for therein shall I doe what is becomming and answerable to my trust) then to purchase my self on the contrary the ignominious brand of perfidie, by any allurements of whatsoever advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages offered me.</p>
                  <p>But very confident I am, of the same divine power which hath still followed me in this work, and will still folllow me; and in that trust doubt I nothing of thus gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving your Lordship plainly this my resolution in that particular, So I remain,</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen we doe seriously consider the great, and many duties which we owe unto God, and his people, over whom he hath made us Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers; and for whom we must give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt; and when wee behold the laudable Examples of the worthy Ministers of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>London,</hi> and of the Commissioners of the Generall Assembly of the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in their free and faithfull testimonies against the insolencies of the Sectarian party in <hi>England.</hi> Considering also the dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of this Kingdome upon the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring how against strong oppositions we were assisted by the Lord the last yeare in discharge of the like dutie, and how he punished the Contempt of our warning upon the despisers thereof: We finde our selves as necessitated; so the more encouraged to cast in our Mite in the treasury, least our silence should involve us in the guilt of unfaithfulnesse, and our People in security, and neglect of duties.</p>
            <p>In this discharge of the trust put upon us by God, we would not be looked upon as sowers of sedition, or broachers of Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and divisive motions, our record is in heaven, that nothing is more hatefull unto us, nor lesse intended by us, and therefore we shall not feare the malicious, and wicked aspersions, which we
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99462:23"/>
know Satan by his Instruments is ready to cast, not onely upon us, but on all who sincerely endeavour the advancement of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
            <p>What of late have been, and now are the insolent, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous practises of the Sectaries in <hi>England,</hi> is not unknowne to the world: For, first, notwithstanding their specious pretences for Religion, and Liberties, yet their late, and present actings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therewith compared, doe clearly evidence that they love a rough garment to deceive; since they have with a high hand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised the Oath in breaking the Covenant, which is so strong a foundation to both, whilest they loaden it with slighting reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, calling it a Bundle of particular and contrary Interests, and a Snare to the people; and likewise labour to establish by Lawes an Universall Toleration of all Religions, which is an Innovation over-turning of Unity in Religion, and so directly repugnant to the word of God, the two first Articles of our Solemne Covenant, which is the greatest wickednesse in them to violate, since many of the chiefest of themselves, have with their hands testified to the most high God, sworne, and sealed it.</p>
            <p>Moreover; their great dis-affection to the Settlement of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so their future breach of Covenant doth more fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by their strong oppositions to Presbyteriall Government (the hedge, and Bulwarke of Religion) whilest they expresse their hatred to it, more then to the worst of errours, by excluding it under the name of Compulsion; when they imbrace, even Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme, and Judaisme in the Armes of Toleration. Not to speake of their Aspersions upon it, and the Assertors thereof, as Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian, and Popish, though they have deeply sworn to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the same Government in the first Article of the Covenant, as it is established in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which they now so despite, and fully blaspheme.</p>
            <p>Againe, It is more then manifest that they seek not the vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but the extirpation of Lawes, and Liberties, as appeares by their seizing on the person of the King, and at their pleasures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving him from place to place, not onely without the consent, but (if we mis-take not) against a direct Ordinance of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: their violent surprizing, imprisoning, and secluding many of the most worthy Members of the Honourable House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, directly against a declared Priviledge of Parliament (an
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99462:23"/>
Action certainly without parallell in any age) and their purposes of abolishing Parliamentary power for the future, and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Representative (as they call it) in stead thereof. Neither hath their fury stayed here, but without all rule, or example, being but private men, they have proceeded to the tryall of the King, against both the Interest, and Protestation of the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the former publique Declarations of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes (besides the violent hast, reiecting the hearing of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences) with cruell hands have put him to death; an act so hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, as no history, divine or humane, hath laid a President of the like.</p>
            <p>These, and many other their detestable insolencies, may abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly convince every unbyassed Judgement, that the present pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the Sectaries, and their Abettors, doe directly over-turne the Lawes and Liberties of the Kingdomes, roote out lawfull, and supreme Magistracy (the just priviledges whereof we have sworne to maintaine) and introduce a fearfull confusion, and lawlesse Anarchie.</p>
            <p>The Spirit of God by <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Pro.</hi> 30. 21. <hi>That a servant to reigne is one of the foure things for which the earth is disquieted, and which is cannot heare:</hi> We wonder nothing that the earth is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted for these things; but we wonder greatly, if the earth can beare them, and albeit the Lord so permit, that folly be set in great dignity, and they which sit in low place; <hi>That servants ride upon horses, and Princes walke as servants upon the Earth,</hi> Eccles. 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7. Yet the same Wise man saith, <hi>Pro.</hi> 19. 10. <hi>Delight is not seemely for a foole, much lesse for a servant to have rule ever Princes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we consider these things, we cannot but declare and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest our utter dislike and detestation of such unwarrantable practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, directly subverting our Covenant, Religion, Lawes, and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And as Watchmen in <hi>Sion</hi> warne all the Lovers of truth, and well-affected to the Covenant, carefully to avoyde compliance with, or not bearing witnesse against horrid Insolencies, least par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking with them in their sinnes, they also be partakers of their plagues. Therefore in the Spirit of meeknesse, wee earnestly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate, and in the authority of Jesus Christ, (whose servants wee are) Charge, and obtest all who resolve to adhere unto truth, and the Covenant, diligently to observe, and conscientiously to performe these following duties.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:99462:24"/>
1. First, That according to our solemne Covenant, every one study more to the power of godlinesse, and personall reformation of themselves, and families, because for the great breach of this part of the Covenant, God is highly offended with these Lands, and justly provoked to permit men to be the Instruments of our misery and afflictions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, That every one in their station and calling earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the Saints, <hi>Jude</hi> 3. And seeke to have their hearts established with grace, that they be not unstable, and wavering, carried about with every winde of doctrine; but that they receive the truth in love, avoyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the company of such, as withdraw from, and vilifie the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Ordinances; speake evill of Church-Government; invent damnable errors, under the specious pretence of a Gospel-way, and new Light; and highly extoll the persons and courses of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Sectaries, least God give them over to strong delusions (the plague of these times) that they may beleeve lies, and be damned.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, That they would not be drawne by Councell, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or Example, to shake off the ancient, and fundamentall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of these Kingdomes by King and Parliament, which we are so deeply ingaged to preserve by our solemne Covenant, as they would not be found guilty of the great evill of these times (condemned by the Holy Ghost) the despising of Dominion, and speaking evill of Dignities.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, That they doe cordially endeavour the preservation of the Union amongst the well-affected in the Kingdomes, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing swayed by any Nationall respect: remembring that part of the Covenant; <hi>That wee shall not suffer our selves directly, nor indirectly, by whatsoever Combination, perswasion, or terrour, to be divided, or withdrawne from this blessed Union, and Conjunction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And finally, albeit there be more present hazard from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Sectaries, (as were from Malignants the last yeare) yet wee are not ignorant of the evill purposes of Malignants, even at this time in all the Kingdomes; and particularly in this; and for this cause we exhort every one with equall watchfulnesse to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves free from associating with such, or from swerving in their judgements to Malignant principles; and to avoyd all such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as have been from the beginning knowne opposers of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,

refusers of the Covenant, combining themselves with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, and other notorious Malignants, especially such who have been chiefe Promotors of the late Ingagement against <hi>England,</hi> Calumniators of the worke of Reformation, in reputing the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the present times unto the advancers thereof, and that their just hatred to Sectaries, incline not their mindes to favour Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, or to thinke that because of the power of Sectaries, the cause of God needs the more to feare the Enmity, or to stand in need of the helpe of Malignants.</p>

            <p>Having therefore seen of late those Articles of Peace granted to the Papist Rebels of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as speciall graces and favours from the late King, in reward, most likely, of their work don, and in his name and authority confirm'd and ratifi'd by <hi>James</hi> Earle of <hi>Ormond;</hi> together with his Letter to Col. <hi>Jones,</hi> Governour of <hi>Dublin,</hi> full of contumely and dishonour, both to the Parliament and Army. And on the other side, an Insolent and seditious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation from the <hi>Scotch</hi> Presbytery at <hi>Belfast</hi> in the North of <hi>Ireland;</hi> no lesse dishonourable to the State; and much about the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99462:25"/>
same time brought hither; there will be needfull as to the same slanderous aspersions but one and the same Vindication against them both. Nor can we sever them in our notice and resentment, though one part intitl'd a <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and would be thou ghta Protestant Assembly, since their own unexampl'd virulence hath wrapt them into the same guilt, made them accomplices and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants to the abhorred <hi>Irish</hi> Rebels, and with them at present to advance the same interest: if wee consider both their calumnies, their hatred, and the pretended Reasons of their hatred to be the same; the time also, and the place concurring, as that there lacks nothing but a few formall words, which may be easily dissembl'd, to make the perfetest conjunction; and between them to divide that Iland,</p>
            <p>As for these Articles of Peace made with those inhumane Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and Papists of <hi>Ireland</hi> by the late King, as one of his last Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-pieces. We may be confidently perswaded, that no true borne <hi>English-man,</hi> can so much as barely reade them without indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and disdaine, that those bloudy Rebels, and so proclaim'd and judg'd of by the King himself, after the mercilesse and barbarous Massacre of so many thousand <hi>English,</hi> (who had us'd their right and title to that Countrey with such tendernesse and moderation, and might otherwise have secur'd themselvs with ease against their Treachery) should be now grac'd and rewarded with such free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and enlargements, as none of their Ancestors could ever merit by their best obedience, which at best was alwaies treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, to be infranchiz'd with full liberty equall to their Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, whom the just revenge of ancient Pyracies, cruell Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the causlesse infestation of our Coast, had warrantably call'd over, and the long prescription of many hundred yeares; besides what other titles are acknowledg'd by their own <hi>Irish</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laments, had fixt and seated in that soile with as good a right as the meerest Natives.</p>
            <p>These therefore by their own foregoing demerits and provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions justly made our vassalls, are by the first Article of this peace advanc'd to a Condition of freedome superior to what any <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Protestants durst have demanded. For what else can be the meaning to discharge them the Common Oath of Supremacy, especially being Papists (for whom principally that oath was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) but either to resigne them the more into their own power,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99462:25"/>
or to set a mark of dishonour upon the Brittish Loyalty; by trusting <hi>Irish</hi> Rebels for one single Oath of Alleageance, as much as all his Subjects of <hi>Brittaine</hi> for the double swearing both of Allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance and Supremacy.</p>
            <p>The second Article puts it into the hands of an <hi>Irish</hi> Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to repeale, or to suspend, if they thinke convenient, that act usually call'd <hi>Poynings Act,</hi> which was the maine, and yet the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villest and most moderate acknowledgement impos'd of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> whereby no Parlament could be summond there, no Bill be past, but what was first to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and allowd under the great seale of <hi>England.</hi> The recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of which Act, tends openly to invest them with a law-giving power of their own, enables them by degrees to throw off all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to this Realme, and renders them who by their endlesse treasons and revolts have deserv'd to hold no Parlament at all, but to be govern'd by Edicts and Garrisons, as absolute and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream in that Assembly as the People of <hi>England</hi> in their own Land. And the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article grants them in expresse words, that the <hi>Irish</hi> Parlament shall be no more dependent on the Parlament of <hi>England,</hi> then the <hi>Irish</hi> themselves shall declare agreeable to the Lawes of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two and twentieth Article more ridiculous then dangerous, coming especially from such a serious knot of Lords and Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, obtaines that those Acts prohibiting to plow with horses by the Tayle, and burne oates in the Straw, be repeald; anough if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, to declare in them a disposition not onely sottish but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docible and averse from all Civility and amendment, and what hopes they give for the future, who rejecting the ingenuity of all other Nations to improve and waxe more civill by a civilizing Conquest, though all these many yeares better shown and taught, preferre their own absurd and savage Customes before the most convincing evidence of reason and demonstration: a testimony of their true Barbarisme and obdurate wilfulnesse to be expected no lesse in other matters of greatest moment.</p>
            <p>Yet such as these and thus affected, the ninth Article entrusts with the Militia; a Trust which the King swore by God at <hi>New-Market,</hi> he would not commit to his Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> no not for an houre. And well declares the confidence he had in <hi>Irish</hi> Rebels, more then in his Loyaliest Subjects. He grants them more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99462:26"/>
till the performance of all these Articles, that 15000 foote and 2500 horse, shall remaine a standing Army of Papists at the beck and Command of <hi>Dillon, Muskery,</hi> and other arch Rebels, with power also of adding to that number as they shall see cause. And by other Articles allows them the constituting of Magistrates and Judges in all Causes, whom they think fie: and till a settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their own minds, the possession of all those Townes and Countreys within their now Quarters being little lesse then all the Iland, besides what their Cruelty hath dispeopl'd and lay'd wast. And lastly, the whole managing both of peace and warre is committed to Papists, and the chiefe Leaders of that Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</p>
            <p>Now let all men judge what this wants of utter alienating and acquitting the whole Province of <hi>Ireland</hi> from all true fealty and obedience to the Common-wealth of <hi>England.</hi> Which act of any King against the Consent of his Parliament, though no other Crime were layd against him, might of it selfe strongly conduce to the dis-inthrowning him of all. In France <hi>Henry</hi> the third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding leave in greatest exigencies to make Sale of some Crown Lands onely, and that to his Subjects, was answerd by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament then at <hi>Blois,</hi> that a King in no case, though of extreamest necessity, might alienate the Patrimony of his Crown, whereof he is but onely <hi>Usu-fructuary,</hi> as Civilians terme it, the propriety re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ever to the Kingdome, not to the King. And in our own Nation, King <hi>John,</hi> for resigning though unwillingly his Crown to the Popes Legate, with little more hazard to his Kingdome then the payment of 1000 Marks, and the unsightlinesse of such a Ceremony, was depos'd by his Barons, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the French Kings Sonne elected in his roome. And to have carried onely the Jewells, Plate, and Treasure into <hi>Ireland</hi> without consent of the Nobility, was one of those impeachments that condemn'd <hi>Richard</hi> the second to lose his Crown.</p>
            <p>But how petty a Crime this will seem to the alienating of a whole Kingdome, which in these Articles of Peace we see as good as done by the late King, not to friends, but to mortall Enemies, to the accomplishment of his own interests and ends, wholly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the Peoples good, may without aggravation be easily conceiv'd. Nay by the Covenant it self, since that so cavillously is urg'd against us, wee are enjoyn'd in the fourth Article, with all
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99462:26"/>
faithfulnesse to endeavour the bringing all such to public Triall and condigne Punishment, as shall divide one Kingdome from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And what greater dividing then by a pernicious and hostile Peace, to disalliege a whole Feudary Kingdome from the ancient Dominion of <hi>England?</hi> Exception we finde there of no person what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; and if the King who hath actually done this, or any for him claime a Priviledge above Justice, it is againe demanded by what expresse Law, either of God or man, and why he whose of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is to execute Law and Justice upon all others, should sit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self like a demigod in lawlesse and unbunded <hi>anarchy;</hi> refusing to be accountable for that autority over men naturally his equals, which God himself without a reason givn is not wont to exercise over his creatures? And if God the neerer to be acquainted with mankind and his frailties, and to become our Priest, made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a man, and subject to the Law, we gladly would be instructed why any mortal man for the good and wellfare of his brethren beeing made a King, should by a clean contrary motion make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a God, exalted above Law; the readiest way to become utterly unsensible, both of his human condition, and his own duty.</p>
            <p>And how securely, how smoothly, with how little touch or sense of any commiseration, either Princely or so much as human, he hath sold away that justice so oft demanded, and so oft by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self acknowledg'd to be due for the bloud of more then 200000. of his Subjects, that never hurt him, never disobeyd him, assassina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and cut in pieces by those <hi>Irish</hi> Barbarians, to give the first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting, as is more then thought, to his own tyrannicall designes in <hi>England,</hi> will appeare by the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article of his peace; wherein without the least regard of Justice to avenge the dead, while he thirsts to be aveng'd upon the living, to all the Murders, Massacres, Treasons, Pyracies, from the very fatall day wherein that Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion first broke out, he grants an act of Oblivion. If this can be justified, or not punisht in whomsoever, while there is any faith, any Religion, any Justice upon Earth, there can no reason be alleg'd why all things are not list to confusion. And thus much be observd in brief concerning these Articles of peace made by the late King withhie <hi>Irish</hi> Rebells.</p>
            <p>The Letter of <hi>Ormond</hi> sent to Col. <hi>Jones</hi> Governour of <hi>Dublin,</hi> attempting his fidelity, which the discretion and true worth of that Gentleman hath so well answerd and repulst, had pass'd heer
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99462:27"/>
with out mention, but that the other part of it not content to doe the errand of Treason, roves into a long digression of evill and reproachfull language to the Parlament and Army of <hi>England.</hi> Which though not worth their notice, as from a Crew of Rebells whose inhumanities are long since become the hornour and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of all that heare them, yet in the pursuance of a good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, to give the world all due satisfaction of the present do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, no fit opportunity shall be omitted.</p>
            <p>He accuses first <hi>that we are the Subveters of true Religion, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors &amp; inviters not only of all false ones, but of irreligion &amp; atheism.</hi> An accusation that no man living could more unjustly use then our accuser himself; &amp; which without a strange besottednesse, he could not expect but to be retorted upon his own head. All men who are true Protestants, of which number he gives out to be one, know not a more immediate and killing Subverter of all true Religion then Antichrist, whom they generally believe to be the Pope and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> he therefore who makes peace with this grand Enemy and perscutor of the true Church, he who joynes with him, strengthens him, gives him root to grow up and spread his poyson, removing all opposition against him, granting him Schools, Abbeyes, and Revenues, Garrisons, Fortresses, Townes, as in so many of those Articles may be seen, he of all Protestants may be calld most justly the Subverter of true Religion, the Protector and inviter of irreligion and atheism, whether it be <hi>Ormond</hi> or his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. And if it can be no way prov'd, that the Parlament hath countenac'd Popery or Papists, but have every where brok'n their Temporall power, thrown down their public Superstitions, and confin'd them to the bare enjoyment of that which is not in our reach, their Consciences, if they have encouragd all true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Gospel, that is to say, afforded them favour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection in all places where they preacht; and although they think not money or Stipend to be the best encouragement of a true Pastor, yet therein also have not been wanting nor intend to be, they doubt not then to affirm themselves, not the Subverters, but the maintainers and defenders of true Religion; which of it self and by Consequence is the surest and the strongest Subversion, not onely of all false ones, but of irreligion and atheism. For <hi>the Weapons of that Warfare,</hi> as the Apostle testifies who best knew, <hi>are not carnall, but mighty through God to the pulling down of Strong Holds,</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:99462:27"/>
               <hi>and all reasonings, and every high thing exalted against the knowledge of God, surprising every thought unto the obedience of Christ, and easily revenging all disobedience,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. What Minister or Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that either understood his high calling, or sought not to erect a secular and carnall Tyranny over spirituall things, would neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect this ample and sublime power conferrd upon him, and come a begging to the weak hand of Magistracy for that kind of ayd which both the Magistrate hath no Commission to afford him, and in the way he seeks it hath been alwayes found helplesse and unprofitable. Neither is it unknown, or by wisest men unobser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'd, that the Church began then most apparently to degenerate, and goe to ruine, when shee borrow'd of the Civill power more then fair encouragement and protection; more then which Christ himself and his Apostles never requir'd. To say therefore that We protect and invite all false Religions, with irreligion also and atheism, because wee lend not or rather missapply not the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power to help out, though in vaine, the sloth, the spleen, the insufficiency of Church-men, in the execution of spirituall disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, over those within their Charge, or those without, is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation that may be layd as well upon the best regulated States and Governments through the World. Who have been so pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as never to imploy the Civill sword further then the edge of it could reach; that is, to Civill offences onely; proving alwayes against objects that were spirituall a ridiculous weapon. Our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection therefore to men in Civill matters unoffensive we cannot deny; their Consciences we leave, as not within our Cognisance, to the proper cure of instruction, praying for them. Neverthelesse, if any be found among us declar'd atheists, malicious enemies of God, and of Christ; The Parlament, I think, professes not to to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate such, but with all befitting endeavours to suppresse them. Otherwaies to protect none that in a larger sense may be tax'd of irreligion or atheism, may perhaps be the ready way to exclude none sooner out of protection, then those themselves that most accuse it to be so generall to others. Lastly, that we invite such as these, or incourage them, is a meer slander without proof.</p>
            <p>He tells us next that they have murderd the King. And they deny not to have justly and undauntedly, as became the Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England,</hi> for more bloudshed and other hainous Crimes then ever King of this Land was guilty of, after op'n tryall, punisht
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99462:28"/>
him with death. A matter which to men whose serious considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof hath left no certain precept, or example undebated, is so farr from giving offence, that wee implore and beseech the Divine Majesty so to uphold and support thir spirits with like fortitude and Magnanimity, that all thir ensuing actions may correspond and prove worthy that impartiall and noble peece of Justice, wherein the hand of God appear'd so evidently on our side. Wee shall not then need to feare what all the rout and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men basely principl'd can doe against us.</p>
            <p>The end of our proceedings, which he takes upon him to have discover'd; <hi>The changing</hi> forsooth <hi>of Monarchy into Anarchy,</hi> sounds so like the smattering of some raw Polititian, and the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worne objection of every triviall talker, that wee leave him in the number. But seing in that which followes he containes not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but contrary to what a Gentleman should know of Civility, proceeds to the contemptuous naming of a person, whose valour and high merit many enemies more noble then himself have both honour'd and feard, to assert his good name and reputation, of whose service the Common-wealth receaves so ample satisfaction, tis answerd in his behalf, that <hi>Cromwell</hi> whom he couples with a name of scorne, hath done in few yeares more eminent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Deeds whereon to <hi>found</hi> Nobility in his house, though it were wanting, and perpetuall Renown to posterity, then <hi>Ormond</hi> and all his Auncestors put together can shew from any record of thir <hi>Irish</hi> exploits, the widest scene of thir glory.</p>
            <p>He passes on in his groundless conjectures, that the aime of this Parlament may be perhaps to set up first an elective Kingdome, and after that a perfet Turkish tyranny. Of the former wee suppose the late act against Monarchy will suffice to acquitt them. Of the latter certainly there needed no other patterne then that Tyranny which was so long modelling by the late King himself, with <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and that arch Prelat of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> his chief Instruments; whose designes God hath dissipated. Neither is it any new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Monarchs, and their Courtiers in these dayes, though Christians they would be thought, to endeavour the introducing of a plain Turkish Tyranny. Witnesse that Consultation had in the Court of <hi>France</hi> under <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth at <hi>Blois,</hi> wherein <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet,</hi> a certain Court projector, brought in secretly by the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor <hi>Biragha,</hi> after many praises of the <hi>Otteman</hi> Government;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99462:28"/>
proposes means and wayes at large in presence of the King, the Queen Regent, and <hi>Anjou</hi> the Kings Brother, how with best ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, and least noyse the Turkish Tyranny might be set up in <hi>France.</hi> It appeares therefore that the designe of bringing in that Tyranny, is a Monarchicall designe, and not of those who have dissolvd Monarchy.</p>
            <p>As for Parlaments by three Estates, wee know that a Parlament signifies no more then the Supream and generall Councell of a Nation, consisting of whomsoever chos'n and assembld for the public good; which was ever practis'd, and in all sorts of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, before the word <hi>Parlament,</hi> or the formality, or the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of those three Estates, or such a thing as a Titular Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess had either name or being in the World. The Originall of all which we could produce to be farr newer then those <hi>all Ages</hi> which he vaunts of, and by such first invented and contriv'd, whose authority, though it were <hi>Charles Martell,</hi> stands not so high in our repute, either for himself, or the age he liv'd in, but that with as good warrant we may recede from what he ordain'd, as he ordaine what before was not.</p>
            <p>But whereas besides he is bold to allege that of the three Estates there remaines onely a small number, and they the <hi>Dreggs and Scum of the House of Commons,</hi> this reproach and in the mouth of an <hi>Irish</hi> Man concernes not them onely, but redounds to appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent dishonour of the whole <hi>English</hi> Nation. Doubtless there must be thought a great scarcity in <hi>England</hi> of persons honourable and deserving, or else of Judgement, or so much as honesty in the People, if those whom they esteem worthy to sit in Parlament be no better then Scum and Dreggs in the <hi>Irish</hi> Dialect. But of such like stuffe wee meet not any where with more excrescence then in his own lavish pen; which feeling it selfe loose without the reines of discretion, rambles for the most part beyond all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berness and Civility. In which Torrent he goes on negotiating and cheapning the Loyalty of our Faithfull Governour of <hi>Dublin,</hi> as if the known and Try'd Constancy of that valiant Gentleman were to be bought with Court fumes.</p>
            <p>He layes before him that <hi>there remaines now no other liberty in the Subject but to professe blasphemous opinions, to revile and tread underfoot Magistracy, to murther Magistrates, to oppresse and undoe all that are not like minded with us.</hi> Forgetting in the mean while himself to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99462:29"/>
be in the head of a mixt Rabble, part Papists, part Fugitives, and part Savages, guilty in the highest degree of all these Crimes. What more blasphemous not opinion but whole Religion then Popery, plung'd into Idolatrous and Ceremoniall Superstition, the very death of all true Religion; figur'd to us by the Scripture it selfe in the shape of that Beast, <hi>full of the names of Blasphemy,</hi> which wee mention to him as to one that would be counted Protestant, and had his breeding in the house of a Bishop. And who are those that have trod under foot Magistracy, murder'd Magistrates, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd &amp; undone all that syded not with them, but the Irish Rebels, in that horrible Conspiracy, for which <hi>Ormond</hi> himselfe hath ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther been or seem'd to be their enemy; though now their Ringlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And let him aske the Jesuitea about him whether it be not their known Doctrine and also practise, not by faire and due processe of Justice to punish Kings and Magistrates, which we disavow not, but to murder them in the basest and most assassinous manner, if thir Church-Interest so require. There will not need more words to this Windy Railer, convicted opnly of all those Crimes which he so confidently and yet falsely charges upon others.</p>
            <p>We have now to deale, though in the same Country, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother sort of Adversaries, in show farr different, in substance much what the same. These write themselves the Presbytery of <hi>Belfast,</hi> a place better known by the name of a late Barony, then by the same of these mens Doctrine or Ecclesiasticall Deeds; whose obscurity till now never came to our hearing. And surely wee should think this their Representment farr beneath considerable, who have neglected and past over the like unadvizednesse of their fellowes in other places more neer us, were it not to observe in some particulars the Sympathy, good Intelligence, and joynt pace which they goe in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> with their Copart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Rebels in the South, driving on the same Interest to loose us that Kingdome, that they may gaine it themselves, or at least share in the spoile: though the other be op'n enemies, these pretended Brethren</p>
            <p>The Introduction of their Manifest out of doubt must be Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; <hi>Their Duty,</hi> they say, <hi>to God and his people, over whom he hath made them Overseers, and for whom they must give accompt.</hi> What meane these men? is the Presbytery of <hi>Belfast,</hi> a small Town in <hi>Ulster,</hi> of so large extent that their voyces cannot serve to teach du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99462:29"/>
in the Congregation which they oversee, without spreading and divulging to all parts farr beyond the Diocesse of <hi>Patrick,</hi> or <hi>Columba,</hi> their writt'n Representation, under the suttle pretence of Feeding their owne Flock? Or doe they think to oversee or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to give an accomht for all to whom their paper sends gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting? St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Elders of <hi>Ephesus</hi> thinks it sufficient to give charge <hi>that they take heed to themselves and to the Flocke,</hi> over which they were made overseers; beyond those bounds hee inlarges not their Commission. And surely when we put down Bishops, and put up Presbyters, which the most of them have made use of to enrich and exalt themselvee, and turn the first heele against their Benefactors, we did not think that one Classick Fraternity so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and so remote, should involve us and all State affairs within the Censure and Jurisdiction of <hi>Belfast,</hi> upon pretence of oversee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own charge.</p>
            <p>Wee very well know that Church Censures are limited to Church matters, and these within the compasse of their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, or to say more truly of their own Congregation: that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of State are not for their Medling, as we could urge ev'n from their own Invectives and Protestations against the Bishops, wherein they tell them with much fervency, that Ministers of the Gospell, neither by that function nor by any other which they ought accept, have the least Warrant to be Pragmaticall in the State.</p>
            <p>And surely in vain were Bishops for these and other Causes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to fit and vote in the Hous, if these men out of the house, and without vote shall claim and be permitted more license on their Presbyteriall stooles, to breed continuall disturbance by interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in the Common Wealth. But seeing that now, since their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out the Prelats to heave in themselves, they devise new wayes to bring both ends together which will never meete, that is to say their former Doctrine with their present doings, as <hi>that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not else teach Magistrates and Subjects their duty, and that they have besides a Right themselves to speake as Members of the Common Wealth,</hi> Let them know that there is a wide difference between the generall exhortation to Justice and Obedience, which in this point is the utmost of their Duty, and the State disputes wherein they are now grown such busie Bodies, to preach of Titles, Interests, and alterations in government: more then our Saviour himselfe, or any

of his Apostles ever took upon them, though the Title both of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> and of <hi>Herod,</hi> and what they did in matters of State might have then admitted controversie anough.</p>
            <p>Next for their Civill Capacities, we are sure that Pulpits and Church-assemblies, whether Classicall or Provinciall, never were intended or allowd by wise Magistrates, no nor by him that sent them, to advance such purposes; but that as Members of the Common Wealth they ought to mixe with other Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and in that temporall Body to assume nothing above other Private persons, or otherwise then in a usuall and legall manner: not by distinct Remonstrances and representments, as if they were a Tribe and party by themselves, which is the next immediate way to make the Church lift a Horne against the State, and claim an absolute and undepending Jurisdiction, as from like advantage and occasion (to the trouble of all Christ'ndome) the Pope hath for many Ages done; and not only our Bishops were climing after him, but our Presbyters also, as by late experiment wee find. Of this Representation therefore wee can esteem and judge no other then of a slandrous and seditious libell, sent abroad by a fort of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries, to delude and make the better way under the cunning and plausible name of a Presbytery.</p>
            <p>A second Reason of thir Representing is, <hi>that they consider the dependance of that Kingdome upon England,</hi> which is another shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse untruth that ever they consider'd; as their own Actions will declare, by conniving, and in thir silence partaking with those in <hi>Ulster,</hi> whose obedience by what we have yet heard, stands dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and with an eye of Conformity rather to the North, then to that part where they owe thir subjection; and this in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood by the inducement and instigation of these Representers: who are so farr from considering thir dependence on <hi>England,</hi> as to presume at every word to terme proceedings of Parliament, <hi>the Insolencies of a Sectarian party, and of private men.</hi> Despising Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and speaking evill of Dignities, which hypocritically they would seeme to disswade others from; and not fearing the due cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of their Superiors, that may in fit season overtake them. When as the least consideration of their Dependance on <hi>England</hi> would have kept them better in their Duty.</p>
            <p>The third Reason which they use, makes against them; The remembrance how God punisht the contempt of their warning last
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:99462:30"/>
yeare upon the Breakers of Covnant, whenas the next year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they forget the warning of that punishment hanging over their own heads for the very same transgression, their manifest breach of Covnant by this seditious Representation accompanied with the doubtfull obedience of that Province which represents it.</p>
            <p>And thus we have their preface supported with three Reasons; two of them notorious falsities, and the third against themselves; and two examples, <hi>the Province of London,</hi> &amp; <hi>the Commissioners of the Kirk Assembly.</hi> But certain, if Canonicall examples bind not, much lesse doe Apocryphall.</p>
            <p>Proceeding to avouch the Trust put upon them by God, which is plainly prov'd to be none of this Nature, <hi>They would not be lookd upon as sowers of Sedition, or authors of divisive motions, their Record,</hi> they say, <hi>is in heaven,</hi> and their Truth and honesty no man knowes where. For is not this a shamelesse hypocrisie, and of meer wolves in sheeps cloathing, to sow sedition in the Eares of all men, and to face us downe in the very Act, that they are Authors of no such matter. But let the sequell both of their paper, and the obedience of the place wherein they are, determine.</p>
            <p>Nay while we are yet writing these things, and foretelling all men the rebellion which was eevn then design'd in the close pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of these unhallow'd Priestlings, at the very time when with thir lips they disclaim'd all sowing of sedition, newes is brought, and too true, that the <hi>Scottish</hi> Inhabitants of that Province are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually revolted, and have not only besieg'd in <hi>London-Derry</hi> those Forces which were to have fought against <hi>Ormond,</hi> and the Irish Rebels; but have in a manner declar'd with them, and begun op'n war against the Parlament; and all this by the incitement and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions of that unchristian Synagogue at <hi>Belfast,</hi> who yet dare charge the Parlament, <hi>that notwithstanding specious pretences, yet thir actings doe evidence that they love a rough garment to deceive.</hi> The Deceit we own not, but the Comparison, by what at first sight may seem alluded, we accept: For that hairy roughnesse assum'd won <hi>Jacob</hi> the Birthright both Temporall and Eternall; and God wee trust hath so dispos'd the mouth of these <hi>Balaams,</hi> that comming to Curse, they have stumbled into a kind of Blessing, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r'd our actings to the faithfull Act of that Patriarch.</p>
            <p>But if they mean, as more probably thir meaning was, that <hi>rough garment</hi> spok'n of <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. 4. We may then behold the pittiful
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99462:31"/>
store of learning, and theology, which these deceivers have thought sufficient to uphold their credit with the people, who, though the rancour that levens them have somewhat quickn'd the common drawling of thir Pulpit elocution, yet for want of stock anough in Scripture-phrase to serve the necessary uses of thir malice, they are become so liberall, as to part freely with their own budge gownes from off their backs, and bestow them on the Magistrate as <hi>a rough garment</hi> to deceive; rather then not be furnish'd with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach though never so improper, never so obvious to be turn'd upon themselves. For but with half an eye cast upon that text, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man will soon discern that <hi>rough garment</hi> to be thir own coate, thir own livery, the very badge and cognisance of such false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets as themselves. Who, when they understand, or ever serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mind the beginning of that 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> verse, may <hi>be asham'd every one of his lying vision,</hi> and may justly fear that foregoing denouncement to such <hi>as speak lies in the name of the Lord,</hi> vers. 3. lurking under the <hi>rough garment</hi> of outward rigor and formality, whereby they cheat the simple. So that <hi>this rough garment to deceiv</hi> we bring ye once again, Grave Sirs, into your own Vestry; or with <hi>Zachary</hi> shall not think much to fit it to your own shoulders. To bestow ought in good earnest on the Magistrate, we know your clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sic Priestship is too gripple, for yee are alwayes begging: and for this rough gown to deceav, we are confident yee cannot spare it; it is your Sundays gown, your every day gown, your only gown, the gown of your faculty; your divining gowne; to take it from ye were sacrilege. Weare it therfore, &amp; possesse it your selvs, most grave and reverend Carmelites, that all men both young and old, as we hope they will shortly, may yet better know ye and distinguish ye by it; and give to your rough gown where ever they meete it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Pulpit, Classis, or Provincial Synod, the precedency, and the pre-eminence of deceaving.</p>
            <p>They charge us next that we have brokn the Cov'nant, &amp; loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d'n it with slighting Reproaches. For the reproaching, let them answer that are guilty, wherof the State we are sure cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd. For the breaking, let us hear wherin. <hi>In labouring</hi> say they, <hi>to establish by Law a universall tolleration of all Religions,</hi> This tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches not the State; for certainly were they so minded, they need not labour it, but do it, having power in thir hands; and we know of no act as yet past to that purpose. But suppose it done, wherin is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99462:31"/>
the Covnant broken. The Covnant enjoyns us to endeavor the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation first of Popery and Prelacy, then of Heresy, Schism, and prophaness, and whatsoever shall be found contrary to sound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin and the power of godliness. And this we ceas not to do by all effectuall and proper means: But these Divines might know, that to extirpat all these things can be no work of the Civil sword, but of the spirituall which is the Word of God.</p>
            <p>No man well in his wits endeavoring to root up weeds out of his ground, instead of using the spade will take a Mallet or a Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Nor doth the <hi>Covnant</hi> any way engage us to extirpate, or to prosecute the men, but the heresies and errors in them, which we tell these Divines and the rest that understand not, belongs chiefly to their own Function, in the diligent preaching and insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon sound Doctrin, in the confuting not the railing down er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, encountring both in public and private Conference, and by the power of truth, not of persecution, subduing those authors of hereticall opinions, &amp; lastly in the spirituall execution of Church discipline within thir own congregations. In all these ways wee shall assist them, favour them, and as far as appertains to us joyn with them, and moreover not tolerate the free exercise of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which shall be found absolutely contrary to sound Doctrin or the power of godliness; for the conscience we must have pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence till it be within our verge. And thus doing we shall believ to have kept exactly all that is requird from us by the <hi>Covnant.</hi> Whilst they by thir seditious practises against us, then which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the present can adde more assistance or advantage to those bloudy Rebels and Papists in the South, will be found most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Covnant breakers themselves, and as deep in that guilt as those of thir own Nation the last year; the warning of whose ill successe like men hardn'd for the same judgment, they miserably pervert to an incouragement in the same offence, if not a fat worse; For now they have joyn'd interest with the <hi>Irish Rebels,</hi> who have ever fought against the <hi>Covnant,</hi> wheras thir Country-men the year before made the <hi>Covnant</hi> thir plea. But as it is a peculiar mercy of God to his people, while they remain his, to preserve them from wicked confederations: so it is a mark and punishment of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites to be drivn at length to mix thir cause, and the interest of thir <hi>Covnant</hi> with Gods enemies.</p>
            <p>And wheras they affirm that the tolerating of all Religions in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99462:32"/>
the manner that we tolerat them, is an innovation, we must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them that we are able to make it good if need be, both by Scripture and the Primitive Fathers, and the frequent assertion of whole Churches and Protestant States in thir Remonstrances and expostulations against the Popish tyranny over souls. And what force of argument do these Doctors bring to the contrary? But we have long observ'd to what passe the bold ignorance and sloth of our Clergy tends no less now then in the Bishops days, to make thir bare sayings and censures authentic with the People, though destitute of any proofe or argument. But thanks be to God they are discern'd.</p>
            <p>Thir next impeachment is, <hi>that we oppose the Presbyteriall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the hedg and bulwark of Religion.</hi> Which all the Land knows to be a most impudent falshood, having establishd it with all free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, wherever it hath been desir'd. Nevertheless as we perceave it aspiring to be a compulsive power upon all without exception in Parochiall, Classicall, and Provinciall Hierarchies, or to require the fleshly arm of Magistracy in the execution of a spirituall Discipline, to punish and amerce by any corporall infliction those whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences cannot be edifi'd by what authority they are compell'd, we hold it no more to be <hi>the hedg and bulwark of Religion,</hi> than the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish and Prelaticall Courts, or the <hi>Spanish Inquisition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we are told, <hi>We imbrace Paganism and Judaism in the arms of toleration.</hi> A most audacious calumny. And yet while we detest <hi>Judaism,</hi> we know our selves commanded by St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 11. to respect the <hi>Jews,</hi> and by all means to endeavor thir conversion.</p>
            <p>Neither was it ever sworn in the <hi>Covnant</hi> to maintain a universal Presbytery in <hi>England,</hi> as they falsly allege, but in <hi>Scotland</hi> against the Common Enemy, if our aid were calld for: being left free to reform our own Country according to the Word of God, and the example of best reformed Churches; from which rule we are not yet departed.</p>
            <p>But heer utterly forgetting to be Ministers of the Gospel, they presume to op'n their mouths not <hi>in the spirit of meeknesse,</hi> as like dissemblers they pretend, but with as much devillish malice, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and falshood as any Irish Rebell could have utter'd; and from a barbarous <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ook of <hi>Ireland</hi> brand us with the extirpation of laws and liberties; things which they seem as little to understand as ought that belongs to good letters or humanity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:99462:32"/>
               <hi>That wee seisd on the person of the King.</hi> Who was surrendred into our hands an Enemy and Captive by our own subordinate and paid Army of <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> Next <hi>our imprisoning many Members of the House.</hi> As if it were impossible they should deserve it, conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and banding against the public good; which to the other part appearing, and, with the power they had, not resisting, had bin a manifest desertion of thir trust and duty. No question but it is as good and necessary to expell rott'n Members out of the House, as to banish Delinquents out of the Land: and the reason holds as well in forty as in five. And if they be yet more, the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous is thir number. They had no privilege to fit there and vote home the author, the impenitent author of all our miseries to free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, honour, and royalty, for a few fraudulent if not destructive concessions. Which that they went about to doe, how much more clear it was to all men, so much the more expedient, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to the Common-wealth was their speedy seisure and exclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and no breach of any just privilege, but a breach of their knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted faction. And heer they cry out, <hi>An action without parallel in any age.</hi> So heartily we wish all men were unprejudic'd in all our actions, as these illiterat denouncers never parallelld so much of any age as would contribute to the tithe of a Century. <hi>That wee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolish Parlamentary power, and establish a representative instead thereof.</hi> Now we have the hight of them; these profound Instructors in the midst of thir Representation, would know the <hi>English</hi> of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative, and were perhaps of that Classis, who heretofore were as much staggerd at <hi>Trienniall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thir grand accusation is our Justice don on the King, which that they may prove to be <hi>without rule or example,</hi> they venture all the credit they have in divine and human history; and by the same desperate boldness detect themselves to be egregious liars and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postors, seeking to abuse the multitude with a show of that gravity and learning which never was their portion. Had thir knowledge bin equall to the knowledge of any stupid Monk, or Abbot, they would have known at least, though ignorant of all things else, the life and acts of him, who first instituted thir order: but these blockish Presbyters of <hi>Clandeboy</hi> know not that <hi>John Knox,</hi> who was the first founder of Presbytery in <hi>Scotland,</hi> taught professedly the doctrine of deposing, and of killing Kings. And thus while
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99462:33"/>
they deny that any such rule can be found, the rule is found in their own Country, givn them by thir own first presbyterian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutor; and they themselves like irregular Friers walking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the rule of thir own foundation, deserv for so grosse an ignorance and transgression to be disciplin'd upon thir own stools. Or had thir reading in history bin any, which by this we may be confident is none at all, or thir malice not highth'n'd to a blind rage, they never would so rashly have thrown the dice to a palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble discovery of thir ignorance and want of shame. But wherefore spend we two such pretious things as time &amp; reason upon Priests, the most prodigal mis-spenders of time, and the scarsest owners of reason? Tis sufficient we have publishd our defences, giv'n reasons, giv'n examples of our Justice don; books also have bin writt'n to the same purpose for men to look on that will; that no Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heav'n but in one age or other hath don the like. The difference onely is, which rather seemes to us matter of glory, that they for the most part have without form of Law don the deed by a kinde of martial Justice; wee by the deliberate and well-weighd Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a legal Judicature.</p>
            <p>But they tell us, <hi>It was against the interest and protestation of the Kingdom of Scotland.</hi> And did exceeding well to joyn those two together: heerby informing us what credit or regard need be givn in <hi>England</hi> to a <hi>Scotch</hi> Protestation; usherd in by a <hi>Scotch</hi> interest: certainly no more then we see is givn in <hi>Scotland</hi> to an <hi>English</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, declaring the interest of <hi>England.</hi> If then our interest move not them, why should theirs move us? If they say, wee are not all <hi>England;</hi> we reply they are not all <hi>Scotland:</hi> nay, were the last year so inconsiderable a part of <hi>Scotland</hi> as were beholding to this which they now term the Sectarian Army, to defend and res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue them at the charges of <hi>England</hi> from a stronger party of thir own Countrymen, in whose esteem they were no better then Sectarians themselves. But they add, <hi>It was against the former De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of both Kingdomes,</hi> to seize, or proceed against the King. We are certain that no such Declarations of both Kingdomes as derive not thir full force from the sense and meaning of the Cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, can be produc'd.</p>
            <p>And if they plead against us the Covenant, <hi>To preserve and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his person;</hi> we aske them briefly whether they take the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99462:33"/>
to be absolute or conditionall? If absolute, then suppose the King to have committed all prodigious crimes and impieties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, or nature, or whole Nations, he must neverthelesse be sacred from all violent touch. Which absurd opinion, how it can live in any mans reason, either naturall or rectifi'd, wee much marvell: Since God declard his anger as impetuous for the saving of King <hi>Benhadad,</hi> though surrendring himselfe at mercy, as for the killing of <hi>Naboth.</hi> If it be conditionall, in the preservation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Religion, and the peoples libertie, then certainly to take away his life beeing dangerous, and pernicious to both these, was no more a breach of the Covnant, then for the same reason at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburrow</hi> to behead <hi>Gordon</hi> the Marquess <hi>Huntley.</hi> By the same Covnant we made vow to assist and to defend all those that should enter with us into this league: not absolutely but in the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and pursuing thereof. If therefore no man else ever were so madd as to claime from hence an impunitie from all Justice, why should any for the King? Whose life by other Articles of the same Covnant was forfet. Nay if common sense had not led us to such a cleer interpretation, the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commissioners themselves might boast to have bin our first teachers: who when they drew to the malignance which brought forth that perfidious last years irrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against all the bands of Covnant or Christian neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, making thir hollow plea the defence of his Majesties person, they were constraind by thir own guiltinesse to leave out that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing morsell that would have choakd them, the <hi>preservation and defence of true Religion, and our liberties.</hi> And questionless in the preservation of these, wee are bound as well, both by the Cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and before the Covnant, to preserve and defend the person of any private man, and the person and authoritie of any inferior Magistrate: So that this Article objected with such vehemence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, containes not an exception of the Kings person, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie to doe by privilege what wickedness he list, and be defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as som fancy, but an express testification of our Loyaltie, and the plaine words without wresting will beare as much, that wee had no thoughts against his person, or just power, provided they might confist with the preservation and defence of true Religion and our liberties. But to these how hazardous his life was, will be needless to repeat so oftn. It may suffice that while he was in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:99462:34"/>
custody, where wee expected his repentance, his remorse at last and compassion of all the innocent bloud shed already and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after likely to be shed for his meer wilfulness, he made no other use of our continuall forbearance, our humblest Petitions and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations at his feet, but to sit contriving and somenting new plots against us, and as his own phrase was, <hi>playing his own game,</hi> upon the miseries of his people: Of which wee desire no other view at present then these Articles of peace with the Rebells, and the rare game likely to ensue from such a cast of his Cards. And then let men reflect a little upon the slanders and reviles of these wretched Priests, and judge what modesty, what truth, what conscience, what any thing fit for Ministers, or wee might say reasonable men can harbour in them. For what they began in shamelesness and malice, they conclude in frenzie: throwing out a sudden rapsody of Proverbs quite from the purpose; and with as much comliness as when <hi>Saul</hi> propheci'd. For casting off, as he did his garments, all modestie and meekness wherewith the language of Ministers ought to be cloath'd, speaking especially to thir supreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, they talke at random of <hi>servants raigning, servants riding, and wonder how the Earth can beare them.</hi> Either those men imagin themselves to be marvellously high set and exalied in the chaire of <hi>Belfast,</hi> to voutsafe the Parlament of <hi>England</hi> no better stile then <hi>servants,</hi> or els thir high notion, which wee rather beleeve, falls as low as Court parasitism; supposing all men to be servants, but the King. And then all thir paines tak'n to seem so wise in proverbing, serves but to conclude them down right slaves: and the edge of thir own proverb falls reverse upon themselves. For as <hi>Delight is not seemly for fooles,</hi> much less high words to come from base minds. What they are for Ministers, or how they crept into the fould, whether at the window, or through the wall, or who set them there so haughtie in the Pontificall See of <hi>Belfast,</hi> wee know not. But this wee rather have cause to wonder if the Earth can beare this unsufferable insolency of upstarts; who from a ground which is not thir own dare send such defiance to the sovran Magistracy of <hi>England,</hi> by whose autoritie and in whose right they inhabit there. By thir actions we might rather judge them to be a generation of High-land theevs and Red-shanks, who beeing neighbourly admitted, not as the <hi>Saxons</hi> by merit of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:99462:34"/>
thir warfare against our enemies, but by the courtesie of <hi>England</hi> to hold possessions in our Province, a Countrey better then thir own, have, with worse faith then those Heathen, prov'd ingratefull and treacherous guests to thir best friends and entertainers. And let them take heed, lest while thir Glence, as to these matters, might have kept them blameless and secure under those proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which they so feard to partake in, that these thir treasonous attempts and practices, have not involv'd them in a farr worse guilt of rebellion; and (notwithstanding that faire dehortatory from joyning with Malignants) in the appearance of a co-interest and partaking with the <hi>Irish</hi> Rebells. Against whom, though by themselves pronouncd to be the enemies of God, they goe not out to battell, as they ought, but rather by these thir doings assist and become associats.</p>
