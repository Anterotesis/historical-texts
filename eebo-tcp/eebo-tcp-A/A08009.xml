            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I am a Goose or a Ghost at least; for what with turmoyle of getting my fooles apparell, and care of being perfit, I am sure I haue not yet supt to night. <hi>Will Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> Ghost I should be, come to present you with <hi>Summers</hi> last will, and Testament. Be it so, if my cousin <hi>Ned</hi> will lend me his Chayne and his Fiddle. Other stately pac't <hi>Prologues</hi> vse to attire themselues within: I that haue a toy in my head, more then ordinary, and vse to goe without money, without garters, without girdle, without a hat-band, without poynts to my hose, without a knife to my dinner, and make so much vse of this word <hi>without,</hi> in euery thing, will here dresse me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. <hi>Dick Huntley</hi> cryes, Begin, begin: and all the whole house, For shame come away; when I had my things but now brought me out of the <hi>Lawndry.</hi> God forgiue me, I did not see my Lord before. Ile set a good face on it, as though what I had talkt idly all this while, were my part. So it is, <hi>boni viri,</hi> that one foole presents another; and I a foole by nature, and by arte, do speake to you in the person of the Idiot our Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker. He like a Foppe &amp; an Asse, must be making himselfe a publike laughing stock, &amp; haue no thanke for his labor; where other <hi>Magisterij,</hi> whose inuention is farre more exquisite, are content to sit still, and doe nothing.

scuruy <hi>Prologue</hi> he had made me in an old vayne of similitudes: if you bee good fellowes, giue it the hearing, that you may iudge of him thereafter.</p>
            <p>The Prologue.</p>
            <p>AT a solemne feast of the <hi>Triumuiri</hi> in Rome, it was seene and obserued, that the birds ceased to sing, &amp; sate solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie on the house tops, by reason of the sight of a paynted Serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t set openly to view. So fares it with vs nouices, that here betray our imperfections: we, afraid to looke on the imaginary serpent of Enuy, paynted in mens affections, haue ceased to tune any musike of mirth to your eares this tweluemonth, thinking, that as it is the nature of the serpent to hisse: so childhood and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance would play the goslings, contemning, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what they vnderstood not. Their censures we wey not, whose sences are not yet vnswadled. The little minutes will be continually striking, though no man regard them. Whelpes will barke, before they can see, and striue to byte, before they haue teeth. <hi>Politianus</hi> speaketh of a beast, who, while hee is cut on the table, drinketh, and represents the motions &amp; voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a liuing creature. Such like foolish beasts are we, who, whilest we are cut, mocked, &amp; flowted at, in euery mans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon talke, will notwithstanding proceed to shame our selues, to make sport. No man pleaseth all, we seeke to please one. <hi>Didymus</hi> wrote foure thousand bookes, or as some say, six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, of the arte of <hi>Grammar.</hi> Our Authour hopes, it may be as lawfull for him to write a thousand lines of as light a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect. <hi>Socrates</hi> (whom the Oracle pronounced the wisest man of Greece) sometimes daunced. <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Lelius</hi> by the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side played at peeble-stone. <hi>Semel insaniuimus omnes.</hi> Euery man cannot, with <hi>Archimedes,</hi> make a heauen of brasse, or dig gold out of the iron mynes of the lawe. Such odde trifles, as Mathematicians experiments be, Artificiall flyes to hang in the ayre by themselues, daunsing balles, an egge-shell that shall clyme vp to the top of a speare, fiery breathing goares, <hi>Poetae noster</hi> professeth not to make. <hi>Placeat sibi quis<expan>

Moralizers, you that wrest a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer meant meaning, out of euery thing, applying all things to the present time, keepe your attention for the common Stage: for here are no quips in Characters for you to reade. Vayne glozers, gather what you will. Spite, spell backwards, what thou canst. As the <hi>Parthians</hi> fight, flying away: so will wee prate and talke, but stand to nothing that we say.</p>
            <p>How say you, my masters, doe you not laugh at him for a Coxcombe? Why, he hath made a <hi>Prologue</hi> longer then his Play: nay, 'tis no Play neyther, but a shewe. Ile be sworne, the sigge of Rowlands God-sonne, is a Gyant in comparison of it. What can be made of Summers last will &amp; Testament? Such another thing, as <hi>Cyllian</hi> of <hi>Braynfords</hi> will, where shee bequeathed a score of farts amongst her friends. Forsooth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the plague raignes in most places in this latter end of sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Summer must come in sicke: he must call his officers to account, yeeld his throne to Autumne, make Winter his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutour, with tittle tattle Tom boy: God giue you good night in Watling street. I care not what I say now: for I play no more then you heare; &amp; some of that you heard to (by your leaue) was extempore. He were as good haue let me had the best part: for Ile be reueng'd on him to the vttermost, in this person of <hi>Will Summer,</hi> which I haue put on to play the <hi>Prologue,</hi> and meane not to put off, till the play be done. Ile sit as a <hi>Chorus,</hi> and flowte the <hi>Actors</hi> and him at the end of euery Sceane: I know they will not interrupt me, for feare of marring of all: but looke to your cues, my masters; for I intend to play the knaue in cue, and put you besides all your parts, if you take not the better heede. <hi>Actors,</hi> you Rogues, come away, cleare your throats, blowe your noses, and wype your mouthes e're you enter, that you may take no occasion to spit or to cough, when you are <hi>non plus.</hi> And this I barre ouer and besides, That none of you stroake your beardes, to make action, play with your cod-piece poynts, or sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d fumbling on your buttom, when you know not how to bestow your fingers. Serue God, and act cleanly; a fit of mirth, and an old song first, if you will.</p>

               <p>Tell me, I pray, wherefore was gold layd vnder our feete in the veynes of the earth, but that wee should contemne it, and treade vpon it, and so consequently treade thrift vnder our feete? It was not knowne, till the Iron age, <hi>donec facinus inuasit mortales,</hi> as the Poet sayes; and the Scythians alwayes detested it. I will proue it, that an vnthrift, of any, comes nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest a happy man, in so much as he comes neerest to beggery. Cicero saith, <hi>summum bonum</hi> consistes in <hi>omnium rerum vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,</hi> that it is the chiefest felicitie that may be, to rest from all labours. Now, who doeth so much <hi>vacare à rebus,</hi> who rests so much? who hath so little to doe, as the begger? Who can sing so merry a note, as he that cannot change a groate? <hi>Cui nil est, nil deest:</hi> hee that hath nothing, wants nothing. On the other side, it is said of the Carle, <hi>Omnia habeo, nec quicquam habeo:</hi> I haue all things, yet want euery thing. <hi>Multi mihi vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio vertunt, quia egeo,</hi> saith Marcus Cato in Aulus Gellius, <hi>at ego illis, quia nequeunt egere:</hi> Many vpbrayde me, sayth he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I am poore: but I vpbrayd them, because they cannot liue if they were poore.

It is not so much subiect to inordinate desires, as wealth or prosperity. <hi>Non habet vnde suum paupertas pascat amorem:</hi> pouerty hath not wherewithall to feede lust. All the Poets were beggers: all Alcumists, and all Philosophers are beggers: <hi>Omnia mea me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum porto,</hi> quoth Bias, when he had nothing, but bread and cheese in a letherne bagge, and two or three bookes in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.

               <p>Fye, fye of honesty, fye: Solstitium is an asse, perdy, this play is a gally-maufrey: fetch mee some drinke, some body. What cheere, what cheere, my hearts? are not you thirsty with liftening to this dry sport? What haue we to doe with scales, and hower-glasses, except we were Bakers, or Clock-keepers? I cannot tell how other men are addicted, but it is against my profession to vse any scales, but such as we play at with a boule, or keepe any howers, but dinner or supper. It is a pedanticall thing, to respect times and seasons: if a man be drinking with good fellowes late, he must come home, for feare the gates be shut; when I am in my warme bed, I must rise to prayers, because the bell rings. I like no such foolish customes. Actors, bring now a black Iack, and a rundlet of of Renish wine, disputing of the antiquity of red noses; let the prodigall childe come out in his dublet and hose all greasy, his shirt hanging forth, and ne're a penny in his purse, and talke what a fine thing it is to walke summerly, or sit whistling vnder a hedge and keepe hogges. Go forward in grace and vertue to proceed; but let vs haue no more of these graue matters.</p>

               <p>I thinke the Sunne is not so long in passing through the twelue signes, as the sonne of a foole hath bin dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting here, about had I wist.

If I can tell what it meanes, pray god, I may neuer get breakefast more, when I am hungry. Troth, I am of opinion, he is one of those <hi>Hieroglificall</hi> writers, that by the figures of beasts, planets, and of stones, expresse the mind, as we doe in A. B. C. or one that writes vnder hayre, as I haue heard of a certaine Notary <hi>Histions,</hi> who following <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> in the Persian warres, and desirous to disclose some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of import, to his friend <hi>Aristagoras,</hi> that dwelt afarre off, found out this meanes: He had a seruant that had bene
<pb facs="tcp:10617:11"/>
long sicke of a payne in his eyes, whom, vnder pretence of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his maladie, he shau'd from one side of his head, to the other, and with a soft pensill wrote vpon his scalpe, (as on parchment) the discourse of his busines, the fellow all the while imagining, his master had done nothing but noynt his head with a feather. After this, hee kept him secretly in his tent, till his hayre was somewhat growne, and then wil'd him to go to <hi>Aristagoras</hi> into the countrey, and bid him shaue him, as he had done, and he should haue perfit remedie. He did so: <hi>Aristagoras</hi> shau'd him with his owne hands, read his friends letter; and when hee had done, washt it out, that no man should perceyue it else, and sent him home to buy him a night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap. If I wist there were any such knauery, or Peter Bales <hi>Brachigraphy,</hi> vnder <hi>Sols</hi> bushy hayre, I would haue a Barber, my hoste of the Murrions head, to be his Interpretour, who would whet his rasor on his Richmond cap, and giue him the terrible cut, like himselfe, but he would come as neere as a quart pot, to the construction of it.

               <l>They heare, they smell, they see better then we,</l>
               <l>To come to speech they haue it questionlesse,</l>
               <l>Although we vnderstand them not so well:</l>
               <l>They barke as good old Saxon as may be,</l>
               <l>And that in more varietie then we:</l>
               <l>For they haue one voice when they are in chase,</l>
               <l>Another, when they wrangle for their meate,</l>
               <l>Another, when we beate them out of dores.</l>
               <l>That they haue reason, this I will alleadge,</l>
               <l>They choose those things that are most fit for them,</l>
               <l>And shunne the contrarie all that they may,</l>
               <l>They know what is for their owne diet best,</l>
               <l>And seeke about for't very carefully.</l>
               <l>At sight of any whip they runne away,</l>
               <l>As runs a thiefe from noise of hue and crie:</l>
               <l>Nor liue they on the sweat of others browes,</l>

               <l>Hunting and conie-catching, two fine artes:</l>
               <l>Yea, there be of them as there be of men,</l>

               <l>Some cariers, and they fetch, some watermen,</l>
               <l>And they will diue and swimme when you bid them:</l>
               <l>Some butchers, and they worrie sheep by night:</l>

                  <hi>Chrisippus</hi> holds, dogs are Logicians,</l>

Eyther he went this, that, or yonder way,</l>
               <l>But neyther that, nor yonder, therefore this:</l>
               <l>But whether they Logicians be or no,</l>
               <l>Cinicks they are, for they will snarle and bite,</l>
               <l>Right courtiers to flatter and to fawne,</l>
               <l>Valiant to set vpon the enemies,</l>
               <l>Most faithfull and most constant to their friends;</l>
               <l>Nay they are wise, as <hi>Homer</hi> witnesseth,</l>

               <l>They are ne're sicke, but they know their disease,</l>

               <l>They traile one of their feet vpon the ground,</l>
               <l>And gnaw the flesh about where the wound is,</l>
               <l>Till it be cleane drawne out: and then, because</l>
               <l>Vlcers and sores kept fowle, are hardly cur'de,</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>The onely medicine for the foote, is rest:</hi>

               <l>For if they haue the least hurt in their feet,</l>
               <l>They beare them vp, and looke they be not stird:</l>

Can you make proofe where euer I sold away my conscience, or pawnd it? doe you know who would buy it, or lend any money vpon it? I thinke I haue giuen you the pose; blow your nose, master constable.

A mans belly was not made for a poudring beefe tub: to feede the poore twelue dayes, &amp; let them starue all the yeare after, would but stretch out the guts wider then they should be, &amp; so make famine a bigger den in their bellies, then he had before.

               <hi>VLisses</hi> a Dwarffe, and the prolocutor for the <hi>Graecians,</hi> gaue me leaue that am a Pigmee, to doe an Embassage to you from the Cranes: Gentlemen (for Kings are no better) certaine humble Animals, called our Actors, commend them vnto you; who, what offence they haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, I know not (except it be in purloyning some houres out of times treasury, that might haue beene better imployde; but by me (the agent for their imperfections) they humbly craue pardon, if happily some of their termes haue trodde awrye, or their tongues slumbled vnwittingly on any mans content. In much Corne is some Cockle; in a heape of coyne heere and there a peece of Copper; wit hath his dregs as well as wine; words their waste, Inke his blots, euery speech his Parenthesis, Poetical fury, as well Crabbes as Sweetings for his Summer fruites. <hi>Nemo sapit omnibus horis.</hi> Their folly is deceased, their feare is yet liuing. Nothing can kill an Asse but colde: colde entertainement, discouraging scoffes, authorized disgraces, may kill a whole litter of young Asses of them heere at once, that haue traueld thus farre in impudence, onely in hope to sit a sunning in your smiles. The Romanes dedicated a Temple to the feuer quartane, thinking it some great God, because it shooke them so: and another, to Ill fortune in <hi>Exquilliis</hi> a Mountaine in Roome, that it should not plague them at Cardes and Dice. Your Graces frownes are to them shaking feuers, your least disfauours, the greatest ill fortune that may betide them. They can builde no Temples, but themselues and their best indeuours, with all prostrate reuerence, they here dedicate and offer vp, wholy to your seruice. <hi>Sis bonus, O faelixque tuis.</hi> To make the gods merry, the coelestiall clowne <hi>Vulcan</hi> tun'de his polt foote, to the measures of <hi>Apolloes</hi> Lute, and daunst a limping Gallyard in <hi>Ioues</hi> starrie hall.

To make you merry that are the Gods of Art, and guides vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen, a number of rude <hi>Vulcans,</hi> vnweldy speakers, ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-headed clownes (for so it pleaseth them in modestie to name themselues) haue set their deformities to view, as it were in a daunce here before you. Beare with their wants, lull me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie asleepe with their absurdities, and expect hereafter better fruites of their industrie. Little creatures often terrifie great beasts: the Elephant flyeth from a Ramme, the Lyon from a Cock and from fire; the Crocodile from all Sea-fish, the Whale from the noyse of parched bones; light toyes chase great cares. The greatfoole <hi>Toy</hi> hath marde the play: Good night, Gentlemen; I go, let him be carryed away.</p>
