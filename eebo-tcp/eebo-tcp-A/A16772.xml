            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <l>Now doe I curse the time I euer went</l>
               <l>In sinnes blacke path, that leadeth to damnation:</l>
               <l>Now do I hate the houres, I haue misse-spent</l>
               <l>In ydle vice, neglecting soules saluation,</l>
               <l>And to redeeme the time I haue mis-worne;</l>
               <l>I wish this houre, I were againe new borne.</l>

But vaine it is, as saith the wisest man,</l>
               <l>To call againe the day that once is past,</l>
               <l>O let me see what best is for me than,</l>
               <l>To gaine thy fauour whil'st my life doth last;</l>
               <l>That in the next I may but worthy be,</l>
               <l>Eu'n in the meanest place to waite on thee.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I will, as did the prodigall sonne sometime,</l>
               <l>Vpon my knees with harty true contrition,</l>
               <l>And Weeping eies, confesse my former crime,</l>
               <l>And humbly begge vpon my low submission,</l>
               <l>That thou wilt not of former faults detect me,</l>
               <l>But like a louing father now respect me.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Or, as the wife that hath her husband wronged,</l>
               <l>So wil I come with feare and blushing cheeke:</l>
               <l>For giuing others what to thee belonged;</l>
               <l>And say, My King, my Lord, and Spouse most meeke,</l>
               <l>I haue defil'd the bed that thou didst owe;</l>
               <l>Forgiue me this, it shall no more be so.</l>

Yet, for the world can witnes mine abuse,</l>
               <l>Ile hide my face from face that witcht mine eies;</l>
               <l>These gracelesse eies, that had my bodies vse,</l>
               <l>Till it be withred with my verie cries:</l>
               <l>That when my wrinckles shall my sorrowes tell,</l>
               <l>The world may say, I ioy'd not, though I fell.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And thus will I, in sorrowing spend my breath,</l>
               <l>And spot my face with neuer-dying teares,</l>
               <l>Till aged wrinckles messengers of death</l>
               <l>Haue purchasde mercy, and remou'd my feares:</l>
               <l>And then the world within my lookes shall read,</l>
               <l>The piteous wracke vnbrideled sinne hath bred.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And that which was a pleasure to beholde,</l>
               <l>Shalbe to me an euer-griping paine;</l>
               <l>All my misdeedes shall one and one be tolde,</l>
               <l>That I may see what tyrants haue mee slaine:</l>
               <l>And when I haue thus mustred them apart,</l>
               <l>I will display on each a bleeding hart.</l>
            </lg>

And lest my teares should faile me at most need,</l>
               <l>Before the face of faith Ile fix my Sauiours passion;</l>
               <l>And see how his most pretious side did bleed,</l>
               <l>And note his death and torments in such fashion;</l>
               <l>As neuer man the like did vndertake,</l>
               <l>For freely he hath done it for my sake.</l>

               <l>If this his kindenesse and his mercy showne,</l>
               <l>Cannot prouoke me vnto tender crying;</l>
               <l>Then will I backe againe turne to mine owne,</l>
               <l>Mine owne sinne, cause of this his cruell dying:</l>
               <l>And if for them no teares mine eies can find,</l>
               <l>Sighs shal cause tears, tears make my poore eies blind.</l>

               <l>No farre fetcht story haue I now brought home,</l>
