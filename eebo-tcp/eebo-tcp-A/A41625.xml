         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Anſwerer in his laſt ſeems to take
his leave of me; <hi>And thus</hi> (ſays he,
p. 30.) <hi>I take a fair leave of the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter.</hi>
But me-thinks, if he be not
gone too far, I would fain have a word
or two with him before we part. And
'tis chiefly in civility to ask him, How
he does? For throughout his laſt Reply, he ſeems ſick of
Anſwering, having ſaid but very little throughout the
whole; and yet aſſuring his Reader, he <hi>has driven the
matter as far as it will go,</hi> (p. ib.) Well, and is there no
more then to be ſaid, to that manifold Charge ſumm'd
up againſt the <hi>Church of England</hi> in my laſt Diſcourſe?
Is that matter driven as far as it will go? I there drew out
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65448:3"/>
a Character of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as lying under
the ſame Charge of Scandals, Innovation, and Idolatry
from a <hi>Diſſenter,</hi> as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does generally
from <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> And almoſt every Point urg'd with the
ſame Proofs of <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reaſons,</hi> which Proteſtants
produce againſt the Papiſts. And all this he paſſes over
with a light touch, and the moſt artificial way of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
with ſaying nothing, as can poſſibly be met
with.</p>
            <p>And firſt, tho' amongſt the many Diviſions of <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
there are ſeveral, from whom the whole Charge
might forcibly be urg'd, as the <hi>Rigid Anabaptiſts,</hi> the
<hi>Quakers, &amp;c.</hi> yet becauſe this would oblige him to anſwer
all the Arguments, and to ſhew, they are not of equal
force againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as againſt the <hi>Papiſts;</hi>
he upon good conſideration, takes it as ſpoken from ſuch
a kind of Diſſenter, which agreeing in many of the Points
with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> cannot reaſonably be thought
to urge them againſt her. And ſo inſtead of giving them
any farther Anſwer, he comes off with, <hi>The Diſſenters
did never charge the Church of</hi> England <hi>with this. The
Diſſenters do the ſame themſelves. There is no Diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Diſſenters and Vs about that. Did ever the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
charge us with this?</hi> And ſo lets them drop without
any farther Reply, tho' ſtill ſtanding in their full force
againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from moſt other Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
excepting thoſe he has pick'd out for better Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Thus he gives the goe-by to the greateſt part of the
Inſtances. And for ſuch other Arguments, as are there
preſs'd againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that equally
from all ſorts of Diſſenters, thoſe he prudently ſays no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to;<note place="margin">Anſw. to Pap. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. pag. 131.</note> In obſervance I ſuppoſe of a Rule he had laid
down before in a former Diſcourſe, <hi>viz. The Greateſt Wits
can do no more than the Cauſe will bear; tho' a little Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65448:3"/>
would teach ME to ſay NOTHING in ſuch a
Cauſe, as will admit of no better a Defence.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſays not one Word in Vindication of his <hi>Popiſh Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,</hi>
of their <hi>Mitres</hi> and <hi>Croſiers,</hi> not a Word of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>to be defended by the Angels:</hi> Nothing of their calling
upon the <hi>Birds,</hi> the <hi>Beaſts</hi> and <hi>Fiſhes;</hi> of their crying out
to <hi>Dead Men,</hi> in their moſt Solemn Devotions; of inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> into their <hi>Liturgy;</hi> of their not wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Rochet,</hi> the <hi>Albe</hi> and <hi>Tunicle;</hi> of their preſcribing
<hi>Faſts,</hi> and not keeping them; of their formerly Praying
for the <hi>Dead, &amp;c.</hi> Not one word to all <hi>his own Reaſons,</hi>
which in his Diſcourſes againſt me he has formerly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
to prove us Superſtitious and Idolaters; and yet
there preſſing with the ſame weight againſt <hi>himſelf</hi> and
his own <hi>Church.</hi> And yet he's taking his leave on me,
<hi>becauſe the matter is driven as far as it will go.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And is it poſſible then, that the Diſputing Humour is
ſo ſoon off? We have heard of nothing hitherto ſo much,
as of <hi>Diſputing,</hi> and <hi>Defending,</hi> and <hi>Juſtifying your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings;</hi>
of theſe repeated Challenges to the <hi>Repreſenter,
We'll Diſpute it when you will:</hi> And now, as far as I ſee,
when the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> is put to defend his own <hi>Church,</hi> and
juſtifie his own <hi>Reaſonings,</hi> he's as cool, and as unwilling
diſpute as the <hi>Repreſenter.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anſw. to Am. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com. p. 16.</note> No, <hi>We are not,</hi> ſay he,
<hi>for purſuing every new Game, but will keep to our old Scent.</hi>
Could any thing poſſibly be ſaid, more <hi>cooly</hi> than this?
Here's not a word now of <hi>Diſputing</hi> or <hi>Juſtifying;</hi> if his
Reaſonings be ſhewn to fly in his own face, as much as
againſt his Adverſary, he's well enough content to hear it,
with ſcarce a word of Reply; becauſe he's reſolv'd <hi>to keep
to his old Scent.</hi> And is not this ſomething ſtrange now,
that He that ſhould draw me out to diſpute over the Biſhop
of <hi>Meaux</hi>'s <hi>Expoſition,</hi> and run over the whole body of
Controverſie, as to matter of <hi>Right,</hi> or <hi>de Jure,</hi> when I
undertook for no more than to declare what our Church
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65448:4"/>
holds as to Matter of <hi>Fact;</hi> and would not take my wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it without many a Flurt and a Jeer: Now when it
comes to his own turn of <hi>Diſputing</hi> and <hi>Defending</hi> his <hi>own
Reaſonings,</hi> in a Caſe <hi>directly</hi> appertaining to our main
Point of <hi>Repreſenting,</hi> lets the matter fall very cautiouſly,
and will ſcarce touch at it forſooth, becauſe he'll <hi>keep to his
old Scent.</hi> So that tho' he's for beating up for me, as
many new Games as he can poſſibly find, for my diverſion;
for his part, he'll not follow the old one, unleſs the ſcent
be very agreeable, which truly 'tis not when it comes to
preſs him to the ſtanding his Ground, and juſtifying his
own Cauſe. I muſt pardon him therefore, it ſeems, as to
this.</p>
            <p>But however, tho' he will not offer any defence againſt
a Character, which ſeems to reflect upon his own Church,
yet he'll endeavour to prevent all miſunderſtanding betwixt
Her and the Diſſenters, that might poſſibly be occaſion'd
by ſuch a Character. And becauſe he finds it much eaſier
to work upon their Affections by Fawning, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
their Judgments by Reaſoning; He firſt tells them
how <hi>Wiſe</hi> they are,<note place="margin">Anſw. to Am. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com. p. 16.</note> and how <hi>Cautious;</hi> nay, how much
<hi>Wiſer they are grown now</hi> of late; and he hopes, they will
grow wiſer and wiſer <hi>every day:</hi> Eſpecially ſo as not to
ſuſpect Them or their Church of any Inclinations to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.
<note place="margin">Ib.</note> For whatever they have formerly ſuſpected—I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi>
(ſays he) <hi>they will call it Popiſh and Antichriſtian
no longer.</hi> And here he gives them a Reaſon or two, with
which if they are not mov'd, they are much to blame.
For he tells them, in how many things the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
agrees with the <hi>Diſſenters.</hi> And firſt, as for their
calling their Churches by <hi>Saints</hi> Names, that's much the
ſame with what the Diſſenters did themſelves; and tho'
they give them the <hi>Titles</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 17.</note> yet he hopes the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
are not ſo ſilly, as to think this to be any more than
for <hi>Diſtinction.</hi> Then as to the <hi>Power of Abſolution,</hi> there's
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65448:4"/>
no diſpute between <hi>Vs</hi> and the <hi>Diſſenters:</hi> They and We
agree,<note place="margin">Pag. 19.</note> ſays he; ſo that whatſoever the Common-Prayer-Book
delivers, of the Prieſt abſolving the Sinner, yet he
aſſures them, there's nothing meant by this, but only
what the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> teach themſelves, that is, <hi>to give Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
to afflicted Conſciences,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 21.</note> &amp;c. So again as to a <hi>vow of
Chaſtity;</hi> he and the Diſſenters agree, that 'tis lawful to
repent of it, and marry; 'tis preſently a raſh Vow, if the
Temptation be but urging. But then as to the buſineſs of
<hi>Pictures</hi> in Bibles, and Images of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> &amp;c. in
Churches,<note place="margin">Pag. 18.</note> there he curries with them cloſely, and aſſures
them, that however theſe <hi>Pictures</hi> are in their Bibles, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Authority, Printed at the Univerſity; tho' <hi>Moſes</hi>
and <hi>Aaron</hi> ſtand in moſt of the Churches, have Place next
to the Commandments, are above the Communion-Table;
yet that all this is nothing but the <hi>Extravagancy of Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Printers, a very late Invention,</hi> and a ſecret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of Papiſts, to reconcile the People by degrees to the
uſe of <hi>Pictures</hi> and <hi>Images.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I defie any man to bid fairer for the good Opinion
of the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> than my Adverſary has here done; who,
for fear they ſhould receive any ill impreſſion in relation to
his Church, from my Character, which is little more than
in jeſt, throws theſe ſcandals upon her in good earneſt;
being reſolv'd, that if his Church be to be ſcandaliz'd, he'll
have the doing it himſelf.</p>
            <p>But for the winning of the Diſſenters, he goes on, and
tells them; Altho' they have been Perſecuted, that ſtill
they are not to complain of his Church: For that 'tis not
ſo much the <hi>Church</hi> has done this, as the <hi>State,</hi> to ſecure it
ſelf from their <hi>Reſtleſs Humour, which has threatned the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Peace.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 21.</note> Now, how far this will agree with them I can't
tell: But I am apt to believe, that if the Diſſenters once reflect,
how much more quiet they have enjoy'd, ſince his Church's
Power have been ſomething check'd, than before, they'l
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65448:5"/>
have ſome Reaſon to ſuſpect, that in their former Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
the Church has had the greateſt ſhare; eſpecially
ſince at this preſent the <hi>State</hi> is as ſecure without thoſe
Perſecutions as ever, which is an Argument, it does not
ſtand much in need of 'em. But I diſpute not this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
let them agree as well as they can; the buſineſs only
is, to put the Saddle upon the right Horſe.</p>
            <p>Another Reſon he lays down before,<note place="margin">Pag. 16.</note> by way of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention:
And 'tis that however the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
as it is repreſented in my Character, may bear ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
with Antichriſt; yet he's confident the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
will hence receive no prejudice, nor entertain any
worſe opinion of Her upon this ſcore; becauſe <hi>They are
too Wiſe and Cautious to take Characters from open and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd
Enemies.</hi> Now if this be true, and ſufficient reaſon
for his preſumption, that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are <hi>ſo Wiſe;</hi> I
would fain know, how <hi>Wiſe</hi> he thinks his own Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to be, that is, ſuch as go to Church; who have
been receiving Characters of <hi>Popery</hi> theſe hundred and
Fifty years, from the <hi>Open and Profeſs'd Enemies of the
Papiſts;</hi> 'tis a Mercy they are not <hi>ſo Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Cautious</hi> as
his <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> otherwiſe the Pulpits might e'en have been
ſilent, as to any thing touching Popery; ſince holding
forth againſt ſuch as they have <hi>Proteſted</hi> againſt, and
own'd themſelves Profeſs'd Enemies to, they could have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
no credit in their Characters. But 'tis well the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi>
are <hi>ſo Wiſe;</hi> and from henceforward 'tis to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
that whoſoever undertakes to give a Character
of his <hi>declared and open Enemies,</hi> and expects to be credited
by his Flock, muſt needs think them not <hi>ſo Wiſe</hi> as they
ſhou'd be.</p>
            <p>But here agen he comes over me with the Whip in hand,<note place="margin">Pag. 17.</note>
and having aſſur'd his <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> that I have abus'd them,
in Fathering upon them ſo ſoul a Character of the Church
of <hi>England;</hi> he tells his Reader, that the Run of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65448:5"/>
is exactly to the tune of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> whoſe <hi>Cant</hi> the
Author (as he ſays) is <hi>as well acquainted with, as if he had
been either their Maſter or Scholar.</hi> And if this be ſo, I muſt
confeſs it a very ſtrange Providence, as having never heard
twenty words from them in my Life, as I can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>All the Harangues and Pulpits, I have been ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with here in <hi>England,</hi> (excepting ſome few
of the <hi>Catholicks</hi> of late) have been thoſe of the
Church of <hi>England;</hi> and if I have learn'd any Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
it muſt have been, not from the <hi>Quakers,</hi> but
from them. The truth of't is, in the drawing up that
Character, I took no other model, but that of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> againſt the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> There is ſcarce an <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
in the Character, but exactly Parallel to what the
Church of <hi>England</hi> uſes in her Defence againſt <hi>Popery;</hi>
the <hi>grounds</hi> of the Arguments are the ſame; the <hi>manner</hi> of
urging them the ſame, the <hi>Maxims;</hi> on which they ſtand,
the ſame; and then then <hi>Reaſons,</hi> which preſs them home,
are they not the very ſame, which the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> himſelf in
his former Diſcourſes urges againſt me? I wonder then,
how this comes to be a <hi>Quakers Cant?</hi> 'Tis ſtrange
men ſhould know their own Picture no better; and that
when they ſee a Copy of what they do, and ſay themſelves,
in the moſt ſerious concern, it ſhould appear to them ſo
unlike the <hi>Original:</hi> that what in themſelves they deem
<hi>Reaſonable</hi> and <hi>Juſt,</hi> being ſhewn them in a <hi>Reflection</hi> or
<hi>Emblem,</hi> ſhould ſeem nothing but <hi>Spiteful</hi> and <hi>Silly;</hi> as
the Anſwerer ſays this do's, (<hi>p.</hi> 17.) This is juſt as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
with little Children, who when they are ſhewn what
<hi>Wry Faces</hi> they make, and how <hi>Scowling looks,</hi> will not
eaſily believe they make ſo <hi>Vgly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, but now the Anſwerer had conſider'd the whole
Character, and begins to think at laſt, that in it I have ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicul'd
the Church of <hi>England. And thus</hi> (ſays he) <hi>this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65448:6"/>
hopeful deſign of Repreſenting and Miſrepreſenting, ends only
in ridiculing the Church of</hi> England;<note place="margin">Pag. 24.</note> 
               <hi>a Liberty, which if
we needed it, is not mannerly for us to uſe at THIS TIME.</hi>
But wherein have I ridicul'd the Church of <hi>England?</hi> I
have done no more in my Character againſt Her, than
what they have been doing theſe Hundred and Fifty Years
againſt the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> only what I have done in a
kind of <hi>Jeſt,</hi> and without endeavouring to delude any
body with ſuch kind of Sophiſtry, They have been doing
in the greateſt <hi>earneſt,</hi> and by it making good their Cauſe.
And as for the <hi>mannerly</hi> and <hi>at this time,</hi> were there any
ridiculing in my Caſe; is it not ſtill as little <hi>manners</hi> to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule
<hi>at this time</hi> the Religion of the <hi>Prince,</hi> as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of the <hi>Subject?</hi> But I leave to the Ingenious and
Impartial Reader to examine this affair of the <hi>Mannerly</hi> and
<hi>This Time;</hi> I'le not judge, neither for my ſelf, nor
him.</p>
            <p>But however, notwithſtanding this little diſpleaſure of
my Anſwerer,<note place="margin">Pag. 24.</note> it clears up agen with him, he pardons all
frankly, and <hi>we are contented</hi> (ſays he) <hi>they ſhould ridicule
our Church, if they will permit us truly to Repreſent theirs.</hi>
Here now we have a liberty granted of <hi>Ridiculing,</hi> which
I reſolve never to make uſe of, unleſs it be to ſhew, how They
ridicule the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> But inſtead of returning my
thanks for this favour, I am e'n reſolved to beg another;
and 'tis, that the Anſwerer will be pleaſed not to take
that for <hi>Ridiculing</hi> in us, which in them he calls <hi>truly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting:</hi>
This would be a very Signal Favour indeed, if it
could be obtain'd; but I almoſt deſpair. For by all that
I can diſcover in their <hi>truly Repreſenting,</hi> 'tis ſo unlike
what he calls it, that nothing can be more underſerving that
Name. For let but an exact Copy be taken of what they
do to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> when they truly Repreſent them, as they
call it, with all its methods and circumſtances; let the
ſame meaſures they uſe to them, be applied to any other
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65448:6"/>
Body or Society, even to their own Church of <hi>England,</hi>
and if it do's not appear to be down right <hi>Miſrepreſenting</hi>
and <hi>Ridiculing</hi> inſtead of <hi>truly Repreſenting,</hi> I'le e'en throw
up the Cauſe, and grant the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to be as <hi>Black</hi> as they
make them. This appears ſomething already in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
now examin'd, which he owns to be <hi>Ridiculing,</hi>
tho' it be nothing but what they do to the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and there call it <hi>Truly Repreſenting.</hi> But this I ſhall
more clearly evince afterwards, when I have examin'd
ſome other Parts of the Anſwer, where I ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of playing him the ſame Tune over agen, a litle more
diſtinctly, without any Ridiculing, but in very good
earneſt.</p>
            <p>But firſt I muſt conſider how he receives the Curteſie I
did him in my laſt Reply. I muſt confeſs, I could not but
be concern'd, to ſee my Anſwerer turning and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, firſt through tedious Ten Sheets, and ſoon after
through other Nine, and all to prove that the Word
<hi>Miſrepreſented</hi> in the <hi>Title</hi> of my Book, was not to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in its <hi>Proper</hi> Senſe. This to me was an Object of
Compaſſion; and therefore to ſave him any farther Sweat,
I thought fit to yield to his Pretenſions, and give into his
hands the full graſp of all that he had juſt before ſo earneſtly
contended for. And ſee now, how ill uſe he makes of this
favour.</p>
            <p>For having ſo far complied with him, that the Word
<hi>Miſrepreſented</hi> in the <hi>Title</hi> of my Book, is not to be taken
in its <hi>Strict</hi> and <hi>Proper</hi> Senſe; he would now willingly
impoſe upon his Reader and Me, and perſwade the World,
as if I own the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> not to charge falſly any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins
or Practices on the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owns:
and that they do not teach their Flock, that the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believes or practices, otherwiſe than She
does.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:65448:7"/>
            <p>
               <hi>This,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anſw. p. 4. 7. 8. 30. &amp; alib. Amic. Accom. p. 6.</note> ſays he, <hi>at laſt, if I underſtand him, he confeſſes.</hi>
Is not this ſtretching a Curteſie with a witneſs, and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſenting
the Repreſenter.</p>
            <p>I yielded to him indeed, for Peace ſake, that the Title
of a <hi>Papiſt Miſrepreſented</hi> is not to be taken in its <hi>ſtrict
and proper Senſe, as Miſrepreſenting ſignifies ONLY down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Lying or falſly charging matter of Fact, the WHOLE
Character being not of that nature.</hi> And this with our
<hi>Anſwerer</hi> is the ſame as to confeſs, That <hi>Proteſtants do not
charge the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>with any Doctrins or Practices,
which She does not own.</hi> So that it ſeems, becauſe the
Character of a <hi>Papiſt Miſrepreſented</hi> is not <hi>wholly</hi> made up
of matters of Doctrin and Practices falſly charg'd upon
the Papiſts; Therefore, (as our <hi>Anſwerer</hi> will have it) it
contains <hi>nothing at all,</hi> wrongfully charg'd upon them;
and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do not in <hi>any thing</hi> Miſrepreſent the
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anſ. p. 5.</note> And this he would have me <hi>plainly
confeſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I muſt beg his pardon for this; I do not ſee he has
made ſo good uſe of the laſt favour I did him, as to accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
away my Senſes and Reaſon, to do him another. No,
<hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is not half ſo diſagreeable to <hi>Proteſtant-Senſes,</hi>
as this is to mine. I could as eaſily confeſs, that
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> do not at all Write or Preach againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi>
as that they do not <hi>Miſrepreſent</hi> them. And for the truth
of this Cauſe, I dare ſtand to the Verdict even of a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Jury.</hi> I'le give the Anſwerer choice-room enough;
Let him pick out of all <hi>England,</hi> Twelve ſuch Men who
underſtand the Belief and Doctrin of Papiſts, all Good
Men and True; and if they ſhall, upon examination, give
in; That they know all to <hi>be true,</hi> which they have heard
from <hi>Proteſtant Pulpits</hi> and <hi>Books</hi> concerning the <hi>Papiſts;</hi>
I'le then yield up the Cauſe, and ſit down contented with
the brand of a Miſrepreſenter. Nay, I dare put it to a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
iſſue; If they do not own, they have heard and read
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65448:7"/>
ſeveral things charg'd upon the Papiſts, which they know
to be falſe, I'le ſubmit to the Anſwerer; and be oblig'd
never more to diſturb him with the Talk of <hi>Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before we advance too far in this matter, let's ſee
firſt, how it ſtands with the <hi>Character</hi> of a <hi>Papiſt Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented;</hi>
and examine, whether there be nothing there
<hi>falſly</hi> laid at the Papiſt's door, enough for the Book to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
ſuch a Title: And whether the fathering on them
ſuch Doctrins as are there contain'd, and found in Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Authors, be not affirming more than is True, and
charging on them Doctrins and Practices, ſuch as they and
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> diſown.</p>
            <p>And firſt, what do's he think of <hi>Praying to Images,</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
as a Practice of the Papiſts, in the firſt <hi>Chap.</hi> of the
<hi>Papiſt Miſrepreſented?</hi> Is not this imputing more to the
Papiſts, than they either teach, practice, or maintain? Do
they believe their Sins to be infallibly remitted upon <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,</hi>
whether they reſolve upon amendment or no?
And yet this is laid to them <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. Do they believe the
Pope can give them leave for a Sum of Money, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
what Sins they pleaſe? And yet this is reported as
their Doctrin, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. Is it abſolutely true, that they
are never permitted to know their Commandments but by
halves? Is it their Doctrin, preſumptuouſly to rely on a
Death-bed Repentance? Are their Sermons in Latin; or
do they teach in Unknown Tongues? Is it true, that they
Fir'd the City? Is he ſure they Kill'd Sir <hi>Edmondbury God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey?</hi>
Or will he put in for an Evidence, to Swear the
Truth of the Damnable, Helliſh Popiſh-Plot? And yet all
theſe things, and more ſtand charg'd upon the Papiſts, in
the Character of a <hi>Papiſt Miſrepreſented.</hi> Why then
ſhould the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> thus quarrel with this <hi>Title,</hi> as if the
Papiſts had no wrong done them in ſuch a Deſcription? I
know it is the Intereſt of ſuch ill men, as have run down
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65448:8"/>
the Papiſts with theſe Charges and Accuſations, and paſs'd
them upon the People for Goſpel, to have them ſtill repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as Truths; leſt the falſity of them being once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd,
they themſelves ſhould appear the Deceivers. But
however they may be willing to purſue ſuch Unchriſtian
methods, to ſave their own Reputation; 'tis not for us to
own the Belief of ſuch Doctrins, which we acknowledge
to be Injurious to Chriſt, nor to maintain ſuch Practices,
which would be a Scandal even amongſt thoſe, who know
not God. And therefore becauſe the Character of a <hi>Papiſt
Miſrepreſented,</hi> contains ſuch Doctrins and Practices, which
<hi>Catholicks</hi> neither own, teach nor believe; nay ſuch as
they abominate and deteſt, and are ready to lay down their
lives, rather than embrace or approve; ſuch a Character of
a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> is nothing leſs than a <hi>Falſe</hi> Character, a <hi>Miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting</hi>
Character, and fit only for the uſe of thoſe, who
have a mind to diſpoſe their Followers into a temper of
giving a better welcome to <hi>Turks, Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> than
to <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know 'tis thought neceſſary for the Eſtabliſhment and
Security of the Proteſtant Religion, that the People
ſhould be Preach'd into a dread of <hi>Popery:</hi> but let it be ſo;
is it a Chriſtian method to make uſe of Artifices to encreaſe
the horror? Why ſhould every thing the Papiſts do, be
ſtretch'd and ſtrain'd, and forc'd, to make ti ugly? Why
ſhould the worſt be made of all that belongs to them?
'Tis true, this is proper enough to win upon the <hi>Mobile,</hi>
who make no diſtinction between <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Artificial</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters;
'tis well enough, where the intereſt is beſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
by the <hi>Madneſs</hi> of the <hi>People.</hi> But where's the
Chriſtianity all the while, where's Truth and Charity?
Why ſhould <hi>Praying to Images, Leave to Sin for Money,
Forgiveneſs without Repentance, Truſting in a Death-bed Lord-have-mercy,
&amp;c.</hi> Why ſhould <hi>ſeign'd Crimes,</hi> and <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Contrivances, &amp;c.</hi> be urg'd againſt them, to make
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65448:8"/>
them the Object of hatred, and the Subject of a Popular fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?
Why ſhould it be pretended, that where theſe things
ſtand charg'd againſt the Papiſts, they are not <hi>Miſrepreſented?</hi>
I am ſure where <hi>Proteſtantiſm</hi> is either grounded or confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by thus <hi>bug-bearing</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> 'tis not built upon the
<hi>Goſpel,</hi> nor is its ſtrength from the power of Truth; and the
uſing ſuch unwarrantable methods, and taking ſo much
pains for the dreſſing it into a Monſter, is argument enough
with Conſidering Men, to ſuſpect ſomething of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Anſwerer</hi> therefore is mightily out, when he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
it confeſs'd by me, that there's no <hi>proper Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting,</hi>
or falſe charge of Matter of <hi>Fact</hi> upon the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
in the Character of the <hi>Papiſt Miſrepreſented.</hi> I
only yield to him, that the Character is not <hi>wholly</hi> made
up indeed of theſe forg'd Accuſations, but that 'tis a <hi>mixt</hi>
Character, deſcribing the Papiſts, as they lie under the
falſe Charges, the Calumnies, Reproaches, Miſconſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Miſtaken Judgments of their both <hi>Malicious,</hi> and
<hi>Ignorant</hi> Adverſaries. And therefore I inform'd him, that
the Title of the <hi>Papiſt Miſrepreſented</hi> was not to be taken
in its <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> ſenſe,<note place="margin">Am. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com. p. 6.</note> as Miſrepreſenting ſignifies
<hi>only</hi> down-right lying, or falſly charging matter of Fact:
But in its <hi>larger,</hi> or leſs proper ſenſe, as it comprehends
both <hi>Lying, Calumniating, Miſ-interpreting, Reproaching,
Miſconſtruing, Miſ-judging,</hi> and whatever elſe of this kind.
But this condeſcendence, which would have oblig'd an
Ingenuous Adverſary, has made my <hi>Anſwerer</hi> ſomething
peeviſh. And therefore now inſtead of his old Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
Humour, he's grown very four, he's full of
grudges, and ſomething ſeems to grate upon his Stomach.
Well, and what's the matter now? What reaſon of this
ſo ſudden Change? Why, it ſeems the <hi>Repreſenter</hi> ſaid,
that the Papiſts are ſtrangely Miſrepreſented; that many
matters of <hi>Fact</hi> are <hi>falſly</hi> charg'd upon them; that they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65448:9"/>
are calumniated, reproach'd, their Doctrin and Practices
miſ-interpreted, miſconſtrued, miſunderſtood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as was
ſhewn in his Character of the <hi>Papiſt Miſrepreſented:</hi> And
all this the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> unhappily takes to himſelf, as if He
were the Man accus'd for doing all this againſt the Papiſts,
as if <hi>He</hi> and <hi>His</hi> were Arraign'd of <hi>Lying, Calumniating,</hi>
&amp;c. Whenas the <hi>Repreſenter</hi> ſpoke only in <hi>general,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſo much as hinting upon any Party or Perſon in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular;
and if I may vouch any thing for him, never thought
of reflecting upon the <hi>Anſwerer,</hi> much leſs of giving him
the Lie. 'Tis true, the <hi>Repreſenter</hi> ſays, for the running
down the Papiſts, and Miſrepreſenting them, beſides their
being Calumniated, and their Doctrins miſ-interpreted,
many <hi>Falſities</hi> and <hi>Lies</hi> have been rais'd againſt them.
But what does this concern the <hi>Anſwerer?</hi> Is this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
any Accuſation againſt him? Suppoſe the <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter</hi>
had gone a ſtep farther, and had ſaid, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
have been injur'd by <hi>Perjury, Forgery,</hi> and <hi>Suborna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
too; would the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> have thought himſelf touch'd
in this, and labour'd to clear himſelf? 'Tis true, for a
Man to be over-eager in quitting himſelf, when the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation
is only <hi>General,</hi> is not the beſt Argument of his
Innocence: But for my part, I never deſign'd to accuſe
the <hi>Anſwerer,</hi> for I knew not the Man; neither have I
any thing now to ſay againſt him, as to this Point; only
that his over-ſolicitude to prove his Innocence, before he
was accus'd, will be likely with ſome to breed a ſuſpicion
of Guilt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Anſwerer</hi> therefore muſt remember, that the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of the <hi>Papiſt Miſrepreſented</hi> contains ſeveral unjuſt
Charges of Doctrin and Practices, (tho' it be not <hi>wholly</hi>
made up of theſe) ſuch as the Papiſts neither own, nor
believe. And that he is over-haſty in perſuading his
Reader, that this Point is gain'd, and confeſs'd by me.
No, he muſt pardon me for this; Il'e go as far as any
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65448:9"/>
Man for an Accommodation, but never ſo, as to ſubſcribe
to a falſity in a Complement.</p>
            <p>Hitherto as to what concerns the Character: Now we
are to conſider, how true that is, which he ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats,
of the fair dealing of <hi>WE</hi> in relation to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.</hi>
For ſome it ſeems there are, if he ſays true, that
are ſo juſt and kind to the Papiſts, as not to Miſrepreſent
them. For throughout the Anſwer we meet with nothing
oftner, than <hi>WE are not Miſrepreſenters in a ſtrict and
proper notion of Miſrepreſenting: WE do not charge the
Church of</hi> Rome <hi>with any matter of Fact, with any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins
or Practices, which ſhe does not own. WE charge
them with nothing that is falſe. WE do not miſ-report
the Doctrins of their Church. WE do not charge men with
ſaying or doing, what they never ſaid or did. WE are no
Miſrepreſenters.</hi> And truly I ſhould be glad to know,
who theſe <hi>WE</hi> are, to return them my thanks for this
ſo kind Office; for really, as the World goes, 'tis no ſmall
favour done to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to ſay no more of them, than
they own and believe themſelves. For my part, did I
know the Men, I would never permit them to lie obſcur'd,
under the <hi>General</hi> name of <hi>WE;</hi> no, I would particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize
them to the World, and have their Names blazon'd in
every Street, upon Pillars erected to their Memory. For
why? Are not ſuch Men Prodigies of Vertue, of Truth,
Honeſty, and Juſtice? Men that never charg'd the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> with any matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> with any <hi>Doctrin</hi> or
<hi>Practice,</hi> which ſhe does not own: Men that never ſaid
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teaches, what ſhe does not teach;
that never condemn'd the Papiſts for believing, what they
do not believe; nor accus'd them of ſaying or doing, what
they never ſaid or did; Men that never Miſrepreſented the
Papiſts! Why, theſe are Admirable Men indeed, and not
to be heard of every day. Were I aſſur'd of the being of
ſuch Men, I ſhould begin to think <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was return'd
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65448:10"/>
again, and that our Nation would in all likelyhood recover
her Credit, loſt in the unhappy times of our late Credulous
Madneſs.</p>
            <p>But I wiſh there be no miſtake in this, it being ſo hard
to imagine who theſe <hi>We</hi> ſhould be. For now if he ſhould
mean by his <hi>We, We Proteſtants; We never accus'd the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
of any Doctrin, or Practices, which they do not own;
never charg'd them with any thing that is falſe;</hi> who could
believe it? Would not this look like a Paradox, which if
the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> will affirm, I believe he'll ſcarce find more
than <hi>one</hi> to ſwear to? For is it poſſible that <hi>We Proteſtants</hi>
never ſaid any thing of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but what is exactly
true; <hi>We</hi> never ſaid they believe, what they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
that they teach, what they do not teach; or that
they did, what they never did? Is it poſſible this ſhould
be true? I would willingly give ſomething for the ſight
of the Man that thinks ſo. For my part, I think it very
hard to be believ'd: And if this be the meaning of the
<hi>Anſwerer,</hi> and what he endeavours to perſuade his Reader,
I think of all the <hi>Miſ-repreſentations</hi> of the Papiſts, that
ever I met with, this of <hi>affirming all to be true, that has
been ſaid of the Papiſts,</hi> is the greateſt; and I wiſh the
<hi>Anſwerer</hi> much Joy for the Improvement. For this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe, than to vouch for the truth of all, that has been
ever alledg'd againſt them; and in three lines to aſſert and
approve all that has been invented againſt them theſe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fifty Years.</p>
            <p>But I think, upon conſideration, I may take it for
granted, that his <hi>WE that charge the Papiſts with nothing
that is falſe, and are no Miſrepreſenters,</hi> are <hi>WE Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants:</hi>
for 'tis theſe he ſeems to vindicate, throughout his
Books, and endeavours to wipe off from them the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of being <hi>Miſrepreſenters.</hi> And beſides, if he ſpeaks
properly, the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> himſelf muſt come in, and make
one of the <hi>WE;</hi> and for him, one may ſwear he's a ſtanch
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65448:10"/>
True <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> as never ſcrupling at any thing that's
for running down the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> tho' it be currying favour
with, and colloguing the Phanaticks; as he ſeems plainly
to do, in his laſt <hi>Anſwer</hi> (p. 16. 18.) And more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
becauſe being to ſpeak againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> he's as large,
as loud, as long-winded as you pleaſe, and is ready to
<hi>Diſpute</hi> againſt it without end, could he but find any, that
would think it worth their while to try him. But being to
ſpeak in defence of the <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> of his own
Religion (as he had occaſion ſufficient from the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating
Sermon in my laſt Anſwer) he's as Flat, as Short,
and as willing to wave the diſputing for it, as any Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
can deſire, which is as plain an Argument to me of
his Perſwaſion, as if 'twas writ in his Forehead; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only one Perſwaſion as I know of amongſt Chriſtians,
which has its <hi>Name, Being</hi> and <hi>Support,</hi> not from what it is
in it ſelf; but from what it <hi>is not,</hi> in defying and <hi>Proteſting</hi>
againſt their Neighbours.</p>
            <p>We muſt ſuppoſe therefore now that his <hi>WE</hi> which are
pretended ſo clear throughout his Anſwer, from being <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſenters</hi>
of the Papiſts, are <hi>WE Proteſtants:</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he diſclaims all Title to Infallibility, there's no need
of taking his word for the truth of what he aſſerts; nor
danger of affronting him, tho' we call in queſtion the
verity of what, he ſays, he has prov'd. And really, as my
Caſe ſtands, I am oblig'd to queſtion it: For if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd
true, what he ſays, that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are no Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſenters
of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> Then, I muſt needs own, I have
highly injur'd the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in complaining againſt them
as Miſ-reporters of the Doctrin and Practices of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and holding out againſt them ſo long the charge
of Miſrepreſenting. Why ſhould I injure any body, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſo conſiderable a Number, as challenge that Name?
No, I will do them no ſuch wrong, and therefore, however
Innocent our Anſwerer may pretend he has prov'd them;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65448:11"/>
I'le here ſhew the Papiſts have been always Miſrepreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and that ever ſince they have had Proteſtant Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
their greateſt Suffering has been, not ſo much from
the force of Truth and Reaſon, as from <hi>Calumny</hi> and <hi>Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
and all ſorts of Miſrepreſentations.</p>
            <p>For the clearing of this, we muſt take along with us the
true Notion of Miſrepreſenting, as 'tis now agreed on by
our Adverſary, who owns in his laſt Anſwer, That whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
undertakes to declare any Action,<note place="margin">Pag. 10, 11, 13.</note> Doctrin, or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and does not deliver it as cloath'd with
all its <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> with the right <hi>Motives,</hi> due <hi>End</hi>
and <hi>Intention,</hi> is in a <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>ſtrict</hi> ſenſe a <hi>Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter.</hi>
Again, in his former Anſer he has this laid down
as a Principle.<note place="margin">Anſw. to Papiſt Pro. p. 17.</note> 
               <hi>If we</hi> (ſays he, ſpeaking of <hi>We Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants)
put our own Opinions of the Papiſts Faith and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
into his Character, this is Miſrepreſenting; becauſe a
Papiſt has not the ſame Opinion of theſe things, which we
have, and this makes it a Falſe Character.</hi> So that here
'tis now to be ſuppos'd, that whatſover Proteſtant in any
thing relating to the Papiſts, either <hi>leaves out,</hi> or <hi>alters</hi>
any material <hi>Circumſtance,</hi> the <hi>Motive, Intention, End,</hi>
puts any <hi>falſe Conſtruction,</hi> or thruſts in his <hi>own Opinion</hi>
into what he relates, is forthwith a Miſrepreſenter.</p>
            <p>And now to diſcover, how much the Papiſts have been
always Sufferers from this Unchriſtian Artifice of Miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting,
we can take no better way, than to make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
into the ſeveral <hi>Methods</hi> us'd in <hi>Miſrepreſenting;</hi> and
this not only in relation to Points of <hi>Doctrin</hi> and <hi>Belief,</hi>
but likewiſe in matters of <hi>Fact</hi> and <hi>Hiſtory:</hi> and tho' it be
impoſſible to give an exact Catalogue of Theſe, they being
as Numberleſs, as the Ways are of <hi>Ignorance</hi> to <hi>miſtake,</hi>
of <hi>Envy</hi> to make <hi>falſe Conſtructions,</hi> of <hi>Malice</hi> to <hi>deceive;</hi>
yet to touch at ſome few, will be ſufficient to evince, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>WE</hi> of the Anſwerer are as clear from miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
and wronging the Papiſts, as he pretends. Or
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65448:11"/>
Whether the Papiſts are <hi>really,</hi> what they pretend to ſhew
them.</p>
            <p>And firſt, one way of Miſrepreſenting the Papiſts is by
charging their Doctrin with Blaſphemy and Prophaneſs,
not otherwiſe due to it, but only through the <hi>Ignorance</hi> or
<hi>Malice</hi> of him that draws the Conſequence. This is the
admirable Gift of Mr. <hi>Sutcliff</hi> in his <hi>Survey of Popery,</hi>
where he lays upon the Papiſts the moſt Infamous Poſitions
of the Heathens, and then gives his Reaſons for it, ſuch
as are more for his own Confuſion, with underſtanding
Men, than to the prejudice of thoſe he writes againſt.
Thus he ſays the <hi>Papiſts Blaſphemouſly make Chriſt not only
a Deſperate Man, without Hope, but alſo an Infidel without
Faith.</hi> And Why all this Only, becauſe <hi>Aquinas, (p.</hi> 3.
<hi>q. 7. art.</hi> 4.) ſays, that Chriſt <hi>ſeeing</hi> and <hi>enjoying</hi> God from
the firſt inſtant of his Conception, could not poſſibly have
<hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Hope</hi> in him, which always ſuppoſe the <hi>Abſence</hi>
of the Object, that is, reſpect the Divine Eſſence <hi>not ſeen</hi>
and <hi>not enjoy'd.</hi> And this is reaſon enough for <hi>Sutcliff</hi> to
cry out againſt the Papiſts, as <hi>Blaſphemouſly making Chriſt,
both a Deſperate Man, and an Infidel.</hi> Certainly ſuch a
Piece of Divinity was never heard of before out of a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
Church.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anſw. to Pap. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. pag. 11.</note> And yet ſuch as it is, My Anſwerer is not
aſham'd to Print it over agen; making this profound Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of <hi>Sutcliffs,</hi> a ſufficient diſcharge of him from being
a <hi>Miſrepreſenter;</hi> quarrelling with me, for curtailing the
Author, in ſetting down this his charge againſt the Papiſts,
without his Reaſon that back'd it.</p>
            <p>Another way of Miſrepreſenting the Papiſts,<note place="margin">A Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch. truly repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Doctrins of the Church of Rome. Pag. 56.</note> is in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to deliver their Doctrin, and then to inſert ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
which is notoriouſly falſe, and abſolutely deteſted
by them; this is what is done by the Author of a Catechiſm
lately Publiſh'd, who undertakes to give a Syſteme of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Doctrins <hi>truly Repreſented,</hi> according to their own
moſt receiv'd Authors, and Councils, and coming to ſpeak of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65448:12"/>
               <hi>IMAGES,</hi> he ſays the Papiſts <hi>PRAY TO THEM;</hi> which
is ſo foul a Miſrepreſentation,<note place="margin">Pag. 17.</note> the the Author of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the <hi>Papiſt Miſrepreſented</hi> plainly Condemns me,
for making it a part of my Miſrepreſentations, as if 'twere
never Charg'd againſt the Papiſts. <hi>This,</hi> ſays he, <hi>would
inſinuate, as tho' WE did directly charge them with PRAY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING
TO their Images,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ib.</note> 
               <hi>without any farther reſpect: Which
we are ſo far from charging them with, that I do not know
of any People in the World liable to that Charge.</hi> Thus
what one Proteſtant aſſerts poſitively, as the Doctrin and
Practice of the Papiſts, another Proteſtant rejects as a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation
ſo <hi>foul,</hi> as not to be imputed to the worſt
of Infidels.</p>
            <p>But however, foul as it is, 'tis not only found thus in
a Grave <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> but ſomething like it in a <hi>Sermon</hi> too,
<hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>J. Thomas</hi> Rect. of St. <hi>Nicholas;</hi> Preach'd at <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diffe,</hi>
before the Baylifs and Aldermen,<note place="margin">Pag. 21.</note> 1679, where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
other Goſpel-truths, he gives his Auditory to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that the Papiſts do not only <hi>Worſhip</hi> Martin's
<hi>Boots,</hi> Georg's <hi>Scabbard,</hi> Criſpins <hi>Paring-knife,</hi> Thomases
<hi>her Shoe, and</hi> Joſephs <hi>Breeches, but do likewiſe CALL
VPON THEM</hi> too. Which is to make them agen more
ſtupid Idolaters, than the worſt of Heathens; but 'tis by
a Miſrepreſentation, however agreeing with that <hi>Year</hi> of
<hi>Oats's</hi> bleſſed Diſcovery, yet much better ſuiting with
ſome other Place, than the Pulpit.</p>
            <p>Another like this, is that of the Anſwer to <hi>Catholicks no
Idolaters,</hi> who ſays, tis the common Anſwer of Catholicks,
that their Adoration of the Euchariſt cannot be Idolatry,
becauſe they <hi>Believe the Bread to be God, juſt as the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers
of the Sun believ'd the Sun to be God.</hi> Which is
ſo abſolutely falſe of the Catholicks, that on the contrary
they believe, that whoſoever believes the Bread to be God,
as the Heathens did the Sun, and adores it upon that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
muſt of neceſſity be an Idolater in adoring it.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:65448:12"/>
            <p>Another way is in framing ſome heatheniſh Abſurdity,
and then laying it on the Papiſts, as their Doctrin and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
when tis only a Malicious Inference drawn from ſome
abuſe, or from an obſcure expreſſion in ſome petty Author;
and this we find in the Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi> ſo often quoted,
who Repreſents the Papiſts as <hi>believing Chriſt to be Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of Men only, but no Women;</hi> that <hi>Whoredom is allow'd
by them all the year long;</hi> and ſeveral other ſuch abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Poſitions, which are no better than the Doctrin of
Devils.</p>
            <p>Such Deductive Abſurdities, are thoſe which Dr. <hi>St.</hi>
according to what the general Current of his Diſcourſe
Repreſents, endeavors to perſwade his Credulous Reader,
to be Doctrins of the <hi>Roman Church, viz.</hi> That it holds
no neceſſity of Repentance, but only once in ones Life.
That the Roman Repentance obliges none to the forſaking
their ſins, or a Reformation of Life. That the Sacraments
confer Grace, on any Receiver of them, tho' never ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepar'd.
That <hi>Indulgences</hi> diſcharge Catholicks from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the beſt part of their Religion. Which may be ſeen
related and confuted in a <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> entitled, The <hi>Roman
Doctrin of Repentance and of Indulgences, vindicated from
Dr.</hi> Sts. <hi>Miſrepreſentations.</hi> The like is to be ſeen in <hi>John
Fox</hi>'s <hi>Acts and Monuments,</hi> where (beſides the infinite
miſtakes and abuſes in relation to his Martyrs) in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
ſome chief Points of the Catholick Doctrin, in leſs
than three leaves, he has falſified them in above one Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and twenty Inſtances; that is, as his Anſwerer words
it in his plain Language, <hi>has uttered more than a Hundred
and fifty Lies:</hi> as is made appear in the <hi>Examen of</hi> John
Fox's <hi>Calendar,</hi> p. 3. p. 412.</p>
            <p>Another way is in <hi>Falſifying Authors</hi> for the Proof of
ſome Extravagant Doctrin upon the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And
this is done ſeveral ways: As firſt by the Archbiſhop of
<hi>York,</hi> who reports it a Tenet of the Papiſts, <hi>That the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65448:13"/>
Pope can make that Righteous, which is unrighteous.</hi> And
then quotes <hi>L. 1. Decret. Greg. Titulus</hi> 7. Chapter the <hi>Fifth,</hi>
which <hi>Titulus</hi> of the <hi>Decretals</hi> conſiſts only of <hi>Four</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and nothing mention'd in them all, beſides what
concerns the <hi>Tranſlation of Biſhops.</hi> Other Tenets of the
like ſtamp he imputes to the Belief of the Church of Rome,
and then quotes St. <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> &amp;c. in ſuch
Places, where either the <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Place</hi> is not to be found,
nor any thing like it.</p>
            <p>This is done another way, by endeavoring to prove
ſome Folly upon the Papiſts, out of their own Authors;
and then bringing in the Authors quite contrary to their
own Senſe and Words: This is exemplified in a Sermon
ſeveral times Printed,<note place="margin">Laſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. 1686.</note> and now lately with Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi>'s
name to it, where <hi>p.</hi> 2. he ſays, <hi>Learned Perſons of the
Church of Rome do acknowledge that Purgatory cannot be
concluded from the Text</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 15.) And then affirms,
<hi>Nay ALL that</hi> Eſtius <hi>contends for from this Place is, that
it cannot be concluded from hence, that there is no Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
Which yet, tho' preach'd at <hi>White-hall,</hi> and before
His late Majeſty, is not <hi>ALL</hi> that <hi>Eſtius</hi> contends for.
For <hi>Eſtius</hi> in his Explication upon that Place of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
ſpeaking of Purgatory concludes with theſe plain words,
<hi>Itaque hac ratione poena Purgatoria animarum, ex hoc</hi> Pauli
<hi>loco bene &amp; ſolide colligitur. Wherefore,</hi> ſays he, <hi>upon this
conſideration from this place of St.</hi> Paul <hi>the Puniſhment of Souls
in Purgatory is well and ſolidly gathered.</hi> Which is little leſs
than a Contradiction to what the Dr. aſſerts of him.
<hi>Dr. Cumber</hi> is ſomething good at this too, who in his <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to Catholicks,</hi> endeavors to make appear that St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
condemns the Doctrin of Catholicks concerning the
not marrying of Prieſts, maintaining as he ſays, that it
is lawful for ſuch of the Clergy, as cannot contain, to
Marry: And yet whoſoever conſults the place, will find
St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> to ſpeak only of ſuch of the Clergy, as are
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65448:13"/>
               <hi>extra Sacros Ordines conſtituti, Not yet in Holy Orders;</hi>
which is not at all contrary to the receiv'd Doctrin of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Dr. is willing to repreſent it,
but what at this day they teach and practice; ſo that in
this he evidently falſifies the Father. Something after the
ſame manner, he in another place treats <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to prove him a <hi>Blaſphemer,</hi> for ſaying, that a
<hi>Man</hi> may be his <hi>own Redeemer:</hi> whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in
the place cited, do's not ſay ſo of himſelf, as the Dr. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
him; but only ſets down the words of Scripture, in
which Man is ſo call'd; and by explicating in what Senſe
they may be underſtood, without any injury to Chriſt,
defends the H. Scripture from the imputation of Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
Which, methinks, is not ſo ill an Office, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Title of <hi>Blaſphemer,</hi> for doing it.</p>
            <p>The Old Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> amongſt many others, has an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
one of this kind, who in his <hi>Synop. Papiſm.</hi> will
needs prove the Pope to be Antichriſt out of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> in
theſe words, <hi>Their own Witneſſes ſhall ſpeak; Bernard</hi>
ſays, <hi>Beſtia de Apocalypſi, cui datum eſt os loquens Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi>
Petri <hi>Cathedram occupat. The Beaſt in the</hi> Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypſe,
<hi>to which a Mouth was given ſpeaking Blaſphemies,
poſſeſſes the Chair of</hi> Peter. By which he will perſwade
his Reader, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> according to the
plain words of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> is the <hi>Beaſt</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi>
and <hi>Antechriſt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ep. 125.</note> Whenas 'tis contrary to St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> who in
that Epiſtle, ſpeaks very honorably of Pope <hi>Innocentius,</hi>
animating him to the performance of his Duty with Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage;
and in the words mention'd reflects only upon a
certain Uſuper, who by violence invaded the Chair of
<hi>Peter,</hi> and baniſh'd <hi>Innocentius</hi> the true Biſhop out of
<hi>Rome.</hi> The late <hi>Diſcourſe concerning the Devotions of the
Church of</hi> Rome plays upon this String too, where <hi>p.</hi> 52.
ſpeaking of the Papiſt's, <hi>They tell us,</hi> ſays he, <hi>there is a
vaſt number of Sins in their own nature Venial—for the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65448:14"/>
pardon of which there is no need, or occaſion for the Mercy
of God.</hi> Which is a Doctrin they neither own nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs;
but abſolutely contrary to their Belief. And tho'
he quotes here <hi>Eſcobar</hi> for this Abſurdity, there is not
one word of this to be found in him, in the place cited:
But above all in this kind,<note place="margin">Eſcob. trac. 2. exam. 1. c. 4.</note> I think Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> bears away
the Bell in his <hi>Diſſwaſive from Popery,</hi> in which he ſhews
an excellent Talent of forging ſtrange Doctrins, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
them on Catholick Authors: And then for his quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
which he pretends to lay down out of Fathers and
Catholick Writers, the greateſt part of them are either
ſtrangely wreſted to a ſiniſter ſenſe, or not found at all in
the Original, or elſe unpardonably corrupted: As his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer
makes appear, who Examin'd them with his own
Eyes, as he profeſſes, in the Original Authors.</p>
            <p>Another way mightily in faſhion for the Miſrepreſenting
the Papiſts, is by putting them upon the ſame File with
Infidels and Pagans, and by ſuch compariſons to imprint
in the Vulgar a Notion of the Papiſts being no better than
Infidels. This is a great Topick with the Biſhop of <hi>Kilmore,</hi>
in his Sermon Preach'd at St. <hi>Warbroughs</hi> in <hi>Dublin</hi> a year
ago, <hi>The Pagans</hi> (ſays he <hi>p.</hi> 12) <hi>had their ſeveral Titular Gods
for ſeveral places; for</hi> Delphos <hi>Worſhip'd</hi> Apollo, Crete Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>and</hi> Epheſus Diana: <hi>And ſo in Popery,</hi> England <hi>Worſhip'd
St.</hi> George, Scotland <hi>St.</hi> Andrew, Ireland <hi>St.</hi> Patrick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Again, <hi>In Paganiſm they had ſeveral Gods to pray to—and
ſo in Popery. In Paganiſm ſeveral Profeſſions had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Gods—So in Popery. Laſtly, to theſe,</hi> ſays he,
<hi>both Pagans and Papiſts build Churches, erect Altars,</hi> &amp;c.
This is the way this Prelate has of ſetting forth the Papiſts.
And one reaſon why he deals ſo civilly with them, as to
render the <hi>Papiſts</hi> no worſe than <hi>Heathens,</hi> he gives in
his <hi>Preface</hi> to the ſaid Sermon, becauſe <hi>we have the Word
of the King</hi> (ſays he) <hi>to defend our Religion.</hi> An admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
return of this Royal Favor, to perſwade his Majeſties
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65448:14"/>
Subjects, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> are much of a Piece.
And yet This Sermon, is deem'd by this Good Prelate <hi>a
Defence of the truth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pref.</note> and a <hi>very ſeaſonable Intimation of
our</hi> (Proteſtant) <hi>Reſolution of being True and Steddy to our
Laws, Oaths and Duties.—And let the Romaniſts take it
as they pleaſe, they muſt expect a great many ſuch.</hi> And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
as to this, I think his Lordſhip is much in the right;
for a great many ſuch we have met with. But I muſt take
the liberty to tell his Lordſhip, that if this be the <hi>method</hi> of
<hi>defending</hi> his Religion, and an argument of his being <hi>True</hi>
and <hi>Steddy</hi> to his <hi>Duty;</hi> that (beſides a great deal more
that might be ſaid to it) 'tis only done by <hi>Miſrepreſenting;</hi>
and that tho' he's oblig'd to Preach againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> as he
ſays, <hi>to the utmoſt of his Wit and Learning,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pref.</note> that here's no
more <hi>Wit</hi> or <hi>Learning</hi> in this, than what every petty So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſter
might find without much adoe, to make the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,
Turk,</hi> and <hi>Jew</hi> all <hi>one,</hi> becauſe <hi>they all agree, in
maligning and defaming the Papiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However this way of calumniating, his Lordſhip has not
the honor of inventing, 'twas firſt devis'd by thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
the Compilers of the Book of <hi>Homilies,</hi> who beſides
this almoſt word for word, have variety of other Scurrilous
ways, as comparing the Papiſts with the Horſe and the
Aſs, and ſuch like, exactly calculated for the Rabble. 'Twas
afterwards taken up by the Pſalm-makers, who finding <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
to have never a <hi>True-Proteſtant Hymn,</hi> added that of
<hi>From Turk and Pope defend us Lord.</hi> And becauſe this
ſeem'd to ſome of too ſoft a ſtrain, 'Tis ſince rais'd a Note
or two higher, and I think even to <hi>Ela</hi> in a good hearty
Family Prayer to be ſaid Morning and Evening, added to
the end of the ſinging Pſalms in a <hi>Common-Prayer-Book,</hi>
Printed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in the year 1683, in Twelves, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
'tis ſaid <hi>O Lord raiſe up faithful Diſtributers of thy My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries—contrarily,
confound Satan, Antichriſt with all Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
and Papiſts.</hi> Which ſeems the effort of a True-Proteſtant
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65448:15"/>
Charity, not only to link <hi>Satan, Antichriſt,</hi>
and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> together, but to wiſh them all overtaken
with the ſame Confuſion.</p>
            <p>Another way there is, in pretending to declare the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions
of Catholicks, and then to inſert ſomething
that is abſolutely falſe as to the <hi>End</hi> or <hi>Intention,</hi> for which
they perform them: This <hi>the Diſcourſe of the Devotions
of the Church of Rome,</hi> is admirable good at; as <hi>p.</hi> 56.
where ſpeaking of the frequent Repetition of the Names
of <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> in the <hi>Jeſus Pſalter,</hi> &amp;c. he thus gives
the reaſons: <hi>Now their ſaying the ſame thing ſo often over</hi>
(ſays he) <hi>is not contriv'd to help and aſſiſt Devotion, or
prevent Diſtraction, or as a Repetition of what is more
than ordinarily important, or for any other good or prudent
Reaſon; BVT OVT OF PVRE VANITY AND OSTEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TATION,
OR AS IT WERE EVEN TO FLAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER
OVR BLESSED SAVIOUR OR THE SAINT
WHICH THEY PRAY TO.</hi> This is his reaſon he gives
of our Devotion, and 'tis as Heroick a way of defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Truth, by Calumniating with a Magiſterial
Confidence, and throwing dirt blindfold, as ever
I met with. I am ſure 'tis ſo unbecoming, that if he
ſhould with the like poſitiveneſs, interpret any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the <hi>State</hi> or Civil Government, 't would not be
call'd a bare <hi>Miſrepreſenting,</hi> without a—at the end of't.</p>
            <p>But the Biſhop of <hi>Kilmore</hi> will not give way to any in
this kind of dawbing, and if the Papiſts be not black enough,
it ſhall be none of his fault: What he does, is upon Oath
and Duty, and therefor he's the more hearty: And his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
being in <hi>Similitudes,</hi> as he before compar'd the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
with the <hi>Heathens;</hi> ſo now he honors them with the
Compariſon of <hi>Eſop's Dog;</hi> and then ſoon finds a ſtaf to
beat them. <hi>Somethere are</hi> (ſays the Prelate in the ſame
Sermon, <hi>p.</hi> 10.) <hi>Who with</hi> Eſop<hi>'s Dog, ſnatch at the ſhadow
and loſe the ſubſtance;</hi> that is, <hi>place the WHOLE Worſhip
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65448:15"/>
of God in Bodily Exerciſe, and External Adoration; as
howing before a Crucifix, in creeping to a Croſs, in running
a bare-leg'd Pilgrimage,—in hanging down the head for a
day like a Bulruſh,—in Pixes and Paxes and ſuch like frip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries.</hi>
Thus he truly Repreſents the Devotions of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
as he's bound by Oath, and yet without Truth, or
Conſcience. For is it true, that their <hi>WHOLE Worſhip</hi>
of God conſiſts in theſe bodily Exerciſes, as his Lordſhip
calls them? Do they not teach their Followers to Worſhip
God by internal Acts of <hi>Love,</hi> of <hi>Fear,</hi> of <hi>Reverence,</hi> of
<hi>Honor,</hi> of <hi>Reſignation,</hi> by an hearty <hi>Oblation</hi> of all they
have, or are, and that no external Action is acceptable to
God, without the Heart and Soul going along with it?
How comes it then, that their <hi>WHOLE Worſhip</hi> of God is
in theſe <hi>Bodily Exerciſes?</hi> But I muſt not urge too far;
ſpreading of theſe Calumnies his Lordſhip takes for his
<hi>Duty;</hi> and as long as he pretends to His <hi>Majeſties Word,</hi>
for his abuſing us, I muſt be ſilent; tho' I have great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to think, his Lordſhip's miſtaken, and that he ſtretches
His <hi>Majeſties Word</hi> farther than 'twill go.</p>
            <p>Another way there is, in laying on the Colours with ſo
much craft on the <hi>Papiſts Tenets,</hi> that tho' they are the
very ſame with what the moſt <hi>Learned Proteſtants</hi> hold
themſelves; yet they ſhall appear ſo Foul and Monſtrous,
as if nothing leſs than a certain Damnation attended their
Abettors. This is done in ſeveral Inſtances: As when
the <hi>Vncharitableneſs</hi> of the Papiſts is to be the Theam,
and the Alarm to keep the drowſie Flock from nodding;
how Unchriſtian are they rendred, for not allowing Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to any out of their Church, for giving the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
no better portion, but with thoſe on the Left hand
of the Judge! Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> plays this Tune roundly in
his before mention'd Sermon, <hi>p.</hi> 22. Where inveighing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Vncharitableneſs</hi> of the Papiſts, he labours
Heartily to create a good Charitable Averſion in his Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65448:16"/>
towards them. And after he has ſpent ſome pages in
this; he at laſt in a Rapture of Charity concludes, <hi>p.</hi> 27.
<hi>I have ſo much Charity (and I deſire always to have it) as
to hope, that a great many among them, who live Piouſly, and
have been almoſt Enevitably detain'd in that Church by the
prejudice of Education and an invincible Ignorance, will upon
a general Repentance find mercy with God.</hi> One would have
expected, by his earneſt condemning the Papiſts, and the
Preamble of this Concluſion, to have met with ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Piece of Charity, both for the Reformation
and example of the Papiſts; and yet after all the outcry
and buſtle, he wont allow one more grain of mercy to the
Papiſts, than the Papiſts do to them; that is, only to ſuch,
who having liv'd piouſly, and truly Repented of their ſins,
have an <hi>Invincible Ignorance</hi> to atone for all other errors
of the Underſtanding; which is the very Doctrin of the
Papiſts in reſpect of ſuch, who die out of the Communion
of their Church. But now whether Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> has
even ſo much Charity as this for the Papiſts, 'tis not eaſie
to tell. For he declares poſitively, that all thoſe who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
<hi>Popery, muſt, by the terms of Communion with that
Church, be guilty either of Hypocriſie or Idolatry;</hi> either
of which are ſins inconſiſtent with Salvation. Now if the
Doctor were Judge, what are become of the poor Papiſts?
Are not they all damn'd in the Lump? And yet this is the
<hi>Proteſtant Charity,</hi> which condemns the <hi>Papiſts</hi> for <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs.</hi>
To ſay the Papiſts muſt be guilty of ſins
<hi>inconſiſtent with Salvation,</hi> is but to ſay they <hi>are Damn'd</hi>
in another Phraſe. And if the Doctor can find any expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to ſave them after this, he muſt make Heaven gate as
wide as the <hi>Portico</hi> to the Turkiſh Paradiſe, where there's
paſſage for the Dog, the Camel and the Whale. Thus when
Proteſtants and Papiſts ſay the ſame thing of each other,
'tis ſtrange how Antichriſtianly-black the Papiſts are made,
when the Proteſtants have the laying on the Colors.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:65448:16"/>
            <p>Another way yet there is, in undertaking to declare the
Tenets of Catholicks; and after having rak'd together
ſome odd and extravagant Opinions of ſome Authors, to
ſet them down for the receiv'd Doctrin of the Church;
and 'tis preſently <hi>true Repreſenting,</hi> if there be but an
<hi>Author</hi>'s Name to ſupport the pretence; and moſt eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if the ſaid Author be allow'd and not condemn'd after
the publiſhing. This is a moſt faſhionable way, trodden
hard in Books and Pulpits. The Arch-Biſhop of <hi>York</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
it mightily. And ſo if he can but cite <hi>Bulgradus,
Veſſel. Grovingenſ.</hi> or <hi>Diſt.</hi> 96. that's enough to make
any Extravagancy to paſs for an Article of Faith: And
then if the thing happen to be diſprov'd and ſhewn a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation,
'tis at leaſt a <hi>Popiſh Miſrepreſentation;</hi> and
this ſerves ſtill to promote the Cauſe, to make the Papiſts
odious. This is a Method ſo unwarrantable, that if fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
by all Parties alike, in expoſing their Adverſaries,
'twould ſoon make all Chriſtendom, only ſo many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
of Infidels. One little Example will clear this.
For ſuppoſe now any <hi>Popiſh Preacher</hi> in his Pulpit beyond
Sea, in a Country where his Auditory underſtands but
little what <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are, ſhould let ſlip his Text, and
following our Mooiſh way, ſhould be ſo unjuſt to his Flock,
as not to ſpend his Glaſs in inſtructing them in their Duty,
or reforming their Lives; but making uſe of ſome little
Arts, ſhould place his main endeavour in provoking them
to a good hearty averſion againſt <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> and ſhould
thus expoſe them: My Dear Chriſtians, ſtick faſt to the
Truth of the Goſpel, preach'd by Chriſt and his Apoſtles,
and deliver'd down to you by a continual Succeſſion of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
and Teachers, and the Practice of the Faithful in all
Ages: But above all, beware of ſuch, who make <hi>Diviſions</hi>
and <hi>Schiſms</hi> in the Church of God, ſuch as cry out, <hi>Chriſt,
Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Reformation,</hi> but are nothing but the Fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of Antichriſt. Theſe call themſelves <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65448:17"/>
Name you have ſcarce heard of, as being no where in
Scripture, Fathers, nor Antiquity; but their wicked Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and Practices have fill'd the whole Earth. They
have out-done even the Heathens, and thoſe that know
not God, in all ſorts of Wickedneſs and Impiety: And
this the few Good Men that are amongſt them own them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
One Eminent for his Writings, and known by the
<hi>Author of the Whole Duty of Man,</hi> confeſſes it to them
and the World,<note place="margin">Deeay of Chriſtian Piety.</note> that they have <hi>broken down not only the
banks of RELIGION, but of CIVILITY too: And
ſo univerſal a depravation is there,</hi> ſays he, <hi>amongſt us, that
we have ſcarce any thing left, to diſtinguiſh us from the moſt
Barbarous People, but a better Name, and worſe Vices.</hi>
Do you ſee how under the pretence of <hi>Reforming,</hi> they
have brought Corruption into the World, that even they
themſelves own it, and yet go on, under an empty Title,
of being the Choſen People of <hi>God?</hi> This ſame thing is
confeſs'd and own'd almoſt in the ſame words, by another
Good Man now of late, who before his Prelate in a Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
Sermon, delivers it for Goſpel, that they are ſo
wicked, that they cannot be thought the Servants of God:
<hi>We can never</hi> (ſays he) <hi>make them</hi> (our Enemies) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that we are the Servants of the Living God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sermon at the Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> by <hi>Sam. Criſp. 1686. p.</hi> 25</note> 
               <hi>or have
a juſt ſenſe of Devotion, while they ſee that we have nothing
to diſtinguiſh us from the Worſhippers of a Falſe God, but
a Better Name and Worſe Vices.</hi> But then, that you may
neither doubt of the truth of this, nor yet wonder at it,
he gives a ſufficient Reaſon in the ſame Sermon, where he
ſays, that their <hi>Guides</hi> and <hi>Miniſters,</hi> who ſhould lead
and direct them to Good, do inſtead of this, encourage
them to Vice and Faction. <hi>When the Clergy themſelves</hi>
(ſays he, p. 14.) <hi>have given EXAMPLE and
ENCOURAGEMENT to Men, to break the Churches
Laws, and contemn her Authority, no wonder that VICE
and FACTION appear inſolent and daring.</hi> You ſee
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65448:17"/>
then, they have not the Fear of God in their Hearts nor
Actions, and you ſee the Reaſon of it. This is all hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
in reſpect chiefly of <hi>God;</hi> but now in reſpect of their
<hi>Neighbour,</hi> they have no Charity for any, that are not of
their mind; but for their <hi>own Brethren,</hi> they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
bound to help and aſſiſt them, tho' engag'd in the
fouleſt of <hi>Villanies</hi> and <hi>Crimes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus when the <hi>Scots,</hi> under pretext of Reforming Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
had invaded their Prince's Authority, and by the
Preaching of <hi>John Knox and other head-ſtrong Miniſters,</hi>
ſays their own Author, had been perſuaded, <hi>that it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
to them to reduce by force their Prince to the preſcript
of Laws;</hi> and wanting ſome aſſiſtance to effect it, they
ſent to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> for Aid. And here what ſays
Sir <hi>Rich. Baker,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sir</hi> Rich. Baker, p. 475. <hi>Printed</hi> An. 1653.</note> a Proteſtant Hiſtorian? Amongſt other
Conſiderations, <hi>It ſeem'd no leſs,</hi> ſays he, <hi>than an IMPIETY
not to give aid to the Proteſtants of the ſame Religion.</hi> So
that tho' they are confeſs'd by him, to have <hi>pretended</hi>
only a Reformation, not by chance; but rather <hi>plotted of
purpoſe,</hi> according to the Suggeſtion of <hi>Head-ſtrong Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi>
to incroach upon the Prerogative of the Crown;
and to demand aid from abroad, by violence to reduce
their Prince, (which is to be as great Traytors as can be)
yet 'tis an <hi>Impiety</hi> (ſays he) not to help them in their
Rebellion, ſince they are Brethren of the ſame Perſuaſion:
Holy Brethren believe me, thus to deem it a Duty to joyn
hands in Rebellion, and to be Traytors for Religion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake!</p>
            <p>You ſee what their Doctrin is in regard of Foreign
Princes. And do you think they have any better reſpect
for their own? Yes, if He be of their Religion, and
thinks as they think. Otherwiſe they'l beg his Pardon:
as now if he ſhould be a <hi>Popiſh</hi> one, for Example; what
deference would they have for him? You may learn it
from one of their own Leaders in the Goſpel, who with a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65448:18"/>
very Remarkable <hi>NOVERINT,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jovian, p. 96.</note> or <hi>BE IT KNOWN,</hi>
delivers a Doctrin of a moſt rare piece of Gallantry,
with a moſt admirable Reſolution of confronting ſuch a
Prince <hi>to his face,</hi> and making the <hi>contempt</hi> of him a <hi>Duty.</hi>
And that none may queſtion in the leaſt this their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful
Divinity, this Author delives it yet plainer in
another Place (<hi>p.</hi> 80.) Where making a Diſcourſe with
ſome proſpect of a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor;</hi> He thus openly ſpeaks
their common ſenſe: <hi>So far</hi> (ſays he) <hi>are all thoſe, who
are ſo tender of the Succeſſion, from having any tenderneſs
for a Popiſh Succeſſor, that they dread him like the PLAGVE,
and therefore would have had Proviſional Laws made, to
bind up ſuch an One, and put him under very CLOSE
LEGAL CONFINEMENT, in caſe he ſhould be
King.</hi> This is what the better and moſt Loyal Part of
them, were willing to afford ſuch a Prince; but for the
others; <hi>Nothing would ſerve</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
but an Act of EXCLVSION, back'd with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for an ASSOCIATION.</hi> Do you ſee, my Dear
Flock, what new ſort of Chriſtians theſe are, what their
<hi>Charity,</hi> what their <hi>Loyalty;</hi> what they look upon their
<hi>Duty;</hi> How far the <hi>Beſt</hi> of them can go, how far the
<hi>Worſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well might that <hi>One</hi> Good Man confeſs, that they
have broken down the Banks not only of <hi>RELIGION,</hi>
but of <hi>CIVILITY</hi> too; and that their Vices are more
heinous than thoſe of the moſt Barbarous People. And
what he confeſs'd, you your ſelves have now ſeen prov'd,
to the ſcandal of the Chriſtian Name, out of their own
Authors; and thoſe not obſcure ones, or rak'd out of the
Duſt; but of the moſt Eminent amongſt them, to be
found in all hands, read every where, and never reprov'd
or condemn'd by any; ſo that you have all the reaſon in
the World to conclude, that 'tis the ſenſe of their Church,
whatſoever ſome of the more ſubtle of them may pretend
to the contrary.</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:65448:18"/>
            <p>But I muſt not harangue too long, I know it will not
pleaſe; and really it even nauſeates me even in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to carry on a piece of Sophiſtry, which I have ſeen and
heard ſo often practic'd in earneſt, in the weightieſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
by the Sobereſt Men, and in the moſt Sacred Places.
This will ſuffice, to let any conſidering Man ſee, what uſe
may be made of Authors; how eaſie 'tis to make any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Odious to the Multitude, and however Chriſtian it may
be, yet with how little difficulty it may be Painted as
Black as Hell, if a Man will be ſo unjuſt, as to paſs theſe
kind of <hi>Miſrepreſenting</hi> Arguments upon the People for
the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the Methods, by which the Papiſts
have been Miſrepreſented, in relation to their Tenets of
<hi>Doctrin</hi> and <hi>Belief;</hi> now I muſt take another ſhort turn,
and examine, how many ways, the Papiſts have been
Miſrepreſented, in relation to ſome matters of <hi>Fact</hi> and
<hi>Hiſtory;</hi> and by that time, I hope, the Reader will diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
whether it be without reaſon, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of being <hi>Miſrepreſented.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One way there is in letting <hi>Avarice, Envy,</hi> or <hi>Malice</hi>
give ill Names to things, and then paſſing them upon the
Crowd for no better, than they are thus ſtamp'd by theſe
<hi>Paſſions.</hi> This was a method very ſerviceable in the time
of the <hi>Reformation;</hi> when there was no need of more,
than nick-naming the moſt Sacred things, and preſently
they became Unhallow'd. Thus we find related by Dr. <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyn;</hi>
The Grandees of the Court, caſting many an envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Eye upon the Rich Hangings, the Maſſy Plate, and
other things, which adorn'd the Altars in thoſe times, did
no more than call them <hi>Corruptions,</hi> and preſently they
were no longer fit for <hi>Churches,</hi> but only for <hi>Private uſe,</hi>
and ſeis'd them. The Candleſticks, Crucifixes and Shrines
had <hi>Superſtition</hi> ſtamp'd on them, and forthwith were made
a ſpoil. The Protector <hi>Somerſet</hi> did no more than pitch
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65448:19"/>
upon Three Epiſcopal Houſes, Four or Five Churches, a
Chappel and Charnel houſe of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, and calls them
<hi>Superfluous;</hi> and they are immediately blown up, and
make proper Materials for his New Palace <hi>Somerſet-houſe.</hi>
St. <hi>Margarets-Weſtminſter</hi> too was condemn'd to the ſame
fate, upon the ſentence of <hi>Vnneceſſary:</hi> But the Workmen
that were ſent to demoliſh it, being diſturb'd by the Clubs
and Staves of the Pariſhioners, 'twas again judg'd <hi>Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi>
for their uſe. This was the Method in thoſe Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
times, when, as we may read in <hi>Heylyn, Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Ambition,</hi> and <hi>Envy</hi> ſet up for removing <hi>Corruptions</hi>
out of the Church; when <hi>Profit</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> was to give
Orders, and <hi>Violence</hi> to Execute; when <hi>Sacriledge</hi> and
<hi>Rapine</hi> were the beſt means for the bringing in the Purity
of the Goſpel. But becauſe this may be all ſeen at large
in ſome <hi>Hiſtorical Collections gather'd out of Proteſtant Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,</hi>
lately Publiſh'd, Ile remit the Reader to them,
where he'l eaſily diſcover how conſiderably the Art of
<hi>Miſrepreſenting</hi> contributed to the outing of Popery.</p>
            <p>This ſame method it was that King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth,
<hi>Luther,</hi> &amp;c. made uſe of, when by <hi>Luxury</hi> and <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine</hi>
they began to reform the Extravagancies of their
times, and make way apace for <hi>Proteſtantiſm</hi> to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the World. If the Pope will not conſent to the Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Paſſions of that Prince, and permit him to take a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Wife, while his firſt is alive; the <hi>Power,</hi> that is the
Curb to his Luſt, is forthwith <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> tis a <hi>Vſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>Foreign Power;</hi> and with ſuch hard names, tis
rendred as odious to the People, as 'twas to him; who by
this means throwing it off, paſſes for a Good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
amidſt his Vile Extravagancies. If <hi>Luther</hi> has a
mind to Marry, and his <hi>Vow</hi> of <hi>Chaſtity</hi> ſtands in his way,
he do's no more than nick-name it a little, calling it a <hi>Raſh</hi>
and <hi>Inconſiderate Vow,</hi> and he's as free to Marry as the
beſt of them; his Vow is no farther a Let to him, and he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65448:19"/>
now contracts according to the Preſcript of the Goſpel.
And if he thinks a <hi>Nun</hi> will make the beſt <hi>Wife;</hi> he do's
no more than make her Vow as <hi>Fooliſh</hi> as his, and the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
is effected without any more ado, no farther Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
they forthwith become a moſt <hi>Evangelical couple.</hi>
This ſame way we have ſeen trod over of late by Honeſt
<hi>Sir William,</hi> who by the Name of <hi>Popiſh Trinckets</hi> and
<hi>Trumpery,</hi> made a ſpoil of Chalices, Croſſes, the Images
of Chriſt and his Saints; and by a rare knack of turning
Guineas into Medals; Pearl-Necklaces into Beads; and
Watches into Relick-Caſes, made them fit for Seiſure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Law,</hi> to the great benefit of the Practicioner,
and much edifying of his Brethren, who could not but
have a holy envy for his Zeal.</p>
            <p>Another way there is in telling a Story to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the Cauſe, in putting that ſide outwards as will
ſerve turn beſt, and keeping under-board whatſoever is
not for the purpoſe; and ſometimes tis only the turn of
the hand, the winding of the breath, a pat Phraſe, and
preſently a <hi>Devil</hi>'s made of any thing. Thus when
Sir <hi>Rich.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Baker</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Baker</hi> has a mind to Paint Queen <hi>Mary</hi> deep in
Blood, he thus Tragically begins: <hi>Hitherto Queen</hi> Maries
<hi>Reign had been without Blood: but now the Cataracts of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
will be opened, that will make it rain Blood.</hi> Thus
he draws the lines of Antichriſt in her Face: And ſee upon
what ſcore; <hi>For now,</hi> ſays he, <hi>on the Eighth of</hi> Auguſt
<hi>the Duke of</hi> Northumberland, <hi>Marqueſs of</hi> Northampton,
<hi>and Earl of</hi> Warwick, <hi>were Arraigned at</hi> Weſtminſter-Hall
Condemned and Executed for High Treaſon, for
Proclaiming the Lady <hi>Jane Gray</hi> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to the true Heireſs. And this, which in a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi>
Prince, on the like occaſion, is termed <hi>the executing
of Juſtice, giving deſerv'd puniſhment to Traytors,</hi> &amp;c. in
<hi>Queen Mary</hi> is nothing leſs than the <hi>opening Cataracts of
Severity, and the raining of Blood.</hi> This ſame Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65448:20"/>
Artifice is made uſe of on all occaſions, in every
thing relating to Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> Nothing can be heard of,
when her Reign is made the proof of the Text, but <hi>Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Blood, Fire, Faggots, Stakes, Smithfield;</hi> nothing can
ſerve to parallel thoſe times, but the perſecutions of <hi>Decius</hi>
and <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> and ſhe is ſo in all things ſet out, as if little
better than a Heathen, and ſwimming in the Blood of
of the Martyrs. This is her Picture. But if we ſhould
view it a little, and conſider, whether ſhe has no wrong
done her; might not we ask; What, and how much this
Blood was, what the occaſion of its being ſpilt, and what
the Provocation given? And here we ſhall have an account
of ſome Proteſtant behavior: of Praying for the death of
their Queen in Meetings, that God would ſhorten her days;
of a Gun ſhot at her Preacher in the Pulpit, of Cats hung
on Gallows, with their Heads ſhorn, and ſomething like
Veſtments, in deriſion of her Prieſts; of a Dog held up
in the Church by the Legs, in deriſion of the Elevation of
the Hoſt; a gallantry of one of <hi>Fox</hi>'s Martyrs; of ſeveral
other provocations by Tumults, Seditions, and Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
And that after this, for the ſecurity of her Crown,
She put in execution Laws not made by Her, but enacted
long before by her Anceſtors <hi>Rich. 2. Hen. 4, &amp;</hi> 5. Now
one would think to be juſt to Crown'd Heads, the <hi>Blood</hi>
ſhould not be expos'd <hi>alone</hi> to the People; but likewiſe the
<hi>occaſions</hi> and <hi>provocations</hi> given, even according to <hi>Law,</hi>
and then let things go as far as they will: but to Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
the Papiſts, Stories muſt be Told and Preached by
<hi>halves;</hi> otherwiſe they will turn to no account with the
People, and ſerve nothing to the Intereſt of the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>But to ſee now how much there go's in the telling a
Story: Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> put to death Two hundred perſons
upon the ſcore of Conſcience, without any actual Crime
or Miſdemeanor againſt the <hi>Ancient Statutes</hi> of the Land,
but only againſt the <hi>Law</hi> of her own contriving; a Law
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65448:20"/>
ſo cruel, that the like is ſcarce to be found even among the
Mahometans, who tho' they have conquer'd many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Nations, yet never, as I have heard of, made it
Treaſon for the Natives, to profeſs their own Religion, or
maintain their Paſtors. And tho' this and much more
was done by this Princeſs, yet ſhe is ſet forth with that
advantage, that ſhe is a <hi>Meek, Merciful, Tender-hearted,
Saintlike, true-Proteſtant Queen:</hi> While her <hi>Siſter,</hi> who
put to death not Three hundred, of which number, thoſe
of the greateſt Note were Traytors in the higheſt Degree,
others Guilty of the moſt intollerable abuſes both to
Church and State, and liable to death by the <hi>Ancient,</hi> and
known <hi>Laws</hi> of the Nation; ſuch as Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi> and
Dr. <hi>Pocklington</hi> both Proteſtants, in their Book Licenſed
and ſet forth by Authority ſtile <hi>Schiſmatical Hereticks,
Factious Fellows, Traytors</hi> and <hi>Rebels,</hi> and She is no better
than a <hi>Cruel, Bloody, Hard-hearted, Popiſh Tyrant.</hi> Thus
according to this Reform'd Method, there needs no more
for the making a <hi>Proteſtant Saint</hi> or a <hi>Popiſh Fiend,</hi> than a
little turn of the breath, and the meer knack of making the
<hi>Narrative:</hi> And if there be not <hi>Miſrepreſenting</hi> in this, I
never heard of any.</p>
            <p>Another way there is in ſpreading the guilt of ſome few
Papiſts upon the whole of that Communion; ſo that if
any of them are catch'd in a Villany, 'tis immediately
ſuggeſted, that what Theſe did, was according to the
Principles of their Religion, and not ſo much to be charg'd
on them in particular, as on their Church, which encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
them to ſuch wicked undertakings. After this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the <hi>Powder. Plot</hi> is manag'd, which tho' it was in all
likelyhood a contrivance of the good Lord <hi>Cecil</hi> (as <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne</hi>
a Proteſtant Hiſtorian plainly confeſſes,)<note place="margin">K. <hi>J.</hi> p. 36.</note> yet becauſe
a few Papiſts were prov'd Actors in it, the guilt is forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
thrown upon the whole body of them, their <hi>Religion</hi>
Calumniated, and they Condemn'd as Deſtructive to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65448:21"/>
and unfit to live under a Proteſtant Prince. Now
however it may be nothing but truth, that <hi>Digby, Faux</hi>
and their complices were as black with this Treaſon, as
they are commonly Painted; yet hence to ſpread the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
upon the <hi>Papiſts</hi> without diſtinction, to cry out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Bloody Papiſts,</hi> the <hi>Barbarous Papiſts,</hi> and by
ſuch <hi>innuendos</hi> to incenſe the Multitude, and lead them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
falſe conceits, that this was a deſign of the Catholicks
in general, according to their profeſs'd Principles and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin,
is an unwarrantable proceeding, unbecoming the
Desk, and nothing better than a Miſrepreſentation: Yes
as unjuſt a Miſrepreſentation, as it wou'd be in any one at
this day, who to drive on a Faction, ſhould get up into
the Pulpit, with the <hi>Bible</hi> in hand; and after having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
a large diſplay of the Trayterous, Bloody, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane
doings of the late Rebels in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> ſhould at
laſt throw it upon the Church of <hi>England;</hi> crying out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Bloody <hi>Church of</hi> England-<hi>men, the Cruel Church
of</hi> England-<hi>men,</hi> their Rebellious Principles, abominable
Doctrins, and Practices of Men not to be tolerated in a
Monarchical Government; and this becauſe he proves the
<hi>Duke</hi> that Headed that Rebellion, to have been a Member
of that Church, with ſome others that joyn'd hands with
him. For be it never ſo true, that ſome were thus really
chargeable with this Rebellion, nay, that at their deaths
they never own'd it as a Crime; (which yet the <hi>Powder
Plotters</hi> did) yet ſtill to charge the guilt upon the <hi>whole</hi> of
that Communion, can be done no otherwiſe, than by the
faſhionable Artifice of Miſrepreſenting.</p>
            <p>Another way there is in putting malitious Conſtructions
upon indifferent things, and running down a Party upon
falſe ſurmiſes. This was the Caſe of the Papiſts ſome
years ſince; When they enjoying a little reſt by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
Indulgence of the late King of Bleſſed Memory; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
on a Sudden they are rendred obnoxious to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65448:21"/>
as abuſing the Royal Favor, and Plotting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his Majeſties Subjects. A great quantity of <hi>long
diveliſh Knives</hi> are diſcover'd, made on purpoſe by the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi>
for the cutting all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Throats; this was
the Proteſtant cry, and thus was the matter fairly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
by them. Upon this the Papiſts, the Cruel
Bloody Papiſts are to be no longer ſuffer'd, their Prieſts
are order'd into Baniſhment, and ſo the point was gain'd.
When the whole truth of the Story, was only ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
of Knives made publickly, to be tranſported for the
uſe of the <hi>Plantations.</hi> But this ſerv'd the Proteſtant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt;
and the Peoples heads by this are full of the Bloody-minded
Papiſts.</p>
            <p>Another way is by making a <hi>Plot</hi> of <hi>every thing.</hi> Thus
in the year 1666.<note place="margin">In the Plates of Common-Prayer-Book Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> An. 1680.</note> was that dreadful Judgment of the <hi>Fire</hi>
improv'd into a <hi>Plot</hi> of the Papiſts. How many Papiſts
were taken with Fire-balls in their Pockets? How many
apprehended in the very Act of throwing Fire-balls into
Windows? How many Thouſand Papiſts were in Arms
at <hi>Temple-bar,</hi> and the Country allarm'd to ſuppreſs them?
And at the latter end, not one word of all this true; but
only a true Proteſtant Repreſentation of a thing that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was: And yet very much to the purpoſe of enraging
the multitude againſt the Cruel, Bloody Papiſts. For by
the frequent buzzing of theſe kind of Goſpel-truths, the
Vulgar within a while became ſo throughly convinc'd of
the damnable induſtry of the Papiſts in throwing Fire-balls,
that they began to think, that Heaven it ſelf could
not now conſume a <hi>Proteſtant Sodom,</hi> without making
uſe of a <hi>Jeſuits</hi> hand to throw the <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Brimſtone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No Fire therefore happens after this, but the <hi>Papiſts</hi>
have a hand in't: If <hi>Southwark</hi> be Fired, 'tis the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Papiſts</hi> do it; if the <hi>Temple</hi> be Burnt, 'tis the Deviliſh
<hi>Papiſts</hi> are blowing the Coals. And thus theſe repeated
Miſrepreſentations are made uſe of, to create an averſion
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65448:22"/>
in the Peoples hearts againſt Popery; and are the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
proofs to convince the Multitude, that its Doctrin
and Practices come all out of the School of Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>Another Text out of the ſame Goſpel, was that Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
Miſrepreſentation, of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> contriving the
Death of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt. This was an unparallel'd
Barbarity Acted in the face of the Sun: the Actors and
Contrivers are as publick as the noon-light, and yet thoſe
who at other times are Scrupulous of diſtruſting their
<hi>Senſes</hi> in a Caſe where God himſelf ſpeaks; here in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to all their <hi>Senſes,</hi> in contradiction to all that was
<hi>ſeen</hi> and <hi>heard,</hi> give credit to a <hi>Monſieur's</hi> Invention, who
comes out of <hi>France</hi> with a Tale, and lays this Royal Blood
at the <hi>Papiſts</hi> doors. But this ſtill ſerves the purpoſe, the
deeper the Papiſts are Painted in Blood, the more the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are convinc'd of the truth of the Reformation.</p>
            <p>Another way is by making a <hi>Plot</hi> of <hi>nothing:</hi> Thus it
happened in the year 1679, When the People having been
by theſe and a Thouſand other ſuch like Goſpel-policies,
moſt Apoſtolically ſatisfied of the Principles of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious,
Trayterous, Barberous, Cruel, Bloody-minded
Papiſts: And being now ſo moulded and diſpos'd, that
nothing could ſeem incredible concerning Thoſe, that
were thus deteſtable and odious, outcomes the <hi>Garagantua
Miſrepreſentation</hi> of them all, that is the <hi>Divine Oates,</hi>
with his <hi>Popiſh Plot.</hi> And here the Papiſts are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd
with that fury, that never were poor People in
greater diſtreſs. The Plot was as dark and confus'd as
the <hi>Chaos,</hi> its monſtroſities were beyond all the Fables of the
<hi>Talmud</hi> or <hi>Alcoran;</hi> that 'tis impoſſible even to be related,
without a touch of that madneſs, that then poſſes'd the
Nation. And yet the whole was receiv'd with that wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
and credit, that what would have been queſtion'd in
the very <hi>Scripture,</hi> was entertain'd without any Scruple:
The <hi>Dr.</hi> having a grant of <hi>that Power,</hi> which is denyed
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65448:22"/>
even to Heaven it ſelf, that is, <hi>of verifying contradictions.</hi>
'Tis ſtrange to conſider, how eaſie it was then to ſwallow
<hi>Screw'd Guns, Handkerchiefs</hi> and <hi>Pillowbers;</hi> with how
little difficulty Troops of <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> and whole Armies
with their <hi>Black-bills</hi> went down. And why all this wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to <hi>Fictions</hi> and <hi>Nonſence?</hi> Only to defeat Antichriſt,
and to root out <hi>Popery.</hi> A rare new way, I confeſs, of
fighting againſt the Devil (as 'twas pretended) with his
<hi>own Weapons.</hi> But Miſrepreſenting do's always the beſt
Execution againſt the Papiſts; and therefore the <hi>Plot</hi> is
carried on with all poſſible Vigor and Zeal. But hitherto
only of the leaſt part of theſe Plots and Miſrepreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the chief is yet to come, and that is the carrying up
of theſe Inventions of Wicked men into the Pulpit, and
thence with the <hi>Finger</hi> in the <hi>Bible,</hi> and a Preamble of
<hi>Hearken to the Word of the Lord,</hi> diſpenſing them to the
People for <hi>Truths.</hi> Theſe are the Miſrepreſentations above
all juſtly to be complain'd of, that into That Place, which
ought to be ſet apart as <hi>Sacred,</hi> for inſtructing the People
to Salvation, and ſowing the Seed of Gods Holy Word,
ſuch things ſhould be prefer'd, as had nothing of truth in
them: Nay, that what Ungodly men reported, vouch'd
and ſwore to, to the evident Peril of their Souls Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſhould take place with the holy Text, ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated
into the People for Truths, nay be confirm'd by
proofs of the Goſpel, and be deliver'd out, as ſomething re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the way to Heaven: So that what was <hi>Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
at the <hi>Bar,</hi> became <hi>Salvation</hi> from the <hi>Pulpit.</hi> And all
this not in any <hi>indifferent</hi> matter, but in a concern of <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
Reputation, Honeſty,</hi> and <hi>Life;</hi> and this not of <hi>one</hi> Man
(which yet would have been a great impiety thus to have
defam'd from the Pulpit) but of <hi>many Families</hi> of many
Thouſands.</p>
            <p>I will not enlarge upon a matter ſo Odious, ſo Unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
as this. I hope this hint will be enough for the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:65448:23"/>
to conſider, that 'twas none of the greateſt Modeſty
in him to brag, how clear <hi>WE were from charging the
Papiſts with ſaying or doing, what they never ſay'd or did.</hi>
When theſe <hi>Innocent WE</hi> have done all this againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
and Fifty times more into the bargain. For this
is only a Taſt of what may be done at large, if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd,
for our Juſtification; it being no great Task inſtead
of ſo many Sheets upon this Subject, to furniſh out ſo
many Volumes.</p>
            <p>But I forbear at preſent, and will only call upon the
Reader to conſider; That if <hi>Miſrepreſenting,</hi> be, what
'tis agreed upon above, viz. <hi>to ſet falſe Conſtructions, to
alter or change the Motives, End, Intention or Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Things;</hi> Whether the Papiſts have not ſome Reaſon
to cry out againſt this Unchriſtian Dealing; when (as it
has been made appear) there is ſcarce any thing belonging
to them, either as to their <hi>Faith</hi> or Practice, wherein
they have not been wrong'd by Adverſaries, and which
has not been injuriouſly ſet forth to the People, under ſome
of theſe Disguiſes.</p>
            <p>For my part, the whole matter is ſo clear to me, that
I do not at all wonder at the Temper of our People at this
day in reſpect of <hi>Popery,</hi> who have a notion of it in their
heads ſo Foul and Monſtrous; that to be a <hi>Papiſt</hi> with
them, is the ſame thing as to be <hi>Cruel,</hi> and <hi>Bloody,</hi> to be
without Soul or Conſcience, and to be given o're to all
ſorts of vice and Extravagancy. And that <hi>Papiſt,</hi> who is
thought by them only a <hi>Fool</hi> or an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> is highly
in their Favor. Some indeed have not yet concluded,
which is worſe, the <hi>Turk</hi> or the <hi>Papiſt;</hi> and are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
which ſide ſhall have their <hi>Good Wiſhes;</hi> whilſt others
at firſt ſight prefer the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and think Them of
the Two, the nearer allied to <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> Then for the
<hi>Jews,</hi> they are ſtill more agreeable than the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and
for a Man to turn <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> is tolerable enough; A <hi>Green-Ribband-Man</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:65448:23"/>
is much more ſuitable: Yes any thing, Good
Lord, but a <hi>Papiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it ſtands with the <hi>People,</hi> and amongſt them may
take place as to this, many a <hi>Grave</hi> and <hi>Sober</hi> Face. But
that they are of this Temper, I do not (I ſay) at all won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
For when I conſider the manner how the <hi>Papiſts</hi>
have been treated; that Ten thouſand Pulpits have been
for many years declaiming againſt them; where every
Man has had a liberty of expoſing them as he pleas'd, as
was moſt taking with his Auditory, and beſt ſuiting with
the <hi>Times:</hi> Where every Man has repreſented Their
<hi>Doctrin,</hi> as he pleas'd; has charg'd it with what <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences</hi>
and <hi>Interpretations,</hi> he pleas'd; has expos'd their
<hi>Practices,</hi> as he pleas'd; has put on them what <hi>Conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
he pleas'd; has expounded their <hi>Authors,</hi> as he pleas'd;
has made <hi>Narratives</hi> of them, as he pleas'd; has made
them as <hi>Guilty,</hi> as he pleas'd; has made <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Goſpel</hi>
of any thing againſt them, as he pleas'd. That beſides this,
infinite numbers of Pamphlets and other Books have been
conſtantly and carefully Publiſh'd, for the promoting the
ſame Cauſe, for encreaſing <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Jealouſies,</hi> advancing
<hi>Suſpitions,</hi> and obliging the People to a <hi>Conſciencious Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred</hi>
of <hi>Popery:</hi> When I conſider, I ſay, this, and reflect
upon the many other ways, by which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have
been handled, left to the <hi>Mercy</hi> of every Pretender, and
made to be that, which every <hi>Weak, Idle, Paſſionate</hi> or
<hi>Malicious</hi> Brain thought fit to make them; 'tis no ſtrange
thing at all to find the <hi>People</hi> to have a leſs averſion againſt
the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> than againſt the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and that
all the moſt <hi>horrid Sins</hi> againſt the <hi>Twelve Commandments</hi>
together, are not half ſo <hi>Foul</hi> and <hi>Damning</hi> with them,
as that <hi>one</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi> (as they conceive it) is by it ſelf.
For theſe <hi>Means</hi> that have been taken to effect this, are
ſo well proportion'd to this end, and do ſo naturally work
People into this <hi>Averſion</hi> and <hi>Hatred;</hi> that were <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:65448:24"/>
it ſelf treated and expos'd to the People for ſome
years, in the ſame <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>method</hi> only, as <hi>Popery</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
has been, I am confident, 'twould be the ſame crime
within a while with them, to become a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as now
'tis to turn <hi>Papiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the mean time this Method is ſo <hi>Vnjuſt</hi> and ſo
unbecoming all true Chriſtian Candor, under which, the
Papiſts have been ſuffering theſe ſo many years, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
in Charity wiſh it to befal the Worſt of Enemies. And
did Charity allow me to ſeek any expedient for the ruin
of any ones <hi>Credit</hi> and <hi>Reputation,</hi> and rendring him the
Object of a <hi>Popular Hatred,</hi> I would conſult no farther,
but only deſire he might take his portion with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi>
and be treated no worſe than they have been all along, by
their adverſaries. After what manner this has been, I hope
the Conſidering Reader, who has perus'd what has been
already ſaid in this Diſcourſe, do's by this time compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.
I gave ſome hint of it before in a former Anſwer,
call'd the <hi>Amicable Accommodation,</hi> in which under the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of a <hi>Diſſenter</hi> arguing againſt and Defaming the <hi>Church
of</hi> England, I diſcover'd in what manner the Papiſts are
handled, by the Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>But this is taken by ſome by the wrong handle, and
therefore can afford it no better a Title than of <hi>Light,
Scurrilous,</hi> and <hi>Jeſting,</hi> and are willing to perſuade their
Readers,<note place="margin">Def. of the Expoſ. of the Doct. of the Ch. of <hi>Eng,</hi> p. 85, 86.</note> that the Character of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as
'tis there drawn, is nothing better than a <hi>Controverſial
Lampoon;</hi> and that ſince <hi>every Idle word</hi> is to be given ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of, what apprehenſions ought the Author of it to
be ſeiz'd with, who inſtead of having any True Zeal for
Truth, has made a Droll of Religion, widens the Diviſions
of the Church, and finds a harmony in her groans! This
is a very ſevere Charge; but the Comfort is, I am in good
Company; for 'tis not only the <hi>Amicable Accommodation</hi>
ſtands thus endited, but the <hi>Vindication of the Biſhop of</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:65448:24"/>
Meaux, and <hi>the Defence of the Late Kings Papers,</hi> which (if any one will
be ſo Civil, as to take this Authors word for'r) do's not <hi>Vindicate,</hi> but <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule;</hi>
and is both void of <hi>Charity</hi> to his <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> and of <hi>reſpect</hi> to
the <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> He defends.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, he has urg'd the charge againſt them all, in the bittereſt
expreſſions imaginable: Nothing is heard of in Two whole pages, but
of their art of <hi>Palliating,</hi> want of <hi>Fairneſs</hi> and <hi>Civility,</hi> laying aſide
<hi>Moderation,</hi> falling into <hi>a vein of Lightneſs and Scurrility,</hi> forgetting
<hi>that Religion is the Subject, and Chriſtians and Scholars their Antagoniſts.</hi>
Their <hi>Mean Reflections</hi> and <hi>Trivial jeſtings,</hi> their <hi>Ridiculing,</hi> their want
of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Reſpect,</hi> their Writings <hi>Accommodated to the Genius of
Sceptics, who divert themſelves at the expence of all Religion;</hi> and being
not <hi>deſign'd to ſatisfie the Sober and Conſciencious of either Side,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now what This Author ſeems here at <hi>firſt ſight</hi> to require, being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <hi>Moderation, Candidneſs,</hi> and <hi>Civility</hi> in <hi>Anſwerers</hi> of all
ſides, I cannot but highly commend; but then agen, when I look far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into him, and ſee him wiſhing for <hi>Moderation</hi> in the deepeſt <hi>Satyr,</hi>
condemning the want of <hi>Civility</hi> in <hi>Others,</hi> with the moſt <hi>Exaſperating
Reflections</hi> of his <hi>One,</hi> writing againſt the <hi>Paſſion</hi> of his <hi>Adverſaries,</hi>
with his <hi>own Pen</hi> ſteept in <hi>Gall;</hi> when I hear him deſirous of laying
down his <hi>Deareſt Blood</hi> for the redreſſing the Evils of the <hi>Divided
Church,</hi> and at the ſame time moſt <hi>Uncharitably</hi> expoſing Antagoniſts,
even ſuch as nothing belong'd to his Province, under the moſt <hi>Odious
Characters</hi> imaginable, I cannot tell how to take him in earneſt; he ſeems
but to make a ſerious Droll, and brings into my mind, what I have heard
of one, who Preaching on Ship-board to correct the extravagant <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of the Mariners, after many arguments to convince them of their
Prophaneſs, at length to preſs the matter home to them, <hi>Swore Bloodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
They would be all Damn'd if they did not leave off <hi>Swearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But however it be, Ile Anſwer for my ſelf, and do here aſſure this
Zealous Author, notwithſtanding all his hard words, that there's no
more of <hi>jeſting</hi> in my laſt Papers, than he may find in any <hi>Parable</hi> or
<hi>Emblem,</hi> in which tho' the <hi>Perſons</hi> may be <hi>feign'd,</hi> as in that of the
<hi>Trees chooſing a King;</hi> yet the <hi>thing ſignified or intended,</hi> is <hi>real</hi> and
<hi>ſerious.</hi> So that tho', it may be, never any <hi>Diſſenter</hi> preſs'd all thoſe
things againſt the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the manner I have there urg'd
them; yet that there is ſhewn the Exact Method how the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> is ſtruck at by <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> is what is intended moſt <hi>Seriouſly</hi> and
without any <hi>drolling</hi> in the leaſt. And therefore if he finds any <hi>Ridiculing</hi>
in the Arguments, <hi>Mean Reflections</hi> or <hi>Trivial Jeſtings</hi> in the urging
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65448:25"/>
them, I can only tell him, that the <hi>Copy</hi> muſt be like the <hi>Original;</hi> and
that he that undertakes to ſhew, how <hi>Proteſtants Ridicule</hi> the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> do's not <hi>Jeſt,</hi> when he does it in ſomething that looks <hi>Ridiculous.</hi>
And if he is ſenſible that this way of handling Controverſies, do's ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
exaſperate, than heal our Diviſions, I am ſincerely of his mind. But
then think, that for the preventing it, he ought rather ſpend his Zeal upon
ſuch of his Brethren, who by thus <hi>Ridiculing</hi> play the Controvertiſts in
<hi>good earneſt,</hi> with their <hi>Bibles</hi> in hand; than upon Adverſaries, who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
detect the <hi>Sophiſtry,</hi> and by <hi>Emblem</hi> ſhew <hi>how</hi> 'tis done.</p>
            <p>If he has therefore ſo much eſteem for the <hi>Salvation of Mens Souls,</hi> and
the <hi>Truth of Religion,</hi> as he pretends, let him ſhew himſelf ſo in a moſt
Chriſtian Action. Let him but turn to ſuch of <hi>his own Communion,</hi> who
have given this <hi>bad Example,</hi> and win ſo far upon them, as <hi>Publickly</hi> to
make <hi>Reſtitution</hi> to ſuch <hi>Innocent</hi> Perſons, of the <hi>Credit</hi> and <hi>Good Name,</hi>
which They have <hi>Publickly</hi> helpt to take away: To remove that <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable</hi>
Opinion, they have Imprinted in the very Souls of their Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
againſt their <hi>Neihgbors,</hi> by <hi>vain Rumors,</hi> and <hi>groundleſs Surmiſes;</hi> let
him prevail upon them never more to Preach to Peoples <hi>Paſſion,</hi> inſtead of
their <hi>Reaſon:</hi> never more to enflame the multitude by Preaching to them
<hi>Dreams</hi> and <hi>Viſions;</hi> nor to advance every <hi>un-ſoul'd Informer</hi> to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of an <hi>Evangeliſt.</hi> Let him ſee, that they <hi>play</hi> not with their
Neighbors <hi>Reputation,</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and run them both down with
idle Stories, ſuch as are Authentick enough for a <hi>Plot-Catechiſm,</hi> but not
for a <hi>Pulpit.</hi> Let him endeavor that their <hi>Arguments</hi> and <hi>Methods</hi> for
the defeating of <hi>Popery,</hi> be not ſuch as any <hi>Jew</hi> may take up to ſtrike a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
