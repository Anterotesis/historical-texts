            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In this courſe, notwithſtanding we had two dayes calme, yet within ſix dayes we arived at our <hi>Port Pheſant,</hi> which is a fine round Bay, of very ſafe harbour for all winds, lying betweene two high points, not paſt halfe a cables length over at the mouth, but within eight or ten cables length every way, having ten or twelve fadome water, more or leſſe, full of good fiſh, the ſoile alſo very fruitfull; which may appear by this, that our Captain having been in this place, within a year and few dayes before, and having rid the place with many alleyes and paths made, yet now all was ſo overgrowne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, as that we doubted at firſt, whether this were the ſame place or no.</p>
                  <p>At our entrance into this Bay, our Captaine having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven order to his brother what to do, if any occaſion ſhoud happen in his abſence, was on his way, with intent to have gone a land, with ſome few only in his company, becauſe he knew there dwelt no <hi>Spaniards</hi> within thirty five leagues of that place. <hi>Tolou</hi> being the neereſt to the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and <hi>Nomb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This advertiſement notwithſtanding, our Captain ment not to depart, before he had built his Pinnaces, which were yet aboard in pieces, for which purpoſe he knew this Port a moſt convenient place. And therefore ſo ſoon as we had mored our ſhips, our Captain commanded his Pinnaces to be brought aſhore, for the Carpenters to ſet up, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf employing al his other company in fortifying a place which he had choſen out as a moſt fit plot of three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58006:7"/>
of an acre of ground, to make ſome ſtrength or ſafety for the preſent, as ſufficiently as the meanes he had would affoord, which was performed, by felling of great trees &amp; bowſing and haling them together with great Pulleis and halfers, untill they were incloſed to the waters, and then letting others fall upon them, untill they had raiſed with trees and boughs thirty foot in height round about, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only one gate to iſſue at neet the waters ſide, which every night (that we might ſleepe in more ſafety and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity) was ſhut up, with a great tree drawn a'rthwart it. The whole plot was built in a Pentagonall form, <hi>to wit,</hi> of five equall ſides and angles, of which angles two were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſea, and that ſide between them was left open, for the eaſie launcing of our Pinnaſes: the other four e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual ſides were cholely (excepting the gate before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) firmly cloſed up. Without, inſtead of a trench, the ground was rid for fifty foot ſpace, round about. The reſt was very thick with trees, of which many were of thoſe kindes, which are never without green leaves, till they are dead at the root (exeepting onely one kind of tree amongſt them, much like to our Aſh, which when the Sun commeth right over them, cauſing great raines, ſuddenly caſteth all their leaves, <hi>viz.</hi> within three dayes, and yet within ſix dayes after becomes all green againe; the leaves of the other trees do alſo in part fal away, but ſo as the trees continue ſtill green notwithſtanding) being of a marvelous height, and ſupported as it were with five or ſix naturall buttreſſes growing out of their bodies, ſo far, that three men may ſo be hidden in each of them that they which ſhall ſtand in the very next buttreſſe ſhall not be able to ſee them. One of them ſpecially was marked to have had ſeven of thoſe ſtayes or buttreſſes for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of his greatnes &amp; height, which being meaſured with a line cloſe by the barke and neer to the ground, as it

                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:58006:8"/>Our Captaine willing to uſe thoſe <hi>Negroes</hi> well (not hurting himſelfe) ſet them a ſhoare upon the maine, that they might perhaps joyn themſelves to their Countrimen the <hi>Symerons,</hi> and gaine their liberty if they would, or if they would not, yet by reaſon of the length and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſſe of the way by land to <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> he might prevent any notice of his comming, which they ſhould be able to give.

                  <p>To this end, diſpoſing of all his companies, according as they inclined moſt, he left the three Ships and the Carvell with Captaine <hi>Rauſe,</hi> and choſe into his foure Pinnaſes (Captaine <hi>Rauſes</hi> Shallop made the fourth) beſides fifty three of our men, twenty more of Captain <hi>Rauſes</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, with which he ſeemed competently furniſhed, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve what he intended: eſpecially having proportioned, according to his own purpoſe, and our mens diſpoſition, their ſeverall armes, <hi>viz.</hi> ſix Targets, ſix Firepikes, twelve Pikes, twenty four Muskets and Callivers, ſixteen Bowes, and ſix Partizans, two Drums, and two Trumpets.</p>

and at ſuch a time, as he ſhould be utterly undiſcovered.</p>
                  <p>Therefore even that afternoone, he cauſeth us to ſet ſaile for <hi>Nombre de dios,</hi> ſo that before ſun ſet we were as farre as <hi>Rio Franciſco:</hi> thence he led us hard aboard the ſhore (that we might not be deſcried of the Watch houſe) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till that being come within two leagues of the point of the Bay, he cauſed us to ſtrike a hull, and caſt our grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, riding ſo untill it was darke night.</p>
                  <p>Then we weighed againe and ſet ſayle, rowing hard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board the ſhoare, with as much ſilence as we could, till we recovered the point of the harbour under the high land: there we ſtayed all ſilent, purpoſing to attempt the towne in the dawning of the day, after that we had repoſed our ſelves for a while.</p>
                  <p>But our Captain with ſome others of his beſt men, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that our people were talking of the greatneſſe of the towne and what their ſtrength might be, eſpecially by the report of the Negroes that we tooke in the Iſle of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi>: thought it beſt to put theſe conceits out of their heads, and therefore to take the opportunity of the riſing of the Moone that night, perſwading them that it was the day dawning.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58006:9"/>
very place where we landed, being a Sandy Bay and no Key at all, not paſt twenty yards from the Houſes.</p>
                  <p>There we found ſix great Pieces of braſſe Ordnance, mounted upon their Carriages, ſome Demy, ſome whole Culvering: we preſently diſmounted them, the Gunner fled, the Towne tooke alarme (being very ready thereto, by reaſon of their often diſquieting, by their neer neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours the <hi>Symerons</hi>) as we perceived, not only by the noyſe and cryes of the people, but by the Bell ringing out, and Drums running up and down the Towne.</p>
                  <p>Our Captaine, according to the directions which he had given over night, to ſuch as he had made choyce of for the purpoſe, left twelve to keep the Pinnaces, that we might be ſure of a ſafe retreit, if the worſt befell. And having made ſure worke of the Platforme before he would enter the Town, he thought beſt, firſt to view the Mount, on the Eaſt ſide of the Towne, where he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, by ſundry intelligences the yeare before, they had an intent to plant Ordnance, which might ſcower round about the Towne. Therefore leaving one halfe of his company, to make a ſtand at the foot of the mount, he marched up preſently unto the top of it, with all ſpeed, to try the truth of the report for the more ſafety. There we found no peece of Ordnance, but onely a very fit place prepared for ſuch uſe, and therefore we left it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any of our men, and with all celerity returned downe the Mount. Then our Captaine appointed his Brother, with <hi>John Oxnam</hi> and ſixteene other of his men to goe about behind the Kings treaſure-houſe, and enter neere the Eaſter end of the market-place: himſelfe with the reſt, would paſſe up the broad ſtreet, into the market-place, with ſound of Drum and Trumpet.</p>
                  <p>The Firepikes divided halfe to the one, and halfe to the other company, ſerved no leſſe for fright to the Enemy,

then light of our Men, who by this meanes might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne every place very well, as if it were neere day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Inhabitants ſtood amazed at ſo ſtrange a ſight, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling what the matter might be; and imagining, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our Drums and Trumpets ſounding in ſo ſundry places, that we had beene a farre greater number then we were.</p>
                  <p>Yet by meanes of the Souldiers which were in the Towne, and by reaſon of the time which we ſpent in marching up and downe the Mount, the Souldiers and the Inhabitants had put themſelves in Armes, and brought their Companies in ſome order, at the South-eaſt end of the Market-place, neere the Governours Houſe, and not farre from the Gate of the Towne, which is onely one, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding towards <hi>Panama,</hi> having (as it ſeemes) gathered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thither, either that in the Governours ſight they might ſhew their Valour, if it might prevaile, or elſe that by the Gate they might beſt take their <hi>Vale,</hi> and eſcape readieſt.</p>
                  <p>And to make a ſhew of farre greater numbers of ſhot, or elſe of a cuſtome they had, by the like device to terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the <hi>Symerons,</hi> they had hung Lines with Matches light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, overthwart the Weſter-end of the Market-place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Church and the Croſſe, as though there had beene in a readineſſe ſome company of ſhot, whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there was not paſt two or three that taught theſe Lines to dance, till they themſelves ran away, as ſoone as they perceived they were diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>But the Souldiers, and ſuch as were joyned with them, preſented us with a jolly hot volley of ſhot, beating full upon the egreſſe of that Street in which we marched, and levelling very low, ſo as their Bullets oft-times grazed on the Sand. We ſtood not to anſwer them in like tearmes; but having diſcharged our firſt volley of ſhot, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered

For our men with their Pikes and ſhort weapons, in ſhort time tooke ſuch order among theſe Gallants, ſome uſing the but-end of their Peeces in ſtead of other weapons, that partly by reaſon of our arrowes, which did us there notable ſervice, partly by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this ſtrange and ſudden cloſing with them, in this manner unlooked for, and the rather for that at the very inſtant, our Captaines brother, with the other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, with their fire-pikes, entred the market-place by the Eaſter-ſtreet: they caſting downe their weapons, fled all out of the Towne by the gate aforeſaid, which had been built for a barre to keepe out of the Towne the <hi>Symerons,</hi> who had often aſſailed it, but now ſerved for a gap for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to fly at.</p>
                  <p>In following and returning, diverſe of our men were hurt, with the weapons which the Enemy had let fall as he fled: ſomewhat, for that we marched with ſuch ſpeed, but more for that they lay ſo thicke and croſſe one on the other.</p>
                  <p>Being returned, we made our ſtand neer the midſt of the market place, where a tree groweth hard by the croſſe; whence our Captaine ſent ſome of our men to ſtay the ringing of the alarme Bell, which had continued all this while: but the Church being very ſtrongly built and faſt ſhut, they could not without firing (which our Captaine forbad) get into the ſteeple where the Bell hung.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time, our Captaine having taken two or three <hi>Spaniards</hi> in their flight, commanded them to ſhew them the Governours houſe, where he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood

was the ordinary place of unlading the Moyles, of all the treaſure which came from <hi>Panamah</hi> by the Kings appointment: Although the ſilver onely was kept there: the gold, pearle and jewels (being there once entred by the Kings Officer) was carried from thence to the Kings treaſure houſe not farre off, being a houſe very ſtrongly built of lime and ſtone, for the ſafe keeping thereof.</p>
                  <p>At our comming to the Governours houſe, we found the great doore (where the Moyles do uſually unlade) even then opened; a Candle lighted upon the top of the ſtayers; and a faire Gennet ready ſadled, either for the Governour himſelfe or ſome other of his houſe-hold to carry it after him. By meanes of this light, we ſaw a huge heape of Silver, in that nether roome: being a pile of bars of ſilver, of as (neere as we could gueſſe) ſeventy foot in length, of ten foot in breadth, and twelve foot in height, piled up againſt the wall, each barre was between thirty five and forty pound in weight. At ſight hereof our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine commanded ſtraightly that none of us ſhould touch a barre of ſilver, but ſtand upon our weapons, becauſe the Towne was full of people, and there was in the Kings treaſure houſe neere the waters ſide, more gold and jewels then all our four Pinnaces would carry, which we would preſently ſet ſome in hand to break open, notwithſtanding the <hi>Spaniards</hi> reports of the ſtrength of it.</p>
                  <p>We were no ſooner returned to our ſtrength, but there was a report brought by ſome of our men, that our Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces were in danger to be taken, and that if we our ſelves got not aboard before day, we ſhould be oppreſt with multitudes both of Souldiers and townes people. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port had his ground from one <hi>Diego</hi> a <hi>Negro,</hi> who in the time of the firſt conflict, came and called to our Pinnaces, to know whether they were Captaine <hi>Drakes</hi>? and upon anſwer received, continued intreating to be taken aboard
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58006:11"/>
(though he had firſt three or foure ſhot made at him) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till at length they fetch him, and learned by him, that not paſt eight dayes before our arrivall the King had ſent thither ſome hundred and fifty Souldiers to guard the Towne againſt the <hi>Symerons,</hi> and the Towne at this time was full of people beſides: which, all the rather beleeved, becauſe it agreed with the report of the Negroes, which we tooke before at the Iſle of <hi>Pinos</hi>: and therefore our Captaine ſent his brother and <hi>John Oxnam</hi> to underſtand the truth thereof. They found our men, which we left in our Pinnaces, much frighted, by reaſon that they ſaw great Troopes and Companies running up and downe, with matches light, ſome with other weapons; crying <hi>Que gente? que gente?</hi> which having not been at the firſt conflict but comming from the utter ends of the Towne (being at leaſt as bigge as <hi>Plimouth</hi>) came many times neere us, and underſtanding that we were <hi>Engliſh,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged their Peeces and ran away.</p>
                  <p>Preſently after this, a mighty ſhower of raine, with a terrible ſtorme of thunder and lightning, fell, which pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red downe ſo vehemently (as it uſually doth in thoſe Countries) that before we could recover the ſhelter of a certaine ſhade or pent-houſe, at the Weſter end of the Kings treaſure-houſe (which ſeemeth to have been built there of purpoſe to avoid Sunne and Raine) ſome of our bow-ſtrings were wet, and ſome of our match and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hurt: which while we were carefull of to refurniſh and ſupply; diverſe of our men, harping on the reports lately brought us, were muttering of the Forces of the Towne, which our Captaine perceiving, told them, that he had brought them to the mouth of the treaſure of the World, if they would want it, they might henceforth blame no body but themſelves. And therefore as ſoone as the ſtorme began to aſſwage of his fury (which was
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58006:11"/>
a long halfe houre) willing to give his Men no longer leaſure to demurre of thoſe doubts, nor yet allow the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy farther reſpite to gather themſelves together; he ſtept forward, commanding his Brother, with <hi>John Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam</hi> and the Company appointed them, to breake the Kings Treaſure-houſe; the reſt to follow him, to keep the ſtrength of the market place, till they had diſpatched the buſineſſe for which they came.</p>
                  <p>But as he ſtept forward, his ſtrength and ſight and ſpeech failed him, and he began to faint for want of blood, which as then we perceived, had, in great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, iſſued upon the Sand, out of a wound received in his legge in the firſt incounter, whereby though he felt ſome paine, yet (for that he perceived diverſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, having already gotten many good things, to be very ready to take all occaſions, of winding themſelves, out of that conceited danger) would he not have it knowne to any, till this his fainting, againſt his will, bewrayed it, the blood having firſt filled the very prints which our foot-ſteps made, to the great diſmay of all our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, who thought it not credible, that one man ſhould be able to ſpare ſo much blood and live.</p>
                  <p>And therefore even they, which were willingeſt to have adventured moſt, for ſo faire a booty, would in no caſe hazzard their Captaines life; but (having given him ſomewhat to drinke wherewith he recovered himſelfe, and having bound his Scarfe about his legge, for the ſtopping of the blood) entreated him to be content to goe with them aboard, there to have his wound ſearched and dreſt, and then to returne a ſhoare againe if he thought good.</p>
                  <p>This when they could not perſwade him unto (as who knew it utterly) impoſſible, at leaſt very unlikely, that ever they ſhould (for that) returne againe, to recover the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58006:12"/>
ſtate in which they now were; and was of opinion, that it were more honourable for himſelfe, to jeopard his life for ſo great a benefit, then to leave off ſo high an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize unperformed:) they joyned altogether, and with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>July</hi> 29</note>Thus we embarqued by breake of the day, having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides our Captaine, many of our Men wounded, though none ſlaine but one Trumpeter: whereupon though our Chyrurgeons were buſily employed, in providing reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Salves for their wounds; yet the maine care of our Captaine was reſpected by all the reſt: ſo that before we departed out of the Harbour for the more comfort of our Company, we tooke the aforeſaid Ship of Wines without great reſiſtance. But before we had her free off the Haven, they of the Towne had made meanes to bring one of their Culverins, which we had diſmounted, ſo as they made a ſhot at us, but hindered not us from carrying forth the Prize to the Iſle <hi>Bastimientes,</hi> or <hi>The Iſle of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuales</hi>; which is an Iland that lyeth without the Bay to the Weſtwards, about a league off the Towne, where we ſtayed the two next dayes, to cure our wounded Men, and to refreſh our ſelves in the goodly Gardens which we there found, abounding with great ſtore of all dainty Roots and Fruits, beſides great plenty of Poultery and other Fowles, no leſſe ſtrange then delicate.</p>
                  <p>Shortly upon our firſt arrivall in this Iland, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and the reſt of his aſſiſtants in the Towne (as we
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58006:12"/>
afterwards underſtood) ſent unto our Captaine a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Gentleman of meane ſtature, good complexion, and faire ſpoken, a principall Souldier of the late ſent Garriſon, to view in what ſtate we were. At his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming he proteſted he came to us of meere good will, for that we had attempted, ſo great and incredible a matter with ſo few men: and that at the firſt they feared that we had beene <hi>French,</hi> at whoſe hands they knew they ſhould finde no mercy: but after they perceived by our Arrowes, that we were <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, their feares were the leſſe, for that they knew, that though we tooke the Treaſure of the place, yet we would not uſe cruelty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their perſons.</p>
                  <p>But albeit this his affection gave him cauſe enough, to come aboard ſuch whoſe vertues he ſo honoured, yet the Governour alſo had not only conſented to his comming, but directly ſent him, upon occaſion that diverſe of the Towne affirmed (ſaid he) that they knew our Captaine, who the laſt two yeares had beene often on their Coaſt, and had alwayes uſed their perſons very well. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſired to know, firſt, whether our Captaine were the ſame Captaine <hi>Drake</hi> or no? and next, becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their men were wounded with our Arrowes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were poyſoned or no? And how their wounds might beſt be cured? Laſtly, what victuals we wanted or other neceſſaries? Of which the Governour promiſed by him to ſupply and furniſh us, as largely as he durſt. Our Captaine although he thought this Souldier but a Spy: yet uſed him very courteouſly, and anſwered him to his Governours demands. That he was the ſame <hi>Drake</hi> whom they meant: it was never his manner to poyſon his Arrowes: they might cure their wounded by ordinary Chyrurgery: as for wants he knew the Iland of <hi>Baſtimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entos</hi> had ſufficient, and could furniſh him if he liſted: but
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58006:13"/>
he wanted nothing but ſome of that ſpeciall commodity, which that Countrey yeelded, to content himſelfe and his Company. And therefore he adviſed the Governour to hold open his eyes, for before he departed, if God lent him life and leave, he meant to reape ſome of their Harveſt, which they get out of the Earth, and ſend into <hi>Spaine</hi> to trouble all the Earth.</p>
                  <p>To this anſwer unlooked for, this Gentleman replyed: If he might without offence move ſuch a queſtion, what ſhould then be the cauſe of our departing from that Towne at this time, where was above three hundred and ſixty Tun of ſilver ready for the Fleet, and much more Gold in value, reſting in Iron Cheſts in the Kings Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure-houſe? But when our Captaine had ſhewed him the true cauſe of his unwilling retreat aboard; he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that we had no leſſe reaſon in departing, then courage in attempting: and no doubt did eaſily ſee, that it was not for the Towne to ſeeke revenge of us, by man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning forth ſuch Frigates or other veſſels, as they had: but better to content themſelves and provide for their owne defence.</p>
                  <p>Thus with great favour and courteous entertainment, beſides ſuch gifts from our Captaine as moſt contented him: after dinner he was in ſuch ſort diſmiſſed, to make report of that he had ſeen, that he proteſted, he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much honoured of any in his life.</p>
                  <p>After his departure, the Negroe fore-mentioned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examined more fully, confirmed this report of the Gold and Silver, with many other intelligences of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, eſpecially how we might have Gold and Silver enough if we would, by meanes of the <hi>Symerons,</hi> whom though he had betrayed diverſe times (being uſed thereto by his Maſters) ſo that he knew they would kill him, if they gat him: yet if our Captaine would undertake his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58006:13"/>
protexion, he durſt adventure his life, becauſe he knew our Captaines name was moſt precious and highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured of them.</p>
                  <p>This report miniſtred occaſion to further conſultation: for which, becauſe this place ſeemed not the ſafeſt; as being neither the healthieſt nor quieteſt.

that which he had informed, and rowed towards this Ship, which as we came neere it, hailed us, asking whence our Shallops were?

                  <p>The next morning our Captaine tooke his Pinnace very early,<note place="margin">

Our Captaine perceiving the feat wrought, would not haſten him, but in rowing away, demanded of them, why their Barke was ſo deepe? as making no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it: but by occaſion of this demand, his Brother ſent one downe to the Steward to know whether there were any water in the ſhip? or what other cauſe might be?

There was no need to haſten the Company, ſome to Pumpe, others to ſearch for the Leake, which the Captaine of the Barke ſeeing they did on all hands very willingly, he followed his Brother, and certified him of the ſtrange chance befaln them that night; that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they had not Pumpt twice in ſix weekes before, now they had ſix foote water in hold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth leave from attending him in fiſhing, to intend

the ſearch and remedy of the leake: and when our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine with his Company profered to go to helpe them, he anſwered, they had men enough aboard, and prayed him to continue his fiſhing, that they might have ſome part of it for their dinner. Thus returning, he found his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany had taken great paines, but had freed the water ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little: yet ſuch was their love to the Barke (as our Captaine well knew) that they ceaſed not, but to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their ſtrength, laboured all that they might till three in the afternoone, by which time, the Company perceiving, that though they had beene relieved by our Captaine himſelfe and many of his Company, yet they were not able to free above a foot and a halfe of water, and could have no likelihood of finding the Leake, had now a leſſe liking of her then before, and greater content to hear of ſome means for remedy: whereupon our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain conſulting with them what they thought beſt to be done: found that they had more deſire to have all as he thought fit, then judgement to conceive any meanes of remedy. And therefore he propounded, that himſelfe would goe into the Pinnace, till he could provide ſome handſome Frigate, and that his Brother ſhould be Captaine in the Admirall, and the Maſter ſhould alſo be there placed with him, inſtead of this: which ſeeing they could not ſave, he would have fired, that the Enemy might never recover her: but firſt all the Pinnaces ſhould be brought aboard her, that every one might take out of her whatſoever they lackt or liked. This, though the company at the firſt marveiled at, yet preſently it was put in execution and performed that night: our Captaine had his deſire,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aug.</hi> 16.</note> and men enough for his Pinnaces.</p>
                  <p>The next morning, we reſolved to ſeek out ſome fit place, in the ſound of <hi>Dorrienne,</hi> where we might ſafely leave our ſhip at Anchor, not diſcoverable by the Enemy,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58006:16"/>
who thereby might imagine us quite departed from the Coaſt, and we the meane time better follow our purpoſes with our Pinnaces; of which our Captaine would him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe take two to <hi>Rio Grande,</hi> and the third leave with his Brother to ſeeke the <hi>Symerons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon this reſolution,<note place="margin">

As ſoone as we arrived, where our Captaine intended, and had choſen a fit and convenient road (out of all trade) for our purpoſe; we repoſed our ſelves there for ſome fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene dayes, keeping our ſelves cloſe, that the bruit of our being upon the Coaſt might ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>But in the meane time we were not idle: for beſides ſuch ordinary workes, as our Captaine every Moneth did uſually inure us to, about the trimming and fitting of his Pinnaces, for their better ſailing and rowing: he cauſed us to rid a large plot of ground, both of Trees and Brakes, and to build us Houſes, ſufficient for all our lodging, and one eſpecially for all our publique mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, wherein the <hi>Negro</hi> which fled to us before did us great ſervice, as being well acquainted with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and their meanes of Building. Our Archers made themſelves Butts to ſhoot at, becauſe we had many that delighted in that Exerciſe, and wanted not a Fletcher to keepe our Bowes and Arrowes in order. The reſt of the Company, every one as he liked beſt, made his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port at Bowles, Quoits, Keiles, &amp;c. For our Captaine allowed one halfe of their Company to paſſe their time thus, every other day interchangeably, the other halfe being enjoyned to the neceſſary workes, about our Ship and Pinnaces, and the providing of freſh Victuals, Fiſh, Fowle, Hogs, Deere, Conies, &amp;c. whereof there is great

                  <p>The ſame day we departed thence to <hi>Rio Grand,</hi> where we entred about three of the clocke in the after-noone.

a ſpeciall skill, in the ſpeedy erection of ſuch houſes.</p>
                  <p>This our ſtore was ſuch, as thereby we releeved, not only our ſelves and the <hi>Symerons,</hi> while they were with us, but alſo two <hi>French</hi> Ships in extreame want. For in our abſence Captaine <hi>John Drake</hi> having one of our Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces as was appointed, went in with the maine, and as he towed a loofe the ſhoare, where he was directed by <hi>Diego</hi> the Negroe aforeſaid, which willingly came unto us at <hi>Nombre de dios,</hi> he eſpyed certaine of the <hi>Symerons,</hi> with whom he dealt ſo effectually, that in concluſion he left two of our men with their Leader, and brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board two of theirs: agreeing that they ſhould meet him againe the next Day, at a River mid way betwene the <hi>Cabezas</hi> and our Ships, which they named <hi>Rio Diego.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe two being very ſenſible men, choſen out by their Commander, did with all reverence and reſpect, declare unto our Captaine, that their Nation conceived great joy of his arrivall, becauſe they knew him to be an enemy to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> not only by his late being in <hi>Nombre de dios,</hi> but alſo by his former Voyages, and therefore were ready to aſſiſt and favour his enterpriſes againſt his and their Enemies to the uttermoſt: and to that end their Captaine and Company, did ſtay at this preſent neer the mouth of <hi>Rio Diego,</hi> to attend what anſwer and order ſhould be given them: that they would have mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by land, even to this place, but that the way is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long, and more troubleſome, by reaſon of many ſteepe Mountaines, deepe Rivers and thicke brakes: deſiring therefore, that it might pleaſe our Captaine to take ſome order, as he thought beſt, with all convenient ſpeed in this behalfe.

whereof he was alwayes very carefull: as alſo conferring it with his Brothers informations of the great kindneſſe that they ſhewed him, being lately with them: after he had heard the opinions of thoſe of beſt ſervice with him, what vvere fitteſt to be done preſently; reſolved himſelfe with his Brother and the two <hi>Symerons,</hi> in his two Pinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to goe toward this River, as he did the ſame evening; giving order, that the Ship and the reſt of his Fleet, ſhould the next morning follow him, becauſe there vvas a place of as great ſafety and ſufficiency, vvhich his Brother had found out neer the River. The ſafety of it conſiſted, not onely in that vvhich is common all along that Coaſt from <hi>Tolou</hi> to <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> being above ſixty leagues; that it is a moſt goodly and plentifull Countrey, and yet Inhabited not with one <hi>Spaniard,</hi> or any for the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>; but eſpecially in that it lyerh among a great many of goodly Ilands full of Trees, vvhere, though there be Channels, yet there are ſuch Rocks and ſhoales, that no Man can enter by night, without great danger, nor by day vvithout diſcovery; whereas our Ship might lye hidden within the Trees.</p>
                  <p>The next day we arrived at this River appointed,<note place="margin">

                  <p>At our firſt meeting, when our Captaine had moved them, to ſhew him the meanes which they had to furniſh him with Gold and Silver; they anſwered plainly, that had they knowne Gold had been his deſire, they could have ſatisfied him with ſtore, which for the preſent they could not doe, becauſe the Rivers, in which they had ſuncke great ſtore, which they had taken from the

                  <p>This anſwer, although it were ſomewhat unlooked for, yet nothing diſcontented us, but rather perſwaded us far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their honeſt and faithfull meaning towards us.

and was preſently returned, with another meſſage: that, the King had forbidden to traffique with any forraigne Nation for any Commodities, except Powder and Shot, of which if we had any ſtore, they would be his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants; he anſwered, that he was come from his Country, to exchange his Commodities for Gold and Silver, and is not purpoſed to returne without his errand. They are like (in his opinion) to have little reſt, if that by faire meanes they would not traffique with him. He gave this Meſſenger a faire Shirt for a reward, and ſo returned him: who rowled his Shirt about his head and ſwamme very ſpeedily.</p>
                  <p>We heard no anſwer all that day, and therefore to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward night we went aboord our Frigates and repoſed our ſelves, ſetting and keeping very orderly all that night our watch, with great and ſmall ſhot.</p>
                  <p>The next morning the winde which had beene Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly in the evening, altered to the Eaſtward.

                  <p>They kept themſelves upon their Oares at Calliver ſhot diſtance, ſpending Powder apace, as we did ſome two or three houres.

Herewith being very ſorry, becauſe much of our Victuall in our Pinnaces was ſpoyled, by the foule weather at Sea, and raines in Harbour; a Frigate being deſcried at Sea re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived us, and put us in ſome hope for the time, that in her we ſhould finde ſufficient; and thereupon it may eaſily be gueſſed, how much we laboured to recover her; but when we had boorded her, and underſtood, that ſhe had neither Meat nor Money, but that ſhe was bound for <hi>Rio Grand,</hi> to take in Proviſion upon Bils, our great hope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into griefe.</p>
                  <p>We endured with our allowance ſeven or eight dayes more, proceeding to the Eaſtwards, and bearing roome for <hi>Santa Martha,</hi> upon hope to finde ſome Shipping in the Read, or Limpets on the Rockes, or ſuccour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Storme in that good Harbour. Being arrived, and ſeeing no Shipping, we anchored under the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter point, where is high land, and, as we thought, free in ſafety from the Towne, which is in the bottome of the Bay, not intending to land there, becauſe we knew that it was fortified, and that they had intelligence of us. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> knowing us to be Men of Warre, and miſliking that we ſhould ſhroud under their Rockes, without their leave, had conveyed ſome thirty or forty ſhot among the Cliffes, which annoyed us ſo ſpitefully, and ſo unrevengedly (for that they lay hidden behinde the Rockes, bur we lay open to them) that we were ſoone weary of our Harbour, and enforced, for all the Storme without, and want within, to put to Sea; which though theſe Enemies of ours were well contented with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, yet for a farewell, as we came open of the Towne, they ſent us a Culverin ſhot, which made a neere eſcape; for

                  <p>The Company of the other Pinnace anſwered, that they would willingly follow him thorow the World, but in this they could not ſee, how, either their Pinnace ſhould live in that Sea, without being eaten up in that ſtorme, or they themſelves able to endure ſo long time, with ſo ſlender Proviſion as they had, <hi>viz.</hi> onely one Gammon of Bacon and thirty pound of Bisket for eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene Men. Our Captaine replyed, that they were better provided then himſelfe was, who had but one Gammon of Bacon, and forty pound of Bisket for his twenty foure Men; and therefore He doubted not but they would take ſuch part as He did, and willingly depend upon Gods Almighty Providence, which never faileth them that truſt in him. With that he hoyſed his fore-ſaile, and ſet his courſe for <hi>Corizao</hi>; which the reſt perceiving, with ſorrowfull hearts in reſpect of the weake Pinnace, yet deſirous to follow their Captain, conſented to take the ſame courſe.</p>
                  <p>We had not ſailed paſt three leagues, but we had eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſayle plying to the Weſtward with her two courſes, to our great joy, who vowed together, that vve vvould

                  <p>The Sea went very high, ſo that it vvas not for us, to attempt to boord her, and therefore we made fit ſmall ſaile to attend upon her, and keepe her company to her ſmall content, till fairer vveather might lay the Sea.

                  <p>We were in all forty eight, of which eighteene onely were <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the reſt were <hi>Symerons,</hi> which beſides their Armes, bare every one of them a great quantity of Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and Proviſion, ſupplying our want of Carriages in ſo long a March, ſo that we were not troubled with any thing but our Furniture. And becauſe they could not carry e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſuffize us altogether, therefore, as they promiſed

before, ſo by the way with their Arrowes, they provided for us competent ſtore from time to time.</p>
                  <p>They have every one of them two ſorts of Arrowes, the one to defend himſelfe and offend the Enemy, the other to kill his Victuals. Theſe for fight are ſomewhat like the Scottiſh Arrow, onely ſomewhat longer, and headed with Iron, Wood or Fiſh-bones. But the Arrows for Proviſion are of three ſorts; the firſt ſerveth to kill any great Beaſt neere hand, as Oxe, Stag, or wilde Boare; this hath a head of Iron of a pound and a halfe weight, ſhaped in forme like the head of a Javelin or Boare-ſpear, as ſharpe as any Knife; making ſo large and deep a wound, as can hardly be beleeved of him that hath not ſeene it. The ſecond ſerveth for leſſer Beaſts, and hath a head of three quarters of a pound; this he moſt uſually ſhooteth. The third ſerveth for all manner of Birds; it hath a head of an ounce weight. And theſe heads, though they be of Iron onely, yet are they ſo cunningly tempered, that they will continue a very good edge a long time; and though they be turned ſometimes, yet they will never or ſeldome breake. The neceſſity in which they ſtand hereof continually, cauſeth them to have Iron in farre greater account then Gold; and no Man among them is of greater eſtimation, then he that can moſt perfectly give this temper unto it.</p>

                  <p>After our Captaine had aſcended to this Bower, vvith the chiefe <hi>Symeron,</hi> and having as it pleaſed God, at that time, by reaſon of the brize, a very faire day, had ſeene that Sea of vvhich he had heard ſuch golden reports: he beſought Almighty God of his goodneſſe, to give him life and leave to Saile once in an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship in that Sea: and then calling up al the reſt of our men, acquainted <hi>Iohn Oxnam</hi> eſpecially with this his petition and purpoſe, if it vvould pleaſe God to grant him that happineſſe: who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding it, preſently proteſted, that unleſſe our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine did beat him from his Company, he would follow him by Gods grace.</p>

but to ſuch height, that the Inhabitants are faine to burne it thrice in the year, that it may be able to feed their Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, of which they have thouſands. For it is a kinde of Graſſe with a ſtalke, as big as a great wheaten reed, which hath a blade iſſuing from the top of it, on which, though the Cattle feed, yet it groweth every day higher, untill the top be too high for an Oxe to reach. Then the Inhabitants are wont to put fire to it, for the ſpace of five or ſix miles together, which notwithſtanding after it is thus burnt, within three dayes ſpringeth up freſh like greene Corne. Such is the great fruitfulneſſe of the ſoyle, by reaſon of the evenneſſe of the day and night, and the rich Dewes which fall every morning.</p>

                  <p>But after that we were come within a dayes journey of <hi>Panama,</hi> our Captaine underſtanding by the <hi>Symerons,</hi> that the Dames of <hi>Panama</hi> are wont to ſend forth Hunters and Fowlers, for taking of ſundry dainty Fowle, which the Land yeeldeth, by whom if we Marched not very heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, we might be deſcryed; cauſed all his Company to March out of all ordinary way, and that with as great heed, ſilence and ſecrecy, as poſſibly they might, to the Grove, which was agreed on foure dayes before; lying within a league of <hi>Panama,</hi> where we might lye ſafely undiſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red near the High-way, that leadeth from thence to <hi>Nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre de Dios.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>For they are wont to take their journey from <hi>Panama</hi> to <hi>Venta Cruz,</hi> which is ſix leagues, ever by night, becauſe the Countrey is all Champion, and conſequently by d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This laſt day our Captain did behold and view, the moſt of all that faire City, diſcerning the large Street which lyeth directly from the Sea into the Land, South and North. By three of the clocke we came into this Grove, paſſing (for the more ſecrecy) alongſt a certaine River, which at that time was almoſt dryed up.</p>
                  <p>Having diſpoſed of our ſelves in the Grove, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched our Spye an houre before night, ſo that by the cloſing in of the evening, he might be in the City; as he was: whence preſently he returned unto us, that which very happily he underſtood by Companions of his; That the Teaſurer of <hi>Lima,</hi> intending to paſſe into <hi>Spaine</hi> in the firſt <hi>adviſo</hi> (which was a Ship of three hundred and fifty Tunne, a very good Sayler) was ready that night, to take his journey towards <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> with his Daughter and Family; having fourteene Moyles in company, of which, eight was laden with Gold, &amp; one with Jewels. And farther, that there were two other <hi>Recoes,</hi> of fifty Moyles in each, laden with Victuals for the moſt part, with ſome little quantity of Silver, to come forth that night after the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58006:32"/>
other. There are twenty eight of theſe <hi>Recoes,</hi> the greateſt of them is of ſeventy Moyles, the leſſe of fifty, unleſſe ſome particular Man hyre for himſelf, ten, twenty or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as he hath need.</p>
                  <p>Upon this notice, we forthwith Marched foure leagues, till we came within two leagues of <hi>Venta Cruz</hi>; in which March, two of our <hi>Symerons</hi> which were ſent before, by ſcent of his Match, found and brought a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> whom they had found a ſleepe by the way, by ſcent of the ſaid Match, and drawing neere thereby, heard him taking his breath as he ſlept; and being but one, they fell upon him, ſtopt his mouth from crying, put out his Match, and bound him ſo, that they well neare ſtrangled him by that time he was brought unto us. By examining him, we found all that to be true, which our Spye had reported to us, and that he was a Souldier entertained with others by the Treaſurer, for the guard and conduct of this Treaſure, from <hi>Venta Cruz</hi> to <hi>Nombre de Dios.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Souldier having learned who our Captaine was, tooke courage, and was bold to make two requeſts unto him; the one, that he would command his <hi>Symerons,</hi> which hated the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (eſpecially the Souldiers) extreamly, to ſpare his life, which he doubted not but they would doe at his charge: the other was, that ſeeing he was a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and aſſured him, that they ſhould have that night, more Gold, beſides Jewels and Pearles of great price, then all they could carry (if not, then he was to be dealt with how they would) but if they all found it ſo, then it might pleaſe our Captaine to give unto him, as much as it might ſuffize for him and his Miſtreſſe to live upon, as he had heard our Captaine had done to divers others: for which he would make his name ſo famous, as any of them, which had received like favour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:58006:33"/>Being at the place appointed, our Captaine with halfe of his men, lay on one ſide of the way, about fifty paces off in the long graſſe; <hi>Iohn Oxnam</hi> with the Captaine of the <hi>Symerons,</hi> and the other halfe, lay on the other ſide of the way, at the like diſtance: but ſo farre behind, that as occaſion ſerved, the former Company might take the foremoſt Moyles by the heads, and the other the hindmoſt, becauſe the Moyles tyed together, are alwayes driven one after another; and eſpecially that if we ſhould have need to uſe our weapons that night, we might be ſure not to endamage our fellows. We had not laine thus in ambuſh much above an houre, but we heard the <hi>Recoes</hi> comming from the City to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enta Cruz,</hi> and from <hi>

                  <p>Now though there vvere as great charge given as might be, that none of our men ſhould ſhow or ſtirre themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but let all that came from <hi>

ſeeing one all in white: for that we had all put our ſhirts over o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>de a falſe Gallop, as deſirous not only himſelfe to be free of this doubt; which he imagined, but alſo to give ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement to others that they might avoid it.</p>
                  <p>Our Captaine who had heard and obſerved (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the hardneſſe of the ground and ſtilneſſe of the nigh) the change of this Gentlemans trot to a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop, ſuſpected that he was diſcovered, but could not imagine by whoſe fault, neither did the time give him leaſure to ſearch. And therefore conſidering that it might be, by reaſon or the danger of the place, well knowne to ordinary Travellers: we lay ſtill in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Treaſurers comming, who was by this time within halfe a league, and had come forwards to us, but that this Horſeman meeting him, and (as we afterwards learned by the other <hi>Recoes</hi>) making report to him, what he had ſeene preſently that night, what he heard of Captaine <hi>Drake</hi> this long time, and what he conjectured to be moſt likely: <hi>viz.</hi> that the ſaid Captaine <hi>Drake,</hi> or ſome for him, diſappointed of his expectation, of getting any great Treaſure, both at <hi>Nombre de dios</hi> and other places, was by ſome meanes or other come by land, in covert thorow the Woods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this place to ſpeed for his purpoſe: and thereupon perſwaded him to turne his <hi>Reco</hi> out of the way, and let the other <hi>Recoes,</hi> which were comming after to paſſe on. They vvere whole <hi>Recoes,</hi> and loaden but with Victuals for the moſt part, ſo that the loſſe of them were farre leſſe if the worſt befell, and yet they ſhould ſerve to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them as well as the beſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:58006:34"/>Thus by the rechleſneſſe of one of our Company, and by the carefulneſſe of this Traveller, we were diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of a moſt rich booty, which is to be thought God would not ſhould be taken, for that by all likelihood it was well gotten by that Treaſurer.</p>
                  <p>The other two <hi>Recoes</hi> were no ſooner come up to us, but being ſtayed and ſeaſed on, one of the chiefe Carriers, a very ſenſible fellow, told our Captaine by what meanes we were diſcovered, and counſelled us to ſhift for our ſelves betimes, unleſſe we were able to encounter the whole force of the City and Country which before day would be about us.</p>
                  <p>It pleaſed us but little that we were defeated of our Golden <hi>Recoe,</hi> and that in theſe we could not find paſt ſome two Horſe-load of Silver: but it grieved our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine much more, that he was diſcovered, and that by one of his owne men. But knowing it bootleſſe to grieve at things paſt, and having learned by experience, that all ſafety in extremeties conſiſteth in taking of time: after no long conſultation with <hi>Pedro</hi> the chiefe of our <hi>Syme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,</hi> who declared that there were but two wayes for him: the one to travell back againe the ſame ſecret way they came, for foure leagues ſpace into the Woods: or elſe to march forward by the high way to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enta Cruz,</hi> being two leagues, and make a way with his Sword thorow the Enemies. He reſolved; conſidering the long and weary Marches that we had taken, and chiefly that laſt evening and day before: to take now the ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and readieſt way; as chooſing rather to encounter his Enemies while he had ſtrength remaining, then to be Encountered or chaſed when we ſhould be worne out vvith vvearineſſe; principally, now having the Moyles to eaſe them that vvould, ſome part of the vvay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:58006:34"/>Therefore commanding all to refreſh themſelves moderately with ſuch ſtore of Victuall, as we had there in aboundance, he ſignified his reſolution and reaſon to them all: asking <hi>Pedro</hi> by name, whether he would give his hand not to forſake him (becauſe he knew that the reſt of the <hi>Symerons</hi> would alſo then ſtand faſt and firme, ſo faithfull are they to their Captaine.) He being very glad of his reſolution, gave our Captaine his hand, and vowed that he would rather dye at his foot, then leave him to the Enemies, if he held this courſe.</p>
                  <p>So having ſtrengthned our ſelves for the time, we tooke our journey towards <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enta Cruz,</hi> with helpe of the Moyles, till we came within a mile of the Towne, where we turned away the <hi>Recoes,</hi> charging the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducters of them, not to follow us upon paine of their lives.</p>
                  <p>There the way is cut thorow the Woods, about tenne or twelve foot broad, ſo as two <hi>Recoes</hi> may paſſe one by another. The fruitfulneſſe of the ſoyle cauſeth that with often ſhredding and ridding the way thoſe Woods grow as thicke as our thickeſt hedges in <hi>England</hi> that are oftneſt cut.</p>
                  <p>To the midſt of this Wood, a Company of Souldiers which continually lay in that Towne, to defend it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Simerons</hi> were come forth, to ſtop us if they might on the way, if not to retrait to their ſtrength, and there to expect us. A Convent of Fryers, of whom one was become a Leader, joyned with theſe Souldiers, to take ſuch part as they did.</p>
                  <p>Our Captaine underſtanding by our two <hi>Simerons,</hi> which with great hee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>fulneſſe and ſilence, marched now, but above halfe a flight-ſhot before us, that it vvas
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58006:35"/>
time for us to arme and take us to our weapons, for they knew the Enemy was at hand, by ſmelling of their match and hearing of a noiſe: had given us charge that no one of us ſhould make any ſhot, untill the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had firſt ſpent their volley, which he thought they would not doe before they had ſpoken, as indeed fell out: For as ſoone as we were within hearing, a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captaine cried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, Hóó, our Captaine anſwered him likewiſe, and being demanded, <hi>Que gente</hi>? replied <hi>Engliſhmen.</hi> But when the ſaid Commander charged him in the name of the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> his Maſter, that we ſhould yeeld our ſelves, promiſing in the word and faith of a Gentleman Souldier, that if he would ſo do, he would uſe us with all courteſie; our Captaine drawing ſomewhat neere him, ſaid; That for the honour of the Queene of <hi>England</hi> his Miſtreſſe, he muſt have paſſage that way: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall diſcharged his Piſtol towards him.</p>
                  <p>Upon this, they preſently ſhot off their whole volly, which, though it lightly wounded our Captaine and diverſe of our men, yet it cauſed death to one onely of our Company called <hi>John Harris,</hi> who was ſo powdered with Haile-ſhot (which they all uſed for the moſt part as it ſeemed, or elſe quartered, for that our men were hurt with that kinde) that we could not recover his life, though he continued all that day afterwards with us. Preſently as our Captaine perceived their ſhot to come ſlacking, as the latter drops of a great ſhewer of raine; with his Whiſtle he gave us his uſuall ſignall, to anſwer them with our ſhot and arrowes, and ſo march onwards upon the Enemy, with intent to come to handy-ſtrokes, and to have joyned with them: whom when he ſound retired as to a place of ſome better ſtrength, he encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his pace to prevent them if he might. Which the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58006:35"/>
                     <hi>Symerons</hi> perceiving (although by terror of the ſhot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing) they were for the time ſtept a ſide, yet as ſoone as they diſcerned by hearing that we marched onward, they all ruſht forwards one after another, traverſing the way, with their Arrowes ready in their Bowes, and their manner of Countrey Dance or Leape, very luſtily, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Yó pehó, Yó pehó,</hi> and ſo got before us, where they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued their Leape and Song, after the manner of their owne Countrey Warres, till they and we over-tooke ſome of the Enemy, who neere the Townes-end had conveyed themſelves within the Woods, to have taken their ſtand at us, as before.</p>
                  <p>But our <hi>Symerons</hi> now throughly encouraged, when they ſaw our reſolution, brake in thorow the thickſt, on both ſides of them, forcing them to flye, Fryers and all, although divers of our Men were wounded, and one <hi>Symeron</hi> eſpecially was runne thorow with one of their Pikes, whoſe courage and minde ſerved him ſo well not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, that he revenged his owne death ere he dyed, by killing him that had given him that deadly wound.</p>
                  <p>We with all ſpeed, following this Chaſe, entred the Towne of <hi>Venta Cruz,</hi> being of about forty or fifty Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which had both a Governour and other Officers, and ſome faire Houſes, with many Store-houſes large and ſtrong for the Wares which were brought thither from <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> by the River of <hi>Chagro,</hi> ſo to be tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Moyles to <hi>Panama,</hi> beſides the Monaſtery, where we found above a thouſand Buls and Pardons newly ſent thither from <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In thoſe Houſes we found three Gentlewomen, which had lately beene delivered of Children there, though their dwelling were in <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58006:36"/>
it hath beene obſerved a long time, as they reported to us, that no <hi>Spaniards</hi> or White Woman could ever be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> with ſafety of their Children, but that within two or three dayes they dyed; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that being borne and brought up in this <hi>Venta Cruz</hi> or <hi>Panama</hi> five or ſix yeares, and then brought to <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> if they eſcaped ſickneſſe the firſt or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Moneth, they commonly lived in it as healthily as in any other place; although no Stranger (as they ſay) can endure there any long time, without great danger of death or extreame ſickneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Though at our firſt comming into the Towne with Armes ſo ſuddenly, theſe Gentlewomen were in great feare; yet becauſe our Captaine had given ſtraight charge to all the <hi>Symerons</hi> (that while they were in his Company, they ſhould never hurt a Woman, nor Man that had not weapon in his hand to doe them hurt, which they earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſed, and no leſſe faithfully performed) they had no wrong offered them, nor any thing taken from them, to the worth of a garter; wherein, albeit they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede ſufficient ſafety and ſecurity, by thoſe of his Company, which our Captaine ſent unto them, of purpoſe to comfort them; yet they never ceaſed moſt earneſtly intreating, that our Captaine would vouchſafe to come to them himſelfe for their more ſafety: which when he did, in their preſence reporting the charge he had firſt given, and the aſſurance of his Men, they were comforted.</p>
                  <p>While the Guards which we had (not without great neede) ſer, as well on the Bridge which we were to paſſe over, as at the Townes end where we entred (they have no other entrance into the Towne by Land, but from the Waters ſide there is one other, to carry up and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58006:36"/>
downe their Merchandiſe from their Frigates) gained us liberty and quiet to ſtay in this Towne ſome houre and halfe; we had not onely refreſhed our ſelves, but our Company and <hi>Symerons</hi> had gotten ſome good Pillage, which our Captaine allowed and gave them (being not the thing he looked for) ſo that it were not too cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome or heavy in reſpect of our travell, or defence of our ſelues. A little before we departed, ſome ten or twelue Horſemen came from <hi>Panama,</hi> by all likelihood, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that we were gone out of this Town, for that all was ſo ſtill and quiet, came to enter the Towne confidently; but finding their entertainment ſuch as it was, they that could, rode faſter back againe for fear, then they had rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den forwards for hope.</p>
                  <p>Thus we having ended our buſineſſe in this Towne, and the day beginning to ſpring, we Marched over the Bridge, obſerving the ſame order that we did before. There we were all ſafe in our opinion, as if we had been environed with Wall and Trench; for that no <hi>Spaniard</hi> without his extreame danger could follow us. The ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now, for that our <hi>Symerons</hi> were growne very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant. But our Captaine conſidering that he had a long way to paſſe, and that he had bin now well neer fortnight from his Ship, where he had left his Company but weake by reaſon of their ſickneſſe, haſtned his Journies as much as he might, refuſing to viſit the other <hi>Symeron</hi> Townes (which they earneſtly deſired him) and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging his owne Company with ſuch example and ſpeech, that the way ſeemed much ſhorter. For He Marched moſt cheerfully, and aſſured us, that he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not but ere he left that Coaſt, we ſhould all be boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully paid and recompenſed for all thoſe paines taken. But by reaſon of this our Captaines haſte, and leaving
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58006:37"/>
of their Townes, we marched many dayes with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry ſtomackes, much againſt the will of our <hi>Symerons</hi>; Who if we would have ſtayed any day from this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall journeying, would have killed for us Victuall ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>In our abſence, the reſt of the <hi>Symerons</hi> had built a little Towne within three leagues off the Port where our Ship lay. There our Captaine was contented, upon their great and earneſt intreaties, to make ſome ſtay; for that they alleadged, it was onely built for his ſake. And indeed he conſented the rather, that the want of Shooes might be ſupplyed by meanes of the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merons,</hi> who were a great helpe unto us: all our Men complaining of the tenderneſſe of their feet, whom our Captaine would himſelfe in their complaint accompany ſometimes without cauſe, but ſometimes with cauſe indeed, which made the reſt to beare the burthen the more eaſily.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Symerons,</hi> during all the time that we were with them, did us continually very good ſervice, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in this Journey, being unto us inſtead of Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, to advertiſe us; of Guides in our way, to direct us; of Purveyors, to provide Victuals for us; of Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights to build our Lodgings; and had indeed able and ſtrong Bodies, carying all our neceſſaries; yea, many times when ſome of our Company fainted with ſickneſſe or wearineſſe, two <hi>Symerons</hi> would carry him with eaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them two miles together; and at other times, when need was, they would ſhew themſelves no leſſe valiant then induſtrious, and of good judgment.</p>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58006:37"/>
this three weekes, kept good watch againſt the Enemy, and ſhifted in the woods for freſh Victuall, for the reliefe and recovery of our men left aboard. Aſſoone as this meſſenger vvas come to the ſhoare, calling to our Ship, as bringing ſome newes, he vvas quickly fet aboord, by thoſe vvhich longed to heare of our Captaines ſpeeding: but when he ſhewed the Tooth-pike of Gold, which he ſaid our Captain had ſent for a token to <hi>Edward Hixom,</hi> vvith charge to meet him at ſuch a River: though the Maſter knew vvell the Captaines Tooth-pike: yet by reaſon of his admonition and caveat given him at par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, he (though he bewrayed no ſigne of diſtruſting the <hi>Symeron</hi>) yet ſtood as amazed, leaſt ſomething had befallen our Captaine otherwiſe then vvell. The <hi>Symeron</hi> perceiving this, told him, that it vvas night vvhen he vvas ſent avvay, ſo that our Captaine cold not ſend any letter, but yet vvith the point of his Knife, he vvrote ſomething upon the Tooth-pike, vvhich (he ſaid) ſhould be ſufficient to gaine credit to the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger.</p>
                  <p>Thereupon the Maſter lookt upon it, and ſavv vvritten, <hi>By me Francis Drake,</hi> vvherefore he beleeved, and according to the meſſage, prepared vvhat provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he could, and repaired to the mouth of the River of <hi>Tortugos,</hi> as the <hi>Symerons</hi> that vvent vvith him then named it.</p>

                  <p>The reſt of our Men which were then miſſed, could not travell ſo well as our Captaine, and therefore were left at the <hi>Indian</hi> new Towne:<note place="margin">

                  <p>Thus being returned from <hi>Panama,</hi> to the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing of our Company, who were throughly revived vvith the report we brought from thence: eſpecially un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding our Captaines purpoſe, that he meant not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Therefore conſidering deepely the intelligences of other places of importance thereabouts, vvhich he had gotten the former years: and particularly of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragua,</hi> a rich Towne lying to the Weſtward, betweene <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> and <hi>Nicaragua,</hi> where is the richeſt Mine of fine Gold, that is on this North ſide: he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with his Company touching their opinions, what was to be done in this meane time, and how they ſtood
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58006:38"/>
affected? Some thought that it was moſt neceſſary to ſeeke ſupply of Victuals, that we might the better be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to keepe our men cloſe and in health till our time came: and this was eaſie to be compaſſed, becauſe the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates with Victuall went without great defence, whereas the Frigates and Barkes with Treaſure, for the moſt part were wafted with great Ships and ſtore of Souldiers. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers yet judged, we might better beſtow our time in intercepting the Frigates of Treaſure: firſt, for that our Magazines and Stor-houſes of Victuall were reaſonably furniſhed, and the Countrey it ſelfe was ſo plentifull, that every man might provide for himſelfe if the worſt befell: and Victuall might hereafter be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided aboundantly as well as now: whereas the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure never floteth upon the Sea, ſo ordinarily as at this time of the Fleetes being there, which time in no wiſe may be neglected.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Symerons</hi> being demanded alſo their opinion, for that they were experienced in the particularities of all the Townes thereabouts, as in which, ſome or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them had ſerved: declared that by <hi>Veragua Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior Pezoro</hi> ſometimes their Maſter from whom they fled, dwelt not in the Towne for feare of ſome ſurpriſe, but yet not farre off from the Towne, for his better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe: in a very ſtrong Houſe of ſtone, where he had dwelt nineteene yeeres at leaſt, never travelling from home, unleſſe happily once a year to <hi>Carthagene</hi> or <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> when the Fleetes were there: he keepeth a hundred Slaves at leaſt in the Mines, each Slave being bound to bring in dayly cleare gaine (all charges deducted) three Pezoes of Gold for himſelfe and two for his women (eight ſhilligs three pence the Pezo) amounting in the whole, to above two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58006:39"/>
pound ſterling each day: ſo that he hath hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped a mighty Maſſe of Treaſure together, which he keepeth in certaine great Cheſts of two foote deepe, three broad, and foure long: being, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his Wealth, hard and cruell, not onely to his Slaues, but unto all men, and therefore never going abroad but with a Guard of five or ſix men to defend his perſon from danger, which he feareth extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily from all Creatures. And as touching meanes of compaſſing this purpoſe, they would conduct him ſafely thorow the Woods, by the ſame wayes by which they fled, that he ſhould not need to enter their Havens with danger, but might come upon their backs alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unlooked for. And though his houſe were of ſtone, ſo that it could not be burnt, yet if our Captaine would undertake the attempt, they would undermine and overthrow, or otherwiſe breake it open, in ſuch ſort as we might have eaſie acceſſe to his greateſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                  <p>Our Captaine having heard all their opinions, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſo; that by dividing his Company, the two firſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſentences, were both reconciled, both to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed and put in ure. <hi>John Oxnam</hi> appointed in the <hi>Beare,</hi> to be ſent Eaſtwards towards <hi>Tolou,</hi> to ſee what ſtore of Victuals would come athwart his halfe, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe would to the Weſtwards in the <hi>Minion,</hi> lye off and on the <hi>Cabezas,</hi> where was the greateſt trade and moſt ordinary paſſage of thoſe which tranſported Treaſure from <hi>Veragua</hi> and <hi>Nicaragua</hi> to the Fleet: ſo that no time might be loſt, nor opportunity let ſlip either for Victuall or Treaſure. As for the attempt of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragua</hi> or <hi>Sinior Pezoros</hi> Houſe by land, by marching thorow the Woods, he liked not of, leaſt it might

over-weary his Men by continuall labour, whom he ſtudyed to refreſh and ſtrengthen, for his next ſervice fore named.</p>
                  <p>Therefore uſing our <hi>Symerons</hi> moſt courteouſly, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſing thoſe that were deſirous to goe to their Wives, with ſuch Gifts and favours as were moſt pleaſing, and entertaining thoſe ſtill aboord his Ships, which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to abide with the Company remaining, the Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces departed, as was determined, the <hi>Minion</hi> to the Weſt, the <hi>Beare</hi> to the Eaſt.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minion</hi> about the <hi>Cabezas</hi> met with a Frigate of <hi>Nicaragua,</hi> in which was ſome Gold, and a <hi>Genoway</hi> Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, of which Nation there are many in thoſe Coaſts, which had beene at <hi>Veragua</hi> not paſt eight dayes before, he being very well entreated, certified our Captaine of the State of the Towne, and of the Harbour, and of a Frigate that was there ready to come forth within few dayes, aboard in which there was above a Million of Gold, offering to conduct him to it, if we would doe him his right, for that he knew the Channell very perfectly, ſo that he could enter by night ſafely without danger of the Sands and Shallowes (though there be but little Water) and utterly undeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At his being there, he perceived they had heard of <hi>Drakes</hi> being on the Coaſt, which had put them in great feare, as in all other places (<hi>Pezoro</hi> purpoſing to remove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the South Sea) but there was nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to prevent him, their freare being ſo great, that, as it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed in ſuch caſes, it excluded Counſell and bred deſpaire.</p>
                  <p>Our Captaine conferring with his owne knowledge and former intelligences, was purpoſed to have retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his Ship, to have taken ſome of thoſe <hi>Symerons</hi> which had dwelt with <hi>Sinior Pezoro,</hi> to be the more confirmed in this point. But when the <hi>Genoway</hi> Pilot was very earneſt to have the time gained, and warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Captaine of good ſpeed, if we delayed not; he diſmiſſed the Frigates ſomewhat lighter, to haſten her journey, and with this Pilots advice, laboured with Sayle and Oares to get this Harbour, and to enter it by night accordingly; conſidering that this Frigate might now be gained, and <hi>Pezoros</hi> Houſe attempted hereafter notwithſtanding.</p>
                  <p>But when we were come to the mouth of the Harbour, we heard the report of two Chambers, and farther off about a league within the Bay, two other, as were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering them. Whereby our <hi>Genowaiſe</hi> Pilot conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that we were diſcovered; for he aſſured us, that this order had beene taken, ſince his laſt being there; by reaſon of the advertiſement and charge, which the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Panama</hi> had ſent unto all the Coaſt, which even in their Beds lay in great and continuall fear of our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and therefore by all likelihood, maintained this kinde of Watch, at the charge of the rich Gnuffe <hi>Pezoro,</hi> for their ſecurity.</p>
                  <p>Thus being defeated of this expectation, we found that it was not Gods will that we ſhould enter at that time: the rather for that the Winde, which had all this time beene Eaſterly, came up to the Weſtward, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited us to returne againe to our Ship; where on ſheere
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58006:40"/>
Thurſday we met according to appointment with our <hi>Beare,</hi> and found that ſhe had beſtowed her time to more profit then we had done. For ſhe had taken a Frigate in which there were ten men, whom they ſet a ſhoare; great ſtore of <hi>Maiz,</hi> twenty eight fat Hogs, and two hundred Hennes. Our Captaine diſcharged this Frigate of her lading, and becauſe ſhe was new, ſtrong, and of a good mould, the next day he tallowed her to make her a Man of Warre: diſpoſing all our Ordnance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions that were fit for ſuch uſe in her. For we had heard by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> laſt taken, that there were two little Gallies built in <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> to waft the <hi>Chagro</hi> Fleete to and fro, but were not yet both lanched: vvherefore he purpoſed now to adventure for that Fleete. And to hearten his Company,<note place="margin">

                  <p>The next day with the new tallowed Frigate of <hi>Tolou</hi> and his <hi>Beare,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Marc.</hi> 21.</note> we ſet ſaile towards the <hi>Cativa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> where about two dayes after we landed, and ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed while noone: at what time ſeeing a ſayle to the Weſtwards, as we deemed making to the Iland: we ſet ſayle and plyed towards him, vvho deſcrying us, bare with us, till he perceived by our confidence, that vve vvere no <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and conjectured that we were thoſe <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> of vvhom they had heard long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And being in great vvant, and deſired to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved by us, he bare up under our Lee, and in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of amity, ſhot off his Lee Ordnance which was not unanſwered.</p>
                  <p>We underſtood that he vvas <hi>Tetu</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of <hi>New-haven,</hi> a Man of Warre as vve vvere: deſirous to be releeved by us. For at our firſt meeting
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58006:41"/>
the <hi>French</hi> Captaine caſt abroad his hands, and prayed our Captaine to helpe him to ſome water, for that he had nothing but Wine and Cider aboord him, vvhich had brought his Men into great ſickneſſe. He had ſought us ever ſince he firſt heard of our being upon the Coaſt, about this five vveekes. Our Captaine ſent one aboord him vvith ſome releefe for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, vvilling him to follovv us to the next Port, vvhere he ſhould have both Water and Victuals. At our comming to Anchor he ſent our Captaine a Caſe of Piſtols, and a faire guilt Symeter, (vvhich had beene the late Kings of <hi>France,</hi> vvhom Monſieur <hi>Mongome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> hurt in the eye, and vvas given him by Monſieur <hi>Stroffe</hi>) our Captaine requited him vvith a Chaine of Gold, and a Tablet vvhich he vvore.</p>
                  <p>This Captaine reported unto us the firſt newes of the Maſſacre at <hi>Paris,</hi> at the King of <hi>Navarres</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage on Saint <hi>Bartholomewes</hi> day laſt, of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of <hi>France</hi> ſlaine in his Chamber, and divers other Murthers; ſo that he thought thoſe Frenchmen the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt that were fartheſt from <hi>France</hi>; now no longer <hi>France</hi> but Frenſie, even as if all <hi>Gaul</hi> were turned into Worme-wood and Gall. <hi>Italian</hi> practiſes having over-maſtered the <hi>French</hi> ſimplicity. He ſhewed what famous and often reports he had heard of our great riches. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know of our Captain vvhich vvay he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe his Voyage alſo. Though we had him in ſome jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie and diſtruſt, for all his pretence, becauſe we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered more the ſtrength he had, then the good will he might beare us; yet upon conſultation among our ſelues, whether it were fit to receive him or no; we reſolved to take him and twenty of his Men, to ſerve vvith our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine for halfes: in ſuch ſort as vve needed not doubt

of their Forces, being but twenty, nor be hurt by their Portions, being no greater then ours; and yet gratifie them in their earneſt ſuit, and ſerve our owne purpoſe, which without more helpe we could very hardly have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved. Indeed he had ſeventy Men, and we now but thirty one: his Ship was above eighty tun, and our Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate not paſt twenty, our Pinnace nothing neer ten tun; yet our Captaine thought this proportionable, in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that not number of Men, but quality of their judgements and knowledge, were to be the principall actors herein; and the <hi>French</hi> Ship could doe no ſervice, nor ſtand in any ſteed to this enterpriſe which we inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and had agreed upon long before, both touching the time when it ſhould take beginning, and the place where we ſhould meet, namely at <hi>Rio Franciſco.</hi> Having thus agreed with Captaine <hi>Tetu,</hi> we ſent for the <hi>Symerians,</hi> as before was decreed; two of them were brought aboard our Ships, to give the <hi>French</hi> aſſurance of this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>As ſoone as we could furniſh our ſelues and refreſh the <hi>French</hi> Company, which was within five or ſix dayes (by bringing them to the Magazine which was the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, where they were ſupplyed by us in ſuch ſort, as they proteſted they were beholding to us for all their lives) taking twenty of the <hi>French,</hi> and fifteene of ours with our <hi>Symerons,</hi> leaving both our Ships in ſafe Roade, we Mand our Frigate and two Pinnaces (we had formerly ſunke our <hi>Lyon,</hi> ſhortly after our returne from <hi>Panama,</hi> becauſe we had not Men ſufficient to Man her) and went towards <hi>Rio Franciſco,</hi> which becauſe it had not water enough for our Frigate, cauſed us to leave her at the <hi>Cabezas,</hi> Mand with <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> in the charge of <hi>Robert Dohle,</hi> to ſtay there, without attempting any chaſe, untill the

returne of our Pinnaces.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Marc.</hi> 13.</note> And then beare to <hi>Rio Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> where our Captaines landed with ſuch Force as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; and charged them that had the charge of the Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, to be there the fourth day next following without any ſaile.</p>
                  <p>And thus knowing that the Cariages went now daily from <hi>Panama</hi> to <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> we proceeded in covert through the Woods, towards the High-way that leadeth betweene them. It is five leagues accounted by Sea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Rio Franciſco</hi> and <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi>; but that way which we marched by land, we found it above ſeaven league. We marched, as in our former journey to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nama,</hi> both for order and ſilence, to the great wonder of the <hi>French</hi> Captaine and Company, who proteſted they knew not by any meanes how to recover the Pinnaces, if the <hi>Symerons</hi> (to whom what our Captaine commanded was a law, though they little regarded the <hi>French,</hi> as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no truſt in them) ſhould leave us: our Captain aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, there was no cauſe of doubt of them, of whom he had had ſuch former tryall. When we were come vvithin an <hi>Engliſh</hi> mile of the Way, vve ſtayed all night, refreſhing our ſelves in great ſtilneſſe in a moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place, vvhere vve heard the Carpenters, being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in number, vvorking upon their Ships, as they uſually doe by reaſon of the great heat of the day in <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> and might heare the Moyles comming from <hi>Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>April</hi> 1.</note> by reaſon of the advantage of the ground. The next morning, upon hearing of that great number of Bels, the <hi>Symerons</hi> rejoyced exceedingly, as though there could not have befallen them a more joyful accident, chiefly having been diſappointed before. Now they all aſſured us, vve ſhould have more Gold and Silver then all of us could beare away, as in truth it fell out. For there came three
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58006:42"/>
                     <hi>Recoes,</hi> one of fifty Moyles, the other two of ſeventy each, every of vvhich caryed three hundred pound vvaight of Silver, vvhich in all amounted to neer thirty Tun. We putting our ſelus in readineſſe, vvent down neer the Way to hear the Bels, vvhere vve ſtayed not long, but vve ſaw of vvhat Mettall they vvere made, and tooke ſuch hold on the heads of the foremoſt and hindmoſt Moyles, that all the reſt ſtayed and lay down, as their manner is.</p>
                  <p>Theſe three <hi>Recoes</hi> were guarded with forty five Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, or thereabouts; fifteene to each <hi>Reco,</hi> which cauſed ſome exchange of Bullets and Arrowes for a time; in which conflict the <hi>French</hi> Captaine was ſore wounded with Hayle ſhot in the Belly, and one <hi>Symeron</hi> ſlain. But in the end theſe Souldiers thought it the beſt way to leave their Moyles with us, and to ſeeke for more helpe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; in which meane time we tooke ſome paine to eaſe ſome of the Moyles, which were heavieſt loaden, of their carriages. And being weary, we were content with a few bars and quoits of Gold, as we could well car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: burying about fifteene tun of Silver, partly in the Boroughs which the great Land-crabs had made in the earth, and parrly under old trees which are fallen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, and partly in the Sand and Gravell of a River, not very deepe of water.</p>
                  <p>Thus when about this buſineſſe we had ſpent ſome two houres, and had diſpoſed of all our matters, and were ready to March backe, the very ſelfe ſame way that we came, we heard both Horſe and Foot comming, as it ſeemed to the Moyles, for they never followed us, after we were once entred the Woods; where the <hi>French</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, by reaſon of his wound, not able to travell farther, ſtayed, in hope that ſome reſt would recover him better ſtrength.

upon the <hi>French</hi> Souldiers complaint, that they miſſed one of their Men alſo, examination being made whether he were ſlaine or no; it was found that he had drunke much Wine, and over-lading himſelfe with Pillage, and haſting to goe before us, had loſt himſelfe in the Woods. And as we afterwards knew, he was taken by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that evening, and upon torture, diſcovered unto them where we had hidden our Treaſure.</p>
                  <p>We continued our March all that and the next day to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Rio Franciſco,</hi> in hope to meet our Pinnaces; but when we came thither,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apr.</hi> 2.3.</note> looking out to Sea, we ſaw ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pinnaces, which had beene ſearching all the Coaſts thereabout. Whereupon we mightily ſuſpected that they had taken or ſpoyled our Pinnaces, for that our Captaine had given ſo ſtraight charge, that they ſhould repaire to this place this after-noone from the <hi>Cabezas</hi> where they rode, whence to our ſight, theſe <hi>Spaniards</hi> Pinnaces did come.</p>
                  <p>But the night before, there had fallen very much raine, with much Weſterly Winde, vvhich as it enforced the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to returne home the ſooner, by reaſon of the Storme; ſo it kept our Pinnaces, that they could not keepe the appointment, becauſe the Winde was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and blew ſo ſtrong, that with their Oares they could all that day get but halfe the way. Notwithſtanding, if they had followed our Captaines direction in ſetting forth over night, while the wind ſerved, they had arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the place appointed with farre leſſe labour, but with farre more danger, becauſe that very day at noone, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Shallops mand out of purpoſe from <hi>Nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre de Dios,</hi> were come to this place to take our Pinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? imagining where we were, after they had heard of our intercepting of the Treaſure. Our Captaine ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58006:43"/>
the Shallops, feared leaſt having taken our Pinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they had compelled our men by torture, to confeſſe where his Frigate and Ships were. Therefore in this diſtreſſe and perplexity, the Company miſdoubting that all meanes of returne to their Country were cut off, and that their Treaſure then ſerved them to ſmall purpoſe: our Captaine comforted and incouraged us all, ſaying: We ſhould venter no farther then he did, it was no time now to feare, but rather to haſte to prevent that which was feared: if the Enemy have prevailed againſt our Pinnaces, which God forbid, yet they muſt have time to ſearch them, time to examine the Mariners; time to execute their reſolution after it is determined; before all theſe times be taken, we may get to our Ships if ye will, though not poſſibly by land, becauſe of the Hils, Thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets and Rivers, yet by water. Let us therefore make a Raft with the trees that are here in readineſſe, as offring themſelves being brought downe the River, happily this laſt ſtorme, and put our ſelves to Sea, I will be one, who will be the other? <hi>Iohn Smith</hi> offered himſelfe, and two <hi>Frenchmen</hi> that could ſwim very well, deſired they might accompany our Captaine, as did the <hi>Symeron</hi> likewiſe (who had been very earneſt with our Captaine to have marched by land though it were ſixteene dayes journey, and in caſe the Ships had been ſurprized, to have aboord alwayes with them) eſpecially <hi>Pedro,</hi> who yet was faine to be left behind, becauſe he could not row. The Raft was fitted and faſt bound; a Sayle of a Bisket Sacke prepared; an Oate was ſhaped out of a young Tree to ſerve inſtead of a Rudder, to direct their courſe before the wind. At his departure he comforted the Company, by promiſing, that if it pleaſed God, he ſhould put his foot in ſafety aboord his Frigate, he would
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58006:44"/>
God willing, by one meanes or other get them all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, in deſpite of all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the <hi>Indies.</hi> In this manner putting off to the Sea, he ſayled ſome three leagues ſitting up to the waſte continually in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and at every ſurge of the wave to the armepits, for the ſpace of ſix houres, upon this Raft, what with the parching of the Sunne, and what with the beating of the Salt water, they had all of them their skins much fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted away. At length God gave them the ſight of two Pinnaces turning towards them with much wind, but with farre greater joy to him, that could eaſily conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and did cheerfully declare to thoſe three with him, that they were our Pinnaces, and that all was ſafe, ſo that there was no cauſe of feare. But ſee, the Pinnaces not ſeeing this Raft, nor ſuſpecting any ſuch matter, by reaſon of the wind and night growing on, were forced to run into a cover behind the point, to take ſuccour for that night: which our Captaine ſeeing, and gathering, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they came not forth againe, that they would An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor there, put his Raft a ſhoare, and ran by land a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the point, where he found them, who upon ſight of him, made as much haſte as they could to take him and his Company aboord. For our Captain of purpoſe to try what haſte they could and would make in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, himſelfe ran in great haſte, and ſo willed the other three with him, as if they had been chaſed by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: which they the rather ſuſpected, becauſe they ſavv ſo few with him. And after his comming aboord, when, they demanding, how all his Company did? he anſwered coldly, well: they all doubted, that all went ſcarce well. But he willing to rid all doubts, and fill them with joy, tooke out of his boſome a Quoit of Gold, thanking God that our Voyage vvas made. And to the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,

                  <p>That night our Captain with great paine of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, rowed to <hi>Rio Franciſco</hi>: where he tooke the reſt in, and the Treaſure which we had brought with us: making ſuch expedition, that by dawning of the day, we ſet ſayle backe againe, to our Frigate, and from thence directly to our Ships: where aſſoone as we arrived, our Captaine devided by weight, the Gold and Silver into two even portions, betweene the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About a fortnight after, vvhen vve had ſet all things in order, and taking out of our Ship all ſuch neceſſaries as we needed for our Frigate, had left and given her to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whom we had all this time detained, we put out of that Harbour, together with the <hi>French</hi> Ship, riding ſome few dayes among the <hi>Cabezas.</hi> In the meane time our Captaine made a ſecret compoſition with the <hi>Symerons,</hi> that twelve of our men and ſixteene of theirs, ſhould make another Voyage, to get intelligence in what caſe the countrey ſtood, and if it might be, recover Monſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur <hi>Tetu</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Captaine, at leaſtwiſe to bring away that which was hidden in this former ſurpriſe and could not then be conveniently carried. <hi>Iohn Oxnam</hi> and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Sherwell</hi> were put in truſt for our ſervice, to the great content of the vvhole Company, who conceived greateſt hope of them next our Captaine, whom by no meanes they would condiſcend to ſuffer to adventure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine this time, yet he himſelfe rowed to ſet them a ſhoare at <hi>Rio Franciſco,</hi> finding his labour well imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both otherwiſe, and alſo in ſaving one of thoſe two <hi>Frenchmen</hi> that had remained vvillingly to accompany

For this Gentleman having eſcaped the rage of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> was now comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Pinnace, vvhere he fell downe on his knees, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God for the time that ever our Captaine vvas borne, vvho now beyond all his hope, vvas become his deliverer.</p>
                  <p>He being demanded vvhat vvas become of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and other fellow, ſhewed that vvithin halfe an hour after our departure, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d over gotten them, and tooke his Captaine and other fellow: he onely eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped, by flight, having caſt away all his Carriage, and among the reſt one Box of Jewels, that he might flye the ſwifter from the Purſuers: but his fellovv tooke it up and burthened himſelfe ſo ſore, that he could make no ſpeed, as eaſily he might otherwiſe, if he vvould have caſt downe his Pillage, and laid aſide his covetous mind; as for the Silver, vvhich we had hidden thereabout in the Earth and the Sands, he thought that it vvas all gone, for that he thought there had been neere two thouſand <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Negroes</hi> there, to dig and ſearch for it. This report notwitſtanding, our purpoſe held, and our Men were ſent to the ſaid place, where they found that the Earth, every way a mile diſtant had beene digged and turned up in every place of any likelihood, to have any thing hidden in it. And yet nevertheleſſe, for all that narrow ſearch, all our Mens labour was not quite loſt: but ſo conſidered, that the third day after their departure, they all returned ſafe and cheerefull, with as much Silver as they and all the <hi>Symerons</hi> could finde, (<hi>viz.</hi> thirteene bars of Silver, and ſome few Quoits of Gold, vvith vvhich they were preſently embarqued vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out empeachment, repairing with no leſſe ſpeed then joy to our Frigate. Now was it high time to thinke of homewards, having ſped our ſelves as we deſired: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58006:45"/>
our Captaine concluded to viſit <hi>Rio Grand,</hi> once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; to ſee if he could meet with any ſufficient Ship or Barke, to carry Victual enough to ſerve our turne home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in which we might in ſafety and ſecurity em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Frenchmen</hi> having formerly gone from us as ſoon as they had their ſhares at our firſt returne with the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as being very deſirous to return home into their Country, and our Captaine as deſirous to diſmiſſe them, as they vvere to be diſmiſſed: for that he foreſaw they could not in their Ship avoid the danger of being taken by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> if they ſhould make out any Men of Warre for them, while they lingred on the Coaſt, and having alſo been then againe releeved vvith Victuals by us: Now at our meeting of them againe, were very loath to leave us, and therefore accompanied us very kindly as far up as Saint <hi>Barnards,</hi> and farther would, but that they durſt not adventure ſo great danger, for that we had intelligence that the Fleet was ready to ſet ſayle for <hi>Spaine,</hi> riding at the entry of <hi>Carthagena.</hi> Thus we departed from them, paſſing hard by <hi>Carthagena,</hi> in the ſight of all the Fleet, with a Flag of Saint <hi>George</hi> in the maine top of our Frigate, with ſilke Streamers and Ancients downe to the water, ſayling forward with a large wind, till we came within two leagues of the River, being all low land, and darke night: where to prevent the over ſhooting of the River in the night, we lay off and on bearing ſmall ſayle, till that about mid-night the wind veering to the Eaſtward, by two of the Clocke in the morning, a Frigate from <hi>Rio Grand</hi> paſſed hard by us, bearing alſo but ſmall ſayle. We ſaluted them with our ſhot and Arrowes, they anſwered us vvith Baſes; but we got aboord them, and tooke ſuch order, that they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58006:46"/>
were content againſt their wils to depart a ſhoar and to leave us this Frigate which was of twenty five Tun, loaded with Maiz, and Hens and Hogs, and ſome Honey in very good time fit for our uſe: for the Honey eſpecially was a notable releever and preſerver of our craſed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The next morning as ſoone as we ſet thoſe <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> a ſhoare on the maine, vve ſet our courſe for the <hi>Cabezas</hi> without any ſtop, whether we came about five dayes after. And being at Anchor, preſently vve hove out all the Maiz aland, ſaving three Buts vvhich vve kept for our ſtore: and carrying all our proviſions a ſhoare, we brought both our Frigates on the <hi>Carine,</hi> and nevv tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them.</p>
                  <p>Here we ſtayed about a ſeven night, trimming and rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging our Frigates, boarding and ſtowing our Proviſions, tearing abroad and burning our Pinnaces, that the <hi>Syme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi> might have the Iron-worke. About a day or two before our departure, our Captain willed <hi>Pedro</hi> and three of the chiefeſt of the <hi>Symerons,</hi> to goe through both his Frigates, to ſee what they liked, promiſing to give it them whatſoever it were, ſo it were not ſo neceſſary as that he could not returne into <hi>England</hi> without it. And for their Wives, he would himſelfe ſeek out ſome Silkes or Linnen that might gratifie them; which while he was chooſing out of his Trunkes, the Cymeter which Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Tetu</hi> had given to our Captaine, chanced to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken forth in <hi>Pedroes</hi> fight, which he ſeeing grew ſo much in liking thereof, that he accounted of nothing elſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of it, and preferred it before all that could be given him; yet imagining, that it was no leſſe eſteemed of our Captaine, durſt not himſelfe open his mouth to crave or commend it, but made one <hi>Francis Tucker</hi> to be his mean to breake his minde, promiſing to give him a fine quoit
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58006:46"/>
of Gold, which yet he had in ſtore, if he would but move our Captaine for it; and to our Captaine himſelfe, he would give foure other great quoits, which he had hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, intending to have reſerved them till another Voyage. Our Captain being accordingly moved by <hi>Francis Tuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> could have beene content to have made no ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, but yet deſirous to content him, that had deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo well, he gave it him with many good words, who received it with no little joy, affirming that if he ſhould give his Wife and Children (which he loved dearly) in liev of it, he could not ſufficiently recompence it, (for he would preſent his King with it, who he knew would make him a great Man, even for this very Gifts ſake) yet in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity and ſteed of other requitall of this Jewell, he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red our Captaine to accept theſe foure peeces of Gold, as a token of his thankfulneſſe to him, and a pawne of his faithfulneſſe during life. Our Captaine received it in moſt kinde ſort, but tooke it not to his owne benefit, but cauſed it to be caſt into the whole Adventure, ſaying, If he had not beene ſet forth to that place, he had not attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſuch a Commodity; and therefore it was juſt, that they which bare part with him of his burthen in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to Sea, ſhould enjoy the proportion of his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit whatſoever, at his returne.</p>
                  <p>Thus with good love and liking we tooke our leave of that People, ſetting over to the Ilands of  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

In which ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we fortuned to take a ſmall Barke, in which were two or three hundred Hides, and one moſt neceſſary thing, which ſtood us in great ſtead, <hi>viz.</hi> a Pumpe, which we

                  <p>They that came aboard were right courteouſly entertained with a dainty banquet, and ſuch gifts as they ſeemed to be moſt glad of, that they might thereby underſtand, that this Fleet came in peace and friendſhip, offering to Traffique with them
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58006:51"/>
for ſuch commodities as their country yeilded, to their own content. This offer they ſeemed moſt gladly to accept, and promiſed the next day to reſort again, with ſuch things as they had to exchange for ours. It is a law amongſt them to drink no wine, notwithſtanding by ſtealth it pleaſeth them well to have it abundantly, as here was experience. At their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn aſhoare, they quietly reſtored the pledge which they had ſtayed, and the next day, at the hour appointed, returning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, brought with them Camels, in ſhew loaden with wares to be exchanged for our commodities, and calling for a boat in haſt, had one ſent them, according to order, with our Generall (being at this preſent abſent, had given before his departure to the Iſland.</p>
                  <p>Our boat coming to the place of landing (which was among the rocks) one of our men called <hi>John Fry,</hi> miſtruſting no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; nor fearing any harm pretended by them, and therefore intending to become a pledge, according to the order uſed the day before, readily ſtept out of the boat and ran a land, which opportunity (being that which the <hi>Moores</hi> did look for) they took the advantage of, and not only they which were in ſight layed hands on him to carry him away with them, but a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber more, which lay ſecretly hidden, did forthwith break forth from behind the rock, whether they had conveyed themſelves (as ſeemeth the night before) forcing our men to leave the reſcuing of him that was taken as captive, and with ſpeed to ſhift for themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The cauſe of this violence, was a deſire which the King of <hi>Feſſe</hi> had, to underſtand what this fleet was, whether any fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of the Kings of <hi>Portugall</hi> or no, and what newes of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty the fleet might give him. And therefore after that he was brought to the K. preſence, &amp; had reported that they were Engliſh men, bound for the <hi>Straights,</hi> under the conduct of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>Drake,</hi> he was ſent back again with a preſent to his cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and offer of great courteſie and friendſhip, if he would uſe his country.

or redeem his man, his pinnace being ready, landed his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and marched ſomewhat into the countrey, without any reſiſtance made againſt him: neither would the <hi>Moores,</hi> by any meanes come nigh our Men, to deale with them any way; wherefore having made proviſion of wood, as alſo viſited an old fort, built ſometime by the King of <hi>Portugall,</hi> but now rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the King of <hi>Feſſe,</hi> we departed <hi>December</hi> 31.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Shortly after our putting forth of this harbor, we were met with contrary winds and foule weather, which continued till the fourth of <hi>January</hi>: yet we ſtill held on our courſe, and the third day after,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Here our Generall determined, for certain dayes to make his abode, both for that the place afforded plenty of freſh vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, for the preſent refreſhing of our men, &amp; for their future ſupply at ſea (by reaſon of the infinite ſtore of divers ſorts of

good fiſh, which are there eaſie to be taken, even within the harbor, the like whereof, is hardly to be found again, in any part of the world) as alſo, becauſe it ſerved very fitly, for the diſpatching of ſome other buſineſſes that we had. During the time of our abode in this place, our generall being a ſhoare was viſited by certain of the people of the country, who brought down with them a woman a <hi>Moore</hi> (with her little babe hanging upon her dry dug, having ſcarce life in her ſelfe, much leſſe milk to nouriſh her child) to be ſould as a horſe, or a cow and calf by her ſide, in which ſort of merchandiſe our generall would not deale. But they had alſo Amber-greece, with certain gums of ſome eſtimation, which they brought to exchange with our men for water (whereof they have great want) ſo that coming with their <hi>Allforges</hi> (they are leathern bags holding liquor) to buy water, they cared not at what price they bought it, ſo they may have to quench their thirſt. A very heavy judgement of God upon that coaſt! The circumſtances whereof conſidered, our generall would receive nothing of them for water, but freely gave it them that came to him, yea &amp; fed them alſo ordinarily with our victuals, in eating where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, their manner was not uncivill, and unſightly to us, but even inhumane and loathſome in it ſelf.</p>

                  <p>For when we found the Springs and Wells which had been there (as appeareth) ſtopped up again, and no other water, to purpoſe to be had to ſerve our need, we marched up to ſeek ſome more convenient place to ſupply our want, or at leaſt to ſee whether the people would be dealt withall, to help us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.

of their liberties in the uſe of divers parts of the fruitfull ſoile of the ſaid Iſland: which is very large, marvellous fruitfull (a refuge for all ſuch ſhips as are bound towards <hi>Braſill, Ginny,</hi> the Eaſt Indies, <hi>Binny, Calecut,</hi> &amp;c.) and a place of rare force, if it were not for the cauſe afore-recited, which hath much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated the pride, and cooled the courage of that people, who (under pretence of trafique and friendſhip) at firſt making an entrance ceaſed not, practiſing upon the poore Iſlands) the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient remainders of the firſt planters thereof, as it may ſeem from the coaſt of <hi>Guinea</hi>) untill they had excluded them from all government and liberty, yea almoſt life.</p>
                  <p>On the South-weſt of this Iſland, we took a Portugall laden the beſt part with wine, and much good cloth, both linnen and woollen, beſides other neceſſaries, bound for <hi>Braſill,</hi> with many Gentlemen and Marchants in her.</p>
                  <p>As we paſſed by with our fleet, in ſight of 3. of their towns, they ſeemed very joyfull that we touched not with our coaſt; and ſeeing us depart peaceably, in honour of our fleet and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, or rather to ſignifie that they were provided for an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, ſhot off two great peeces into the ſea, which were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by one given them again from us.</p>

The fire ſheweth it ſelf but four times in an houre, at which times it breaketh out with ſuch violence &amp; force, and in ſuch main abundance, that beſides that it giveth light like the Moone a great way off, it ſeemeth, that it would not ſtay till it touch one heavens themſelves. Herein are ingendred great ſtore of prumice ſtores, which being in the vehement heat of the fire

carried up without the mouth of that fiery body, fall down, with other groſſe and ſlimy matter upon the hill, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall increaſing of the ſame. And many times theſe ſtones falling down into the ſea are taken up and uſed, as we our ſelves had experience by ſight of them ſwimming on the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

                  <p>Upon the South ſide, about two leagues off this Iſland of burning, lyeth a moſt ſweet and pleaſant Iſland, the trees there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are alwaies green and faire to look on, the ſoile almoſt full ſet with trees, in reſpect whereof its named the brave Iſland, being a ſtorehouſe of many fruits and commodities, as figs alwaies ripe, cocos, plantons, orenges, limons, cotton, &amp;c. from the banks into the ſea do run in many places the ſilver ſtreams of ſweet and wholſome water, which with boats or pinnaces may eaſily be taken in. But there is no convenient place or roade for ſhips, neither any anchroaching at all. For after long triall, and often caſting of leads, there could no ground be had at any hand, neither was it ever known (as is reported) that any line would fetch ground in any place about that Iſland. So that the top of <hi>Fogo</hi> burneth not ſo high in the aire, but the root of <hi>Brava</hi> (ſo is the Iſland called) is buried and quenched as low in the Seas. The only inhabitant of this Iſland is an Hermit, as we ſuppoſe, for we found no other houſes but one, built as is ſeemed for ſuch a purpoſe; and he was ſo delighted in his ſolitary living, that he would by no meanes abide our coming, but fled, leaving behind him the relicks of his falſe worſhip; to wit, a croſs, with a cruſifix, an altar with his ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altar, and certain other Idols of wood of rude workmanſhip.</p>
                  <p>Here we diſmiſſed the Portugals taken neere Saint <hi>Jago,</hi> and gave to them in exchange of their old ſhip, our new pinnace built at <hi>Mogadore</hi>: with wine, bread, and fiſh for their provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſo ſent them away, <hi>Feb.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">

                  <p>During which long paſſage on the vaſt gulph, where nothing but ſea beneath us and aire above us was to be ſeen, as our eyes did behold the wonderfull works of God in his creatures, which he had made innumerable both ſmall and great beaſts, in the great and wide Seas: ſo did our mouthes taſte, and our natures fed on, the goodneſs thereof in ſuch fulneſs at all time, and in every place, as if he had commanded and enjoyned the moſt profitable and moſt glorious works of his hands to wait upon us, not alone for the relief of our neceſſities, but alſo to give us delight in the contemplation of his excellence, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the variety and order of his providence, with a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular taſt of his fatherly care over us all the while.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, we often met with adverſe winds, unwelcome ſtormes, and to us (at that time) leſs welcome calms, and being as it were in the boſome of the burning zone, we felt the effects of ſultring heat, not without the affrights of flaſhing lightning, and terrifyings of often claps of thunder; yet ſtill with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of many comforts. For this we could not but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, that whereas we were but badly furniſhed (our caſe conſidered) of freſh water (having never at all watred (to any purpoſe, or that we could ſay we were much the better for it) from our firſt ſetting forth out of <hi>England</hi> till this time, nor meeting with any place where we might conveniently water, till our coming to the river of Plate, long after) continually, after once we were come within foure degrees of the line on this ſide, <hi>viz.</hi> after. <hi>Feb.</hi> 10. and till we were paſt the line as many pegrees towards the South, <hi>viz.</hi> till <hi>Feb.</hi> 27. there was no one day went over us but we received ſome raine, whereby our want of water was much ſupplyed.</p>

                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:58006:55"/>This alſo was obſervable, that of our whole fleet,<note place="margin">1577.</note> being now 6. in number, notwithſtanding the uncouthnes of the way, and what ever other difficulties, by weather or otherwiſe we met withall, not any one, in all this ſpace, loſt company of the reſt; except only our Portugall priſe for one day, who <hi>March</hi> 28. was ſevered from us, but the day following <hi>March</hi> 29. ſhe found us again, to both her own, and our no little comfort: ſhe had in her 28. of our men, and the beſt part of all our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for drink; her ſhort abſence cauſed much doubting and ſorrow in the whole company, neither could ſhe then have been finally loſt, without the overthrow of the whole voyage.</p>
                  <p>Among the many ſtrange creatures which we ſaw, we took heedfull notice of one, as ſtrange as any; to wit, the flying fiſh, a fiſh of the bigneſs and proportion, of a reaſonable or middle ſort of Pilchards: he hath finnes, of the length of his whole body, from the bulk to the top of the taile, bearing the forme, and ſupplying the like uſe to him, that wings do to other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. By the help of thoſe fins, when he is chaſed of the <hi>Bonito,</hi> or great mackrel (whom the <hi>Aurata</hi> or dolphin likewiſe purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) and hath not ſtrength to eſcape by ſwimming any longer, he lifteth up himſelf above the water, &amp; flieth a pretty height, ſometimes lighting into Boats or Barks as they ſaile along: The quils of their wings are ſo proportionable, and finely ſet together, with a moſt thinne and dainty film, that they might ſeem to ſerve for a much longer or higher flight, but the dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them is ſuch, after ſome 10. or. 12. ſtrokes, that he muſt needs into the water again to moiſten them, which elſe would grow ſtiffe and unfit for motion. The increaſe of this little and wonderfull creature is in a manner infinite, the fry whereof ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the upper part of the waters, in the heat of the Sun, as duſt upon the face of the earth, which being in bigneſſe of a wheat ſtraw, and in length an inch more or leſs, do continually exerciſe themſelves in both their faculties of nature: wherein, if the Lord had not made them expert indeed, their generation could not have continued, being ſo deſired a prey to ſo many,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58006:56"/>
which greedily hunt after them,<note place="margin">1578.</note> forcing them to eſcape in the aire by flight, when they cannot in the waters live in ſafety. Neither are they always free, or without danger in their fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but as they eſcape one evill, by refuſing the waters, ſo they ſometimes fall into as great a miſchief, by mounting up into the aire, and that, by means of a great and ravening foule, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of ſome a <hi>Don</hi> or <hi>Spurkite,</hi> who feeding chiefly on ſuch fiſh as he can come by at advantage, in their ſwimming in the brim of the waters, or leaping above the ſame, preſently cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth upon them with great violence, making havock, eſpecially among theſe flying fiſhes, though with ſmall profit to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>There is another ſort of fiſh, which likewiſe flyeth in the aire, named a <hi>Cuttill</hi>: its the ſame, whoſe bones the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths commonly uſe, or at leaſt not unlike the ſort, a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of which, have at one time, in their flight, fallen into our ſhips, amongſt our men.</p>
                  <p>Paſſing thus, in beholding the moſt excellent works of the eternall God in the ſeas, as if we had been in a garden of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>April</hi> 5.<note place="margin">

Which order of making fires, though it be univerſall, as well among Chriſtians as Heathens, yet is it not likely that many do uſe it to that end, which the <hi>Braſilians</hi> do: to wit, for a ſacrifice to Divels, whereat they intermix many and divers ceremonies of conjurations, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up great heaps of ſand, to this end, that if any ſhips, ſhall go about to ſtay upon their coaſts, their miniſtring ſpirits may make wrack of them, whereof the <hi>Portugals</hi> by the loſſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of their ſhips, have had often experience.</p>
                  <p>In the reports of <hi>Magellanes</hi> voyage, it is ſaid, that this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple pray to no manner of thing, but live only according to the inſtinct of nature, which if it were true, there ſhould ſeeme to

be a wonderfull alteration in them, ſince that time, being fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from a ſimple and naturall ereature, to make Gods of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels; but I am of the mind, that it was with them then, as now it is, only they lacked then the like occaſion, to put it in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, which now they have: for then, they lived as a free people among themſelves, but now, are in moſt miſerable bondage &amp; ſlavery, both in body, goods, wife, and children, and life it ſelf to the <hi>Portugals,</hi> whoſe hard and moſt cruell dealings againſt them, forceth them to fly into the unfruitfull parts of their own land, rather there to ſtarve, or at leaſt live miſerably with liberty, then to abide ſuch intollerable hondage, as they lay upon them, uſing the aforeſaid practiſes with Divels, both for a revenge againſt their oppreſſors, and alſo for a defence, that they have no further entrance into the country. And ſuppoſing in deed, that no other had uſed travell by ſea in ſhips, but their enemies only, they therefore uſed the ſame at our coming: notwithſtrnding, our God made their diveliſh intent of none effect; for albeit there lacked not (within the ſpace of our fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with this coaſt) forcible ſtorms and tempeſts, yet did we ſuſtain no damage, but only the ſeparating of our ſhips out of ſhoare, but we could find no harbor in many leagues. And therefore coaſting along the land, towards the ſouth, <hi>April</hi> 7.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>April</hi> 7.</note> we had a violent ſtorm, for the ſpace of 3. houres, with thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, lightning, and rain in great abundance, accompanied with a vehement ſouth wind, directly againſt us, which cauſed a ſeparation of the <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> (viz. the Caunter which we took at cape <hi>Blank,</hi> in exchange for the <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> whoſe name ſhe hence forward bore) from the reſt of the fleet.</p>
                  <p>After this, we keep on our courſe, ſometime to the ſeaward, ſometimes toward the ſhoare, but alwaies ſouthward, as neere as we could: till <hi>April</hi> 14.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Among other cares which our Generall took in this action, next the main care of effecting the voyage it ſelf, theſe were the principall and chiefly ſubordinate: to keep our whole fleet (as neere as poſſible we could) together; to get freſh Water which is of continual uſe; &amp; to refreſh our men wearied vvith long toyls at ſea, as oft as vve ſhould find any opportunity of effecting the ſame.

But becauſe this place was not fit or convenient harbor for us, to do our neceſſary buſineſs; niether yet to make proviſion of ſuch things as we wanted, as Water, Wood, and ſuch like, we departed thence the 15. of <hi>May.</hi>

                  <p>At our departure thence, we held our courſe South and by Weſt, and made about 9. leagues in 24. houres; bearing very little ſaile, that our fleet might the eaſier get up with us, which by reaſon of the contrary winds, were caſt a ſtern of us.</p>
                  <p>In 47. deg. 30. min. we found a bay, which was faire, ſafe, and beneficiall to us, very neceſſary for our uſe; into which we haled, and anchored <hi>May</hi> 17.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>May</hi> 17.</note> and the next day, <hi>May</hi> 18.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>May</hi> 18.</note> we came further into the ſame bay, where we caſt anchor, and made our abode full 15. dayes.</p>
                  <p>The very firſt day of our arrivall here, our generall having ſet things in ſome order, for the diſpatch of our neceſſary buſines, being moſt carefull for his 2. ſhips which were wanting, ſent forth to the ſouthward, Captain <hi>Winter</hi> in the <hi>Elizabeth</hi> vice-admiral; himſelf in the Admiral, going forth northvvard, into the ſea, to ſee, if happily they might meet vvith either of them: at which time, by the good providence of God, he himſelf met with the Swan, formerly loſt at our departure from the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Plate, and brought her into the ſame harbor, the ſame day: where being after unloaden, and diſcharged of her fraight, ſhe was caſt off, and her iron work, &amp; other neceſſaries being ſaved, for the better proviſion of the reſt; of the remainder was made firewood, and other implements which we wanted. But all this while, of the other ſhip which we loſt ſo lately, in our extremity, we could have no newes.</p>
                  <p>While we were thus imployed, after certain dayes of our ſtay in this place, being on ſhoare in an Iſland nigh unto the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58006:59"/>
main, where a low water was free paſſage on foote, from the one to the other; the people of the country did ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto us, with leaping, dancing, and holding up of their hands, and making outcries after their manner: but being then high water, we could not go over to them on foot. Wherefore the generall cauſed immediatly a boat to be in readineſs, and ſent unto them ſuch things as he thought would delight them; as knives, bels, bugles, and whereupon they being aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether upon a hill, half an <hi>Engliſh</hi> mile from the waters ſide, ſent down two of their company, running one after the other with a great grace, traverſing their ground as it ſeemed after the manner of their wars, by degrees deſcending towards the waters ſide very ſwiftly. Notwithſtanding drawing nigh unto it, they made a ſtay, refuſing to come neer our men-which our men perceiving, ſent ſuch things as they had tyed with a ſtring upon a rod, and ſtuck the ſame up a reaſonable diſtance from them, where they might ſee it. And aſſoon as our men were departed from the place, they came and took thoſe things, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in ſtead of them, as in recompence, ſuch feathers as they uſe to weare about their heads, with a bone made in manner of a toothpick, carved round about the top, and in length about ſix inches, being very ſmoothly burniſhed. Whereupon our Generall, with divers of his Gentlemen and company, at low water went over to them to the maine.</p>
                  <p>Againſt his coming they remained ſtill upon the hill, and ſet themſelves in a rank, one by one; appointing one of their company to run before them from the one end of the rank to the other, and ſo back again, continually Eaſt and Weſt, with holding up his Hands over his Head, and yeilding forward his body in his running toward the riſing and ſetting of the Sun: and at every ſecond or third turne at the moſt, erected his body againſt the midſt of the rank of the people, lifting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf vaulting-wiſe from the ground towards the Moon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then over our heads: ſignifying thereby, as we conceived, that they called the Sunne and Moon (whom they ſerve for
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58006:60"/>
gods) to witneſſe, that they meant nothing towards us but peace. But when they perceived that we aſcended the hill apace, and drew nigh unto them, they ſeemed very fearfull of our comming.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore our Generall not willing to give them any way any occaſion to miſlike, or be diſcomfited, retyred his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; whereby they were ſo allured, and did ſo therein confirm themſelves of us, that we were no enemies, neither meant them harm, that without all fear, divers came down with great ſpeed after us, preſently entring into trafique with our men; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they would receive nothing at our hands, but the ſame muſt be firſt caſt upon the ground, uſing this word, <hi>zuſſus</hi> for exchange, <hi>toytt</hi> to caſt upon the ground. And if they miſliked any thing, they cryed <hi>coroh, coroh,</hi> ſpeaking the ſame with rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the throat. The wares we received from them were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of reeds, feathers, and ſuch bones as are afore deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>This people go naked, except a skin of furre which they caſt about their ſhoulders, when they ſit or lie in the cold: but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any thing to do, as going or any other labour, they uſe it as a girdle about their loyns. They weare their haire very long, but leſt it might trouble them in their travell, they knit it up with a roll of <hi>Oſtrich</hi> feathers, uſing the ſame rolls and haire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for a quiver for their arrows, and for a ſtore houſe, in which they carry the moſt things which they carry about them. Some of them within theſe rolls ſtick on either ſide of their heads (for a ſign of honour in their perſons) a large and plain feather ſheweth like horns afar off: ſo that ſuch a head upon a naked body (if Divels do appeare with horns) might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nigh reſemble Divels.</p>
                  <p>The whole bravery and ſetting out themſelves ſtandeth in painting their bodies with divers colours, and ſuch works as they can deviſe. Some waſh their faces with ſulphure, or ſome ſuch like ſubſtance: ſome paint their whole bodies black, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only their necks behind and hefore white, much like our Damoſels that weare their ſquares, their necks and breaſts
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58006:60"/>
naked. Some paint one ſhoulder black, another white, and their ſides and legs interchangeably with the ſame colours, one ſtill contrary to the other. The black part hath ſet upon it white moons, and the white part black Suns, being the marks and characters of their gods, as is before noted.</p>
                  <p>They have ſome commodity by painting of their bodies, for the which cauſe they uſe it ſo generally: and that I gather to be the defence it yeildeth againſt the piercing and nipping cold. For the colours being cloſe laid on upon their skin, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the fleſh, as by continuall renewing of theſe juces which are layed on, ſoakt into the inner part thereof, doth fill up the pores ſo cloſe that no aire or cold can enter, or make them once to ſhrink.</p>
                  <p>They have clean, comely, and ſtrong bodies: they are ſwift of foot, and ſeem very active. Neither is any thing more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable (in my judgment) then that ſo goodly a people, and ſo lively creatures of God, ſhould be ignorant of the true and living God. And ſo much the more is this to be lamented, by how much they are more tractable, and eaſie to be brought to the ſheepfold of Chriſt: having in truth a land ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence any chriſtian Prine in the world, for the whole tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell and labour, coſt and charges beſtowed in that behalf: with a wonderfull enlarging of a kingdome, beſides the glory of God by encreaſing of the Church of Cſtriſt.</p>
                  <p>Its wonderfull to hear, being never known to Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time, how familiar they became in ſhort ſpace with us,; thinking themſelves to be joyned with ſuch a people, as they ought rather to ſerve, then offer any wrong or injury un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: preſuming that they might be bold with our generall as with a father, &amp; with us as with brethren &amp; their neer friends; neither ſeemed their love leſſe towards us. One of the chiefeſt among them having on a time received a cap off our generals head, which he did daily weare, removing himſelf but a little from us, with an arrow pierced his legge deeply, cauſing the bloud to ſtream out upon the ground: ſignifying thereby, how
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58006:61"/>
unfainedly he loved him, and giving therein a covenant of peace: the number of men which here did frequent our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, were about fiftie perſons. Within, in the Southermoſt part of this bay, there is a river of freſh water, with a great many profitable Iſlands; of which, ſome have alwaies ſuch ſtore of ſeales or ſea-wolves as were able to maintain a huge army of men. Other Iſlands being many and great, are ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with birds and foule, as if there were no other victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, a wonderfull multitude of people might be nouriſhed by the increaſe of them for many poſterities. Of theſe we killed ſome with ſhot, and ſome with ſtaves, and took ſome with our hands, from mens heads and ſhoulders upon which they ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. We could not perceive that the people of the country had had any ſort of boat or canow, to come to theſe Iſlands. Their own proviſion which they eat, for ought we could perceive, was commonly raw. For we ſhould ſometimes find the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of Seales all bloudy which they had gnawn with their teeth like dogs: They go all of them armed with a ſhort bow of about an ell in length in their hands, with arrows of reeds, and headed with a flint ſtone, very cunningly cut and faſtned.</p>
                  <p>This bay by reaſon of the plenty of Seals therein found (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that we killed two hundred in the ſpace of one hour) we called <hi>Seale bay.</hi> And having now made ſufficient proviſion of victuals and other neceſſaries, as alſo happily finiſhed all our buſineſſes, <hi>June</hi> 3.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iune</hi> 3.</note> we ſet ſaile from thence; and coaſting along towards the pole Antartick <hi>June</hi> 12.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iune</hi> 12.</note> we fell with a little bay, in which we anchored for the ſpace of two dayes ſpent in the diſcharging of our Caunter, the <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> which we here layed up.</p>
                  <p>The 14. day we waighed again, and kept on our courſe ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward till the 17. and then caſt anchor in another bay in 50. d. 20. min. lacking but little more then one degree,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Here our generall on good advice determined to alter his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58006:61"/>
courſe; and turn his ſtern to the Northward again, if happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God would grant we might finde our ſhip and friends whom we loſt in the great ſtorm, as is beforeſaid. Foraſmuch as if we ſhould enter into the Straight without them into our company) it muſt needs go hard with them; and we alſo in the mean time as well by their abſence, as by the uncertainty of their ſtate, muſt needs receive no ſmall diſcomfort.</p>
                  <p>And therefore <hi>June</hi> 18.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iune</hi> 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> in the morning putting to ſea again with harty and often prayers, we joined watchfull induſtry to ſerve Gods good providence: and held on our purpoſe to run back toward the line into the ſame height, in which they were firſt diſſevered from us.</p>
                  <p>The 19. day of <hi>June</hi> toward night,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iune</hi> 19.</note> having ſailed within a few leagues of port St. <hi>Julian,</hi> we had our ſhip in ſight: for which we gave God thanks with moſt joyfull minds. And foraſmuch as the ſhip was far out of order, and very leake, by reaſon of extremity of weather which ſhe had endured, aſwell before her looſing company as in her abſence: our Generall thought good to bear into St. <hi>Julian</hi> with his fleet, becauſe it was ſo nigh at hand, and ſo convenient a place: intending there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh his wearied men, and cheriſh them which had in their abſence taſted ſuch bitterneſſe of diſcomfort beſides the want of many things which they ſuſtained.</p>
                  <p>Thus the next day the 20. of <hi>June</hi> we entred port Saint <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iune</hi> 20.</note> which ſtandeth in 49. deg. 30. mi. and hath on the South ſide of the harbor picked rocks like towers, and within the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor many Iſlands, which you may ride hard aboard off, but in going in you muſt borrow of the North ſhoare.</p>
                  <p>Being now come to anchor, and all things fitted and made ſafe aboard, our Generall with certain of his company, <hi>viz. Thomas Drake</hi> his brother, <hi>John Thomas, Robert Winter, Oliver</hi> the Maſter Gunner, <hi>John Brewer,</hi> and <hi>Thomes Hood</hi>) <hi>June</hi> 22.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>June</hi> 22</note> rowed further in with a boate to find out ſome convenient place which might yeild us freſh water, during the time of our abode there, &amp; furniſh us with ſupply for proviſion, to take to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58006:62"/>
ſea with us at our departure. Which work as it was of great neceſſity, and therefore carefully to be performed; ſo did not he think himſelf diſcharged of his duty, if he himſelf beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the firſt travell therein, as his uſe was at all times in all other things belonging to the relieving of our wants, and the maintenance of our good eſtate, by the ſupplying of what was needfull. Preſantly upon his landing he was viſited by two of the inhabitants of the place, whom <hi>Magellane</hi> named <hi>Patagous</hi> or rather <hi>Pentagours</hi> from their huge ſtature, and ſtrength pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable: theſe as they ſeemed greatly to rejoyce at his ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall, ſo did they ſhew themſelves very familiar, receiving at our generals hands whatſoever he gave them, and taking great pleaſure in ſeeing Maſter <hi>Oliver</hi> the maſter Gunner of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall, to ſhoot an Engliſh arrow: trying with him to ſhoot at at length, but came nothing neere him.</p>
                  <p>Not long after, came one more of the ſame laſte, but of a ſowrer ſort, for he, miſliking of the familiarity which his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows had uſed, ſeemed very angey with them, and ſtrove earne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly to withdraw them, and turn them to become our enemies; Which our generall with his men not ſuſpecting in them, uſed them as before: and one Mr. <hi>Robert Winter,</hi> thinking of pleaſure to ſhoot an arrow at length. as Mr. <hi>Oliver</hi> had done before, that he which came laſt might have a ſight thereof, the ſtring of his bow brake; which, as before it was a terror unto them, ſo now broken, it gave them great incouragement, and boldneſs, and as they thought, great advantage in their treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous intent and purpoſe; not imagining that our callivers, ſwords, and targets, were any munition or weapon of war.</p>
                  <p>In which perſwaſion (as the generall with his company were, puietly without any ſuſpition of evill, going down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his boat) they ſuddainly being prepared, and gotten by ſtealth behind him, ſhot their arrows; and chiefly at him which had the bow, not ſuffering him to ſtring the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, which he was about to have done, as well as he could: but being wounded in the ſhoulder at the firſt ſhot, and turning
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58006:62"/>
about, was ſped with an arrow, which pierced his lungs, yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

In this extremitie, if our general had not been both expert in ſuch affaires, able to judge, and give preſent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in the danger thereof, and had not valiantly thruſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the dance, againſt theſe monſters, there had not one of our men, that there were landed, eſcaped with life. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore giving order that no man ſhould keep any certain ground, but ſhift from place to place, encroaching ſtill upon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, uſing their targets, and other weapons for the defence of their bodies, and that they ſhould breake ſo many arrows, as by any meanes they could come by, being ſhot at them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he himſelf was very diligent, and carefull alſo in calling on them, knowing that their arrows being once ſpent, they ſhould have theſe enemies at their devotion and pleaſure, to kill or ſave, and this order being accordingly taken, himſelf I ſay with a good courage and truſt in the true and living God, take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſhooting off the ſame piece, which the ſame Gunner could not make to take fire, diſpatched the firſt beginner of the quarrell, the ſame man which ſlew our Mr. Gunner. For the piece being charged with a bullet, and haile ſhot, and well aimed, tare out his belly and guts, with great torment, as it ſeemed by his cry, which was ſo hideous and horrible a roare, as if ten buls had joyned together in roaring, wherewith the courage of his partners was ſo abated, and their hearts appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that notwithſtanding, divers of their fellows and country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men appeared out of the woods, on each ſide yet they were glad, by flying away to ſave themſelves, quietly ſuffering our men either to depart or ſtay.

                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:58006:63"/>That night our Mr. Gunners body being left aſhoare, for the ſpeedier bringing of the other aboard, our generall himſelf the next day, with his boate well appointed, returned to the ſhore, to fetch it likewiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they found lying where it was left, but ſtript off his uppermoſt garment, and having an Engliſh arrow ſtruck in his right eye.</p>
                  <p>Both of theſe dead bodies were laid together in one grave, with ſuch reverence, as was fit for the earthen tabernacles of immortall ſoules; with ſuch commendable ceremonies, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto ſouldiers of worth, in time of war, which they moſt truly and rightfully deſerved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Magellane</hi> was not altogether deceived, in naming of them Giants; for they generally differ from the common ſort of men, both in ſtature, bigneſſe, and ſtrength of body, as alſo in the hideouſneſſe of their voice: but yet they are nothing ſo monſtrous, or Giantlike as they were reported; there being ſome Engliſh men, as tall as the higheſt of any that we could ſee, but peradventure, the Spaniards did not think, that ever any Engliſh man would come thither to repove them; and thereupon might preſume the more boldly to lie: the name <hi>Pentagones, five cubits, viz.</hi> 7. foot and half, deſcribing the full height (if not ſome what more) of the higheſt of them.</p>
                  <p>But this is certain, that the Spaniſh cruelties there uſed, have made them more monſtrous, in mind and manners, then they are in body; and more inhoſpitable, to deale with any ſtrangers that ſhal come hereafter. For the loſs of their friends (the remembrance whereof is aſſigned and conveighed over from one generation to another, among their poſterity) breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an old grudg, which will not eaſily be forgotten, with ſo quarrelſome &amp; revengefull a people. Notwithſtanding the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror which they had conceived of us, did henceforward ſo quench their heat, &amp; take down their edge, that they both for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat revenge, and ſeeming by their countenance, to repent them of the wrong they had offered us, that meant them no harm, ſuffered us to doe what we would, the whole ſpace of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58006:63"/>
two moneths after this, without any interruption or moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by them, and it may perhaps be a meanes to breed a peace in that people, towards all that may hereafter this, come that way.</p>
                  <p>To this evill, thus received at the hands of Infidels, there was adjoyned and grew another miſchief, wrought and continued cloſely among our ſelves, as great, yea far greater, and of farre more grievous conſequence then the former: but that it was, by Gods providence, detected and prevented in time, which elſe had extended it ſelf, not only to the violent ſhedding of innocent bloud, by murthering our generall and ſuch others as were moſt firm and faithfull to him: but alſo to the finall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the whole action intended, and to divers other moſt dangerous effects.</p>
                  <p>Theſe plots have been laid before the voyage began in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: the very modell of them was ſhewed and declared to our Generall in his garden at <hi>Plimmouth,</hi> before his ſetting ſaile, which yet he either would not credit, as true or likely, of a perſon whom he loved ſo deerely, and was perſwaded of to love him likewiſe unfainedly, or thought by love and benefits, to remove and remedy it, if there were any evill purpoſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived againſt him.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, he did not only continue (to this ſuſpected &amp; accuſed perſon) all countenance, credit, &amp; courteſies, which he was wont to ſhew and give him; but increaſed them, uſing him in a manner as another himſelf, and as his moſt inmoſt friend: lodging him with himſelf; giving him the ſecond place, in all companies, in his preſence; leaving in his hand, the ſtate as it were of his own perſon, in his abſence; imparting unto him all his counſells; allowing him free liberty in all things that were reaſonable; and bearing often at his hands great infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; yea, deſpiſing that any private injury, ſhould breake ſo firm a friendſhip, as he meant towards him. And therefore, was he oftentimes not a little offended, even with thoſe, who upon conſcience of their duty, and knowledge that otherwiſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58006:64"/>
they ſhould indeed offend) diſcloſed from time to time unto him, how the fire increaſed, that threatned his own, together with the deſtruction of the whole action.</p>
                  <p>But at length, perceiving that his lenity and favours did little good; in that the heat of ambition was not yet allayed, nor could be quenched, as it ſeemed, but by bloud; and that the manifold practiſes grew dayly more and more, even to extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; he thought it high time, to call theſe practiſes into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton, before it were too late, to call any queſtion of them into hearing. And therefore ſetting good watch over him, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling all his Captains, and gentlemen of his company to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; he propounded to them, the good parts which were in the gentleman, the great good will, and inward affection, more then brotherly, which he had ever, ſince his firſt acquaintance born him, not omitting the reſpect which was had of him, among no mean perſonages in <hi>England</hi>; and afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the letters, which were written to him, with the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars from time to time, which had been obſerved, not ſo much by himſelf, as by his good friends; not only at ſea, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at <hi>Plimmouth</hi>; not bare words but writings; not writings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but actions, tending to the overthrow of the ſervice in hand, and making away of his perſon.</p>
                  <p>Proofs were required and alleadged, ſo many, and ſo evident, that the Gentleman himſelf, ſtricken with remorſe of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate and unkind dealing, acknowledged himſelf to have deſerved death, yea many deaths; for that he conſpired, not only the overthrow of the action, but of the principall Actor alſo, who was not a ſtranger or ill-willer, but a deare and true friend unto him: and therefore in a great aſſembly openly beſought them, in whoſe hands juſtice reſted, to take ſome or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for him; that he might not be compelled, to enforce his own hands, againſt his own bowels, or otherwiſe to become his own executioner.</p>
                  <p>The admiration and aſtoniſhment hereat, in all the hearers even thoſe which were his neereſt friends, and moſt affected
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58006:64"/>
him was great, yea in thoſe, which for many benefits received from him, had good cauſe to love him: but yet the generall was moſt of all diſtracted; and therefore withdrew himſelf, as not able to conceale his tender affection, requiring them that had heard the whole matter, to give their judgements, as they would another day anſwer it unto their Prince, and unto Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, judge of all the earth. Therefore they all, above 40. in number, the chiefeſt in place and judgment in the whole fleet, after they had diſcuſſed diverſly of the caſe, and alledged whatſoever came in their mindes, or could be there produced by any of his other friends, with their own hands, under ſeale adjuged that: <hi>He had deſerved death: and that it ſtood, by no means with their ſafety, to let him live: and therefore, they remitted the manner thereof, with the reſt of the circumſtances to the generall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This judgement, and as it were aſſize, was held a land, in one of the Iſlands of that port; which afterwards, in memory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was called, the Iſland of <hi>true juſtice and judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now after this verdict was thus returned unto our generall (unto whom, for his company, her Majeſty before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, had committed her ſword, to uſe for his ſafety, with this word: <hi>We do account that he which ſtriketh at thee Drake, ſtriketh at us</hi>) he called for the guilty party, and cauſed to be read unto him, the ſeverall verdicts which were written, &amp; propounded of him, which being acknowledg'd for the moſt part (for none had given heavier ſentence againſt him, then he had given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf, our Generall propoſed unto him this choyce: <hi>Whether he would take to be executed in this Iſland? or to be ſet a land on the main? or return into England, there to anſwer his deed before the Lords of her Majeſties Counſell?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He moſt humbly thanked the Generall for his clemency, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended towards him in ſuch ample ſort: and craving ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpit to conſult thereon, and ſo make his choyce adviſedly: the next day he returned this anſwer, that, <hi>Albeit he had yeelded in his heart, to entertain ſo great a ſin; as whereof now he was juſtly condemned: yet he had a care, and that excelling all other cares,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58006:65"/>
to dye a chriſtian man, that whatſoever did become of his clay body, he might remain aſſured of an eternall inheritance, in a far better life. This he feared, if he ſhould be ſet a land among Infidels, how he ſhould be able to maintain this aſſurance, feeling in his own frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, how mighty the contagion is of lewd cuſtome.</hi> And therefore he beſought the Generall moſt earneſtly, that <hi>he would yet have a care, and regard of his ſoul; and never jeapard it amongſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and ſavage Infidels. If he ſhould return into England, he muſt firſt have a ſhip, and men to conduct it, with ſufficient victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als: two of which though they were had, yet for the third, he thought no man would accompanie him, in ſo ſad a meſſage, to ſo vile an iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, from ſo honourable a ſervice. But if that there were, which could induce their minds, to return with him; yet the very ſhame of the return, would be as death, or grievouſer if it were poſſible: becauſe he ſhould be ſo long a dying, and dye ſo often. Therefore he profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that with all his heart, he did imbrace the first branch of the Generals proffer; deſiring only his favour, that they might receive the holy communion, once again together before his death; and that he might not dye other then a Gentlemans death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though ſundry reaſons were uſed by many to perſwade him to take either of the other wayes: yet when he remained reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in his former determination, both parts of his laſt requeſt were granted: and the next convenient day, a communion was celebrated, by <hi>Mr. Francis Fletcher,</hi> preacher and paſtor of the fleet at that time. The Generall himſelf communicated in this ſacred ordinance, with this condemned penitent Gentleman; who ſhewed great tokens of a contrite and repentant heart, as who was more deeply diſpleaſed with his own act, then any man elſe. And after this holy repaſt, they denyed alſo at the ſame table together, as chearfully in ſobriety, as ever in their lives they had done aforetime: each cheering up the other, and taking their leave, by drinking each to other, as if ſome jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney only had been in hand.</p>
                  <p>After dinner, all things being brought in readineſs, by him that ſupplyed the room of the provoſt Marſhall; without any
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58006:65"/>
dallying, or delaying the time, he came forth, and kneeled down, preparing at once, his neck for the axe, and his ſpirit for heaven: which having done, without long ceremony, as who had before digeſted this whole Tragedy, he deſired all the reſt to pray for him, and willed the Executioner to doe his offices not to feare nor ſpare.</p>
                  <p>Thus having by the worthy manner of his death (being much more honorable by it, then blameable for any other of his actions) fully blotted out, what ever ſtain, his fault might ſeem to bring upon him; he left unto our fleet, a lamentable example of a goodly Gentleman, who in ſeeking advancement unfit for him, caſt away himſelf: and unto poſterity a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of I know not what fatal calamity, incident to that port, and ſuch like actions, which might happily afford a new pair of parallels, to be added to Plutarchs: in that the ſame place, neere about the ſame time of the year, witneſſed the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of 2. gentlemen, ſuffring both for the like cauſe, imployed both in like ſervice, entertained both in great place, endued both with excellent qualities, the one 58. year after the other.</p>
                  <p>For on the main, our men found a gibbet, fallen down, made of a ſpruce maſt, with mens bones underneath it, which they conjectured to be the ſame gibbet, which <hi>Magellane</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be erected, in the yeare 1520. for the execution of <hi>John Carthagene</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Burgos</hi> Coſen, who by the Kings or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, was joyned with Magellane in commiſſion, and made his Vice-Admirall.</p>
                  <p>In the Iſland, as we digged to bury this gentleman, we found a great grinding-ſtone, broken in two parts, which we took and ſet faſt in the ground, the one part at the head, the other at the feet, building up the middle ſpace, with other ſtones and turfes of earth, and engraved in the ſtones, the names of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties buried there, with the time of their departure, and a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall of our Generals name in Latine, that it might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be underſtood, of all that ſhould come after us.</p>

                  <p>It hath formerly been received as an undoubted truth, that the ſeas, following the courſe of the firſt mover, from the eaſt to weſt, have a continuall current through this ſtraite, but our experience found the contrary: the ebbings and flowings here, being as orderly (in which the water riſes and fals more then 5. fathoms upright) as on other coaſts.</p>
                  <p>The 24. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> being <hi>Bartholomew</hi> day, we fell with 3. Iſlands, bearing trianglewiſe one from another, one of them was very faire and large, and of a fruitful ſoile, upon which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing next unto us, and the weather very calm, our Generall with his Gentlemen, and certain of his Marriners, then land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; taking poſſeſſion thereof in her Majeſties name, and to her uſe, and called the ſame <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Iſland.</p>
                  <p>The other two, though they were not ſo large, nor ſo fair to the eye, yet were they to us exceeding uſefull, for in them we found great ſtore of ſtrange birds, which could not fly at all, nor yet run ſo faſt, as that they could eſcape us with their lives, in body they are leſs then a gooſe, and bigger then a mallard, ſhort and thick ſet together, having no feathers, but inſteed thereof, a certain hard and matted down; their beakes are not much unlike the bils of crows, they lodg and breed upon the land, where making earths, as the conies do, in the ground, they lay their egs, and bring up their young; their feeding and proviſion to live on, is in the ſea, where they ſwim in ſuch ſort as nature may ſeem to have granted them no ſmall preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in ſwiftneſs, both to prey upon others, and themſelves to eſcape from any others that ſeek to ceaſe upon them, &amp; ſuch was the infinite reſort of theſe birds to theſe Ilands, that in the ſpace of 1. day, we killed no les then 3000. &amp; if the increaſe be according to the number, it is not to be thought, that the world
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58006:67"/>
hath brought forth, a greater bleſſing in one kind of creature in ſo ſmall a circuit, ſo neceſſarily and plentifully ſerving the uſe of man, they are a very good and wholeſome victuall: our Generall named theſe Iſlands, the one <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> according to the day; the other Saint <hi>Georges,</hi> in honour of <hi>England,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ancient cuſtome there obſerved.</p>
                  <p>In the Iſland of Saint <hi>George,</hi> we found the body of a man, ſo long dead before, that his bones would not hold together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved out of the place whereon they lay.</p>
                  <p>From theſe Iſlands, to the entrance into the ſouth ſea, the frete is very crooked; having many turnings, &amp; as it were ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings up, as if there were no paſſage at al, by means whereof, we were often troubled with contrary winds, ſo that ſome of our ſhips recovering a cape of land, entring another reach, the reſt were forced to alter their courſe, and come to anchor where they might. It is true which <hi>Magellane</hi> reporteth of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: namely that there be many faire harbours, and ſtore of freſh water; but ſome ſhips had need to be fraughted with nothing elſe, beſides anchors and cables, to find ground in moſt of them, to come to anchor; which when any extreame guſts or contrary winds do come (whereunto the place is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubject) is a great hindrance to the paſſage, and carryeth with it no ſmall danger.</p>
                  <p>The land on both ſides is very high and mountainous, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on the North and weſt ſide the continent of <hi>America,</hi> and on the ſouth and Eaſt part, nothing but Iſlands: among which, lye innumerable fretes or paſſages into the ſouth ſea. The mountains ariſe with ſuch tops, and ſpires into the aire, &amp; of ſo rare a height, as they may wel be accounted amogſt the wonders of the world; environed as it were, with many regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of congealed clouds, and frozen meteors, whereby they are continually fed and increaſed, both in the height and bigneſs, from time to time, retaining that which they have once recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, being little again diminiſhed by the heat of the ſun, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo farre from reflexion, and ſo nigh the cold and frozen Region.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:58006:67"/>But notwithſtanding all this, yet are the low and plaine grounds very fruitfull, the graſſe green and naturall, the heards that are of very ſtrange ſorts, good and many; the trees for the moſt part of them alwaies green; the aire of the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of our countrey; the water moſt pleaſant; and the ſoile agreeing to any grain which we have growing in our country: a place no doubt, that lacketh nothing, but a people to uſe the ſame to the Creators glory, and the encreaſing of the Church: the people inhabiting theſe parts, made fires as we paſſed by in divers places.</p>
                  <p>Drawing nigh the entrance of the ſouth ſea, we had ſuch a ſhutting up to the northward, and ſuch large and open fretes toward the ſouth, that it was wonderful which way we ſhould paſſe, without further diſcovery: for which cauſe, our Generall having brought his fleet to anchor under an Iſland; himſelf with certain of his Gentlemen, rowed in a boat to deſcry the paſſage, who having diſcovered a ſufficient way towards the North, in their return to their ſhips, met a Cannow under the ſame Iſland, where we rode then at anchor, having in her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers perſons.</p>
                  <p>This Cannow or Foate was made of the barke of divers trees, having a prow and a ſtern ſtanding up, and ſemicircle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe yeelding inward, of one form and faſhion; the body whereof was a moſt dainty mould, bearing in it moſt comely proportion, and excellent workmanſhip; inſomuch as to our Generall and us, it ſeemed never to have been done, without the cunning and expert judgment of art, and that not for the uſe of ſo rude and barbarous a people, but for the pleaſure of ſome great and noble perſonage, yea of ſome Prince: It had no other cloſing up or caulking in the ſeames, but the ſtichin with thongs, made of Sealeskins, or other ſuch beaſt, and yet ſo cloſe that it received very little or no water at all.</p>
                  <p>The people are of a meane ſtature, but well ſet and compact in all their parts and lims; they have great pleaſure in paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their faces, as the others have, of whom we have ſpoken:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58006:68"/>
before. Within the ſaid Iſland they had a houſe of mean buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of certain poles, and covered with skins of beaſts; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therein fire, water, and ſuch meat, as commonly they can come by: as Seales, Muſſels, and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>The veſſels wherein they kept their water, and their cups in which they drink, are made of barks of trees, as was their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now: and that with no leſſe skill (for the bigneſſe of the thing) being of a very formal ſhape and good faſhion. Their working tools, which they uſe in cutting theſe things and ſuch other, are knives made of moſt huge and monſtrous muſſel ſhels (the like whereof have not been ſeen or heard of lightly by any travellers; the meat thereof being very ſavoury and good in eating) which after they have broken off the thinne and brittle ſubſtance of the edge, they rub and grinde them upon ſtones had for the purpoſe, til they have tempered and ſet ſuch an edg upon them, that no wood is ſo hard but they will cut it at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with the ſame: whereof we our ſelves had experience. Yea they cut therewith bones of a marvellous hardneſſe; making of them fiſgies to kill fiſh, wherein they have a moſt pleaſant exerciſe with great dexterity.</p>

                  <p>Only this by all our mens obſervations was concluded; that the entrance, by which we came into this ſtrait, was in 52. deg. the middeſt in 53. deg. 15. m. and the going out in 52. d. 30. m. being 150. leagues in length: at the very entry, ſuppoſed alſo to be about 10. leagues in bredth.

                  <p>From this bay of parting of friends, we were forcibly driven back again into 55. deg. towards the pole Antartick.

But the winds returning to their old wont, and the ſeas raging after their former manner, yea every thing as it were ſetting it ſelf againſt our peace and deſired reſt, here was no ſtay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, neither any ſafety to be looked for.</p>

The winds were ſuch as if the bowels of the earth had ſet all at liberty; or as if the clouds under heaven had been called together, to lay their force on that one place: the ſeas, which by nature and of themſelves are heavy, and of a weighty ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, were rowled up from the depths, even from the roots of the rocks, as if it had been a ſcroll of parchment, which by the extremity of heat runneth together: and being aloft were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in moſt ſtrange manner &amp; abundance, as feathers or drifts of ſnow, by the violence of the winds, to water the exceeding tops of high and lofty mountains. Our anchors, as falſe friends in ſuch a danger, gave over their holdfaſt, and as if it had been with horror of the thing, did ſhrink down to hide themſelves in this miſerable ſtorm; committing the diſtreſſed ſhip and helpleſſe men to the uncertain rowling ſeas, which toſſed them, like a ball in a racket. In this caſe, to let fall more anchors would availe us nothing; for being driven from our firſt place of ancoring, ſo unmeaſurable was the depth, that 500. fathom would fetch no ground: ſo that the violent ſtorm without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion; the impoſſibility to come to anchor; the want of opportunity to ſpread any ſaile; the moſt mad ſeas; the lee ſhores; the dangerous rocks; the contrary and moſt intolerable winds; the impoſſible paſſage out; the deſperate tarrying there; and inevitable perils on every ſide, did lay before us ſo ſmall likelihood to eſcape preſent deſtruction, that if the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall providence of God himſelf had not ſupported us, we could never have endured that wofull ſtate: as being invironed with moſt terrible and moſt fearful judgments round about. For tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it was more likely that the mountains ſhould have been rent in ſunder, from the top to the bottom, and caſt hedlong into the ſea, by theſe unnaturall winds; then that we, by any help or cunning of man, ſhould free the life of any one amongſt us.</p>

Even God (whom not the winds and ſeas alone, but even the Divels themſelves and powers of hell obey) did ſo wonderfully free us, and make our way open before us, as it were by his holy Angels ſtil guiding and conducting us, that more then the affright and amaze of this eſtate, we received no part of damage in all the things that belonged unto us.</p>
                  <p>But eſcaping from theſe ſtraites and miſeries, as it were through the needlesey (that God might have the greater glory in our delivery) by the great and effectuall care and travell of our Generall, the Lords inſtrument therein; we could now no longer forbeare, but muſt needs find ſome place of refuge, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to provide water, wood, and other neceſſaries, as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort our men, thus worn and tyred out, by ſo many and ſo long intollerable toyls: the like whereof, it to be ſuppoſed, no tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller hath felt, neither hath their ever been ſuch a tempeſt (that any records make mention of) ſo violent, and of ſuch continuance, ſince <hi>Noahs</hi> flood, for as hath been ſaid it laſted from <hi>September</hi> 7. to <hi>October</hi> 28. full 52. dayes.</p>
                  <p>Not many leagues therefore to the ſouthwards of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer anchoring, we ran in again among theſe Iſlands; where we had once more better likelihood to reſt in peace: and ſo much the rather, for that we found the people of the country travelling for their living, from one Iſland to another, in their canows, both men, women, and young infants wrapt in skins, and hanging at their mothers backs; with whom he had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique for ſuch things as they had, as chains of certain ſhels and ſuch other trifles; here the Lord gave us three days to breath our ſelves, and to provide ſuch things as we wanted, albeit the ſame was with continuall care, and troubles to avoid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent dangers, which the troubled ſeas and bluſtering winds did every hour threaten unto us.</p>

more rigorouſly aſſaulted by the not formerly ended, but now more violently renewed ſtorm; and driven them alſo with no ſmall danger; leaving behind us the greater part of our cable with the anchor; being chaſed along by the winds, and buffeted inceſſantly in each quarter by the ſeas (which our Generall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, as though God had ſent them of purpoſe to the end which enſued) till at length we fell with the uttermoſt part of land towards the ſouth pole, and had certainly diſcovered how far the ſame doth reach ſouthward, from the coaſt of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica aforenamed.</p>
                  <p>The uttermoſt Cape or hedland of all theſe Iſlands, ſtands neere in the 56. deg. without which there is no main, nor Iland to be ſeen to the ſouthwards: but that the Atlantick Ocean, and the ſouth ſea, meet in a moſt large and free ſcope.</p>
                  <p>It hath been a dreame through many ages, that theſe Iſlands have been a maine, and that it hath been <hi>terra incognita</hi>; wherein many ſtrange monſters lived.

                  <p>And here as in a fit place, it ſhall not be a miſſe to remove that error in opinion, which hath been held by many, of the impoſſible return, out of <hi>Mar del zur,</hi> into the Weſt Ocean; by reaſon of the ſuppoſed Eaſtern current, and leavant winds: which (ſay they) ſpeedily carry any thither, but ſuffer no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. They are herein likewiſe altogether deceived: for neither did we meet with any ſuch current, neither had we any ſuch certain winds, with any ſuch ſpeed to carry us through; but at all times in our paſſage there, we found more opportunity to return back again into the weſt Ocean, then to goe forward into <hi>Mar del zur,</hi> by meanes, either of current, or winds to

And in that they allege the narrowneſſe of the frete, and want of ſea-rome, to be the cauſe of this violent current; they are herein no leſſe deceived, then they were in the other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon: for beſides, that it cannot be ſaid, that there is one only paſſage, but rather innumerable; it is moſt certain, that a ſea-board all theſe Iſlands, there is one large and main ſea, wherein if any will not be ſatisfied, nor believe the report of our experience and eyeſight, he ſhould be adviſed to ſuſpend his judgment, till he hath either tryed it himſelf, by his own travell, or ſhall underſtand by other travellers, more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to confirm his mind therein.</p>
                  <p>Now as we were fallen to the uttermoſt part of theſe Ilands <hi>October</hi> 28.<note place="margin">

                  <p>The cauſe of this force and injury by theſe <hi>Ilanders,</hi> was no other but the deadly hatred which they bear againſt their civil enemies the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for the bloudy and moſt tirannous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion which they had uſed towards them.

                  <p>The ſame day that we receiv'd this dangerous affront, in the afternoon we ſet ſaile from thence; and becauſe we were now nigh the appointed height, wherein our ſhips were to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, as alſo the extremity and craſie ſtate of our hurt men adviſing us to uſe expedition, to finde ſome convenient place of repoſe, which might afford them ſome reſt, and yeild us ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſupply of freſh victuals for their diet; we bent our courſe, as the wind would ſuffer us, directly to run in with the main.

Yet in their return to us, they deſcryed within the bay, an Indian with his Canow as he was a fiſhing: him they brought aboard our generall, canow and all as he was in it.

                  <p>This man being courteouſly entertained, and his pains of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming double requited; after we had ſhewed him, partly by ſigns, and partly by ſuch things as we had, what things we needed, and would gladly receive by his means, upon exchang of ſuch things as he would deſire; we ſent him away with our boat and his own canow (which was made of Reed ſtraw) to land him where he would.

                  <p>By his coming as we underſtood, that there was no meane or way, to have our neceſſities relieved in this place; ſo he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelf to be our Pilot, to a place and that a good harbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, not far back to the Southward again: where, by way of traffique, we might have at pleaſure, both water, and thoſe other things which we ſtood in need of.

                  <p>Our neceſſities being thus to our content relieved, our next care was the regaining (if poſſible) of the company of our ſhips, ſo long ſevered from us: neither would any thing have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied our general, or us ſo wel, as the happy meeting, or good news of them, this way therefore (all other thoughts, for the preſent ſet apart) were all our ſtudies and endeavours bent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>To this end, conſidering that we could not conveniently run in with our ſhip (in ſearch of them) to every place where was likelihood of being in harbor; and that our boat was to little, and unable to carry men enough, to encounter the malice or treachery of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (if we ſhould by any chance meet with any of them) who are uſed to ſhew no mercy, where they may overmaſter; and therefore meaning not to hazard our ſelves to their cruel courteſie; we determined, as we coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted now towards the line, to ſearch diligently for ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place, where we might in peace and ſafety, ſtay the triming of our ſhip, and the erecting of a pinnace, in which we might have better ſecurity, then in our boat, and without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering of our ſhip, by running into each creek, leave no place untried, if happily we might ſo finde again our friends and countrimen.</p>

                  <p>As we ſayled along, continually ſearching for freſh water; we came to a place called <hi>Tarapaca,</hi> and landing there we ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on a <hi>Spaniard</hi> who lay aſleep, and had lying by him 13. bars of ſilver, weighing in all, about 4000.

freed him of his charg, which otherwiſe perhaps would have kept him waking, and ſo left him to take out (if it pleaſed him) the other part of his ſleep in more ſecurity.</p>
                  <p>Our ſearch for water ſtill continuing, as we landed again not far from thence, we met a <hi>Spaniard</hi> with an Indian boy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> driving 8. Lambs or <hi>Peruvian</hi> ſheep: each ſheep bare two leathern bags, and in each bag was 50. pound weight of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined ſilver, in the whole 800. weight: we could not indure to ſee a gentleman <hi>Spaniard</hi> turnd Carrier ſo; and therefore without intreaty, we offered our ſervice, and became drovers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> only his directions was not ſo perfect, that we could keep the way which he intended; for almoſt as ſoon as he was parted from us, we with our new kind of carriages, were come unto our boats.</p>
                  <p>Farther beyond this cape fore-mentioned lie certain Indian towns, from whence as we paſſed by, came many of the people in certain bawſes made of Seals ſkins; of which two being joyned together of a juſt length, and ſide by ſide, reſemble in faſhion or form of a boat: they have in either of them a ſmall gut, or ſome ſuch thing blown ful of wind; by reaſon whereof it floateth, and is rowed very ſwiftly, carrying in it no ſmall burthen. In theſe upon ſight of our ſhip, they brought ſtore of fiſh of divers ſorts, to trafique with us, for any trifles we would give them: as knives, margarites, glaſſes, and ſuch like, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, men of 60. and 70. years old, were as glad as if they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome exceeding rich commodity, being a moſt ſimple and plain dealing people.

                  <p>Nor far from this, <hi>viz.</hi> in 22. deg. 30. min. lay <hi>Mormorena,</hi> another great town of the ſame people, over whom 2. <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> held the government, with theſe our generall thought meet to deale; or at leaſt to try their courteſie, whether they would, in way of traffique, give us ſuch things as we needed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Amongſt other things which we had of them, the ſheep of the country (<hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as we mentioned before bearing the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern bags) were moſt memorable. Their height and length was equal to a pretty cow, &amp; their ſtrength fully anſwerable if not by much exceeding their ſize or ſtature. Upon one of their backs did ſit at one time three well grown and tall men, and one boy, no mans foot touching the ground by a large foot in length, the beaſt nothing at all complaining of his burthen in the mean time. Theſe ſheep have necks like Camels; their heads bearing a reaſonable reſemblance of another ſheep. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> uſe them to great profit. Their wool is exceeding fine, their fleſh good meat, their increaſe ordinary, and beſides they ſupply the room of horſes for burthen or travell: yea they ſerve to carry over the mountains, marvellous loads, for 300. leagues together, where no other carriage can be made but by them only.

From whoſe high and ſnow-covered mountains, the north and northweſt winds (the conſtant viſitants of thoſe coaſts) ſend abroad their frozen nimphs, to the infecting of the whole aire with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable ſharpnes: not permitting the Sun, no not in the pride of his heat, to diſſolve that congealed matter and ſnow, which they have breathed out ſo nigh the Sun, and ſo many degrees diſtant from themſelves.

                  <p>In the mean time our Generall having aſſembled his men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether (as forecaſting the danger, and worſt that might fall out) prepared himſelf to ſtand upon ſure ground, that we might at all times be ready in our own defence, if any thing ſhould chance otherwiſe then was looked for or expected.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore every man being in a warlike readineſs, he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched within his fenced place, making againſt their approach a moſt warlike ſhew (as he did alſo at all other times of their reſort) whereby if they had been deſperat enemies, they could not have choſen, but have conceived error and feare, with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to attempt any thing againſt us, in beholding of the ſame.</p>

                  <p>Theſe things being ſo freely offered, our Generall thought

not meet to reject or refuſe the ſame: both for that we would not give them any cauſe of miſtruſt, or diſliking of him (that being the only place, wherein at this preſent we were of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity inforced to ſeek relief of many things) and chiefly, for that he knew not to what good end God had brought this to paſſe, or what honour or profit it might bring to our country in time to come.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore in the name and to the uſe of her moſt excellent Majeſty, he took the Scepter, Crown and dignity of the ſaid country into his hand: wiſhing nothing more then that it had layen ſo fitly for her Majeſty to enjoy, as it was now her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per own, and that the riches and treaſure thereof (where with in the up-land countries i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The ceremonies of this reſigning, and receiving of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, being thus performed, and the common ſort but of men and women, leaving the king and his guard about him, with our generall, diſperſed themſelves among our people, taking a diligent view or ſurvey of every man; and finding ſuch as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their fancies (which commonly were the youngeſt of us) they preſently encloſing them about, offered their ſacrifices unto them, crying out with lamentable ſhreeks and moanes, weeping and ſcratching, and tearing their very fleſh off their faces with their nailes, neither were it the woman alone which did this, but even old men, roaring, and crying out, were as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent as the women were.</p>
                  <p>We groaned in ſpirit to ſee the power of Sathan ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, in ſeducing theſe ſo harmleſſe ſoules, and laboured by all

means, both by ſhewing our great diſlike, and when that ſerv'd not, by violent with-holding of their hands from that mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, directing them (by our eyes and hands lift up towards heaven) to the living God whom they ought to ſerve: but ſo mad were they upon their Idolatry, that forcible withholding them would not prevaile (for as ſoon as they could get liberty to their hands again, they would be as violent as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) till ſuch time, as they whom they worſhiped, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed from them into the tents, whom yet as men beſides themſelvs, they would with fury &amp; outrage ſeek to have again.</p>
                  <p>After that time had a little qualified their madnes, they then began to ſhew &amp; make known unto us their griefs &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes which they carryed about them, ſome of them having old aches, ſome ſhrunke ſinews, ſome old ſores and cankred ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, ſome wounds more lately received, and the like, in moſt lamentable manner craving help and cure thereof from us: making ſigns, that if we did but blow upon their griefs, or but touched the diſeaſed places, they would be whole.</p>
                  <p>Their griefs we could not but take pitty on them, and to our own deſire to help them: but that (if it pleaſed God to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their eyes) they might underſtand we were but men and no gods, we uſed ordinary means, as lotions, emplaiſters, and unguents moſt fitly (as far as our skils could gueſſe) agreeing to the natures of their griefs, beſeeching God, if it made for his glory, to give cure to their diſeaſes by theſe means. The like we did from time to time as they reſorted to us.</p>
                  <p>Few were the dayes, wherein they were abſent from us, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole time of our abode in that place: and ordinarily every third day, they brought their ſacrifices, till ſuch time, as they certainly underſtood our meaning, that we took no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but were diſpleaſed with them: whereupon their zeale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, and their ſacrificing, for a ſeaſon, to our good liking ceaſed: notwithſtanding they continued ſtill to make their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort unto us in great abundance, and in ſuch ſort, that they oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times forgat, to provide meate for their own ſuſtenance; ſo
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58006:88"/>
that our generall (of whom they made account as of a father) was faine to perform the the office of a father to them, relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them with ſuch victuals as we had provided for our ſelvs, as Muſcles, Seales, and ſuch like, wherein they took exceeding much content; and ſeeing that their ſacrifices were diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to us, yet (hating ingratitude) they ſought to recompence us, with ſuch things as they had, which they willingly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon us, though it were never ſo neceſſary or needfull for themſelves to keep.</p>
                  <p>They are a people of a tractable, free, and loving nature, without guile or treachery; their bows and arrows (their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weapons, and almoſt all their wealth) they uſe uſe very skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, but yet not do any great harm with them, being by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their weakeneſs, more fit for children then for men, ſending the arrow far off, nor with any great force: and yet are the men commonly ſo ſtrong of body, that which 2. or 3. of our men could hardly beare, one of them would take upon his back, and without grudging carry it eaſily away, up hil and down hill an Engliſh mile together: they are alſo exceeding ſwift in running, and of long continuance; the uſe whereof is ſo familiar with them, that they ſeldome goe, but for the moſt part run. One thing we obſerved in them with admiration: that if any time, they chanced to ſee a fiſh ſo neer the ſhoare that they might reach the place without ſwiming, they would ſeldome, or never miſſe to take it.</p>
                  <p>After that our neceſſary buſineſſes were wel diſpatched, our generall with his gentlemen, and many of his company, made a journey up into the land, to ſee the manner of their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and to be the better acquainted with the nature &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of the country: their houſes were all ſuch as we have formerly deſcrbed, and being many of them in one place, made ſeverall villages here and there. The inland we found to be far different from the ſhoare, a goodly country and fruitful ſoil, ſtored with many bleſſings fit for the uſe of man: infinite was the company of very large and fat Deer, which there we ſaw

by thouſands as we ſuppoſed in a herd: beſides a multitude of a ſtrange kind of conies, by far exceeding them in number: their heads and bodies, in which they reſemble other Conies, are but ſmall; his taile like the taile of a Rat, exceeding long; and his feet like paws of a Want or Moale; under his chin, on ether ſide, he hath a bagge, into which he gathereth his meate, when he hath filled his belley abroade, that he may with it, either feed his young, or feed himſelf, when he lifts not to travaile from his burrow: the people eate their bodies, and make great account of their skins, for their Kings holidayes coat was made of them.</p>
                  <p>This country our Generall named <hi>Albion,</hi> and that for two cauſes, the one in reſpect of the white banks and cliffes, which lie toward the ſea: the other, that it might have ſome affinity, even in name alſo, with our own country, which was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſo called.</p>

                  <p>And now, as the time of our departure was perceived by them to draw nigh, ſo did the ſorrows and miſeries of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſeem to themſelves to increaſe upon them; and the more certain they were of our going away, the more doubtfull they ſhewed themſelves, what they might doe; ſo that we might

eaſily judg that that joy (being exceeding great) wherewith they received us at our firſt arrivall, was clean drown'd in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive ſorrow for our departing: for they did not only looſe on a ſuddain all mirth, joy, glad countenance, pleaſant ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, agility of body, familiar rejoycing one with another, and all pleaſure whotever fleſh and bloud might be delighted in, but with ſighs and forrowings, with heavy hearts and grieved minds, they powred out wofull complaints and moanes, with bitter teares and wringing of their hands, tormenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And as men refuſing all comfort, they only accounted themſelves as caſtawaies, and thoſe whom the gods were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to forſake: ſo that nothing we could ſay or doe, was able to eaſe them of their ſo heavy a burthen, or to deliver them from ſo deſperate a ſtrait, as our leaving of them did ſeem to them that it would caſt them into.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit ſeeing they could not ſtill injoy our preſence, they (ſuppoſing us to be gods indeed) thought it their duties to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat us that being abſent, we would yet be mindfull of them, and making ſignes of their deſires, that in time to come we would ſee them again, they ſtole upon us a ſacrifice, and ſet it on fire ere we were a ware: burning therein a chaine and a bunch of feathers. We laboured by all meanes poſſible to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold or withdraw them, but could not prevaile, till at laſt we fell to prayers and ſinging of Pſalms, whereby they were allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red immediately to forget their folly, and leave their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unconſumed, ſuffering the fire to goe out, and imitating us in all our actions; they fell a lifting up their eyes and hands to heaven as they ſaw us doe.</p>
                  <p>The 23. of <hi>July</hi> they took a ſorrowfull farewell of us, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loath to leave us, they preſenly ran to the tops of the hils to keep us in their ſight as long as they could, making fires be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and behind, and on each ſide of them, burning therein (as is to be ſuppoſed) ſacrifices to our departure.</p>

                        <hi>Iuly</hi> 25.</note> And our Generall now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that the extremity of the cold not only continued but increaſed, the Sun being gone father from us, and that the wind blowing ſtill (as it did at firſt) from the northweſt, out off all of finding a paſſage through the northern parts, thought it neceſſary to looſe no time; and therefore with generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all, bent his courſe directly to runne with the Iſlands of the <hi>Moluccas.</hi> And ſo having nothing in our view but aire and ſea, without ſight of any land for the ſpace of full 68. days together, we continued our courſe through the main Ocean, till <hi>September</hi> 30.<note place="margin">

                  <p>There canows were made after the faſhion, that the canows of all the reſt of the Iſlands of <hi>Moluccas</hi> for the moſt part are: that is, of one tree, hollowed within with great art and cunning being made ſo ſmooth both within and without, that they bore a glaſs, as if it were a harneſſe moſt finely burniſhed: a prow and ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At the ends whereof was faſtned croſſewiſe a great cane, the uſe whereof was to keep their canows from overthrowing, and that they might be equally born up on each ſide.</p>

The firſt ſort &amp; company of thoſe canows being come to our ſhip (which then by reaſon of a ſcant wind made a little way) very ſubtilly and againſt their natures, began in peace to traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique with us, giving us one thing for another very orderly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending (as we perceived, hereby to work a greater miſchief to us: intreating us by ſigns moſt earneſtly to draw neerer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſhoare, that they might (if poſſible) make the eaſier prey both of the ſhip and us. But theſe paſſing away, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers continually reſorting, we were quickly able to gueſſe at them what they were: for if they received any thing once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands, they would neither give recompence nor reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of it, but thought what ever they could finger to be their own: expecting alwaies with brows of braſs to receive more, but would part with nothing: yea being rejcted for their bad dealing, as thoſe with whom we would have no more to do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing us ſo evilly, they could not be ſatisfied till they had given the attempt to revenge themſelves, becauſe we would not give them whatſoever they would have for nothing: and having ſtones good ſtore in their canows, let flie a many of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us. It was far from our Generals meaning to requite their malice by like injury. Yet that they might know he had power to do them harm (if he had liſted) he cauſed a great peece to be ſhot off, not to hurt them but to affright them. Which wrought the deſired effect amongſt them, for at the noiſe thereof; they every own leaped out of his canow into the water, and diving under the keele of their boats, ſtayed them from going any way till our ſhip was gone a good way from them.

                  <p>While they were delivering their meſſage to us, our Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was come unto the Court, who being met by the way by certaine noble perſonages, was with great ſolemnity conveyed into the Kings preſence; at whoſe hands he was moſt friendly and graciouſly entertained, and having delivered his errand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his preſent unto the King, the King ſeemed to him to judge himſelfe blame-worthy that he had not ſooner haſted in perſon to preſent himſelfe to our Generall, who came ſo far and from ſo great a Prince; And preſently with all expedition, he made ready himſelfe with the chiefeſt of all his States and Councellors to make repair unto us.</p>
                  <p>The manner of his coming as it was Princely, ſo truly it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to us very ſtrange and marvelous; ſerving at the preſent not ſo much to ſet out his owne royall and kingly ſtate (vvhich vvas great) as to do honour to her Highneſſe to vvhom vve belonged

vvherein hovv vvillingly he imployed himſelfe, the Sequel vvill make manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, before his coming, did he ſend off three great and large Canovves, in each vvhereof, vvere certain of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt perſonaegs that vvere about him, attired all of them in vvhite Lavvn, or cloth of Calecut, having over their heads, from one end of the Canovv to the other, a covering of thin and fine mats, born up by a frame made of Reeds, under vvhich every man ſat in order according to his dignity; the hoary heads of many of them, ſet forth the greater reverence due to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and manifeſtly ſhewed, that the King uſed the adviſe of a grave and prudent Counſell in his affaires. Beſides theſe, were divers others, young and comely men, a great number attired in white as were the other, but with manifeſt differences: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their places alſo under the ſame covering, but in inferior order, as their calling required.</p>
                  <p>The reſt of the men were Souldiers, who ſtood in comely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der round about on both ſides; on the outſide of whom, againe did ſit the rowers in certain galleries, which being three on each ſide all alongſt the Canow, did lie off from the ſide therof, ſome three or four Yards, one being orderly builded lower then the other: in every of vvhich Galleries vvas an equall number of Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58006:93"/>
and ſome of them ſome other weapons, as Lances, Callivers, Bowes, Arrows, and many Darts.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Canowes comming neere our Ship in order, rowed round about us one after another; and the men as they paſſe by us, did us a kind of homage with great ſolemnity, the greateſt Perſonages beginning firſt, with reverend countenance and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour to bow their bodies even to the ground: which done, they put our owne meſſenger aboard us againe, and ſignified to us that their King (who himſelfe was comming) had ſent them before him to conduct our Ship into a better roade, deſiring a Halfer to be given them forth, that they might employ their ſervice as their King commanded, in towing our Ship therewith to the place aſſigned.</p>
                  <p>The King himſelfe was not far behind, but he alſo with ſix grave and ancient Fathers in his Canow approching, did at once together with them, yeeld us a reverend kind of obeyſance in far more humble manner, then was to be expected; he was of a tall ſtature, very corpulent and well ſet together, of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Princely and gratious countenance; his reſpect amongſt his owne was ſuch, that neither his Viceroy of <hi>Mutir</hi> aforenamed, nor any other of his Counſellors, durſt ſpeake unto him but u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their knees, not riſing againe till they were licenced.</p>
                  <p>Whoſe comming as it was to our Generall, no ſmall cauſe of good liking, ſo was he received in the beſt manner we could, anſwerable unto his ſtate: our Ordnance thundred, which we mixed with great ſtore of ſmall ſhot, among which ſounding our trumpets and other inſtruments of muſick, both of ſtill and loud noiſe, wherwith he was ſo much delighted, that requeſting our muſick to come into the Boat, he joyned his Canow to the ſame, &amp; was towed at leaſt a whole hour together, with the boat at the ſterne of our Ship: Beſides this our Generall ſent him ſuch preſents, as he thought, might both requite his courteſie already received, and worke a farther confirmation of that good liking and friendſhip already begun.</p>
                  <p>The King being thus in muſicall paradiſe, and enjoying that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58006:93"/>
wherewith he was ſo highly pleaſed; his brother named <hi>Moro</hi> with no leſſe bravery, then any of the reſt, accompanied alſo with a great number of gallant followers, made the like repair, and gave us like reſpect; and his homage done he fell a ſterne of us, till we came to anchor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither did our Generall leave his courteſie unrewarded, but bountifully pleaſed him alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we parted.</p>
                  <p>The King as ſoone as we were come to anchor, craved par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done to be gone, and ſo tooke leave, promiſing us, that the next day he would come aboard, and in the meane time would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and ſend ſuch Victuals as were requiſite and neceſſary for our proviſion.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly the ſame night, and the morrow following, we received what was there to be had, by way of traffique, <hi>to wit,</hi> Rice in pretty quantity, Hens, Sugar-canes, imperfect and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid Sugar, a fruit which they call <hi>Figo</hi> (<hi>Magellane</hi> cals it a Fig of a ſpan long, but is no other then that which the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> and <hi>Portugals</hi> have named <hi>Plantanes</hi>) <hi>Cocoes</hi> and a kind of meale<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they call <hi>Sago,</hi> made of the tops of certaine trees, taſting in the mouth like ſowre curdes, but melts away like Sugar; whereof they make a kinde of cake which will keepe good at leaſt ten yeers; of this laſt we made the greateſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of our proviſion: for a few Cloves we did alſo traffique, whereof for a ſmall matter, we might have had grearer ſtore, then we could well tell where to beſtow: but our Generals care vvas that the Ship ſhould not be too much peſtered or anoyed therewith.</p>
                  <p>At the time appointed our Generall (having ſet all things in order to receive him) looked for the Kings returne, who fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling both in time and promiſe, ſent his Brother to make his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, and to intreat our Generall to come on ſhoar; his brother being the while to remain aboard, as a pawne for his ſafe reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: our Generall could willingly have conſented, if the King himſelfe had not firſt broke his word the conſideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, bred an utter diſliking in the whole company, who by no
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58006:94"/>
meanes would give conſent, he ſhould hazard himſelfe, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, for that the Kings Brother had uttered certaine words, in ſecret conference with our Generall aboard his Cabbin, which bred no ſmall ſuſpition of ill intent; our General being thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to goe a ſhoar at that time, reſerved the Viceroy for a pledge, and ſo ſent certaine of his Gentlemen to the Court, both to accompany the Kings Brother, and alſo with ſpeciall meſſage to the King himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>They being come ſomewhat neere unto the Caſtle, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by another Brother of the Kings, and certaine others of the greateſt States and conducted with great honour towards the Caſtle, where being brought into a large and faire houſe, they ſaw gathered together a great multitude of people, by ſuppoſition at leaſt a thouſand, the chief whereof were placed round about the Houſe, according as it ſeemed to their degrees and calling, the reſt remained without.</p>
                  <p>The Houſe was in forme four ſquare, covered all over with cloth of divers colours, not much unlike our uſuall Pentadoes borne upon a frame of Reeds, the ſides being open from the groundſell to the covering, and furniſhed with ſeates round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout: it ſeemes it was there Councell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>houſe and not common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly employed to any other uſe.</p>
                  <p>At the ſide of this houſe next unto the Caſtle was feared the chaire of ſtate, having directly over it, and extending very larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every way, a very faire and rich Canopy, as the ground alſo for ſome ten or twelve paces compaſſe, was covered with cloth of Arias.</p>
                  <p>Whileſt our Gentlemen attended in this place the comming of the King, which was about the ſpace of halfe an hour, they had the better opportunity to obſerve theſe things; as alſo that before the Kings comming, there were already ſet threeſcore noble grave and ancient perſonages, all of them reported to be of the Kings privy Councell; at the the nether end of the houſe were placed a great company of young men, of comely perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and attire. Without the houſe on the right ſide, ſtood four
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58006:94"/>
ancient comely hoare-headed men, clothed all in red downe to the ground, but attired on their heads not much unlike the <hi>Turks</hi>; theſe they called <hi>Romans,</hi> or Strangers, who lay as Lidgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers there to keepe continuall traffique with this people: there were alſo two <hi>Turks</hi> one <hi>Italian</hi> as Lidgiers; and laſt of all one <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who being freed by the Kings out of the hands of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> in the recovering of the Iſland, ſerved him now in ſtead of a Souldier.</p>
                  <p>The King at laſt coming from the Caſtle with 8. or 10. more grave Senators following him, had a very rich Canopy (adorned in the middeſt with Emboſſings of Gold) borne over him, and was guarded with 12. Lances the points turned downward: our men (accompanied with <hi>Moro</hi> the Kings brother) aroſe to meet him, and he very graciouſly did welcome and entertain them.</p>
                  <p>He was for Perſon, ſuch as we have before deſcribed him, of low voice, temperate in ſpeech, of Kingly demeanour, and a <hi>Moore</hi> by Nation. His attire was after the faſhion of the reſt of his Country, but far more ſumptuous, as his condition and ſtate required: from the Waſte to the ground, was all Cloth of Gold, and that very rich; his Legs bare, but on his Feet a paire of Shooes of Cordivant died Red: in the attire of his head, were finely wreathed in divers rings of plated Gold, of an inch, or an inch and halfe in bredth, which made a fair and princely ſhew, ſomewhat reſembling a crowne in forme; about his necke he had a chaine of perfect Gold, the linkes very great and one fold double; on his left hand was a Diamond, an Emerald, a Ruby; and a Turky, four very fair and perfect jewels; on his right hand in one Ring, a big and perfect Turky, and in another Ring many Diamonds of a ſmaller ſize, very artificiall ſet and couched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>As thus he ſate in his Chaire of State, at his right ſide there ſtood a Page with a very coſtly fan (richly embrodered and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet with Saphires) breating and gathering the aire to refreſh the King, the place being very hot, both by reaſon of the Sun, and the aſſembly of ſo great a multitude. After a while our gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58006:95"/>
having delivered their meſſage, and received anſwer, were licenced to depart, and vvere ſafely conducted backe againe, by one of the chiefe of the Kings Councell, who had charge from the King himſelfe to performe the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Our Gentlemen obſerving the Caſtle as well as they could, could not conceive it to be a place of any great force two onely Canons they there ſaw, and thoſe at that preſent untraverſable becauſe unmounted. Theſe with all other furniture of like ſort which they have, they have gotten them from the <hi>Portugals,</hi> by whom the Caſtle it ſelf was alſo builded, whiles they inhabited that place and Iſland. Who ſeeking to ſettle a tyrannous gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as in other places ſo) over this people, and not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves with a better eſtate then they deſerved (except they might (as they thought) make ſure worke by leaving none of the royall blood alive, who ſhould make challenge to the Kingdome) cruelly murthered the King himſelfe (father to him who now raignes) and intended the like to all his ſons. Which cruelty inſtead of eſtabliſhing brought ſuch a ſhaking on their uſurped eſtate, that they were fain, without covenanting to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away Goods, Munition, or any thing elſe to quit the place and the whole Iſland to ſave their lives.</p>
                  <p>For the preſent King with his brethren in revenge of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers murther, ſo beſtirred themſelves, that the <hi>Portugall</hi> was wholly driven from that Iſland, and glad that he yet keeps foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in <hi>Tidore.</hi> Theſe four yeeres this King hath been encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and was (as was affirmed) at that preſent, Lord of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Iſlands thereabout; and was even now preparing his forces to hazard a chance with the <hi>Portugals</hi> for <hi>Tidore</hi> it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The People are <hi>Moores,</hi> whoſe Religion conſiſts much in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſuperſtitious obſervations of new Moones, and certaine ſeaſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For being accuſed of a capitall crime whereof (though free) yet he could not evidently make his Innocency appeare, and knowing the peremptory juſtice of <hi>China,</hi> to be irrevocable, if he ſhould expect the ſentence of the Judges; he before hand made ſuite to his King, that it would pleaſe him to commit his trial to Gods providence and judgement, and to that end to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to travel, on this condition, that if he brought not home ſome worthy Intelligence, ſuch as his Majeſtie had never had before, and were moſt fit to be known, and moſt honourable for <hi>China,</hi> he ſhould for ever live an Exile, or elſe dye for daring to ſet foot againe in his owne Country: for he was aſſured that the God of Heaven had care of Innocency.</p>
                  <p>The King granted his ſuite, and now he had been three yeares abroad, and at this preſent came from <hi>Tidore</hi> (where he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58006:96"/>
two Moneths) to ſee the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Generall, of whom he heard ſuch ſtrange things, and from him (if it pleaſed God to afford it) to learne ſome ſuch Intelligence as might make way for his returne into his Country, and therefore he earneſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated our Generall, to make relation to him of the occaſion, way, and manner of his comming ſo far from <hi>England</hi> thither, with the manifold Occurrences that had happened to him by the way.</p>
                  <p>Our Generall gave ample ſatisfaction to each part of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; the ſtranger harkned with great attention and delight to his diſcourſe, and as he naturally excelled i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then fell he to intreate our Generall with many moſt earneſt and vehement perſwaſions, that he would be content to ſee his Country before his departure any farther Weſtward, that it ſhould be a moſt pleaſant, moſt honourable, and moſt pofitabe thing for him that he ſhould gain hereby the notice, &amp; carry home the deſcription of one of the moſt ancient, migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt and richeſt Kingdoms in the world. Hereupon he took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to relate the number and greatneſſe of the Provinces, with the rare Commodities and good things they yeelded; the number, ſtatelineſſe, and riches of their Cities, with what abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Men, Victuals, Munition, and all manner of neceſſaries &amp; delightful things they were ſtored with: In particular, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ordnance and great Guns (the late invention of a ſcab ſhind <hi>Frier</hi> amongſt us in <hi>Europe</hi>) he related that in <hi>Sunuien</hi> (by ſome called <hi>Quinzai</hi>) which is the chiefeſt City of all <hi>China,</hi> they had braſſe Ordnance of all ſorts (much eaſier to be traverſed then ours were, and ſo perfectly made that they would hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

With many other worthy things which our Generals own experience (if it would pleaſe him to make triall) would (better then his relation) aſſure him of. The brize would ſhortly ſerve very fitly to carry him thither
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58006:96"/>
and he himſelf would accompany him al the way. He accounted himſelfe a happy man, that he had but ſeen and ſpoken with us; the relation of it might perhaps ſerve him to recover favour in his Country; but if he could prevaile with our Generall him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to goe thither, he doubted not but it would be a meanes of his great advancement, and increaſe of honour with his King. Notwithſtanding our Generall could not on any ſuch perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be induced, and ſo the ſtranger parted ſorry, that he could not prevaile in his requeſt, yet exceeding glad of the Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence he had learned.</p>

The calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the winds, which are almoſt continuall before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the brize (which was not yet expected) perſwaded us it was the fitteſt time that we could take.</p>
                  <p>With this reſolution we ſailed along till <hi>November</hi> 14.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nov.</hi> 14.</note> at what time we arrived at a little Iſland (to the Southward of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebes</hi>) ſtanding in 1. deg. 40. min. towards the pole antarticke; which being without Inhabitants, gave us the better hope of quiet abode. We anchored, and finding the place convenient for our purpoſes (there wanting nothing here which we ſtood in need of, but onely water which we were faine to fetch from another Iſland ſomewhat farther to the South) made our abode here for ſix and twenty whole dayes together.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing we did, we pitched our Tents and intrenched our ſelves as ſtrongly as we could upon the ſhoare, leaſt at any time perhaps we might have been diſturbed by the Inhabitants of the greater Iſland which lay not far to the Weſtward of us; after we had provided thus for our ſecurity, we landed our Goods, and had a Smiths Forge ſet up, both for the making of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58006:97"/>
ſome neceſſary Shipworke, and for the repairing of ſome Iron-hooped Caskes, without which they could not long have ſerved our uſe: and for that our Smiths Coals were all ſpent long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time; there was order given and followed for the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Charcoale, by which that want might be ſupplyed.</p>
                  <p>We trimd our Ship, and performed our other buſineſſes to our content. The place affording us not onely all neceſſaries (which we had not of our owne before) thereunto, but alſo wonderfull refreſhing to our wearied bodies, by the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reliefe and excellent proviſion that here we found, whereby of ſickly, weake, and decayed (as many of us ſeemed to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our comming hither we in ſhort ſpace grew all of us to be ſtrong, luſty, and healthfull perſons. Beſides this, we had rare experience of Gods wonderfull wiſedome in many rare and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable creatures which here we ſaw.</p>
                  <p>The whole Iſland is a through grown wood, the trees for the moſt part are of large and high ſtature, very ſtraight and clean without bowes, ſave onely in the very top. The leaves whereof are not much unlike our Brooms in <hi>England:</hi> Among theſe Trees, night by night did ſhew themſelves an infinite ſwarme of Firie-ſeeming wormes flying in the aire, whoſe bodies (no big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then an ordinary Flye) did make a ſhew, and give ſuch light as if every twig on every Tree had been a lighted Candle: or as if that place had beene the Starry Sphear.

                  <p>For whiles it ſemed to be a clear caſe, that our Ship was ſo faſt moared, that ſhe could not ſtirre; it neceſſarily followed, that either we were there to remaine on the place with her; or elſe leaving her to commit our ſelves in a moſt poore and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſtate to ſeeke ſome other place of ſtay and refuge, the better of which two choices, did carry with it the appearance of worſe then one thouſand deaths.</p>
                  <p>As touching our Ship this was the comfort that ſhe could give us, that ſhe her ſelfe lying there confined already upon the hard and pinching Rocks, did tell us plaine, that ſhe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually expected her ſpeedy diſpatch, as ſoone as the Sea and windes ſhould come, to be the ſevere Executioners of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy judgement, by the appointment of the eternall judge alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

would our life have been worſe then death, not alone in reſpect of our wofull captivity, and bodily miſeries, but moſt of all in reſpect of our Chriſtian liberty, being to be deprived of all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique meanes of ſerving the true God, and continually grieved with the horrible impieties and divelliſh Idolatries of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</p>
                  <p>Our miſery being thus manifeſt, the very conſideration wherof muſt needs have ſhaken fleſh and blood, if faith in Gods promiſes had not mightily ſuſtained us, we paſt the night with earneſt longings that the day would once appeare, the meane time we ſpent in often prayers and other godly exerciſes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by comforting our ſelves, and refreſhing our hearts, ſtriving to bring our ſelves to an humble ſubmiſſion under the hand of God, and to a referring our ſelves wholly to his good will and pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>The day therefore at length appearing, and it being almoſt full Sea about that time, after we had given thankes to God for his forbearing of us hitherto, and had with teares called upon him to bleſſe our labours; we againe renewed our travell, to ſee if we could now poſſibly find any anchor-hold, which we had formerly ſought in vaine.

                  <p>It was therefore preſently motioned, and by generall voyce determined to commend our caſe to God alone, leaving our ſelves wholly in his hand; to ſpill or ſave us as ſeeme beſt to his gracious wiſedome. And that our faith might be the better ſtrengthned, and the comfortable apprehenſion of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Chriſt be more clearly felt; we had a Sermon, and the Sacrament of the body and blood of our Saviour celebrated.</p>

So that even thoſe things which we before this time nor any other in our caſe could be without, did now ſeeme as things onely worthy to be deſpiſed; yea, we were herein ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that neither our munition for defence, nor the very meale for ſuſtentation of our lives could find favour with us, but every thing as it firſt came to hand went overboard, aſſuring our ſelves of this, that if it pleaſed God once to deliver us out of that moſt deſperate ſtrait wherein we were, he would fight for us againſt our Enemies, neither would he ſuffer us to periſh for want of bread. But when all was done, it was not any of our endeavours, but Gods onely hand that wrought our delivery; 'twas he alone that brought us even under the very ſtroke of death; t'was he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone that ſaid unto us, Returne againe ye ſons of men; 'twas he alone that ſet us at liberty again, that made us ſafe &amp; free, after that we had remained in the former miſerable condition, the full ſpace of twenty hours, to his glorious name be the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting praiſe.</p>

The Generall cauſed the Vize-admirall to goe with the Pinnaces well manned to ſee what they were; who upon ſight of the ſaid Pinnaces approaching neer unto them, abandoned for the moſt part all their Ships (being <hi>Frenchmen</hi>) laden all with Salt, and bound homewards into <hi>France</hi>; amongſt which Ships (being all of ſmall burthen) there was one ſo well liked, which alſo had no man in her, as being brought unto the Generall, he thought good to make ſtay of her for the ſervice, meaning to pay for her, as alſo accordingly performed at our return; which Bark was called the <hi>Drake.</hi>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:58006:106"/>
The reſt of theſe Ships (being eight or nine) were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed without any thing at all taken from them. Who being afterwards put ſomwhat farther off from the ſhore, by the contrariety of the winde, we hapned to meet with ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The day following, ſtanding in with the ſhore againe, we deſcried another tal Ship of twelve ſcore tuns or ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, upon whom Maſter <hi>Carleill</hi> the Lievtenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall being in the <hi>Tygar,</hi> undertooke the chaſe, whom alſo anon after the Admirall followed; and the <hi>Tygar</hi> having cauſed the ſtrange Ship to ſtrike her ſayles, kept her there without ſuffering any body to goe aboord untill the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall was come up; who forthwith ſending for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and divers others of their principall Men, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to be ſeverally examined, found the Ship and Goods to be belonging to the Inhabitants of Saint <hi>Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> but the Marriners to be for the moſt part belonging to Saint <hi>John de Luce,</hi> and the Paſſage. In this Ship was great ſtore of dry <hi>Newland</hi> Fiſh, commonly called with us <hi>Poore John,</hi> whereof afterwards (being thus found a lawfull Prize) there was diſtribution made into all the Ships of the Fleet, the ſame being ſo new and good as it did very greatly beſtead us in the whole courſe of our Voyage.</p>
                  <p>A day or two after the taking of this Ship, we put in within the Iſles of <hi>Bayon,</hi> for lacke of favourable winde, where we had no ſooner anchored ſome part of the Fleet, but the Generall commanded all the Pinnaces with the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58006:106"/>
Ship-boats to be Manned, and every man to be furniſhed with ſuch armes as was needfull for that preſent ſervice; which being done, the Generall put himſelfe into his Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, which was alſo well furniſhed; and rowing towards the City of <hi>Bayon,</hi> with intent, and the favour of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to ſurprize it. Before we had advanced one halfe league of our way, there came a Meſſenger, being an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Merchant, from the Governour, to ſee what ſtrange Fleet we were; who came to our Generall, and conferred a while with him, and after a ſmall time ſpent, our Generall called for Captaine <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and willed him to goe to the Governour of the City, to reſolve him of two point. The firſt, to know if there were any Wars between <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>England</hi>? The ſecond, why our Merchants with their Goods were imbarred or arreſted? Thus departed Captain <hi>Sampſon</hi> with the ſaid Meſſenger to the City, where he found the Governour and People much amazed of ſuch a ſudden accident.</p>
                  <p>The Generall with the advice and counſell of Maſter <hi>Carleill</hi> his Lievtenant generall, who was in the Galley with him, thought not good to make any ſtand, till ſuch time as they were within the ſhot of the City, where they might be ready upon the return of Captaine <hi>Sampſon,</hi> to make a ſudden attempt if cauſe did require before it was darke.</p>
                  <p>Captaine <hi>Sampſon</hi> returned with his Meſſage in this ſort. Firſt, touching Peace or Wars, the Governour ſaid he knew of no Wars, and that it lay not in him to make any, he being ſo mean a Subject as he was. And as for the ſtay of the Merchants with their Goods, it was the Kings pleaſure, but not with intent to endammage any man: and that the Kings counter-mand was (which had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in that place ſome ſeven nights before) that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>

The Governour ſent us ſome refreſhing, as Bread, Wine, Oyle, Apples, Grapes, Marmalad, and ſuch like. About midnight the vveather begins to overcaſt, inſomuch that it vvas thought meeter to repair aboord, then to make any longer abode on land, and before vve could recover the Fleet, a great tempeſt aroſe, vvhich cauſed many of our Ships to drive from their ancour hold, and ſome were forced to Sea in great perill, as the Barke <hi>Talbot,</hi> the Barke <hi>Hawkins</hi> and the <hi>Speedwell,</hi> vvhich <hi>Speedwell</hi> onely vvas driven into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the others recovered us again; the extremity of the ſtorme laſted three dayes, which no ſooner began to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage, but Maſter <hi>Carleill</hi> our Lieutenant Generall, was ſent with his owne Ship and three others, as alſo with the Galley and with diverſe Pinnaces, to ſee what he might do above <hi>Vigo,</hi> where he tooke many Boates and ſome Carvels, diuerſly laden with things of ſmall value but chiefly with houſehould ſtuffe, running into the high Country, and amongſt the reſt, he found one Boat laden with the principall Church-ſtuffe of the high Church of <hi>Vigo,</hi> where alſo was their great Croſſe of Silver, of very faire emboſſed worke, and double gilt all over, having coſt them a great Maſſe of money. They complained to have loſt in all kind of Goods above thirty thouſand Duckets in this place.</p>

                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:58006:107"/>The next day the Generall with his whole Fleete went up from the Iſles of <hi>Bayon,</hi> to a very good harbour above <hi>Vigo,</hi> where Maſter <hi>Carleill</hi> ſtayed his comming, as well for the more quiet tiding of his Ships, as alſo for the good commodity of freſh watering, which the place there did affoord full well. In the meane time the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Galliſia</hi> had reared ſuch forces as he might, his numbers by eſtimate were ſome two thouſand foot, and three hundred horſe, and marched from <hi>Bayon</hi> to this part of the Countrey, which lay in ſight of our Fleet, where making ſtand, he ſent to parle with our Generall, which was granted by our Generall, ſo it might be in boates upon the water: and for ſafety of their perſons there were pledges delivered on both ſides; which done, the Governour of <hi>Galliſia</hi> put himſelfe with two others into our Vice-Admirals Skiffe, the ſame having been ſent to the ſhoare for him. And in like ſort our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall in his owne Skiffe, where by them it was agreed, we ſhould furniſh our ſelves with freſh water, to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by our owne people quietly on the land, and have all other ſuch neceſſaries, paying for the ſame, as the place would affoord.</p>
                  <p>When all our buſineſſe was ended, we departed, and tooke our way by the Iſlands of <hi>Canaria,</hi> which are eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſome three hundred leagues from this part of <hi>Spain,</hi> and falling purpoſely with <hi>Palma,</hi> with intention to have taken our pleaſure of that place, for the full digeſting of many things in order, and the better furniſhing our ſtore with ſuch ſeverall good things as that affoorded ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry abundantly, we were forced by the vile Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to depart with the receipt of many their Canon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot, ſome into our Ships, and ſome beſides, ſome of them being in very deed full Canon high. But the onely or chiefe miſchiefe, was the dangerous ſea ſurge, which at ſhore all alongeſt, plainly threatned the overthrow of as many Pinnaces and Boates, as for that time ſhould have attempted any landing at all.</p>
                  <p>Now ſeeing the expectation of this attempt fruſtrated by the cauſes aforeſaid, we though it meeter to fall with the Iſle <hi>Ferro,</hi> to ſee if we could find any better fortune; and comming to the Iſland, we landed a thouſand men in a valley under a high Mountaine, where we ſtayed ſome two or three houres, in which time the Inhabitants, accompanied with a young fellow borne in <hi>England,</hi> who dwelt there with them, came unto us, ſhewing their ſtate to be ſo poore, that they were all ready to ſtarve, which was not untrue: and therefore without any thing gotten, we were all commanded preſently to imbarke, ſo as that night we put off to Sea South South-eaſt along towards the coaſt of <hi>Barbarie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vpon Saturday in the morning, being the thirteenth of <hi>November,</hi> we fell with <hi>Cape Blancke</hi> which is a low land and ſhallow water, where we catched ſtore of fiſh, and doubling the Cape, we put into the Bay, where we found certaine <hi>French</hi> Ships of Warre whom we enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with great courteſie, and there left them. The after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone the whole Fleet aſſembled, which was a little ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered about their fiſhing, and put from thence to the Iſles of <hi>Cape Verde,</hi> ſayling till the ſixteenth of the ſame Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in the morning, on which day we deſcried the Iſland of Saint <hi>Jago,</hi> and in the evening we anchored the Fleet between the Towne called the <hi>Plaie</hi> or <hi>Praie</hi> and Saint <hi>Jago,</hi> where we put on ſhore a thouſand men or more, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the leading of Maſter <hi>Chriſtopher Carleill</hi> Lieuetenant Generall, who directed the ſervice moſt like a wiſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander. The place where we had firſt to March did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord no good order, for the ground was Mountaines and full of Dales, being a marvelous ſtony and troubleſome paſſage, but ſuch was his induſtrious diſpoſition, as he would never leave, untill we had gotten up to a faire Plaine, where we made ſtand for the aſſembling of the army. And when we were all gathered together upon the Plaine, ſome two little miles from the Towne, the Lieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Generall thought good not to make attempt till day light; becauſe there was not one that could ſerve for Guide or giving knowledge at all of the place. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after having well reſted, even halfe an houre before day, he commanded the Army to be divided into three ſpeciall parts, ſuch as he appointed, whereas before we had marched by ſeverall Companies, being thereunto forced by the naughtineſſe of the way as is aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>Now by the time we were thus ranged in a very brave order, daylight began to appeare, and being advanced hard to the Wall we ſaw no Enemie to reſiſt, whereupon the Lieuetenant Generall appointed Captaine <hi>Sampſon</hi> with thirty ſhot, and Captaine <hi>Barton</hi> with other thirty, to go downe into the Towne which ſtood in the Valley under us, and might very plainly be viewed all over from that place where the whole Army was now arrived, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after theſe Captaines was ſent, the great Enſigne which had nothing in it but the plaine <hi>Engliſh</hi> Croſſe, to be placed tovvards the Sea, that our Fleet might ſee Saint <hi>Georges</hi> croſſe floriſh in the Enemies fortreſſe. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was given that all the Ordinance throughout the town, and upon all the Platformes, which vvas above fifty Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces all ready charged, ſhould be ſhot off in honour of the

Queenes Majeſties Coronation day, being the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>November,</hi> after the yeerly cuſtome of <hi>England,</hi> which was ſo anſwered againe by the Ordinance out of all the Ships in the Fleet which now was come neere, as it was ſtrange to hear ſuch a thundering noiſe laſt ſo long together. In this meane while the Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall held ſtill the moſt part of his Force on the hill top, till ſuch time as the Towne was quartered out for the lodging of the whole army, which being done every Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain tooke his owne quarter, and in the evening was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſuch ſufficient guard upon every part of the Towne that we had no cauſe to feare any preſent Enemie.</p>
                  <p>Thus we continued in the City the ſpace of fourteene dayes, taking ſuch ſpoyles as the place yeelded, which were for the moſt part, Wine, Oyle, Meale, and ſome ſuch like things for Victual, as Vinegar, Olives, and ſome ſuch other traſh, as Merchandiſe for their <hi>Indian</hi> trades. But there was not found any Treaſure at all, or any thing elſe of worth beſides.</p>
                  <p>The ſcituation of Saint <hi>Jago</hi> is ſomewhat ſtrange, in forme like to a triangle, having on the Eaſt and Weſt ſides two Mountaines of Rocke and Cliffie, as it were hanging over it, upon the top of which two Mountaines was builded certaine fortifications to preſerve the Towne from any harme that might be offered, as in this Plot is plainly ſhewed. From thence on the South ſide of the Towne is the maine Sea, and on the North ſide, the valley lying betweene the foreſaid Mountaines, wherein the Towne ſtandeth: the ſaid Valley and Towne both doe grow very narrow, inſomuch that the ſpace betweene the two cliffes of this end of the Towne is eſtimated not to be above <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then they told him, if his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour did deſire to take a courſe for the common benefit of the People and Countrey, his beſt way were to come and preſent himſelfe unto our Noble and mercifull Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> whereby he might be aſſured to finde favour, both for himſelfe and the Inhabitants.

                  <p>Upon the foure and twentieth of <hi>November,</hi> the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall accompanied with the Lievetenant Generall and ſix hundred men, marched forth to a Village twelve Miles within the Land, called <hi>Sancto Domingo,</hi> where the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and the Biſhop with all the better ſort were lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and by eight of the Clocke we came to it, finding the place abandoned, and the people fled into the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, ſo we made a ſtand a while to eaſe our ſelves, and partly to ſee if any would come to ſpeake to us.</p>
                  <p>After we had well reſted our ſelves, the Generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Troops to match away homewards, in which

retreat the Enemy ſhewed themſelves, both Horſe and Foot, though not ſuch Force as durſt encounter us: and ſo in paſſing ſome time at the gaſe with them, it waxed late and towards night, before we could recover home to Saint <hi>Jago.</hi>

                  <p>On Munday the ſix and twentieth of <hi>November,</hi> the Generall commanded all the Pinnaces with the Boates, to uſe all diligence to imbarke the Army into ſuch Ships as every man belonged. The Lieuetenant Generall in like ſort commanded Captaine <hi>Goring</hi> and Lievetenant <hi>Tuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> with one hundred ſhot to make a ſtand in the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, untill our Forces were wholly imbarked, the Vice-Admirall making ſtay with his Pinnace and certain Boats in the harbour, to bring the ſaid laſt company aboord the Ships. Alſo the General willed forthwith the Gallie with two Pinnaces to take into them the company of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Barton,</hi> and the Company of Captaine <hi>Bigs,</hi> under the leading of Captaine <hi>Sampſon,</hi> to ſeeke out ſuch Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition as was hidden in the ground, at the Towne of <hi>Pray</hi> or <hi>Play,</hi> having been promiſed to be ſhewed it by a priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which was taken the day before.</p>

In ſome that dyed were plainly ſhewed the ſmall ſports, which are often found upon thoſe that be infective with the Plague; we were not above eighteene dayes in paſſage between the ſight of Saint <hi>Jago</hi> aforeſaid, and the Iſland of <hi>Dominica,</hi> being the firſt Iſland of the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> that we fell withal, the ſame being inhabited with Savage Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which goe all naked, their skin coloured with ſome painting of a reddiſh tawney, very perſonable and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſtrong men, who doe admit little converſation with the <hi>Spaniards</hi>: for as ſome of our people might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, they had a <hi>Spaniard</hi> or twaine priſoners with them, neither doe I thinke that there is any ſafety for any of our Nation, or any other to be within the limits of their commandment, albeit they uſed us very kindly for thoſe few houres of time which we ſpent with them, helping our folkes to fill and carry on their bare ſhoulders freſh Water from the River to our Ships Boats, and fetching from their houſes, great ſtore of Tobacco, as alſo a kind
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58006:112"/>
of Bread which they fed on, called <hi>Caſſado,</hi> very vvhite and ſavery, made of the roots of <hi>Caſſania.</hi> In recompence whereof, we beſtowed liberall rewards of Glaſſe, coloured Beads, and other things which we had found at Saint <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> wherewith (as it ſeemed) they reſted very greatly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and ſhewing ſome ſorrowfull countenance when they perceived that we would depart.</p>
                  <p>From hence we went to another Iſland Weſtward of it, called Saint <hi>Christophers</hi> Iſland, wherin we ſpent ſome dayes of <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> to refreſh our ſicke People, and to cleanſe and ayre our Ships. In which Iſland were not any People at all that we could hear of.</p>
                  <p>In which time by the Generall it was adviſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, with the conſent of the Lievtenant generall, the Vice-Admiral, and all the reſt of the Captains to proceed to the great Iſland of <hi>Hispaniola</hi>; as well for that we knew our ſelus then to be in our beſt ſtrength, as alſo the rather allured thereunto, by the glorious fame of the City of Saint <hi>Domingo,</hi> being the ancienteſt and chiefe inhabited place in all the tract of Countrey there abouts. And to proceed in this determination, by the way we met a ſmall Frigot, bound for the ſame place, the which the Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall took, and having duly examined the Men that were in her, there was one found by whom we were advertized, the Haven to be a barred Haven, and the ſhore or Land thereof to be well fortified, having a Caſtle thereupon furniſhed with great ſtore of Artillery; without the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger whereof, was no convenient landing place within ten <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles of the City; to which the ſaid Pilot tooke upon him to conduct us.</p>
                  <p>All things being thus conſidered on, the whole Forces were commanded in the evening to embarke themſelves into Pinnaces, Boats and other ſmall Barks, appointed for
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58006:112"/>
this ſervice. Our Souldiers being thus imbarked, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall put himſelfe into the Barke <hi>Francis</hi> as Admirall, and all this night we lay on the Sea, bearing ſmall ſayle untill our arrivall to the Landing place, which was about the breaking of the day; and ſo we landed, being <hi>New-years</hi> day, nine or ten miles to the Weſtwards of that brave Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Saint <hi>Domingo</hi>: for at that time, not yet is knowne to us, any landing place, where the Sea ſurge doth not threaten to overſet a Pinnace or Boat. Our Generall hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeene us all landed in ſafety, returned to his Fleet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathing us to God, and the good conduct of Mr. <hi>Carli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell,</hi> our Lievtenant Generall: at which time, being about eight of the clocke, we began to March, and abovt noone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, or towards one of the clocke we approached the Towne, where the Gentlemen and thoſe of the better ſort, being ſome hundred and fifty brave Horſes, or rather more, began to preſent themſelves; but our ſmall ſhot played upon them, which were ſo ſuſtained with good proportion of Pikes in all parts, as they finding no part of our Troope unprepared to receive them (for you muſt underſtand they viewed all round about) they were thus driven to give us leave to proceed towards the two Gates of the Towne, which were the next to the Sea-ward. They had manned them both, and planted their Ordnance for that preſent, and ſudden alarum without the Gate, and alſo ſome Troops of ſmall ſhot in Ambuſcado upon the hye-way ſide. We divided our whole Force, being ſome thouſand or twelve hundred Men into two parts, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize both the Gates at one inſtant; the Lievtenant Generall having openly vowed to Captaine <hi>Powell</hi> (who led the Troope that entered the other Gate) that with Gods good favour he would not reſt untill our meeting in the Market-place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:58006:113"/>Their Ordnance had no ſooner diſcharged upon our neere approach, and made ſome execution amongſt us, though not much, but the Lievtenant Generall began forthwith to advance both his voyce of encouragement and pace of Marching; the firſt Man that was ſlaine with the Ordnance, being very neer unto himſelfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon haſted all that he might to keepe them from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of the Ordinance. And notwithſtanding their Ambuſcadoes, we marched or rather ran ſo roundly into them as pell mell we entered the Gates, and gave them more care every Man to ſave himſelfe by flight, then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſtand any longer to their broken fight; we forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with repaired to the Market-place: but to be more truly underſtood, a place of very faire ſpacious ſquare ground before the great Church; whether alſo came (as had been agreed) Captaine <hi>Powell</hi> with the other Troope; which place with ſome part next unto it, we ſtrengthened with Barricadoes, and there (as the moſt convenient place) aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured our ſelves, the City being farre too ſpacious for ſo ſmall and weary a Troope to undertake to guard. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what after midnight they vvho had the guard of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, hearing us buſie about the Gates of the ſaid Caſtle, abandoned the ſame; ſome being taken priſoners, and ſome flying away by the helpe of Boats, to the other ſide of the Haven, and ſo into the Country.</p>
                  <p>The next day we quartered a little more at large, but not into the halfe part of the Town, and ſo making ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall trenches, and planting all the Ordnance that each part was correſpondent to other: we held this Town the ſpace of one Moneth.</p>
                  <p>In the which time happened ſome accidents more then are well remembred for the preſent; but amongſt other things, it chanced that the Generall ſent on his Meſſage to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58006:113"/>
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> a Negro Boy with a Flag of vvhite, ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truce, as is the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ordinary manner to doe there, vvhen they approach to ſpeake to us; vvhich Boy unhappily was firſt met with, by ſome of thoſe who had beene belonging as Officers for the King in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Galley, which with the Towne was lately fallen into our hands, who without all order or reaſon, and contrary to that good uſage wherewith we had entertained their Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, furiouſly ſtrooke the poore Boy through the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with one of their Horſemens ſtaves, with which wound the Boy returned to the Generall, and after he had declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the manner of this wrongfull cruelty, dyed forthwith in his preſence; wherewith the Generall being greatly paſſioned, commanded the Provoſt Martiall to cauſe a couple of Fryers, then priſoners, to be carried to the ſame place where the Boy was ſtroken, accompanied with ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient guard of our Souldiers, &amp; there preſently to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, diſpatching at the ſame inſtant another poore priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with this reaſon wherefore this execution was done; and with this Meſſenger further, that untill the party who had thus murthered the Generals Meſſenger, were delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into our hands, to receive condigne puniſhment, there ſhould no day paſſe, wherein there ſhould not two priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners be hanged, untill they were all conſumed which were in our hands.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon the day following, he that had been Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Kings Galley, brought the Offendor to the Towns end, offring to deliver him into our hands, but it was thought a more honourable revenge, to make them there in our fight, to performe the execution themſelues; which was done accordingly.</p>
                  <p>During our being in this Town, as formerly alſo at S. <hi>Jago</hi> there had paſſed juſtice upon the life of one of our
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58006:114"/>
company for an odious matter: ſo here likewiſe was there an <hi>Iriſh</hi> man hanged, for the murthering of his Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</p>
                  <p>In this time alſo paſſed many Treaties betweene their Commiſſioners and us, for ranſome of their Citie, but upon diſagreements, we ſtill ſpent the early mornings in firing the outmoſt houſes: but they being built very mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently of ſtone, with high lofts, gave us no ſmall travel to ruine them. And albeit for divers dayes together, we ordained each morning by day breake, untill the heat began at nine of the Clocke, that two hundred Marriners did nought elſe but labour to fier and burn the ſaid houſes vvithout our trenches, whileſt the Souldiers in like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion ſtood forth for their Guard: yet did we not or could not in this time conſume ſo much as one third part of the Towne. And ſo in the end, what wearied with firing, and what haſtned by ſome other reſpects, we vvere contented to accept of five and twenty thouſand Duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets of five ſhilling ſix pence the peece, for the ranſome of the reſt of the Towne.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt other things which happened and were found at S. <hi>Domingo,</hi> I may not omit to let the world know one very notable marke and token, of the unſatiable am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King and his Nation, vvhich vvas found in the Kings houſe, vvherein the chief Governour of that City and Countrey is appointed alwayes to lodge, vvhich vvas this: In the comming to the Hall or other roomes of this houſe, you muſt firſt aſcend up by a faire large paire of ſtairs, at the head of which ſtaires is a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſpatious place to walk in, ſomewhat like unto a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, wherein upon one of the Wals, right over againſt you as you enter the ſaid place, ſo as your eye cannot eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the ſight of it, there is deſcribed and painted in a very
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58006:114"/>
large Scutchion, the armes of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and in the lower part of the ſaid Scutchion, there is likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed a Globe, containing in it the whole circuit of the Sea and the Earth, vvhereupon is a Horſe ſtanding on his hinder part within the Globe, and the oher fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part vvithout the Globe, lifting up (as it were) to leape, vvith a ſcrole painted in his mouth, wherein was written theſe words in Latin <hi>Non ſufficit orbis</hi>: which is as much to ſay, as the World ſufficeth not, vvhereof the meaning vvas required to be knowne of ſome of thoſe of the better ſort that came in Commiſſion to treat upon the ranſome of the Town, who would ſhake their heads, and turne aſide their countenance in ſome ſmiling ſort, without anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any thing, as being greatly aſhamed thereof. For by ſome of our company it was told them, that if the Queen of <hi>England</hi> vvould reſolutely proſecute the Wars againſt the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> he ſhould be forced to lay aſide that proud and unreaſonable reaching vaine of his; for he ſhould finde more then enough to do, to keepe that which he had already, as by the preſent example of their loſt Town they might for a beginning perceive well enough.</p>
                  <p>Now to the ſatisfying of ſome men, who marvell great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that ſuch a famous and goodly builded City ſo well inhabited of gallant People, very bravely apparelled (whereof our Souldiers found good ſtore for their relief) ſhould afoord no greater Riches then was found there, vvherein it is to be underſtood that the <hi>Indian</hi> people, which were the naturals of this whole Iſland of <hi>Hiſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niola</hi> (the ſame being neere hand as great as <hi>England</hi>) vvere many yeares ſince cleane conſumed by the Tyranny of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which vvas cauſe, that for lacke of people to worke in the Mines, the Gold and Silver Mines of this Iſland are wholly given over, and thereby they are
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58006:115"/>
faine in this Iſland to uſe Copper money, whereof vvas found very great quantity The chiefe trade of this place conſiſteth of Sugar and Ginger, which groweth in the Iſland, and Hides of Oxen and Kine, which in this waſte Countrey of the Iſland are bred in infinite numbers, the ſoile being very fertile: and the ſaid Beaſts are fed up to a very large growth, and ſo killed for nothing ſo much, as for their Hides aforeſaid. We found here great ſtore of ſtrong Wine, ſweet Oyle, Vinegar, Olives and other ſuch like proviſions, as excellent Wheat-meale packed up in Wine pipes and other caske, and other commodities like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as Wollen and Linnen cloth, and ſome Silkes; all which proviſions are brought out of <hi>Spaine</hi> and ſerved us for great relief. There vvas but a little Plate or Veſſel of Silver, in compariſon of the great Pride in other things of this Towne, becauſe in thoſe hot Countries they uſe much theſe earthen Diſhes finely painted or varniſhed, which they call <hi>Parſellina,</hi> and is had out of the Eaſt-<hi>India</hi>; and for their drinking, they uſe Glaſſes altogether, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they make excellent good and faire in the ſame place. But yet ſome Plate we found, and many other good things, as their houſhold garniture very Gallant and Rich, which had coſt them deere, although unto us they were of ſmall importance.</p>
                  <p>From S. <hi>Domingo</hi> we put over to the maine or firme Land, and going all alongſt the Coaſt, we came at the laſt in ſight of <hi>Cartagena,</hi> ſtanding upon the Sea ſide ſo near as ſome of our Barks in paſſing alongſt, approched vvith the reach of their Culverin ſhot, which they had planted upon certaine Platformes. The harbour mouth lay ſome three miles toward the Weſtward of the Town, vvhereinto vve entred about three or foure of the Clocke in the afternoone without any reſiſtance of ordinance,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58006:115"/>
or other impeachment planted upon the ſame. In the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening we put our ſelves on Land towards the Harbour mouth, under the leading of Maſter <hi>Carleill</hi> our Lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Generall, who after he had digeſted us to march for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward about the midnight, as eaſily a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But as we came within ſome two miles of the Town, their Horſemen which were ſome hundred, met us, and taking the ala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>um, retired to their towneward againe upon the firſt Volley of our Shot that was given them: for the place vvhere we encountered being Woody and buſhy even to the water ſide, was unmeet for their ſervice.</p>
                  <p>At this inſtant we might hear ſome Peeces of Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſcharged, with diverſe ſmall ſhot towards the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, which gave us to underſtand, according to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſet downe in the evening before by our Generall, that the Vice-Admirall accompanied with Captaine <hi>Venner,</hi> Captaine <hi>White,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Croſſe,</hi> with other Sea Captaines, and with diverſe Pinnaces and Boates ſhould give ſome attempt unto the little Fort ſtanding on the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the inner Haven, neer adjoyning to the town, though to ſmall purpoſe, for that the place was ſtrong, and the entry very narrow vvas chained over: ſo as there could be nothing gotten by the attempt, more then the giving of them an Alarum on that other ſide of the Haven being a mile and a halfe from the place where we now vvere. In which attempt the Vice-Admirall had the Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58006:116"/>
of his Skiffe ſtroken through with a Saker-ſhot, and little or no harme received elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>The Troops being now in their March, halfe a mile be hither the towne or leſſe, the ground we were on grew to be ſtraight, and not above fifty paces over, having the maine Sea on the ſide of it, and the Harbour vvater or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Sea (as you may terme it) on the other ſide, which in this Plot is plainly ſhewed. This ſtraight was fortified clean over with a ſtone Wall and a ditch without it; the ſaid Wall being as orderly built with flancking in every part, as can be ſet down. There was onely ſo much of this ſtraight unwalled, as might ſerve for the iſſuing of the Horſemen, or the paſſing of the carriage in time of need: but this anwalled part was not without a very good <hi>Barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cado</hi> of Wine Buts or Pipes, filled vvith earth, full and thicke as they might ſtand on end one by another, ſome part of them ſtanding even within the maine Sea.</p>
                  <p>This place of ſtrength was furniſhed of ſix great Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, demi-Culverins and Sakers, which ſhot directly in front upon us as we approached. Now without this vvall upon the inner ſide of the ſtreight, they had brought like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviſe two great Gallies with their proweſſe to the ſhore, having planted in them eleven peeces of Ordnance, vvhich did beat all croſſe the ſtraight, and flanked our comming on. In theſe two Gallies were planted three or foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſmall ſhot, and on the land in the guard onely of this place, three hundred ſhot and pikes.</p>
                  <p>They in this their full readineſſe to receive us, ſpared not their ſhot both great and ſmall. But our Lievtenant generall, taking the advantage of the darke (the day light as yet not broken out) approached by the loweſt ground, according to the expreſſe direction which himſelf had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly given, the ſame being the Sea-waſh-ſhore, where
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58006:116"/>
the water was ſomwhat fallen, ſo as moſt of all their ſhot was in vaine. Our Lievtenant generall commanded our ſhot to forbear ſhooting untill we were come to the wall ſide; and ſo with Pikes roundly together we approached the place, where we ſoone found out the Barricadoes of Pipes or Buts, to be the meeteſt place for our aſſault; which notwithſtanding it was well furniſhed with Pikes and ſhot, was without ſtaying attempted by us: downe went the buts of earth, and pell mell came our Swords and Pikes together, after our ſhot had firſt given their volley, even at the enemies noſe. Our Pikes were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what longer then theirs, and our bodies better armed, for very few of them were armed; with which advantage our Swords and Pikes grew too hard for them, and they dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to give place. In this furious entry, the Lievtenant generall ſlue with his owne hands, the chiefe Enſigne-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> vvho fought very manfully to his lives end.</p>
                  <p>We followed into the Town vvith them, and giving them no leaſure to breath, vve vvan the Market-place, albeit they made head, and fought a vvhile before vve got it; and ſo vve being once ſeazed and aſſured of that, they vvere contento ſuffer us to lodge vvithin their Towne, and themſelves to goe to their Wives, vvhom they had carried into other places of the Country before our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither.</p>
                  <p>At every Streets-end they had raiſed very fine Barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadoes of Earth-vvorkes, vvith trenches vvithout them, as vvell made as ever vve ſavv any vvorke done; at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring whereof was ſome little reſiſtance, but ſoone over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; it was with few ſlaine or hurt. They had joyned with them many <hi>Indians,</hi> whom they had placed in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of advantage, all Bow-men, with their Arrowes moſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58006:117"/>
villanouſly empoyſoned, ſo as if they did but breake the skin, the party ſo touched dyed without marvell: ſome they ſlew of our People with their Arrowes, ſome they likewiſe miſchieved to death with certaine Prickes of ſmall ſtickes ſharply pointed, of a foot and a halfe long, the one end put into the ground, the other empoyſoned, ſticking faſt up, right againſt our comming in the way, as we ſhould approach from our landing towards the Towne, whereof they had planted a wonderfull number in the ordinary way, but our keeping the Sea-waſh-ſhore miſſed the greateſt part of them very happily.</p>
                  <p>To let paſſe many particular matters, as the hurting of Captain <hi>Sampſon</hi> at ſword blowes in the firſt entring, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom was committed the charge of the Pikes of the Vantgard by his lot and turne; as alſo of the taking of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonzo Bravo</hi> (the chiefe Commander of that place) by Captain <hi>Goring,</hi> after the ſaid Captain had firſt hurt him with his Sword; unto which Captain was committed the charge of the Shot of the ſaid Vantgard.</p>
                  <p>Captain <hi>Winter</hi> was likewiſe by his turne of the Vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard in this attempt, where alſo the Lievtenant generall marched himſelfe: the ſaid Captaine <hi>Winter</hi> through a great deſire to ſerve by Land, having now exchanged his charge by Sea with Captain <hi>Cecill,</hi> for his Band of Foot-Men.</p>
                  <p>Captaine <hi>Powell</hi> the Sergeant Major had by his turne the charge of the foure Companies which made the Battaile.</p>
                  <p>Captaine <hi>Morgan,</hi> who at S. <hi>Domingo</hi> was of the Vantgard, had now by turne his charge upon the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Rere-gard.</p>
                  <p>Every Man as well of one part as of another, came ſo willingly on to the ſervice, as the enemy was not able to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58006:117"/>
endure the fury of ſuch hot aſſault.</p>
                  <p>We ſtayed here ſix weeks, and the ſickneſſe with mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality before ſpoken of, ſtill continuing among us, though not with the ſame fury as at the firſt; and ſuch as were touched with the ſaid Sickneſſe, eſcaping death, very few or almoſt none could recover their ſtrength, yea ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them were much decayed in their memory; in ſo much that it was growne an ordinary judgement, when one was heard to ſpeake fooliſhly, to ſay, he had beene ſicke of the Calentour, which is the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> name of their burning Ague: for, as I told you before, it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry burning and peſtilent Ague. The originall cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is imputed to the evening or firſt night ayre, which they tearme <hi>La ſerena,</hi> wherein they ſay and hold very firme opinion, that who ſo is then abroad in the open ayre, ſhall certainly be infected to the death, not being of the <hi>Indian</hi> or naturall race of thoſe Countrey People; by holding their Watch, were thus ſubjected to the infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>With the inconvenience of continuall mortality, we were forced to give over our intended enterprize, to goe with <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> and ſo over-land to <hi>Pannama,</hi> where we ſhould have ſtroken the ſtroke for the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and full recompence of our tedious travailes.

                  <p>But while we were yet there, it happened one day, that our Watch called the Sentinell, upon the Church-Steeple, had diſcovered in the Sea a couple of ſmal Barks or Boats, making in with the Harbour of <hi>Cartagena,</hi> whereupon Captaine <hi>Moone</hi> and Captaine <hi>Varney,</hi> with <hi>John Grant</hi> the Maſter of the <hi>Tyger,</hi> and ſome other Sea-men,

embarqued themſelves in a couple of ſmall Pinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to take them before they ſhould come nigh the ſhore, at the mouth of the Harbour, leſt by ſome ſtragling <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> from the Land, they might be warned by ſignes from comming in; which fell out accordingly, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the diligence that our Men could uſe: for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Boats, upon the ſight of our Pinnaces comming towards them, ran themſelves a ſhore, and ſo their Men preſently hid themſelves in Buſhes hard by the Sea ſide, amongſt ſome others that had called them by ſignes thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Our Men preſently without any due regard had to the quality of the place, and ſeeing no man of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> to ſhew themſelves, aboorded the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Barkes or Boats, and ſo ſtanding all open in them, were ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhot at by a troope of <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of the Buſhes; by which volley of ſhot there were flaine Captaine <hi>Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> which dyed preſently, and Captaine <hi>Moone,</hi> who dyed ſome few dayes after, beſides ſome foure or five others that were hurt; and ſo our folkes returned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their purpoſe, not having any ſufficient number of Souldiers with them to fight on ſhore. For thoſe Men they carried were all Marriners to rowe, few of them ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, becauſe they made account with their Ordinance to have taken the Barkes well enough at Sea, which they might ful eaſily have done, without any loſſe at all, if they had come in time to the Harbor-mouth, before the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> Boats had gotten ſo near the ſhore.</p>
                  <p>During our abode in this place, as alſo at S. <hi>Domingo,</hi> there paſſed divets curteſies betweene us and the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>; as Feaſting, and uſing them with all kindneſſe and favour: ſo as amongſt others, there came to ſee the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, the Governor of <hi>Cartagena,</hi> with the Biſhop of the ſame, and diverſe other Gentlemen of the better ſort.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:58006:118"/>This Towne of <hi>Cartagena</hi> we touched in the out parts, and conſumed much with fire, as we had done Saint <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo</hi> upon diſcontentments, and for want of agreeing with us in their firſt Treaties touching their Ranſome, which at the laſt was concluded betweene us, ſhould be one hundred and ten thouſand Duckets for that which was yet ſtanding, the Ducket valued at five ſhillings ſix pence ſterling.</p>
                  <p>This Towne, though not halfe ſo big as S. <hi>Domingo,</hi> gives as you ſee, a farre greater ranſome, being in very deed of far more importance, by reaſon of the excellency of the Harbor, and the ſituation therof, to ſerve the Trade of <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> and other places, and is Inhabited with far more richer Merchants. The other is chiefly inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Lawyers and brave Gentlemen, being the chiefe or higheſt appeale of their ſuits in Law of all the Iſlands about it, and of the maine Land coaſt next unto it. And it is of no ſuch account as <hi>Cartagena,</hi> for theſe and ſome other like reaſons which I could give you, over long to be now written.</p>
                  <p>The warning which this Towne received of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming towards them, from S. <hi>Domingo,</hi> by the ſpace of twenty dayes before our arrivall hither, was cauſe that they had both fortified and every way prepared for their beſt defence. As alſo that they had carried and convayed away all their Treaſure and principall ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>The Ranſome of one hundred and ten thouſand Duck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets thus concluded on, as is aforeſaid, the ſame being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and expreſſing for nothing more then the Towne of <hi>Cartagena,</hi> upon the paiment of the ſaid Ranſome, we left the ſaid Towne, and drew ſome part of our Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers into the Priory or Abbey, ſtanding a quarter of one <hi>Engliſh</hi> mile below the Towne upon the Harbour water
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58006:119"/>
ſide, the ſame being walled with a wall of ſtone, which we told the <hi>Spaniards</hi> was yet ours, and not redeemed by their Compoſition: whereupon they finding the defect of their Contract, were contented to enter into another Ranſome for all places, but ſpecially for the ſaid Houſe, as alſo the Blocke-houſe or Caſtle, which is upon the mouth of the inner Harbour. And when we asked as much for the one as for the other, they yeelded to give one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crownes for the Abbey, leaving us to take our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon the Block-houſe, which they ſaid they were not able to ranſome, having ſtretched themſelves to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their powers; and therefore the ſaid Block-houſe was by us undermined, and ſo wirh Gun-powder blowne up in peeces.</p>
                  <p>While this latter Contract was in making, our whole Fleet of Ships fell downe towards the Harbour mouth, where they Anchored the third time, and employed their Men in fetching of freſh Water aboord the Ships, for our Voyage homewards, which Water was had in a great Well, that is in the Iſland by the Harbour mouth; which Iſland is a very pleaſant place as hath been ſeen, having in it many ſorts of goodly and very pleaſant Fruits, as the Orange trees and others, being ſet orderly in Walkes of great length together. Inſomuch as the whole Iſland be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome two or three miles about, is caſt into grounds of Gardening and Orchards.</p>
                  <p>After ſix weekes abode in this place, we put to Sea the laſt of <hi>March,</hi> where after two or three dayes, a great Ship which we had taken at S: <hi>Domingo,</hi> and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was called <hi>The new years gift,</hi> fell into a great leake, being laden with Ordnance, Hides, and other Spoyles, in the night ſhe loſt the company of our Fleet; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d the next morning by the Generall, he caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58006:119"/>
with the whole Fleet, fearing ſome great miſchance to be happened unto her, as in very deed it ſo fell out; for her leake was ſo great, and her Men were all tyred with Pumping. But at the laſt having found her, and the Barke <hi>Talbot</hi> in her company, which ſtayed by great hap with her, was ready to take their Men out of her, for the ſaving of them. And ſo the Generall being fully adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of their great extremity, made ſaile directly backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to <hi>Cartagena</hi> with the whole Fleet, where having ſtayed eight or ten dayes more, about the unlading of this Ship, and the beſtowing thereof and her Men, into other Ships; we departed once againe to Sea, directing our courſe towards the Cape S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> being the Eaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt part of <hi>Cuba,</hi> whether we arrived the ſeven &amp; twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of <hi>Apil.</hi> But becauſe freſh water could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be found, we weyed ankor and departed, thinking in few dayes to recover the <hi>Mattances,</hi> a place to the Eaſt-ward of <hi>Havana.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After we had ſailed ſome fourteene dayes, we were brought to Cape S. <hi>Anthony</hi> againe, thorough lacke of favourable winde: but then our ſcarſity was grown ſuch, as need made us looke a little better for water, which we found in ſufficient quantity, being indeede, as I judge, none other then raine water newly fallen, and gathered up by making pits in a plot of marriſh ground, ſome three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred paſes from the Sea ſide.</p>
                  <p>I doe wrong if I ſhould forget the good example of the Generall at this place, who to encourage others, and to haſten the getting of freſh water aboord the Ships, tooke no leſſe paine himſelfe then the meaneſt, as alſo at S. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo, Cartagena,</hi> and all other places, having alwayes ſo vigilant a care and foreſight in the good ordering of his Fleet, accompanying them, as it is ſaid, with ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58006:120"/>
travell of body, as doubtleſſe had he beene the meaneſt perſon, as he was the chiefeſt, he had yet deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the firſt place of honour: and no leſſe happy doe we accompt him, for being aſſociated with Maſter <hi>Carleill</hi> his Lievtenant Generall, by whoſe experience, prudent counſell, and gallant performance, he atchieved ſo many and happy enterpriſes of the War, by whom alſo he was very greatly aſſiſted, in ſetting downe the needfull Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Lawes, and courſe of Juſtice and for the due admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the ſame upon all occaſions.</p>
                  <p>After three dayes ſpent in watering our Ships, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted now the ſecond time from this Cape of S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> the thirteenth of <hi>May,</hi> and proceeding about the Cape of <hi>Florida,</hi> we never touched any where, but coaſting alongſt <hi>Florida,</hi> and keeping the ſhore ſtill in ſight, the eight and twentieth of <hi>May</hi> early in the morning, we deſcried on the ſhore a place built like a Beacon, which was indeed a Scaffold upon foure long Maſtes, raiſed on end for men ro diſcover to the Seaward, being in the latitude of thirty degrees, or very neare thereunto. Our Pinnaces manned, and comming to the ſhore, we marehed up alongſt the River ſide, to ſee what place the Enemie held there: for none amongſt us had any knowledge thereof at all.</p>
                  <p>Here the Generall tooke occaſion to march with the companies himſelfe in Perſon, the Lieutenant Generall having the Vantguard, and going a mile up or ſomewhat more by the River ſide, we might diſcerne on the other ſide of the River over againſt us, a fort, which newly had been built by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and ſome mile or three about above the fort, was a little Town or village without wals, built of woodden houſes, as this Plot here doth plainly ſhew: we forthwith prepared to have Ordnance for the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58006:120"/>
battery, and one Peece was a little before the evening planted, and the firſt ſhot being made by the Lievtenant Generall himſelfe at their Enſigne, ſtrake through the Enſigne, as we afterwards underſtood by a <hi>Fenchman,</hi> which came unto us from them. One ſhot more was then made, which ſtrake the foot of the fort Wall, which was all maſſive timber of great trees like Maſtes. The Lievtenant Generall was determined to paſſe the River this night with foure Companies, and there to lodge himſelfe intrenched as neare the Fort, as that he might play with his Muskets and ſmalleſt ſhot upon any that ſhould appeare; and ſo afterward to bring and plant the battery with him, but the helpe of the Marriners for that ſudden to make Trenches could not be had, which was the cauſe that this determination was remitted untill the next night.</p>
                  <p>In the night the Lievtenant General tooke a little row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Skiffe, and halfe a dozen well armed, as Captaine <hi>Morgan,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Sampſon,</hi> with ſome others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the rowers, and went to view what gard the Enemy kept, as alſo to take knowledge of the ground. And albeit he went as covertly as might be, yet the Enemy taking the <hi>Alarum,</hi> grew fearfull that the whole Force was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to the aſſault, and therefore with all ſpeed abandoned the place after the ſhooting of ſome of their Peeces. They thus gone, and he being returned unto us againe, but nothing knowing of their flight from their Fort, forthwith came a <hi>Frenchman</hi> being a Phipher (who had been priſoner with them) in a little Boat, playing on his Phiph the tune of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his ſong, and being called unto by the Guard, he told them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he put foot out of the Boat, what he was himſelfe, and how the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were gone from the Fort,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58006:121"/>
offering either to remaine in hands there, or elſe to return to the place with them that would goe.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Intelligence, the Generall, the Lievtenant Generall, with ſome of the Captaines in one Shiffe, and the Vice-Admiral with ſome others in his Skiffe, and two or three Pinnaces furniſhed of Souldiers with them, put preſently over towards the Fort, giving order for the reſt of the Pinnaces to follow. And in our approach, ſome of the Enemy bolder then the reſt, having ſtayed behinde their company, ſhot off two peeces of Ordnance at us; but on ſhore we went, and entred the place without finding any man there.</p>
                  <p>When the day appeared, we found it built all of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the Wals being none other but whole Maſts or bodies of Trees ſet upright and cloſe together, in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a Pale, without any Ditch as yet made, but who intended with ſome more time, for they had not as yet finiſhed all their work, having begun the ſame ſome three or foure Moneths before: ſo as to ſay the truth, they had no reaſon to keepe it, being ſubject both to fire and eaſie aſſault.</p>
                  <p>The platforme whereon the Ordnance lay, was whole bodies of long Pine trees, whereof there is great plenty, layed a croſſe one on another, and ſome little earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt. There was in it thirteen or fourteen great peeces of braſſe Ordnance, and a Cheſt unbroken up, having in it the value of ſome two thouſand pounds ſterling, by eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Kings treaſure, to pay the Souldiers of that place, who were one hundred and fifty Men.</p>
                  <p>The Fort thus won, which they called S. <hi>John</hi> Fort, and the day opened, we aſſayed to goe to the Towne, but could not by reaſon of ſome Rivers and broken ground which was betweene the two places; and therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58006:121"/>
to imbarke againe into our Pinnaces, we went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the great maine River, which is called, as alſo the Towne by the name of S. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At our approaching to land, there was ſome that began to ſhew themſelves, &amp; to beſtow ſome few ſhot upon us, but preſently withdrew themſelves. And in their runing thus away, the Serjeant Major finding one of their Horſes ready ſadled &amp; bridled, took the ſame to follow the chaſe, and ſo overgoing all his Company, was (by one layed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde a Buſh) ſhot through the head, and falling downe therewith, was by the ſame and two or three more, ſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in three or foure places of his body with Swords and Daggers, before any could come neere to his reskue. His death was much lamented, being in very deed an honeſt wiſe Gentleman, and a Souldier of good experience, and of as great courage as any man might be.</p>
                  <p>In this place called S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> we underſtood the King did keepe, as is before ſaid, one hundred and fifty Souldiers, and at another place ſome dozen leagus beyond to the Northwards, called S. <hi>Helena,</hi> he did there likewiſe keepe one hundred and fifty more, ſerving there for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpoſe, then to keepe all other Nations from Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting any part of all that Coaſt, the Government wherof vvas committed to one <hi>Pedro Melendez Marqueſſe,</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew to that <hi>Melendez</hi> the Admitall, vvho had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown Maſter <hi>John Hawkins</hi> in the Bay of <hi>Mexico</hi> ſome fifteen or ſixteen years agoe. This Governor had charge of both places, but vvas at this time in this place, and one of the firſt that left the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Here it vvas reſolved in full aſſembly of Captaines, to undertake the enterprize of S. <hi>Helena,</hi> and from thence to ſeek out the Inhabitation of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Country-Men
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58006:122"/>
in <hi>Virginia,</hi> diſtant from thence ſome ſix degrees North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>When we came thwart of Saint <hi>Helena</hi> the ſhols ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing dangerous, and we having no Pilot to undertake the entrie, it was thought meereſt to goe hence alongſt. For the Admiral had been the ſame night in four fadome and a halfe three leagues from the ſhore: and yet we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the help of a known Pilot, there may and doth goe in Ships of greater burthen and draught then any we had in our Fleet.</p>
                  <p>We paſſed thus alongſt the Coaſt hard aboord the ſhore, which is ſhallow for a league or two from the ſhore, and the ſame is low and broken land for the moſt part.</p>
                  <p>The ninth of <hi>June</hi> upon fight of one ſpeciall great fire (which are very ordinary all alongſt this coaſt, even from the Cape of <hi>Florida</hi> hither) the Generall ſent his Skiffe to the ſhore, where they found ſome of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Country men (that had been ſent thither the year before by Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi>) and brought one aboord, by whoſe direction we proceeded along to the place which they make their Port. But ſome of our Shipps being of great draught unable to enter, we anchored all without the Harbour in a wilde Road at Sea, about two miles from ſhore.</p>
                  <p>From whence the Generall wrote Letters to Maſter <hi>Ralph Lane,</hi> being Governour of thoſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and then at his Fort about ſix leagues from the Road in an Iſland which they call <hi>Roanoac,</hi> wherein is ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſhewed how ready he was to ſupply his neceſſities and wants which he underſtood of, by thoſe he had firſt talked withall.</p>
                  <p>The morrow after Maſter <hi>Lane</hi> himſelfe and ſome of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58006:122"/>
his company comming unto him, with the conſent of his Captaines he gave them the choice of two offers, that is to ſay: either he would leave a Ship, a Pinnace, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Boa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es with ſufficient Maſters and Marriners, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther furniſhed with a Moneths Victuall to ſtay and make farther diſcovery of the Country and coaſts, and ſo much Victual likewiſe that might be ſufficient for the bringing of them all (being an hundred and three Perſons) into <hi>England</hi> if they thought good after ſuch time, with any other thing they would deſire, and that he might be able to ſpare.</p>
                  <p>Or elſe if they thought they had made ſufficient diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very already, and did deſire to returne into <hi>England,</hi> he would give them paſſage. But they as it ſeemed, being deſirous to ſtay, accepted very thankfully, and with great gladneſſe that which was offred firſt. Whereupon the Ship being appointed and received into charge, by ſome of their owne Company ſent into her by Maſter <hi>Lane,</hi> before they had received from the reſt of the Fleet, the Proviſion appointed them, there aroſe a great ſtorme (which they ſaid was extraordinary and very ſtrange) that laſted three dayes together, and put all our Fleet in great danger to be driven from their ankoring upon the coaſt. For we brake many Cables, and loſt many Ankors. And ſome of our Fleet which had loſt all of which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was the ſhip appointed for Maſter <hi>Lane</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany) was driven to put to Sea in great danger, in avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Coaſt, and could never ſee us againe untill we met in <hi>England.</hi> Many alſo of our ſmall Pinnaces and Boats were loſt in this ſtorme.</p>
                  <p>Notwitſtanding after all this, the Generall offered them (with conſent of his Captaines) another Ship with ſome Proviſion, although not ſuch a one for their turnes,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58006:123"/>
as might have been ſpared them before, this being unable to be brought into their Harbour. Or elſe if they would, to give them paſſage into <hi>England,</hi> although he knew he ſhould performe it with greater difficulty then he might have done before.</p>
                  <p>But Maſter <hi>Lane</hi> with thoſe of the chiefeſt of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany he had then with him, conſidering what ſhould be beſt for them to doe, made requeſt unto the Generall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their hands, that they might have paſſage for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>: the which being granted, and the reſt ſent for out of the Country and ſhipped, we departed from that coaſt the eighteenth of <hi>June.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo God be thanked, both they and we in good ſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty arrived at <hi>Portſmouth</hi> in <hi>July</hi> 28. 1586. to the great glory of God, and to no ſmall honour to our Prince, our Countrey and our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>The totall value of that which was gotten in this Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, is eſtimated at threeſcore thouſand pounds, whereof the Companies which have travelled in the Voyage were to have twenty thouſand pounds, the Adventurers the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forthy. Of which twenty thouſand pounds (as I can judge) will redound ſome ſix pounds to the ſingle ſhare.</p>
                  <p>We loſt ſome ſeven hundred and fifty Men in the Voyage.</p>
                  <p>The Men of name that dyed and were ſlaine in this Voyage, as I can preſently call to my remembrance, are theſe:

                  <p>In the thirty ſeventh year of the reign of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> being the eight and twentieth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five hundred ninty five, we imbarked at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> thence we ſail'd toward the <hi>Grand Canadoes,</hi> in which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, <hi>Sep.</hi> 6. about noon, we deſcri'd a <hi>French</hi> man of War (in the height of the Northern <hi>Cape</hi>) whom we chaſing immediately overtooke, after him a (<hi>Rochellor</hi>) having been at <hi>New-found-land,</hi> whom we quietly let paſſe: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that we overtooke two <hi>Biſkners</hi> bound for <hi>Barbara,</hi> who accompanied us untill they could take their courſe thither.</p>
                  <p>The ninth of <hi>September</hi> we eſpyed a Ship of <hi>Weymouth,</hi> vvhom vve chaſed and fetched up, vvho ſpeaking with our Generall accompanied us to the <hi>Grand Canadoes.</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after we diſcovered twenty of the King of <hi>France's</hi> men of Warre, vvho chaſed us but could not fetch us up, and therefore left us.</p>
                  <p>The nineteenth of <hi>September</hi> we met with a Frigate of the Earle of <hi>Cumberlands</hi> who brought us word that the Kings men of Warre were going homewards.</p>
                  <p>The twenty five of <hi>September</hi> we deſcried two Iſlands, the one called <hi>Hamſeroth,</hi> Weſt and by South; The other <hi>Forta fontura,</hi> both ſtanding in 28 degrees, and are diſtant

one from the other 4 or 5 leagues Inhabited only by a ſavage people. Theſe Iſlands from the <hi>Grand Canadoes</hi> are diſtant ten leagues.</p>
                  <p>The twenty ſixt of <hi>September</hi> we anchored in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid port of <hi>Canadoes</hi> otherwiſe called S. <hi>John Decrus,</hi> and about ten of the clock in the forenoone we were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked into Boats and Pinnaces, endeavoring with the greateſt celerity to attain to land, but were fruſtrated of our intentions by the Enemies vigilancy, who waiting our comming had intrenched themſelves in the very place where we ſhould have put to ſhore, who upon our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach plyed us ſo faſt with great and ſmall ſhot, both from the Caſtle and towne, and from the other ſide of us, that we were conſtrained to retire with the loſſe of ſome few men unto our Ships againe.</p>
                  <p>The Enemy were in number betweene three or foure hundred ſtrong.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day being all imbarked in our Ships againe, we departed to a certaine place where we watered, it ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Weſt and by North from the towne, and was in times paſt a great and famous River. But now it is overgrown with graſſe, it commeth from the Rocks, and runneth to the Sea.</p>
                  <p>The people of this Iſland being a barbarous people and Mountaneers; vve had ſlaine at this watering place by them, of our men which ſtragled into the Countrey, amongſt whom vvas Captaine <hi>Grinston</hi> and foure more with him, the which were wounded very ſore and torne with dogges, which they keepe of purpoſe to deſtroy our men when any of them come there to water. This Iland yeeldeth much Wine, as <hi>Canadoe</hi> Wine, and divers kind of graine, as Wheat and ſuch like, great ſtore of Conies, and Partredges, and Treſſe, which have a joyce like Milk but rank poyſon.</p>

                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:58006:127"/>This Iland hath many mighty Rocks in it; there is about twenty leagues diſtant from this Iſland another Iſland called the <hi>Tenereffe</hi> or Peak of <hi>Tenereffe.</hi> It is a mighty high land.</p>
                  <p>Sunday the twenty eight of <hi>September</hi> a little before night we departed from the aforeſaid watering place to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Orientall <hi>Indies,</hi> we tooke our courſe South Weſt and by Weſt. <hi>Septemb.</hi> 29 being <hi>Michaelmas</hi> day, we ſayled South weſt and by South, the thirtieth we ſayled South vveſt, the firſt of <hi>October</hi> we ſayled Weſt and by South, the thirteenth we ſayled Weſt in the height of ſixteenth degr. the fourteenth the wind was ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thernly: the five and twentieth of this Moneth, the <hi>Hope</hi> and the <hi>Adventure</hi> fell foule on one another about ten of the clocke in the night, ſo that they of the <hi>Adventure</hi> were conſtrained to cut downe their Niſſon Maſte, and to fling it overboord. The night being very darke and there ariſing a great tempeſt of Haile and Raine, at the ſame time they were in extream Jeopardy of their lives, which cauſed in them a very great terror. The twenty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth of <hi>October</hi> we eſpyed the Iſland of <hi>Martinino,</hi> which lay from us towards the Weſt. This Iſland is inhabited by a Barbarous people called <hi>Canibals.</hi> We vvere thirty dayes ſayling between the <hi>Canadoes</hi> and <hi>Martinino.</hi> From this Iſland we ſayled towards an Iſland called <hi>Dominica</hi> where is great ſtore of Tobacco. It is diſtant from <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinino</hi> about ten or twelve of our Engliſh miles, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Weſt and by North. The people of this Iſland be not altogether ſo rude as other peopl are; for they would traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick with us for hatched Knives &amp; ſuch like Commodities in exchange for their Tobacco which is the chiefeſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity this Iſland yeeldeth. The Weapons uſed by theſe people are Bowes and Arrowes made of a Reed, with a

ſharp peece of Braſeilon the end thereof; they to uſe wear their haire very long, cut round by their ſhoulders. The thirtieth of this inſtant <hi>October,</hi> we came to another Iſland called <hi>Gordelowpa</hi> which is diſtant from that of <hi>Dominica</hi> ten leagues; we went unto a certaine River of that Iſland; on the Weſt ſide there be many Rivers iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Mountaines with great force into the Sea. This Iſland is not inhabited, but is a very Wilderneſſe wherein are many wilde Beaſts; amongſt the reſt there is one worthy of your obſervation in ſhape of a Serpent. We continued there from the thirtieth of <hi>October</hi> to the fourth of <hi>November.</hi> From thence we ſayled towards the River <hi>della hatch,</hi> and ſtruke our courſe North Weſt and by North. The ſeventh of <hi>November</hi> vve deſcried three Iſlands of the <hi>Trigonies</hi> vvhich lyeth between <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delowpa</hi> and Saint <hi>John de Portrizo</hi>; the firſt is called <hi>Mononalla,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Rotmido,</hi> the third <hi>Savoa</hi>; we ſayled within three or four leagues of them, vvhere vve found it in depth ſometimes five otherwhiles eight fathome; the ſhoal beareth from us North eaſt. The eight of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> our Generall ſet on ſhoar all the Land-men, to the end that every Captaine might know his owne men. The tenth of <hi>November</hi> vve departed from that Harbour to another, three or four <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles diſtant, vvhere vve continued untill tueſday the eleventh of <hi>November,</hi> and then ſet ſayle for Saint <hi>John de Portrizo</hi> Weſt and by North.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Iſlands belonging to <hi>Virginia</hi> be many in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, vve cannot name them becauſe they be without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; there are many faire Harbours in them, in ſome whereof one thouſand Ships may ride at anchor; on every ſide the Mountaines are very high.

Wedneſday, we anchored within three or foure <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> miles of the Towne of <hi>Portricho,</hi> againſt a great Fort, where was placed a great peece of Ordnance, which plyed us with ſhot divers times. The ſame day Sir <hi>John Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> dyed at the place aforeſaid; whoſe death, in regard that he was one of our chiefe Commanders, a wiſe, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet and carefull Man for his Company, was no little grief<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſame day alſo was Sir <hi>Nicholas Clifford,</hi> Captaine <hi>Stratford,</hi> Maſter <hi>Brutt Browne</hi> were wounded with the ſame peece of Ordnance from the ſaid Fort, all at one time, ſitting at Supper with our Generall Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Baſkerfield</hi>; the ſtoole that Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> ſat on was ſtruke from under him, as he was drinking of a cup of Beere, yet by Gods providence he eſcaped with all the reſt, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly them three before mentioned; the ſame night Sir <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Clifford</hi> dyed of the ſame wound; and the ſame night we went againſt the Towne, where we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored.</p>
                  <p>The next day, which was thurſday, the 13. of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> our Generall called a Councell. The night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, about nine of the clocke in the night, certaine ſhott being appointed to be imbarked in our Pinnaces and Boats, with Gunners and Fire-workes; there were to the number of five hundred Men which went within the Harbour to burne the five Men of Warre which rode within the Harbour, one of them was of the burthen of foure hundred tunne, the reſt not ſo big; in this Ship was planted great ſtore of great Ordnance, which play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon our Men exceedingly, beſides great ſtore of ſmall ſhott, likewiſe great ſtore of great ſhott from the ſhore, with others, as Hargabuſhes of crocke, and Muskets, and ſuch like, which played at us on both ſides moſt vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58006:128"/>
in the time of this Incounter. They had planted on this plot of great Ordnance one hundred and three ſcore (beſides ſmall ſhott) as were to be numbred. This aſſault, although it brought unto us no great profit, in reſpect of the loſſe of one of our Ships, called the <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Francis,</hi> which was taken by them before our approach which gave them intelligence of our comming; alſo the loſſe of ſome of our Men at that time; the which was a moſt valiant attempt and worthy to be Chronicled. There was of the Enemy burned, and ſlaine, and drowned all the men in the great Ship, but ſome three or foure that we tooke up out of the water, to the intent that they ſhould reveale ſomewhat unto us; they informed us, that they having intelligence of our comming by our Ship that was taken by them, our end and intent was fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.</p>
                  <p>This Towne was of great force to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and had in it three millions of Treaſure of the King of <hi>Spaines,</hi> which thoſe five men of War came of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for it; and they told us alſo, that they kept our men at <hi>Portricho,</hi> the which they tooke in the Ship cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Little Francis</hi>; whereupon our Generall wrote unto the chiefe Governour of the Towne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

which joyneth to the Towne (ſo farre as we could diſcerne) it ſeemeth to be of a vaſt longitude and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>

                  <p>The ſixteenth being Sunday we departed from Saint <hi>John de Portricho</hi> at which place we Muſtered all our Men, and every Captaine knew his Men in more ample manner then they did before.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day we imbarked our ſelves in our Ships againe, and with all ſpeed we ſailed to a place called Saint <hi>John Jermans</hi> Bay, there we landed, it is diſtant from <hi>Portricho</hi> thirty ſix leagues, there we landed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our Companies to guard our Carpenters that did build our Pinnaces; not far from this place is a Houſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an <hi>Ingeneroide,</hi> where is great ſtore of Sugar made; it is inhabited with <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The ſame day Maſter <hi>Brut Browne</hi> dyed.</p>

                  <p>The fifteenth of <hi>December</hi> being Friday, the Enemy made faire promiſes to our Generall, which was onely to have us to ſtay as we ſuppoſed, till they had ſent word to other places, as afterwards the Governour confeſſed.</p>
                  <p>The ſixteenth of <hi>December</hi> the Governour came to parley and to tell us his determined purpoſe of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, which was as aforeſaid; our companies marched divers times for Victuals and ſo met with the Governour. We tooke ſome more of their men priſoners, and found ſome of their Goods afterward which we carried away. But when we ſaw that they would not come to any faire cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence or agreement, our Generall commanded us to burne all places where ever we came.</p>
                  <p>The day before our departure we left the towne of a light Fire, unleſſe it was a new Religious houſe not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and another houſe that they uſe to bring all the Kings treaſure and Merchandiſe.</p>
                  <p>In this Houſe we found ſome of their treaſure and Merchandiſe with other things which was brought in, as
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58006:130"/>
Pearle and ſuch like, which was brought unto the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall. The Country yeeldeth great ſtore of Cattle, as Oxen, Beeves, Goats, Sheepe, Horſes, and Aſſes, as alſo great ſtore of graſſe. The people that Inhabit this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try are <hi>Idians</hi> and <hi>Negroes,</hi> they live in the Mountaines being wilde and ſavage People, but onely ſuch as the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> keepe under ſubjection; thoſe wilde People doe Warre againſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; in this Country are great ſtore of Fowls, as Pellicans, and other red Fowls, being Sea Fowls in the proportion of a Crane.</p>
                  <p>There is diſtant from the towne ſome ten leagues a mighty great Mountaine bearing towards the Weſt from the towne of River <hi>Della Hatch.</hi> This Hill ſeemeth to be far higher then the <hi>Glorodel.</hi> Upon it ſnow remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth continually through the coldneſſe of its ſituation.</p>
                  <p>The nineteenth of <hi>December</hi> being Saturday, we came to another towne called <hi>Sancta Martha,</hi> the which we entred and there we found the Enemy with their Wives and Children fled out of the towne into the Mountains, but our men following them into the Woods found ſome Treaſure with other things of ſome value. The ſame day we tooke one of the chiefe Cavaliers of the towne, he was the Governors Deputy of the towne, the which we brought away with us; we departed from <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Martha,</hi> the twentieth of <hi>December</hi> being Sunday, at our departure from the towne (leaving it on fire,) we were informed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that we were within three leagues of a Golden Mine.</p>
                  <p>The twenty five of <hi>December</hi> being thurſday, we ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led towards another towne called <hi>Nombre de dios.</hi> The ſame day being <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> day we came within the ſight of the Iſland called <hi>Pinos,</hi> diſtant from us twelve leagues. The twenty ſeventh of <hi>December</hi> we anchored before the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58006:131"/>
face of the town of <hi>Nombre de dios</hi>; the ſame day Captain <hi>Arnold Baskerfield</hi> being Serjeant Major dyed; we being imbarked we landed all our men an <hi>Engliſh</hi> mile from the towne, and ſo marched toward the towne, where the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy gave us a brovadoe of ſhor, and ſo they ran away into the Woods, all their Goods and Treaſure was gone before, they left none but what was the Soldiers and that lay in a great Fort. They had but three great Peeces of Ordnance, and one of them broke with the Shot, ſome of the Soldiers we tooke priſoners.</p>
                  <p>The King uſuall ſendeth all his Treaſure and Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize to this place, and to that end hath Boats and Pinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which continually bring his Treaſure from <hi>Panama</hi> to this place. We found ſome treaſure in the Woods as Oyle, Wine, Vinegar, Meale, and Linnen-Cloth. Our Generall having intelligence of the Governors going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Panama.</hi> The munday after Sir <hi>Thomas Baſkerfield</hi> our Coriner General with ſix hundred men went by land, with intent to have ſurprized him. The way was extream dangerous to travell in, not onely in regard of the Enemy but alſo of the water and Rocks, inſomuch that oft times we went in perill of our lives. In our march we ſaw great ſtore of Munkyes, Apes, and could heare Lyons. This towne of <hi>Panama</hi> ſtandeth upon the South Sea, and is diſtant from <hi>Nombre de dios</hi> eighteen leagues; we mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched nine leagues but could get no farther, the Enemy preventing us by a Fort vvhich they made on the top of a Rocke, which we of neceſſity muſt march through. It was ſo narrow that but one man could goe before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which they taking the advantage of, ſlew our men as faſt as they aſcended up; there being no other way <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
