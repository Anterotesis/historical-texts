            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Having received your apologetical diſcourſe (in a Letter ſent to a friend of mine) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe you and I formerly had, in the which Letter you diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered your ſelf to be a great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt unto the truth &amp; the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry thereof: Moreover it doth appear by your Letter, that it is
<pb facs="tcp:170253:3"/>your Pulpit diſcourſe frequently to calumniate the people of God; upon the conſideration whereof, I thought my ſelf bound in duty to ſpend ſome time in ſhewing the difference betwixt true and falſe Miniſters by ſeveral characters, to the end you may ſee your ſelves to be ſuch (as you accuſe the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt to be) <hi>viz.</hi> the falſe corrupt Miniſters, and ſo conſequently the Miniſters of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, to the end you may ceaſe to pervert the right way of the Lord, and repent of your abuſing Gods People and Ordinances; for aſſuredly, Sirs, your turning of things upſide down, will cauſe the Lord to turn you out of his preſence, unleſſe <hi>you repent, for God in all ages hath been very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his order,</hi> hence it came to paſſe, that the Lord threatned the Prieſts of old <hi>to ſhew them his back and not his face in the day
<pb facs="tcp:170253:3"/>of their calamity;</hi> the reaſon was, becauſe they had cauſed the People to ſtumble from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient path, to walk in a way not caſt up, and doubtleſſe it you look into the antient path of Chriſt, which he and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Diſciples walked in, you will find that you are got far out of that path, for they did not teach for hire, to make themſelves the Rabbies of the times, but were willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean themſelves, and be the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of all men for Chriſts ſake: neither did they caſt up ſuch a Path as Infants baptiſme, to make whole Nations to be a Church, but did command per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to come out from the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and thereby compacted Chriſts Churches together of ſanctified Stones, that is to ſay men ſeparated from the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal multitude by repentance,
<pb facs="tcp:170253:4"/>faith and baptiſm, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the ſpiritual houſe: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over Sir, whereas you abuſe the People of God, by caſting reproachfull ignominious ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders on them, know, the Lord takes it as done unto himſelf, they being as dear to him as the apple of his eye, and if <hi>Samſon</hi> would be revenged of the Philiſtins for his eyes, ſurely the Lord will be revenged of ſuch as labour (as much as in them lieth) to pluck out his eyes; Sirs are you not like unto thoſe Phariſaical Prieſts, that Chriſt reproves, which did build the toombs of the prophets, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Sepulcher of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, pretending great love to them, and yet notwithſtanding perſecute the friends of Chriſt, which walk in that way which Chriſt hath left them to walk in, by your ſect and example, I
<pb facs="tcp:170253:4"/>ſay, if the blood of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhould be required of ſuch a generation, repent you and break off your ſins by righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, before the wrath of the Lord break out, and there be no remedy: But to paſſe that, and come to the matter in hand, I have peruſed your Letter, and given you a full anſwer to it in the following treatiſe; one thing I ſtrange at, that you ſhould ſo much forget your ſelf, as to charge me, that I fell upon you with abuſive words for a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon you delivered, in the which you ſaid, you proved me, and ſuch as I were to be the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Sathan, when in very deed and truth, I knew not that you had delivered ſuch a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, neither did I begin with you, but after you had anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſome queſtions that were propounded to you (by another)
<pb facs="tcp:170253:5"/>and that in your ſpeech you had caſt reproachfull ſpeech up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the people of God, I could do no leſſe but anſwer to your ſpeech, but not with abuſive words, as you may ſee more at large in the anſwer to your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſeveral other things you did miſtake your ſelf in, but I have ſhewed you them in their time and places, as before mentioned; Moreover, Sir, take this word of adviſe, that if your memory be ſo ſhallow, that you cannot retain any thing without Book, when you have the like occaſion again, take down what is ſpoken in writting, ſo that you may affirm the truth, for I doe aſſure you to ſpeak untruth is a ſhame and reproach to any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but more eſpecially to ſuch as profeſſe themſelves to be the Miniſters of Chriſt; and as to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Sin which was a thing we
<pb facs="tcp:170253:5"/>conteſted about, I have alſo ſhewed you in the following trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe what puniſhment it brought upon the Sons of men, and what death it was that was threatned as to be the puniſhment of it, the which death reigned over all from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moyſes,</hi> and yet righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Noah</hi> and ſeveral others were not damned; ſo deſiring your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, much more than your confuſion, I reſt, but not to be your ſervant and all mens for Chriſts ſake,</p>

                  <p>THere is incloſed in this little Treatiſe many weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty particulars, the which did concern all perſons to look into in former ages, but more eſpecially we that live in the laſt age; If therefore thou ſhalt read this Treatiſe with a ſingle heart, and an impartial affection, doubtleſs it will be worth thy time and pains. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I do deſire that thou wouldeſt ſearch the Scriptures, and bring thoſe things that are contained here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to them, that ſo by the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of Gods Word thou maiſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern between Truth and Error, and thereby thou wilt become obedient to that Command of the Lord, which is, <hi>Try all things, and hold faſt
<pb facs="tcp:170253:6"/>that which is good.</hi> Remember that the <hi>Bereans</hi> were counted more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than the men of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> becauſe they received the words of <hi>Paul,</hi> (which was counted as ſtrange doctrine) and ſearched the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures daily, to ſee whether thoſe things were ſo or no: even ſo, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many of theſe particulars may be counted erroneous, yet prove thy ſelf a noble <hi>Berean,</hi> to ſearch the Scriptures to ſee whether it be ſo or no. Moreover, do not count it a ſtrange thing, that the trueſt Doctrines that ever was ſhould be queſtioned, and counted Hereſie; for the learned Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees did queſtion Chriſt, to know where he had his Doctrine, and ſaid He hath a Devil, and is mad: The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> alſo was called a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilent fellow, a teacher of ſtrange Doctrines, a ring-leader of Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, a turner of the world up-ſide down, and what not? Yet, as the
<pb facs="tcp:170253:7"/>Apoſtle ſaith, After the manner they called Hereſie, ſo worſhipped he the God of his Fathers, believing all that was written: Even ſo ſay I, that if any thing that I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in this Treatiſe doe not agree with the Word of God, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine according to godlineſs, I ſhall give thanks to any man that will inform me of it, and alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it; but, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in another caſe, I judge I have the Spirit of God, and ſpeak the Truth. Moreover, Chriſtian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, know that we are in the laſt age, upon whom the very end of the world is come, in which laſt age that great howr of temptation ſhall be, the which ſhall try all them that dwell upon the face of the whole Earth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very profitable for us to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Prophecies, of the laſt Times, that being fore-warned, they may be fore-armed; and in order to the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of thy mind, I have in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Anabaptiſt, as appeared by his heat, being much troubled at a Sermon deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Miniſter, wherein he proved plainly by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, That ſuch as he was, were the Meſſengers of Satan, and delivered Satans Meſſage, fell upon the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with abuſive words; afterwards they entred into Diſputation, the Queſtion was, <hi>Whether there were any ſuch Sin as Original ſin;</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſt denied it; the Miniſter ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged an Argument from the example
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170253:10"/>of <hi>David,</hi> confeſsing that hee was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did his Mother conceive him, <hi>Pſal. 51.5.</hi> to prove there was.</p>
                     <p>The Anabaptiſt anſwered, That the meaning of that place was this, not that <hi>David</hi> himſelf was corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or defiled with ſin, but that hee was ſhapen and conceived in a ſinful Woman. Which anſwer will appear to any man that hath but common ſenſe, to be not only falſe, but alſo moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and ridiculous; for <hi>David,</hi> as will plainly appear to him that reads that Pſalm, ſpeaks only of himſelf, confeſſeth his own Sin only, and this Original ſin, as the root and fountain of all the reſt; there was not ſo much as a thought of time betwixt his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural being, and his Sinful being, Corruption did accompany the very firſt degree of his Conception, <hi>I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my Mother conceive me:</hi> And he praies for the forgiveneſs of this ſin among the reſt.</p>
                     <p>After many words paſt, the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt, unſatisfied, objected, That the Miniſter never read of any Childe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170253:10"/>that was Damned, therefore no ſuch Sin which deſerved eternal Death; his reaſon was, becauſe eternal Death is only the wages of actual ſin; which the Miniſter denied, and inſtanced in <hi>Eſau,</hi> reprobated from all eternity, <hi>Rom. 9.11, 12, 13.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Anabaptiſt anſwerd, That that was for <hi>Eſaus</hi> actual tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and cited <hi>Jeremy</hi> falſly; but the words named are in <hi>Amos 1.3.6.9. For three Tranſgreſſions of</hi> Damaſcus, <hi>and for Four, I will not turn away the puniſhment thereof;</hi> and ſo the ſixth and ninth of <hi>Gaza</hi> and <hi>Tyrus;</hi> which text is as farre from the purpoſe as <hi>Baughton</hi> is from <hi>Rome.</hi> It appears plainly from the Apoſtle, that the words cited by the Miniſter, <hi>Eſau have I hated,</hi> are concerning Gods purpoſe in Election and Reprobation, and not for any actual Sin committed by <hi>Eſau,</hi> or good done by <hi>Jacob,</hi> for the Children not being yet born, mark that, neither having done good or evil, mark that, that the purpoſe of God according to election might ſtand, <hi>verſ. 11.</hi> it is written, <hi>Jacob have I loved, but</hi> Eſau <hi>have I hated.</hi>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:170253:11"/>What will the Anabaptiſts ſay now? they ſay it is unjuſt for God to Damn thoſe that never committed Actual Sin, the Apoſtle would ſtop their blaſphemous mouthes, <hi>verſ. 14. What ſhall we ſay then, is there unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs with God? God forbid,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Hath not the Potter power over the Clay, to make one Veſſel for honour, and another for diſhonour,</hi> ver. <hi>21.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Anabaptiſt ſtill obſtinate, the Miniſter urged another Argument to prove ſome Children were Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and not for Actual ſin, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for Original, and therefore there was ſuch ſin as we call Original; the Argument was taken out of <hi>Jude,</hi> verſ. 7. where it is ſaid, that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and the Cities about them, ſuffered the vengeance of eternal fire; in which Cities, no doubt but there were ſome Children which never had ſinned actually, and theſe with the reſt ſuffered the vengeance of eternal fire.</p>
                     <p>The Anabaptiſt anſwered, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the meaning of Eternal; The word Eternal, ſaith he, is there to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood for conſuming, which is as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170253:11"/>ridiculous and abſurd as the reſt; our ordinary <hi>fire</hi> is conſuming, it conſumes the Wood, or other matter that nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth it, and ſo at laſt it ſelf is extinguiſhed; but this eternal fire never goeth out, neither doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume thoſe it burns; the wicked burn eternally, that is, for ever, and are never conſumed; ſo the anſwer implyes a contradiction.</p>
                     <p>To make this his Expoſition good, he cited a place of St. <hi>Mat. 10.15.</hi> It ſhall be more tollerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the Day of Judgement, than for that City, that will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Apoſtles; more tollerable, that is, ſaith he, (being holpen by one of his Diſciples) Sodom and Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah ſhall be excuſed; but that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition they can never make good; more tollerable, ſaid the Miniſter, that is, they ſhall not receive ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere a Sentence, they ſhall receive leſſer Damnation, but not be wholly excuſed. This he proved by reaſon, for more is the Comparative degree, and is a relative term, and reſpects the ſame thing; then ſtrenghened this reaſon by Scripture, <hi>Mat. 23.14.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170253:12"/>Yee ſhall receive greater damnation</hi> there is Damnation for them becauſe they devoured widows houſes, but greater damnation, becauſe they made long prayer their pretence; more tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, then, doth not imply that they were wholly excuſed, but received leſſer puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>The Anabaptiſt then began to urge an Argument, that no Children were Damned; the Miniſter perceiving that this was to run round in a circle, not able to indure the cold longer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not yet fully recovered of ſickneſs, the Anabaptiſt began to cry Victory, by railing on the Miniſters.</p>
                     <p>Were not thoſe people given over to a reprobate ſenſe, to ſtrong deluſions, to beleeve lyes, they could never force ſuch interpretations upon Scripture. The Lord open their eyes, that they may ſee the truth, and convert, and be healed.</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170253:13"/>and more-over I ſaid, That ſprinkling a little water in a Childes face in its Infancy, was not Baptiſm, <hi>but a couſening ſhift brought in by Pope</hi> Innocentius <hi>the Third;</hi> and then you replied, and ſaid, That <hi>Baptizo</hi> ſignified Sprinkling, as well as Dipping, the which I denied, and ſhewed you, there was no correſpondency between the word <hi>Baptizo</hi> and <hi>Rantizo</hi> (in their ſignifications) to prove one and the ſame thing,
<note place="margin">Baptizo ſignifies to plunge, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm, Rantizo, to ſprinkle, or ſcatter.</note>

                           <p>And now in order I ſhall come to the one and fiftieth Pſalm, verſ. 5. theſe words, <hi>Behold, I was ſhapen in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and in ſin did my mother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me.</hi> In which words there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth no ſuch thing as you ſay, that <hi>David</hi> there confeſſed any ſin, or guilt of any ſin, as he ſtood in the loyns of his Parents, unleſs that firſt ſinne, which, as I have ſhewed you, brought but the firſt Death; neithe have they any leſs perfection in quality of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by the which they are put into a worſe capacity, to ſtand, or fall, as to the loſſe of the injoyment of that eternal inheritance, although I grant the firſt thing they do when they are capable of a Law (and temptations do approach) they like their firſt Father <hi>Adam,</hi> break the Law of God, as he did; and theſe words have I ſpoken as in order to the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170253:15"/>making way for the opening of the words before mentioned; for in the firſt verſe <hi>David</hi> is a Petitioning to God for Mercy and Pardon for that ſin w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he had committed in killing <hi>Uriah,</hi> and taking <hi>Bathſheba</hi> his Wife unto himſelf, in the which Petition he uſes three Arguments, as we may ſo ſay.</p>
                           <p>The Firſt is from the multitude of Gods Mercies, in theſe words, <hi>Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy loving kindneſs, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the multitude of thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> verſe the firſt.</p>
                           <p>The Second is from his acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of his Sin, ſaying, <hi>My ſins are ever before me,</hi> verſ. 3. as if he ſhould ſay, They are the greateſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that I have in the World, they are always in my way; ſo that we ſee the ſecond Motive that he uſes to attain Mercy, is by confeſſion of his ſin, with great zeal and ardency of ſpirit, he well knowing that God had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, That he that confeſſeth and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh his ſin, ſhould finde mercy.</p>
                           <p>And the Third and laſt Argument which he uſed (in this Pſalm) to move God to have mercy upon him, in blotting out his tranſgreſſions, was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170253:15"/>from the brittleneſs of his Nature, and the weakneſs of that Lump that he was made out of; As if hee ſhould have ſaid, Father, thou knoweſt I am of the Earth earthly, which is ſubject to much weakneſs, and frailty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he beyond all other reaſons, in this laſt reaſon, verſ. 5, ſaith, Behold! as if he ſhould have ſaid, Lord, take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, as well conſider how defective the Mould was in the which I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (which to me appears to be his Mother <hi>Eva,</hi> in whoſe loyns was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and all other ſhapen, for God made all Mankind at once, and not his Mother that bare him) that thereby thou conſidering my frame, maiſt in pity blot out my tranſgreſſions.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170253:16"/>you cited to me in theſe words, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me,</hi> is no more but the proneneſs of <hi>Davids</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by reaſon of the weakneſs of the matter that he was made of; and that is the ſame that he deſires God to take notice of, or behold, whereby hee might graciouſly remit that ſinful Act that he had committed, unleſs you meant that Sin which beleeving men and women ſuffer for, which is the ſin againſt the firſt Covenant, which did conſiſt of an <hi>earthly Paradiſical glory,</hi> which I did to you, and do ſtill affirm, That both <hi>Adam,</hi> and all his Poſterity conſideredly as they were in his loyns, did not only commit it, but alſo ſuffer for it, which I did then (and do ſtill) affirm to bee the firſt Death, by which Pollution and Corruption run thorow all the parts of the outward man.

                           <p>But whereas you ſaid, that there was no thought of time betwixt the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral being of <hi>David,</hi> and the ſinful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; if you mean his ſinful being, by that matter that he received from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> it is granted, but if it be of the Soul, or inward part, which had its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God, it is denied from the two Reaſons already rendred.</p>
                           <p>Further, one Reaſon more; <hi>Any Creature that is defiled in the inward
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170253:17"/>man, is not fit for the Kingdom of God; but Children are fit for the Kingdom of God at the very birth of them; therefore Children are not defiled or corrupted in the inward man.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Further, You affirmed in your wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that I ſaid that you could never read in Scripture that any Children were damned, and therefore no ſuch Sin Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal to Damn; to which ſay you, you inſtanced that of <hi>Eſau,</hi> who was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated from all Eternity; to the which I anſwer, I do indeed confeſs you ſaid ſo, but I have learned, that your ſay ſo is no ſufficient proof; for the ninth of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth verſes, which you cited to prove the matter, prove no ſuch thing; for let any Soul ſeriouſly read that place, and ſee whether that place ſay, that God reprobated <hi>Eſau</hi> before hee was born, or had done good or evil; We may take notice that <hi>Paul</hi> in that place makes uſe of two portions of Scripture, the firſt is <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.23. and the next is <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.2, 3.</p>
                           <p>But firſt to the firſt place, that ſpeaks of <hi>Eſau</hi> before he was born; now in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170253:18"/>this place we may take notice that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca</hi> had been barren, and Childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing was ſomewhat ſtrange to her being barren, ſo that in verſe twenty two it is ſaid, <hi>the Children ſtruggled</hi> within her (which was <hi>a Type of that variance and difference that was to be in time betwixt</hi> Jacob <hi>and</hi> Eſau) and ſhe ſaid, <hi>If it be ſo, why am I thus?</hi> as if ſhe ſhould have ſaid, What is the cauſe of this ſtruggleing, ſince it is ſo that I have been barren, and the text ſaid, <hi>Shee inquired of the Lord;</hi> now followeth the matter that was ſpoken of <hi>Eſau</hi> before he was born, <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto her, two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are in thy wombe, and two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of people ſhall be ſeparated from thy bowels, and the one people ſhall be ſtronger than the other people, and the elder ſhall ſerve the younger.</hi> Now I pray conſider, <hi>Doth this ſay that God hath reprobated</hi> Eſau <hi>before hee was born? and this was all that I finde was ſaid of him before hee was born.</hi> Pray may not a younger brother farre ſurmount in external injoyments, inſomuch that thereby the elder may come to ſerve the younger, and yet
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170253:18"/>both of them ſaved, if the elder do not miſdemean himſelf to God? ſo, though <hi>Jacob</hi> have that great poſſeſſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> have the inferiour poſſeſſion of <hi>Edom,</hi> yet, may not <hi>Eſau</hi> be ſaved if he do not abuſe his talent?</p>
                           <p>And the ſecond place that <hi>Paul</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth is, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.3, in theſe words, as it is written, Jacob <hi>have I loved, and</hi> Eſau <hi>have I hated,</hi> Rom. 9.13. Now we know, that it is no where elſe written,
<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Eſau</hi> not hated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee was born.</note> 
                              <hi>Jacob</hi> have I loved, and <hi>Eſau</hi> have I hated; and this was long after <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> were dead; though <hi>Paul</hi> make uſe of theſe two places, as <hi>Geneſis</hi> and <hi>Malachy,</hi> both at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of time, yet <hi>the ſentence in</hi> Malachy <hi>was written hundreds of years ſince that of</hi> Geneſis i and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Eſau</hi> after he was dead, and had done many evil works, as <hi>Oba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diah</hi> the tenth.</p>
                           <p>Thus you may ſee your miſtakes in the Scriptures by your little reading, or leſs exerciſing of your underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in them; and as you ſay, I falſly cited <hi>Jeremy,</hi> when the place was in <hi>Amos;</hi> I ſay you falſly accuſe me, for
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170253:19"/>I cited <hi>Malachy, Obadiah,</hi> and <hi>Amos,</hi> and the place cited in <hi>Jeremy</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Potter and the Clay.</p>
                           <p>Sir, one abſurdity take notice of, in the which you may ſee you make God a Lyar, when as God ſweareth, (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11.) that he deſires not the death of the wicked, but rather that they would return and live; you ſay hee is ſo farre from meaning what he ſaith, that he hath appointed from eternity the greateſt part of men to be Damned, Contrary to that, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, 4, verſes, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. with a multitude more of Scriptures that might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. You ſay that the <hi>Anabaptiſts, as you call them, will ſay that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt for God to condemn thoſe that have not committed actual Sin;</hi> to which I anſwer.</p>
                           <p>The Apoſtle would ſtop their blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous mouthes with <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.14. in theſe words, <hi>What, is there unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs with God? God forbid.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over you adde, verſ. 21. in theſe words, <hi>Hath not the Potter power over the Clay, to make one veſſel to honour, and another to diſhonour;</hi> and in theſe words you think you have met with us
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170253:19"/>to the purpoſe, and therefore are bold to call us blaſphemous; but Sir, give me leave to tell you without offence, <hi>That if you know as well how to feed the Flock, as you do to take off the fleece, you would have ſeen</hi> that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had not brought this place to have proved that God might have been righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and yet for all that damn where there is no actual ſin; for Sir, take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that in this place he ſpeaks not to Children, or ſuch as had not commited actual ſin, but to the rebellious houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom he compares to Clay marred in the Potters hands; ſo they were in the Lords hands, and he did intend to make them honourable Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, he did (as we may ſay in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his Majeſty) do all what hee could to them, uſe all the means that he had to beſtow upon a people to make them Honourable, yet ſtill <hi>they were marred in his hand, that is to ſay, rebellious and refractory.</hi> You may ſee this proved fully in theſe two portions of Scripture, in the room of many more that might be given, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. from the firſt Verſe to the eighth, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiel</hi> 16, from the fifth to the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170253:20"/>Now to come to the eighteenth of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> from the firſt verſe and ſo onwards, you may ſee they are the very words that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> maketh uſe of to anſwer that Objection, Rom. 9.19. which ſaith, <hi>Thou then wilt ſay unto me, why doth hee yet finde fault, for who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> Anſwer, <hi>Nay, but O man, who art thou that replieſt againſt God? Shall the thing formed ſay unto him that formed it, why haſt thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter power over the Clay, to make one veſſel to honour, and another to diſhonour?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now this take notice of well,
<note place="margin">Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the cauſe that men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Veſſels of diſhonour.</note> that the Apoſtle goeth now to anſwer that Objection, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. in theſe words, <hi>Who hath reſiſted his will;</hi> and ſheweth them plainly, that they were the people that had reſiſted his will; if he had not ſhewed by infallible proof, that they were the people that had reſiſted Gods will, then the Objection had lain ſtill unanſwered, but now he anſwereth it, as if he ſhould have ſaid, O yee mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring ſtiffe-necked houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> have you a word to ſpeak againſt God for his Juſtice in cutting you off, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170253:20"/>making you a diſhonourable people? did not the Lord ſay unto you long ago by his Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Chap. 18. verſ. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. when he compares you to the Clay, and himſelf to the Potter, you being ſtubborn or refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory in the hand of the Lord, and would have none of his inſtructions, when he called you to walk in that good old way, but your anſwer was, <hi>You would not walk therein,</hi> Jerem. 6.16. did not the Lord prophecy to make you another veſſel as ſeemed him good? which in all likelihood was to be a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of diſhonour, for it ſeems good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, when perſons will not bee allured by Mercy, to be cut off by the Axe of his Juſtice, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.1, 2, 3. Verſes, therefore who art thou, or how canſt thou finde fault, ſaying, <hi>Who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> when it is evident that thou haſt ſo reſiſted his will, being Clay marred in the Potters hands. But if the Objection be made, That he had mercy on ſome of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſo made them Veſſels of honour, and yet ſome hee made Veſſels of diſhonour; To that I anwſer, It is very true, that hee did
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170253:21"/>make ſome of that Lump Veſſels of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but they were ſuch as were pricked in their heart for their ſins
<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 2.37</note>, and did purifie their heart through beleeving, and obeying the truth, and ſo Chriſt became the Author of their eternal Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. verſ. 22. for it was that which the Lord hath promiſed Souls that did purge themſelves from the unbeleef in their hearts, as you may ſee, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.20. <hi>But in a great Houſe there are not only Veſſels of Gold, and of Silver, but alſo of Wood, and of Earth, and ſome to honour, and ſome to diſhonour,</hi> verſ. 21. <hi>if a man therefore purge himſelf from theſe, he ſhall be a veſſel unto honour, ſanctified and meet for the Maſters uſe, and prepared unto every good work.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And now I ſhall give you a brief re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of thoſe words that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> makes uſe of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. they are the words of the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> Jer. 18.1. to 17. and ſo onwards, <hi>And the Word of the Lord came unto me ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Go down to the Potters houſe, and there will I cauſe thee to hear my words; and I went down to the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170253:21"/>Houſe, and behold he wronght a work on the wheel; and the veſſel that he made with clay was marred in the hands of the Potter, and he made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Veſſel as ſeemed the Potter good to make it; then the Word of the Lord came unto me ſaying, O Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>can I not do with you as this Potter, ſaith the Lord? Behold, as the clay is in the Potters hands, ſo are yee in my hands, O Houſe of</hi> Iſrael. <hi>At what inſtant I ſpeak concerning a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Kingdom, to pluck up, or deſtroy; If that Nation turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil I thought to do unto them; but in what inſtant I ſpeak concerning a Nation or Kingdom, to build or to plant it, if they do evil in my ſight, then will I repent of the good wherewith I ſaid I would benefit them; now therefore go, ſpeak to the men of</hi> Judah, <hi>and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>ſaying, thus ſaith the Lord, Behold, I frame evil againſt you, and deviſe a device a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you; return every one of you from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good, but they

                                 </gap> after our own devices, &amp;c.</hi> and in verſ, 17. he threatens to ſhew them his back, and not the face in the day of their Calamity, the which wee may ſee the Lord brought upon them, and yet he was juſt when he judged; and thus you ſee the Apoſtle anſwereth the Objection, and ſhews the <hi>Jews, Rom.</hi> 9. what the Lord had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined concerning them, and alſo made known by the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> that hee could, according to the truth of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice (if they remained obſtinate in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil in his ſight) make them a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable Veſſel, as well as the Potter could make that Clay (which was not yeelding, and conformable to his hands) a veſſel of diſhonour. Thus I have ſhewed you the words of the Prophet, and the meaning of the Apoſtle, that he doth not ſtop the mouthes of thoſe perſons that ſay, the Lord of the whole earth cannot do unrighteouſneſs, and therefore cannot Condemn the Childe, and caſt it into Hell for the Fathers ſin; neither can he Reprobate any but for their actual ſin; but hee ſtops the mouthes of thoſe <hi>Jews,</hi> and all ſuch
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170253:22"/>as they are who do queſtion why God might finde fault, although they before have given him juſt cauſe of offence, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.8.</p>
                           <p>The next thing you affirm,
<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Sodom</hi> not ſuffering puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Hell fire.</note> is not true, wherein you ſaid I did affirm, That that fire which Saint <hi>Jude</hi> calls <hi>eternal fire,</hi> was meant only conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire; though it was conſuming indeed, yet I did not affirm that to bee the only meaning of it, but you may remember, I ſaid by the word <hi>eternal fire,</hi> was meant ſuch a fire as was not kindled by man, neither did it happen in the City by accident, but it iſſued forth from God, being not kindled by man, and ſo was as eternal as himſelf, for <hi>the breath of the Lord was ever a fire to his enemies,</hi> Dan. 7.10. From hence it is ſaid of him, in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Our God is a conſuming fire;</hi> the which fire did deſtroy the Natural bodies of the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> and that eternal fire was not Hell, as you blindly conceive; but it was ſuch fire as the Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to come down from Heaven to deſtroy the Captains, and their Fifties, which was as eternal as that of <hi>Sodom,</hi> being without kindling by man, or
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170253:23"/>without end, and it came not out of Hell, but from Heaven; and ſo you may ſee it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.24. in theſe words, <hi>Then the Lord rained upon</hi> Sodom, <hi>and upon</hi> Gomorrah, <hi>brimſtone and ſire from the Lord out of Heaven;</hi> and this was for the deſtruction of no more but their Natural bodies, for it is not Gods way to afflict the puniſhment of Hell before he hath tried Souls at the general Judgement, which ſhall not be till after the Reſurrection; for the Sentence againſt the firſt ſin, and the puniſhment thereof (which was the firſt death) was not inflicted upon <hi>Adam</hi> till after God had legally tried him; and Sir, let me tell you, that the very Devils are not yet in Hell, but their puniſhment is reſerved until the Day of Judgement,
<note place="margin">Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and reprobate men not yet in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</note> 
                              <hi>Iude</hi> verſ. 6. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.29. <hi>Why art thou come to torment us before the time?</hi> Which ſheweth plainly, that the puniſhment of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate Angels, and reprobate Men, is not yet inflicted, but hath reference to time; and Sir, if I ſhould ask you where Hell were, what anſwer would you give me? you would happily tell mee, it was where the Wrath of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170253:23"/>God was, and then I ſhall conclude, that Hell were under your Coat, for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.36. <hi>That he that beleeveth not, the wrath of God abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth on him for ever.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And truly Sir, if your faith ſhould be tried by your works (as <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith it muſt be) then doubtleſs you would be found altogether unbeleeving; and if ſo, then according to the former words of our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>That the wrath of God abides on ſuch;</hi> ſo that if you do conclude Hell to bee in all places where the Wrath of God is, (though I do indeed conclude, that there ſhall be a material place of Hell, where the Wrath of God ſhall remain perpetually) then Hell muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be at the place aforeſaid.</p>
                           <p>And if you do conclude it to bee on the Earth, or under the Earth, as ſome fooliſhly have conceived, then it is moſt evident, that the Devils are not yet in Hell, for he is called <hi>the Prince of the Air;</hi> and hence it comes to paſs, that the Devil is many times caſt down by the Judgements of God; ſo that if you have any reaſon to prove Hell to be yet in being, then you might have ſome
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170253:24"/>better ground, to ſay the <hi>Sodomites</hi> with their Children are in Hell, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no reaſon to prove the <hi>firſt,</hi> you have little reaſon to ſay the <hi>ſecond.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But if you ſhould ſuppoſe that <hi>Luke</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Parables prove not things.</note> ſixteenth would prove it in the <hi>Parable,</hi> I will ſhew you that that will bee no proof, for it was but a <hi>Parable,</hi> and I can as well affirm that the Trees went forth on a time to anoynt a King over them, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.8. <hi>And they ſaid unto the Olive tree, reign thou over us.</hi> You may read unto the ſixteenth verſe, and ſee a large Diſcourſe of it, which is a Parable as well as that, <hi>Luke</hi> ſixteenth, and ſo proves nothing, but is for illuſtration, and ſo that place <hi>Luke</hi> ſixteenth is for illuſtration, by the which the Lord doth ſhew what ſhall be the condition of poor afflicted Souls that ſuffer in this Life, and alſo the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch who hate the poor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted people of God, and take their pleaſure in this Life; ſo that God calls things that ſhall be in time, as if they were in preſent being.</p>
                           <p>Hence it comes to paſs, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel cries out, <hi>Babylon is fallen,</hi> Revel. 14.8. and ſo <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.2. which
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170253:24"/>Voyce from Heaven was ſixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ago, and yet I doubt not but you would conclude with me, that <hi>Rome</hi> which is there called <hi>Myſtery Babylon</hi> is not yet fallen; &amp; ſo alſo <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.11, 12. <hi>That he ſaw the general Reſurrection, and the laſt Judgement;</hi> ſo that you may ſee God calleth things that ſhall be, as if they were; and thus I have anſwered your great Objection, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.22. But now becauſe there is a Generation of Men, which affirm, That there is no Hell now in being, nor never ſhall be, and thereby are hardned in their ungodly practiſes, I ſhall ſhew you in a few words my judgement concerning Hell, that all men may ſee I abhor ſuch an ungodly opinion.</p>
                           <p>In the firſt place I ſhall ſpeak a little
<note place="margin">Hell not in being till the coming of the Lord</note> of the time of its being, and that I find in Scripture ſhall not be till the coming of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to judge the world, 2 <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 7. verſ. 8. where the Lord is ſaid <hi>to come in flaming fire, to puniſh ſuch as diſobey him in his Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>Iude</hi> 14, 15. verſes, <hi>Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thouſand of his Saints, to execute
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170253:25"/>judgement upon all.</hi> Which ſheweth, that neither Judgement, nor the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Judgement (which is the puniſhment of Hell) ſhall be untill the coming of the Lord; ſee alſo, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.12. <hi>He ſhall come quickly, and his reward ſhall be with him, to give unto every one according to his works.</hi> See <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.29, 30, 31. So much briefly for the time of Hell in its being, although much more may be ſaid.</p>
                           <p>Secondly in brief, for the place of Hell, which I conceive ſhall bee on Earth, where ſin was committed; for which I refer you to <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 24.21. which ſaith, <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs in that day, that the Lord will puniſh the Hoſt of High ones which are on high, and the Kings of the earth on the earth.</hi> It is in that day when <hi>hee ſhall reign gloriouſly in the Hill of</hi> Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>when the Sun ſhall be aſhamed, and the Moon confounded.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And further, we know Hell is called utter darkneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> when the Lord hath with-drawn, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, which are but for ſigns and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and for days and years; and theſe words ſhew that they are limited
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170253:25"/>as to time, which when they are taken away, the Earth will be utter darkneſs, and ſo the place where the Lord will puniſh. Further he ſaith, he will gather all Fleſh to the valley of <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> and plead with them there, and ſo much briefly to the place.</p>
                           <p>Now becauſe I have thus ſaid, that Hell is not yet in being, let not any ungodly Soul be hardned in his ungodly practices, to think that when they dye they ſhall not go to Hell, thou maiſt come there too ſoon; for if ſo be that a thouſand years to the Lord be but as yeſterday, and yet he have knowledge of time, then ten thouſand years is but a moment to thoſe which have no knowledge of time; but in the Grave there is no remembrance of time, ſo that from <hi>Adams</hi> death which was the firſt man, unto the time of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, will be to him but a moment of time.</p>
                           <p>But if by theſe words you ſhould conclude that I hold the Mortality of the <hi>Soul,</hi> I ſhall ſpeak a word to it, although I have ſpoke to it before, yet a word now in its place may be ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and that is this, All that is man
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170253:26"/>dyeth, and is mortal; neither do I know, and I beleeve you will be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to finde, that any other thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to God, than that Spirit, which is neither of man, nor from man, but was freely given from God, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is immortal, and yet is in no ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to receive joy, until the body is perfected with it. I could ſpeak much to this particular, but that I ſee two ſorts of perſons that are ready to run upon the extremes, which for want of true underſtanding in that point do run into great abſurdities.</p>
                           <p>In the laſt Clauſe of your Letter you ſay, The Anabaptiſt would have ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged another Argument to prove no Children damned, but you ſay you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed it, and ſaid, that was but running round.</p>
                           <p>To which I anſwer, That it did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me you were very weary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and could not anſwer to one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and therefore much leſs to many more. You writ to me that you were ſcarcely recovered of Sickneſs, and ſo that was one ground why you could not. We uſe to ſay, Sir, a bad ſhift is better than none, but while you were a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170253:26"/>talking of the fleſh, namely conteſting about your Tithes with your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, which was none of your Flock, you ſeemed to be very well.</p>
                           <p>But Sir, I marvell not much at your Apology, for I ſcarce ever met with any of your Coat but they had urgent buſineſs that wanted them at home, or a great way to Ride, or a Sermon to Teach, or ſome ſuch like excuſe; but were any of you at any place where you might have varieties for your Belly, or monies for your Purſe, and no Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the way (as you call them) to trouble you, you would not bee in ſuch great haſt. Furthermore, you ſaid I cried Victory by railing upon you, Sir, I pray you do not make me like your ſelf, which uſually do rayl in your Pulpit, as I am informed, and by your own confeſſion; but I ſhall give you a review of thoſe words, which you call rayling.</p>
                           <p>You may remember, when you were mounted on your Horſe, and ready to be gone, when you could ſay nothing unto me, you had thought to ſtop my mouth with theſe words, ſaying unto me, you profeſs God hath ſpoke
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170253:27"/>to you, let us ſee you ſhew a ſign.</p>
                           <p>Although I never had a tittle in my ſpeech to that purpoſe, my anſwer was this <hi>(which you call rayling)</hi> that you are like to that adulterous Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that ſeek a ſign, and none ſhall be given them.</p>
                           <p>And furthermore I ſaid, That if you were as careful to read the Scriptures, and being frequent in them, as you were, to look after your Tithes, you might have remembred, that <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> who was a very great Prophet, did ſhew no ſign or mark at all, yet all that that he ſaid was true, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.41. and this was the ſum of that I ſaid, which you call rayling.</p>
                           <p>The laſt thing you ſay, appears to be full of confuſion, for in the firſt Clauſe of your laſt Verſe, in which you ſay, that ſuch as wee, are given up, <hi>The meaning thereof is this, That God hath given us up to be caſt out of his favour, not only intending to harden us, but alſo to harden himſelf againſt us, not intending any means ſhall do us good, cutting us from mercy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in our deſtruction;</hi> this is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170253:27"/>meant by giving up to a reprobate ſenſe.</p>
                           <p>And yet now in the laſt Clauſe of your Verſe you pray, That the Lord would open our eyes; ſo that in one place you caſt us as far as you can into Hell, and ſay, That God hath done ſo in his account already. Do I wrong ſuch a generation of men; if I ſhould call them <hi>Babels</hi> Brats? I leave the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to judge. But as for your prayer I matter it not, whether you pray for us, or curſe us (which is your moſt uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt practice) for I know that the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of ſuch are abomination, according to the Word of the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. I ſhall ſpeak no more to the Letter at preſent, but exhort you to repent from your dead works, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the Goſpel, and be <hi>Baptized for remiſſion of ſins, before the Decree paſs, and there be no remedy.</hi>

                           <p>Now Sir, having anſwered your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170253:28"/>I ſhall not leave you ſo, but ſhall further clear the truth of what I have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by word and writing, and that by ſeveral Reaſons or Arguments, as followeth.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. That opion that affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God may change in what he hath abſolutely <hi>Decreed,</hi> is falſe, and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious; but your Opinion, that Original ſin bringeth <hi>Adam</hi> and all his Poſterity,
<note place="margin">God not changeable in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.</note> liable, or guilty to the ſecond Death, (and yet we ſee <hi>Adam</hi> and all his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity are not puniſhed with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Death) maketh God changeable in what he hath abſolutely Decreed; <hi>ergo</hi> your opinion is falſe and erronious.</p>
                           <p>The Major part of the Argument I ſuppoſe will not bee denied, and that you know well that God changeth not, and therefore <hi>the Sons of</hi> Jacob <hi>are not conſumed.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Minor I ſhall thus prove, from <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. which faith, <hi>But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou ſhalt not eat of it, for in the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely dye,</hi> or, in dying thou ſhalt dye. Here we may ſee God did abſolutely <hi>Decree.</hi> and alſo declare his <hi>Decree,</hi> That if
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170253:28"/>
                              <hi>Adam</hi> did tranſgreſs that Law, hee ſhould dye.</p>
                           <p>Now if that Death included there do preſuppoſe the ſecond Death as well as the firſt, then if all do not dye the ſecond Death as well as the firſt, Gods Juſtice is not ſatisfied, but his Decree fruſtrated, for God cannot bring any ſecondary means to fruſtrate that which he hath abſolutely Decreed, or diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the ſatisfaction of his Juſtice. When I ſay he cannot, my meaning is this, That the Will of God, with the Attribute of his Truth, doth guide the Attribute of his Power, ſo that he can do nothing but what is righteous, according to truth.</p>
                           <p>If God may bring a ſecondary means to diſappoint the ſatisfaction of his Juſtice, he may as well bring a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary means to diſappoint the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his Mercy, whereby the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of his Mercy be not executed.</p>
                           <p>In plaineneſs of words, my meaning is this, That if the Lord would after he had ſaid <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould dye (and all his) eternally, and yet afterwards pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare life and glory for ſo many of them as would accept of it; may hee not as
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170253:29"/>well prepare a Hel for perſons who have continued faithful unto death, whoſe reward is a Crown of Life?</p>
                           <p>But now to anſwer an Objection or two.</p>
                           <p>Obj. 1. <hi>The firſt Objection is from the example of</hi> Ninivie, <hi>for the Lord ſaid,</hi> Forty days and <hi>Ninivie</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed, <hi>and yet it was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; from which word many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that God doth change in his Decree.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſ.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">God doth not change his Decree, but doth decree to change his Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the actions of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> To this I anſwer, That God did not change his Decree, but did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to change his Diſpenſation of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or Judgement according to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures obedience, or diſobedience; for God had declared his Decree long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Jonah</hi> was ſent to <hi>Ninivie,</hi> That <hi>at what inſtant be ſpake of a Nation, or Kingdom, to pluok up, or deſtroy, if they did repent of their evil, hee would repent of the evil he thought to do unto them,</hi> Jerem. 18.7. but wee ſee <hi>Ninivie</hi> did repent, from the <hi>King on the throne, to the Begger on the dunghil.</hi> And hence it comes to paſs, that God could not deſtroy them, though he told <hi>Jonah</hi> hee did intend ſuch a thing as concerning them; and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170253:29"/>thus we ſee God doth not alter in his Decree, although he doth Decree to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Diſpenſation of Mercy or Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to the Creatures actings.</p>
                           <p>Hence it comes to paſs, though <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> ſhould have enjoyed all <hi>Paradiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> glory, &amp; not been rooted up for ever, yet for his diſobedience he was rooted up, &amp; drove out of the Garden, with the loſs of all that aforeſaid injoyment; and God that ſeeth things before time that ſhall be in time, and calleth things that ſhall be as if they were, ſaw <hi>Adam</hi> the very ſame day that hee did Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, not only dying (in dying thou ſhalt ſurely dye) but alſo ſaw <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſterity returned unto Earth from whence hee was taken; ſo the Sentence is true in his account, that calls things that ſhall be as if they were. So much briefly to the firſt Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                           <p>Obj. 2. <hi>The ſecond Objection is, That the Promiſe did intervene</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams <hi>Sin, and the Sentence.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, That makes not to the taking away of the Puniſhment of it; hence it comes to paſs, though the Promiſe hath been made fleſh, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170253:30"/>dwelt amongſt us, and hath been dead and riſen again, yet no whit of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is abated; ſo that God can as well ceaſe to be, as he can ceaſe to be unfaithful in the true execution of the Attributes of his Juſtice or Mercy.</p>
                           <p>But I conceive the reaſon why the Promiſe did intervene, was, becauſe he would not leave his Creatures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome comfort, as if he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>Adam,</hi> there was a time when thou mighteſt have eaten of every Tree in the Garden, unleſs that Tree in the middeſt, and in pleaſure, and not in ſorrow, but now thou ſhalt eat in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row all the days of thy life, until thou returneſt unto that lump of Earth from whence thou waſt taken, therefore thou maiſt ſee what thou haſt got by harkning to the voyce of the Serpent, and thy Wife, yet this let me ſpeak to thy comfort, <hi>The Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhall break the Serpents head;</hi> that is, though the Serpent had thought by his ſubtilty to have buried thy honour in the duſt for ever, and ſo to have deſtroyed the work that I had been doing Six, days, in one hour, yet I will have him to know, that my Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170253:30"/>is unſearchable, and my ways paſt finding out; that I have found a way to involve my Son in the fleſh, not to take upon him the <hi>Nature of Angels,</hi> but the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whereby hee may <hi>take</hi> away the Victory from the Grave; though thou muſt needs dye, and be like water ſpilt upon the ground, yet I have uſed a means that thou ſhalt not be for ever expelled, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.14.</p>
                           <p>So, know this to thy comfort, and ſet the Serpent know this to his ſhame, though my word be eſtabliſhed in the Heavens, that the Heavens and Earth ſhall paſs away, yet not one word of mine ſhall paſs away unexecuted, and ſo I ſhall take the words of the Lord before named, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.14. and ſhew you why God brought in the promiſed Seed, to intervene ſin and the ſentence, that is, though his <hi>Decree</hi> cannot be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, nor his Juſtice go unſatisfied, but that Man muſt dye for that Original Sin, no man or woman to be exempted, but muſt all be baniſhed by death.</p>
                           <p>But <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was to bring life and immortality to light; herein is the ſaying made good, <hi>O Death where is
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170253:31"/>thy ſting! O Grave where is thy Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory! the ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the Law, but thanks be to God, who hath given us victory through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This place the Apoſtle uſeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. to prove the very thing that I am now a proving of. If you ſhould ask me, whether Chriſt brought nothing for the Sons of Men more than a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</hi> I ſhould anſwer yes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, he brought <hi>heavenly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſical glory</hi> for all ſuch as would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it upon thoſe conditions that he offered it. Much more might be ſaid to this Objection and Argument, but my time at preſent is precious.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If the Sin againſt the Firſt Covenant made the Sinners liable but to the firſt Death, then <hi>Adam,</hi> and all ſince in his loyns, were liable but to the firſt Death.</p>
                           <p>But the Sin againſt the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made the Sinners liable but to the firſt Death.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ergo</hi> Adam <hi>and all his poſterity ſtand guilty by that Sin only of the firſt Death.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To the proof of this Argument I
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170253:31"/>ſhall give you to underſtand what I mean by the firſt <hi>Covenant,</hi> and that you may ſee, was excellent injoyments (I mean) excelling in Prerogative be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all other Creatures, inſomuch as they were all under him, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever name he gave them they ſhall bee called by; and alſo, had he not ſinned, he ſhould have injoyed that pure earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Paradiſical injoyment, which was the glory of the firſt Covenant, from which glory hee fell by tranſgreſſion of that Law, or that Original Sin, as you ſo call it.</p>
                           <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Adams</hi> ſin being only againſt the firſt Covenant brings not Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Hell.</note> That he ſinned againſt no other Covenant but that Covenant, becauſe there was never no Covenant made of a ſecond Life, or a ſecond Glory, not till after <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, and therefore could not ſin againſt ſuch a Covenant, it being not made, nor he in a capacity to ſin againſt any ſuch thing.</p>
                           <p>So that Sir, take notice of this one thing by the way, that as the Grave, and the miſery tending thereunto, as ſickneſs, weakneſs, and ſuch like infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, is that which a Creature recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth as puniſhment for the ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that pure earthly Paradiſical Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
                           <pb n="46" facs="tcp:170253:32"/>
                           <p>So the Gulf of Hell,
<note place="margin">Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Hell only for tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſecond Covenant</note> with eternal miſery, is the puniſhment of Sin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt that ſecond Covenant, the which is a Covenant of heavenly Paradiſical glory; ſo that as the glory of the ſecond Covenant doth ſurmount the glory of the firſt, ſo the loſs of the thing Covenanted, with the puniſhment thereunto, doth farre ſurmount the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the firſt, with the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment annexed thereunto.</p>
                           <p>Now to prove my Minor Propoſition by a plain rext, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. <hi>In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eat bread, until thou returneſt to the ground, for out of it waſt thou taken, dust thou art, and unto duſt thou ſhalt return,</hi> Compare this with the ſeventeenth verſe of the ſame Chapter, where he ſaith, <hi>Curſed is the ground for thy ſake;</hi> and alſo telleth him, <hi>that it ſhall bear thorns and thiſtles.</hi> So if you take good notice what the Lord denounces as puniſhment to him and his ſeed, (which is only earthly) and inflicted only upon the outward man, no whit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, neither inflicted upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man; and thus I have proved my Minor Propoſition, that <hi>Adams</hi> Sin
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170253:32"/>was but againſt the firſt Covenant, which ſin loſt but the injoyment of the firſt Life, with that earthly Paradiſical glory.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Arg.</hi> 3.
<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Adam</hi> and all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments before he fell were but earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> If <hi>Adam</hi> in his beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition (as he ſtood in Paradiſe before the Fall) were but an earthly man, and all his injoyments were but earthly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments; then he could loſe no more than what he had to loſe, which was earthly.</p>
                           <p>But <hi>Adam</hi> in his beſt condition was but an earthly man, all his injoyments were but earthly injoyments.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ergo</hi> all that he loſt was butearthly injoyments.</p>
                           <p>The Minor I ſhall thus prove, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.44. <hi>There is a Natural body, and a Spiritual body, ſo it is written, the firſt man</hi> Adam <hi>was made a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soul, the laſt man Adam was made a quickning ſpirit,</hi> verſe 45. <hi>howbeit that was not firſt which is Spiritual, but that which is Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and after that which is Spiritual,</hi> verſ. 46. <hi>The firſt man is of the earth earthy, the ſecond man is the Lord from Heaven,</hi> verſ. 47. Thus you ſee the firſt man <hi>Adam</hi> was but earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170253:33"/>and alſo his injoyments as earthly as himſelf.</p>
                           <p>Obj. <hi>If it ſhould be objected and ſaid, That the Lord made</hi> Adam <hi>an immortal Soul.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> To which I anſwer, that God breathed into <hi>Adam</hi> the breath of Life, and ſo hee became a living Soul; it ſhould appear he was a dead Soul before, for many times in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Mortal part of Man is called the Soul, <hi>Joſhua</hi> 10.28. it is proved in, and ſo oftentimes in the ninth, tenth, and eleventh Chapters of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> and all his Poſterity had ſuch mortal Souls, that had not <hi>Chriſt</hi> riſen to have brought a Reſurrection, that is to ſay, that mortal Body out of the duſt, we had been like the beaſts that periſhed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.18.

                           <p>But that puniſhment due to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe is no other than what God hath declared in the Sentence, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>ergo</hi> none of the Children of <hi>Adam</hi> ſhal ſuffer in Hell for that Sin; and that it was but a loſs of earthly injoyments, with deformities, and corruption, I have proved it at large.</p>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170253:35"/>Infants that dye in their Infancy, none excepted, muſt needs be damned; for you did affirm, That <hi>David</hi> was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that Sin that brought Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and if <hi>David</hi> were guilty, then all Children, for <hi>David</hi> in your ſenſe was an Elect Perſon, and yet if he had died in his Infancy he had been damned, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your expreſſion from Pſalm fifty; ſo that upon this account all Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in their infancy ſtand at enmity with God; and if ſo, then ſhew mee what reconciliation there can be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Scripture account, without the manifeſtation of Repentance and Faith towards <hi>God,</hi> for Chriſt faith, <hi>Except you beleeve, you ſhall dye in your ſins, John</hi> 8.24. which Children cannot do, although you would blindly conclude from <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. that thoſe little ones there were Children, which cannot bee proved; for though Chriſt did take a little one, yet he took not little ones, and neither are little ones capable to ſuffer for Chriſt, and ſo conſequently not capable to be offended.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, Faith is a perſwaſion of the minde, flowing from the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but Children having no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170253:36"/>can have no faith, ſo that God ſaith, <hi>I ſpeak not to your Children, which neither know nor underſtand;</hi> and ſo much for the abſurdity which neceſſarily will follow, That all Infants muſt be damned, if that which you ſay be true, and ſo I ſhall leave as to that particular.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He next thing that I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon, is to ſhew the Characters of the falſe and corrupted Miniſtery, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they that run may read, and know them by their fruits.</p>
                     <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1 Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter.</note> you ſhall know them by their teaching for Doctrines the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men; the Lord in old time did complain againſt ſuch Perſons, as you may ſee, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.30, 31. in theſe words, <hi>A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the Land, the Prophets Propheſy falſly, and the Prieſts bear rule by their means, and the people love to have it ſo, and what ſhall be done in the end thereof?</hi> Thus you may ſee the Prophets of old did propheſie the viſion of their own Brain,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170253:37"/>and the Prieſts of Old, they muſt bear rule by their means, that is to ſay, their falſe Divinations muſt go for truth, and it being pleaſing to the fleſh the people loved to have it ſo. So it is with the falſe corrupted Miniſtery in our days, the Prophets of old, or more properly <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Fathers,</hi> as they ſo call them, they in their ſeveral Councils have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined certain Articles of their own invention, impoſing them on mens Conſciences as infallible truths (when God never ſpake any ſuch thing in his Word) the Prieſts they bear rule by their means, and conclude, they muſt needs be truths, it being the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their reverend Fathers, as <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and the like, and it being grown in cuſtom amongſt the people, they love to have it ſo; like as the people of old, who luſted after the Fleſh-pots of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> I ſhall only particularize a few of their Traditions, and ſo paſs the firſt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, Infants Baptiſm, which never had a footing in Gods Word, nor their Cuſtom, which is of late by ſprinkling.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:170253:37"/>
                     <p>Another Tradition of Man is, their ſeparating from their antient Churches, (as they ſo call it) and make a kinde of new Garment with old Cloth; my meaning is this, that many of the beſt ſort of Prieſts (as they ſo think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, although I look upon them to be the very worſt) ſeparate from their antient Church, for all they own their Fundamentals to be true both in Faith and Practice; will not the old Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals riſe up in Judgement and condemn you, O yee wiſe Presbyters! that have learned to ſeparate from a Church true in Fundamentals (as you ſay) when Shee fails in no hing but Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance? is this not getting out of one ſhape into another, and yet ſtill hold correſpondency with the Cuſtoms of the Limes? would you not fain ſhape your ſelves into the likeneſs of the Goſpel Miniſtery, if you could? No marvel, for Sathan alſo would tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf into an Angel of Light; and thus by your Traditions, you make voyd the Commandement of Chriſt, which did not command the Miniſter of the Church of <hi>Pergamus</hi> to ſeparate from the aforeſaid Church, although
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170253:38"/>ſome of them held the Doctrin of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam,</hi> and alſo of the <hi>Nicolaitans;</hi> but that which he was to do, was to repent, and help reform. Time would bee too ſhort for me to ſpeak of your old Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, even the Cuſtoms of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and your croſſings in Baptiſms, and ſuch fooliſh tricks, which you your ſelf are almoſt aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of, although it be part of your Trade, by which you have had your living; or your Traditions, whereby you have deceived Souls for many Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Character by the which
<note place="margin">2 Char.</note> you may know a falſe Miniſter is, They are ſuch as are Men-pleaſers, they will ſpeak as great men will have them ſpeak, that thereby they may keep in favour with them howſoever; this you may ſee by <hi>Ahabs</hi> falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, in that of 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18.10. and thereby will be a means to impriſon the true, if it be poſſible, as you may ſee Verſ. 23, 24, 25. Chap. 24.20, 21. Alſo ſee it pertinent in <hi>Jerem.</hi> 27.14, 15, 16. So are alſo our corrupted Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in the time of the Goſpel; the Prieſt-hood there were the cauſe of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170253:38"/>Chriſts being taken, and the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> of the Goſpel to ſuffer; and ſo it is in our days, the Prieſt-hood get in favour with the great men of the times, and by their means the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Goſpel, and the reſt of their poor afflicted Brethren, ſuffer, both in Perſon and Eſtate, as by that Human Tradition of theirs, as namely Tithes, or forced Maintenance, which never was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God for the maintenance of a Goſpel-Miniſter.</p>
                     <p>The third Character whereby you
<note place="margin">3 Char.</note> may know the falſe corrupt Miniſters. Chriſt tells you in <hi>Matth. 7. They come in ſheeps cloathing, but inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are ravening Wolves</hi> (that is to ſay) they make the people beleeve that they are the Miniſters of Chriſt, and have great care of the Flock, <hi>but inwardly they are ravening Wolves;</hi> that is, in their hearts they intend to make a prey of the flock; ſo that their greateſt care is for to get the fleece, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they pretend great care of the flock; and they may be very well like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the falſe Prophets of Old, that the Lord complains againſt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.4. <hi>O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>thy Prophets are like the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170253:39"/>Foxes in the Deſart, yee have not gone up in the gaps, neither made up the hedges;</hi> for the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they did not care to come where there was any work for them to do, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one looked for gain in his quarter; wherefore the Lord cals thoſe Prieſts of old <hi>greedy Doggs, that will never have enough.</hi> Even ſo it is with the Prieſthood in our days, they ſtand not up in the gap to defend their cauſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſafe-guard their people (from the Wolves, as they call them) Perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture you hear them often rail in their Pulpits, but if they meet any of them that they call Wolves (although many of their flock be there preſent) they will not ſtand in the gap to defend that which they call truth; this makes it appear they are but Hirelings, and care not for the flock, but look after the fleece; ſo that let their flock be where they will, or do what they wil, if they meet with them at Shering time, it is as much as they care for.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth Character is,
<note place="margin">4 Char.</note> You may know a falſe Prophet by the ignorance of their people, they are ſuch as <hi>lead ſilly women captive, who are ever
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170253:39"/>learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> This wee may ſee by the poor National people, that go to Church (as they ſo call it) ſome forty, fifty years and upwards, and when all is done, they can ſcarce ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an account of the hope that is in them, they know not, as to ſay, their right hand from their left in the things of God.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>If it be Objected and ſaid, That it cannot be meant the Prieſts of the Nation, becauſe they that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved there, are of that ſort</hi> that creep into Houſes, which lead ſilly women captive, <hi>which the Prieſts of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion think they are not, and ſo lye not under that reproach.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> To which I anſwer, That the Scripture doth not reprove ſuch as preach in Houſes, but ſuch as creep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Houſes; but I ſhall a little ſhew you what creeping Creatures are, and that I finde are Froggs. Hence it came to paſs that the <hi>Froggs</hi> of <hi>Aegypt</hi> did not abide in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court only, but alſo they crope into his Kneading<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trougles; and I finde in the ſixteenth of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> that thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170253:40"/>ſpirits like Froggs went creeping unto the Kings of the earth, to gather them together to Battel, which hath been the trade of the Prieſt-hood all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, to beget warre in the Nation, to uſe the privateſt and ſubtileſt way to bring about their enterpriſe, which may be called ereeping; and further, though they come not much amongſt the poor of the flock in their Cottages, yet in the Houſes of the rich they will creep often enough.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing in order to the anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Objection is this, That <hi>Paul</hi> condemned not preaching in Houſes, for then he had condemned his own pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, for he preached from Houſe to Houſe often, and often in his own hired houſe, as <hi>Acts</hi> 28.30, 31. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he tells them, in Chap. 20. ver. 20. <hi>I have kept nothing back, but have ſhewed you, and taught you publickly, and from houſe to houſe.</hi> And Chap. eight, and the laſt, <hi>And in every houſe they ceaſed not to preach Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> So that they are not counted Leaders of ſilly women, that preach from houſe to houſe, or in their hired houſe, but they are Leaders of ſillly Women,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170253:40"/>that creep into Houſes, as I have afore ſhewed you. This might alſo ſerve to reprove another ſort of falſe Prophets, but I paſs, and haſten to the Fifth Character.</p>
                     <p>The Fifth Character to diſcover the
<note place="margin">5 Char.</note> falſe corrupted Miniſtery, is this, You ſhall know them by their Pride and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>In the laſt days there ſhall be thoſe who will be ſelf-lovers,</hi> and not only ſo, <hi>but proud and covetous withall, having a form of godlineſs without any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> And ſo are the Prieſthood in our time, proud, in that they love the chiefeſt Seats at the Feaſt, and greetings in the Market, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi; and their Covetouſneſs appears in this, In that they reap where they never ſow, covet the goods of ſuch as are no whit partakers of their Miniſtery, and yet notwithſtanding they will have a form of godlineſs, and make their people beleeve they leane upon the Lord, and that God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them in their worſhip, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the corrupted Prieſts of old, <hi>Mich.</hi> 3.11. <hi>The Prieſts teach for hire, and the Prophets Divine for Mony, yet will they lean upon the Lord, and ſay,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170253:41"/>Is not the Lord amongſt us? no evil ſhal come unto us.</hi> And ſo much for the Fifth Character.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">6 Char.</note> The Sixth is You ſhall known them by their implacable hatred againſt the Miniſters of the Goſpel, and the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Goſpel, they are always crying out to the Magiſtrate, a Sword, a Sword, that ſo they may bee found guilty of the bloud of the Saints, and Prophets, they being of the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſh</hi> crew; This was the diſpoſition of the falſe Prophets, and corrupted Miniſtery of old, as <hi>Lament.</hi> 4.3. they are ſuch as cauſe the bloud of the Juſt to bee ſhed in the midſt of the ſtreet; and ſo is it with the Prieſthood of our times, which nothing will ſerve their turns, had they the power in their hands, but the Lives or Liberties of the people of God; witneſs their railing at them in their Pulpits, and backbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in private, on purpoſe to ſet the people at enmity with them, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, away with them, like unto the malignity of the ſpirits of their Fathers of old, fearing, that if ſuch continue, their trade and great goods will come to nought.</p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:170253:41"/>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">7 Char.</note> The Seventh Character by which the falſe corrupted Miniſtery may be known, is, They are ſuch as take up the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery for filthy lucre ſake (that is to ſay) when they come to a people, if they will not give them ſo much by the year, they will not be their Miniſter, they leave ſmall Livings to go to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo their great and weighty Call lieth in the heavie Purſe; you ſhall ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome (or never) hear them ſay, <hi>Woe be to me if I preach not the Goſpel;</hi> (although I am in hunger and naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) but woe unto you people, if you pay me not my Tithes, I will get a Summons againſt you, and ſo lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that reproof that ſaith, He that putteth not into their mouth, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare warre againſt, ſo that <hi>they feed themſelves with the fat, and cloath themſelves with the wool, and kill them that are fed,</hi> Ezek. 34.2, 3. &amp;c. And ſo much for the Seventh Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
                     <p>The Eighth Character,
<note place="margin">8 Char.</note> whereby you may know the falſe corrupted Miniſters, is, They are ſuch as receive their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery by way of Trade, and not by way of Gift; they buy it, on purpoſe to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170253:42"/>ſell it again; if <hi>Simon Magus</hi> were in the gall of bitterneſs, who thought to purchaſe the gifts of the Holy Spirit for Mony (and yet we cannot finde that he had an intention to ſell it again) then how lye ſuch under the gall of bitterneſs, who would fain buy it, on purpoſe to ſell it again? ſo that as the Miniſters of Chriſt receive their Gift by vertue of his aſcending up on high, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8. they being under his teaching and guiding; ſo the falſe Miniſters receive their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and Teachings from <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> and <hi>Oxford</hi> by vertue of ſums of Mony, and ſo as I have afore ſaid, they have not the Miniſtery by vertue of Gifts from God, but by vertue of ſuch Human helps. And ſo much for the Eighth Character.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">9 Char.</note> The Ninth Character whereby you may know the falſe corrupted Miniſters, is, They are ſuch as their covetous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and ill-gotten goods (many times) indureth not to the ſecond Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; for the Lord hath ſaid, hee will plead both with Fathers and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; ſo that many times miſery falls upon the outward man, both to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Children, for ſuch things; you
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170253:42"/>may ſee what the Lord denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the corrupt Prieſts and Prophets of old, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>The Prieſts ſaid not where is the Lord, and they that handled the Law knew me not; the Paſtors alſo have tranſgreſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, and the Prophets propheſyed by</hi> Baal, <hi>and walked after things that did not profit; wherefore I will yet plead with you ſaith the Lord, and with your Childrens Children will I plead.</hi> So it is with the Prieſts in our times, they ask not whether the Lord be in the place, but whether there be a good Benefice, and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we ſee often times that the Lord hath ſo pleaded with them and their Children, that they have been expoſed to great want. And ſo much to the Ninth.</p>
                     <p>The Tenth and laſt Character,
<note place="margin">10 Char.</note> whereby you may know the falſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Miniſters, is, They will pretend much love to Chriſt and his Apoſtles, as though they owned their perſons and ways; but the Children of God, (ſuch as walk in Chriſts ways, which he hath left both by precept and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) they hate, revile, and perſecute, as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170253:43"/>much as in them lieth; ſo it was with the corrupt Phariſaical Prieſts and Scribes of old, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.29, 30. <hi>Woe unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, becauſe you build the tombs of the Prophets, and garniſh the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres of the righteous, and ſay, If we had been in the days of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, we would not have been parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers with them in their bloud, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yee are witneſſe to your ſelves, that yee are the Children of them that killed the Prophets,</hi> verſ. 31. Here you may take notice, that though the <hi>Phariſaicall</hi> Prieſts and Scribes of old did pretend great love to the Prophets, and righteous men that were before them, condemning their Fathers for perſecuting of them, yet you may ſee they were the men that owned a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der againſt Chriſt, and alſo perſecuted his Diſciples. It was the Prieſts that gave <hi>Judas</hi> the thirty peeces of Silver to betray his Maſter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.3. compared with 14, 15. Alſo they were the men that gave large Mony to the <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,</hi> to ſay, <hi>His Diſciples ſtole him away while we ſlept.</hi> So the Prieſts of out time, they make as if they were
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170253:43"/>friends to Chriſt and his Diſeiples, and yet they are the greateſt Agitators of the reproach and ſufferings that is brought upon ſuch as walk in that way which Chriſt and his Apoſtles have left by precept and example. And ſo much for the Tenth and laſt Character.</p>
                     <p>Now having briefly ſhewed you the Characters of the Falſe Miniſters, I ſhall come now to ſhew you the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the True, the which hath ſo great a difference from the Falſe, that they that run may diſcern it; and ſo briefly to the firſt.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Character of the true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters is as followeth. They are not only ſent by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to preach, but alſo Gifted by him, whereby they are inabled to preach at all times inſtant, in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon; they do not want a great Library of Books, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they want a weeks time to preach a Sermon, neither do they preach other mens Works, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not their Miniſtery of man, or from man, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1. but receive it as a free Gift, as you may ſee, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.8. And ſo much in brief to the firſt.</p>

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">2.</note> The Second Character whereby they are known, is, As they are Gifted by him, ſo they preach his words only, going forth with the words of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, preaching Repentance and Faith, and having thereby made Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples they <hi>Baptize</hi> them, according to the command of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go teach all Nations, and Baptize them;</hi> ſhewing clearly, that perſons muſt be taught before they are Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; it is alſo pertinent, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37, 38, 39. Chap. 8.12. verſ. 37 with many other Scriptures, which will not only prove it to be a precept of Chriſt, but alſo the practiſe of the Miniſters of Chriſt in the Primitive times; and ſo in our time; ſo they Conſtitute Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (if it may be ſo called) not by <hi>Generation,</hi> but by <hi>Regeneration,</hi> my meaning is this, That they do not make Church-Members by ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as Beleevers Seed) but by faith, and profeſſion, which doth intitle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed, and Heirs according to promiſe. And ſo much briefly to the ſecond Character.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">3.</note> The Third Character whereby they
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170253:44"/>are known, is, As they go forth with his words and Commiſſion, ſo they are contented with what Wages hee gives them; they take not up the Miniſtery for filthy Lucres ſake, but are willing to ſuffer hunger and cold, and many ſuch like things, if they are called, thereunto; they do not ask the People to whom they preach, what they will give them, but are willing to labour with their hands to ſupply their wants; this you may ſee was the carriage of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who was a Miniſter of Chriſt, and a pattern of good works to the Miniſters that ſhould ſucceed him, as you may ſee, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.33. <hi>I have coveted no mans Silver, or Gold, or Apparrel, yee your ſelves know, that theſe hands of mine have communicated unto my wants, and to them that are with me;</hi> ſo it is with the true Goſpel Miniſters in our time, they are willing to lay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out to preach the Goſpel fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in ſeveral places, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, are as willing to let their hands communicate to their wants, and to their Family, to the end they may make the Goſpel of Chriſt without
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170253:45"/>charge, and alſo not to lay a ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-blocke in the way, to cauſe them that are weak to fall; and in a word, they ſeek not the Fleece, but the Flock, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>not yours but you.</hi> And ſo much to the third Character.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">4.</note> The Fourth Character whereby you may know the true Miniſters of the Goſpel, is, They are men of the loweſt rank, and of the weakeſt capacity, or prudency in Natural things, whereby the Children of this World are wiſer in their Generation than they; therefore if you will know the true Miniſters of the Goſpel, or finde them our, you muſt not go amongſt the wiſe Rabbies of the times, but you muſt look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the weak, deſpiſed, rejected people, for in their weakneſs Chriſt hath promiſed to manifeſt his ſtrength, and hath alſo ſaid, <hi>He will deſtroy the wiſdom of the wiſe, and deſtroy the wiſdom of the prudent;</hi> you ſhall ſee theſe Scriptures in the room of many, firſt by Propheſie, ſecondly fulfilled, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. in theſe words, <hi>Out of the mouthes of babes and ſucklings thou haſt ordained ſtrength,</hi> Iſa. 28.7.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170253:45"/>Mat. 11.25. there Chriſt gives thanks, that God had begun to make good his Promiſes, ſaying, <hi>I thank thee O Lord, Father of Heaven and Earth, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed them unto babes;</hi> therefore the Apoſtle ſaith in 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Where is the wiſe? where is the Scribe? where is the diſputer of this World?</hi> Compared with Verſe 26. which ſaith, <hi>For you know, your calling Brethren, that not many wiſe men after the fleſh, nor many mighty, nor many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are called, but God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the World to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the wiſe, that no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence,</hi> verſ. 29. &amp;c. <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is written, that he that glorieth may glory in the Lord.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, That foraſmuch as Perſons are ready to ſet up the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and look ſo little at the Creator, I will now give Strength, and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Gifts to men of the leaſt account, (as in reference to Human Part) that Perſons may not attribute praiſe to the Creature, as to his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or Learning, or ſuch like things,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170253:46"/>but may attribute praiſe only to me the Creator, for the leſs fleſhly parts, or Human Wiſdom is ſeen in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the more the gifts of Gods Spirit is magnified. And ſo much of the Fourth Character.</p>
                     <p>The Fifth Character,
<note place="margin">5.</note> You ſhall know them by their being rejected of the Wiſe and Learned men of the Times, whereby they bee often in Tumults; nay you ſhall know them by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in thoſe things which others count ſhame, as you ſhall find by the carriage of the true Miniſters of old, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.40, 41. <hi>When they had called the Apoſtles, and beaten them, they commanded them that they ſhould preach no more in the Name of Jeſus, and they departed from the preſence of the Council, rejoycing, that they were counted worthy to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſhame for his</hi> name, alſo in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.4. You may ſee there how perſons prove themſelves to be Miniſters of Chriſt, in theſe words, <hi>But in all things appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our ſelves the Miniſters of God, in much patience and afflictions, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity and diſtreſs, in ſtripes, in impriſonments, in tumults, in labours.</hi>
                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:170253:46"/>So the Apoſtle, though he were in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with the chief Prieſt when hee went to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> yet no ſooner did he turn to be a Preacher of Chriſt in ſimplicity, and forſook the old <hi>Jewiſh</hi> form, but he was fain to eſcape out of their hands in a Basket out of a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, being afterwards taken, was ſmote by the High Prieſt (who once owned him) So it is with the Miniſters of our time, no ſooner do they forſake the Ceremonies of the Nation, but preſently they become a prey (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the Prieſthood of the Nation) ſo that he that runneth may read the true Miniſter from the falſe. And ſo much to the Fifth Character.</p>
                     <p>The Sixth Character,
<note place="margin">6.</note> is, They are always counted Broachers of new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Hereticks, and turners of the World upſide down, their Doctrin called Hereſie, and they Ring-leaders of the Sectaries; ſo it was in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive age, and ſo it is now; that it is ſo now the continual out-cries of the Prieſthood of the Nation againſt the Miniſters of Chriſt doubtleſs ſounds forth, or otherwiſe I ſhall willingly be corrected by the Chriſtian Reader; and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170253:47"/>that it was ſo in the Primitive time, I ſhall prove clearly, as from two or three inſtances of Scripture, in the room of many more, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.5. which ſaith, <hi>We have found this man a peſtilent fellow, a mover of ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amongst all the</hi> Jews <hi>throughout the World, and a Ring-leader of the Sects of the</hi> Nazarens, this was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 17.6. the laſt clauſe, in theſe words, <hi>Thoſe that have turned the world upſide down are come hither alſo,</hi> Acts 28.22. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Sect we know, That it is every where ſpoken againſt,</hi> Chapter 22.22. <hi>Then they lift up their voices and ſaid, Away with ſuch a fellow, it is not fit that he ſhould live,</hi> chap. 25.24. And <hi>Feſtus</hi> ſaid, <hi>King</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa, <hi>and all men that are here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with us, yee ſee this man about whom all the multitude of the</hi> Jews <hi>have dealt with me about at</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <hi>and alſo here, crying, that hee ought not to live any longer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that you may ſee plainly, that as the Miniſters of the Goſpel then were looked upon as peſtilent Fellows, and the Ring-leaders of the Sectaries in that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170253:47"/>time, by the wiſe learned <hi>Jews;</hi> ſo are the Miniſters of the Goſpel looked upon in our days, by the blinde formal people of this Nation. And ſo much to the Sixth Character.</p>
                     <p>The Seventh Character of the true Miniſters,
<note place="margin">7.</note> is, they are not aſhamed of the meaneſt ways or Ordinances of Chriſt, though they are contemptible to the Wiſe men of our times, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.11. the Goſpel Miniſters do not pick out thoſe for ſuch Doctrines as pleaſe the fancies of men, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>If I yet pleaſe men I am not the Servant of Chriſt.</hi> They preach the Goſpel in the plain mean way of it, for the which they ſuffer reproach, nevertheleſs they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, for they know whom they have beleeved, even their Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter who went before them, leaving them an example, <hi>Who turned not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his face from ſhame and ſpitting, Iſa.</hi> 50 4, 5, 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2, 3. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. So that you may know the Miniſters of the Truth by their boldneſs for the Truth, being not aſhamed to preach Chriſt in his low deſpiſed ways, at all places, where the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170253:48"/>Lord ſets a door open unto them. And ſo much for the Seventh Character.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">8.</note> The Eighth Character whereby you may know a true Miniſter, is, They ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver call for a Magiſtrate, or Temporal Lord, to incounter with their Enemies, (or more properly Chriſts Enemies) Chriſt hath prohibited them, teaching them another Leſſon, That he that taketh the Sword ſhall periſh by the Sword; ſo that the Weapons of their Warfare are not Carnal, but Spiritual; ſo that when they meet with Truths Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies they take the ſword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, and that is the Weapon by the which they put the enemies to the worſt, and by that Sword at the laſt Chriſts enemies ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.15. and this is the Magiſtrates Sword, or Champion that the Miniſters of the Goſpel (in caſe of oppoſition) fly to. And ſo much for the Eighth Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">9.</note> The Ninth Character whereby you may know a true Miniſter, is, <hi>They are not Lords over Gods heritage,</hi> that is to ſay, they will not Lord it over their fellow Brethren, neither do they deſire
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170253:48"/>the preheminence over the inferioreſt Member in the Church; they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Churches Servants, and not their Lords, they can bee content to ſuffer want, when happily the Church, or ſome of them, are fed to the full; they can be contented to bee abaſed when the Church doth abound, they make not a prey of their Flocks, they labour not to be rich; nay they can ceaſe from their own wiſdom, they can willingly be counted fools for Chriſts ſake, they ſeek not the goods of the Church, but their good; <hi>not yours but you,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.14. Much more might be ſaid as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Self-denial of the true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel, but I ſhall paſs to the Tenth and laſt Character.</p>
                     <p>The Tenth Character of a true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is as followeth;
<note place="margin">10.</note> They may bee known by the hardſhip that will follow them, by reviling, by ſcoffing, by buffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, by tumults, they ſhall be a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word in the mouth both of men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and children; for Signs and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Nation where they live, as it hath been propheſied of them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.18. <hi>I and the Children that thou</hi>
                        <pb n="80" facs="tcp:170253:49"/>
                        <hi>haſt given me, are for Signs and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> The Phraſes of Carnalmen are as followeth; What, ſuch a Fellow a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter? a Cobler, Tailor, or Tincker, and ſuch like Mechanicks, are they fit for Miniſters? Where had ſuch Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows their Learning? Are they not blind leaders of the blind, ſay the wiſe Carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts of our time? and by ſuch like terms they ſet the World in an uproar a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; Was it not ſo with Chriſt, and the true Miniſters in the Primitive time? Did not the wiſe Jews, and Scribes, and Phariſaical Prieſts deride Chriſt, and call him the Carpenter, and Carpenters Son, and wondered from whence he had his Doctrins? Did not the Wiſe learned men of the <hi>Jews</hi> call his Diſciples ignorant and unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, which knew not the Law, and were accurſed, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Chriſt did chuſe Mechanicks, as Fiſher-men, and the like, and did reject the wiſe and learned, and yet that was a hard thing to be received in thoſe days, and ſo it is in ours; and you may ſee that Chriſt was a poor Chriſt in Carnal mens account; <hi>His face was more marred than the</hi>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:170253:49"/>
                        <hi>Sons of men, he had no form nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, when any lookt upon him, that they ſhould deſire him,</hi> Iſa. 53.1, 2, 3, 4. ſo are his <hi>Ordinances</hi> and his ways mean, that if men look upon them with a Natural eye, there is no form or comlineſs; and ſo it is with the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel, as I have ſhewed you; hee calleth not the rich but the poor, not the wiſe but babes, not the learned but the ignorant, that hee may make ſuch to know Doctrin; that the wiſe men may ſtumble, and fall, and bee taken, but as it is written, <hi>He that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth let him glory in the Lord;</hi> and ſo much briefly to diſcover the falſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and the true; ſo that hee that will view this with an impartial eye, or ſingle heart, may clearly diſcern who are the true Miniſters, and who are the falſe, to that end they may not be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but may be followers of the Lamb whereſoever he goeth, that thereby they may have him to be their refuge when all falſhood ſhall be diſcovered, and the refuge of lies ſwept away.</p>

Ezek. 36.10, 11. from theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures it is very clear, That at the laſt and general return of the <hi>Jews,</hi> their Cities ſhall be built, and although they may meet with ſome difficulties after the building thereof (as I ſhall ſhew you) yet in the time of their return and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they ſhall have great aſſiſtance from God, as is clear from the current of Scripture. Moreover, although the Man of Sin ſhall trouble them after their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170253:55"/>yet it ſhall not be as afore-time, but they ſhall bee nouriſhed by God from the fierce wrath of the Dragon, and they ſhall <hi>be a Crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem in the hand of their God,</hi> Iſa. 62.3. <hi>And they ſhall call them the Holy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the redeemed of the Lord, and thou ſhalt be called Sought out, a City not forſaken,</hi> verſ. 12.

                     <p>The Firſt is from the Viſion that the Lord ſhewed <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in the time of <hi>Iſraels</hi> Captivity,
<note place="margin">1 Three Reaſons why the Temple ſhall be built a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</note> for it is uſual with the Lord to follow his people with Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſo that in the valley of <hi>Achor</hi> there may bee a door of hope; ſo the Lord dealt with <hi>John,</hi> when he was driven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Iſle of <hi>Pathmos.</hi> But to paſs to <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Viſion, Wee may take notice that in the fortieth of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Verſes, that the Lord brought <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiel</hi> in a Viſion into the Land of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170253:56"/>
                        <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſetting him upon an high Mount ſhewed him the frame of a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in the which City alſo he ſaw a man whoſe countenance was like Braſſe, and hee had alſo a meaſuring reed in his hand. Moreover, that this was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of the laſt and general return, ſee chap. 37.38. and that alſo without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> did ſee a Temple built as well as a City, as you may ſee proved already from Chap. 41.1. and verſ. 4. from which we may ſee clearly there was a Temple, and ſo as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſo I ſay now, read and conſider well the three precedent Chapters, and you ſhall ſee that it was the laſt and general return out of Captivity that there was Propheſied of; from the ſame account it is clear, That there is to be a Temple as well as a City.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> If it be objected and ſaid, That there were Prieſts and Sacrifices mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that Prophecie, to that I anſwer, and ſay, It is true, but after the <hi>Jews</hi> return out of their Captivity, they ſhall wait for their Meſſiah in their Sacrifices, untill ſuch time as the Man of Sin ſhall ſpoyl them, and take it away, and place up abomination in the room, for I
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170253:56"/>cannot finde from Scripture that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall be converted by a Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preaching, although I know the two Witneſſes ſhall prophecy one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days. Now that theſe two Witneſſes ſhal preach Goſpel-Ordinances, or a Crucified Chriſt, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and faith to the <hi>Jews,</hi> in ſuch a manner and way as he was,
<note place="margin">The <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall not be converted by a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</note> or is preached to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that I much queſtion, for as much as I ſee not the Scripture making good ſuch a thing, but in many places doth croſſe ſuch an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as to my underſtanding, for the Lord Chriſt ſaid, They ſhould ſee him no more till they ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; as for the Goſpel they are enemies for your ſake, but as touching Election they are beloved for the Fathers ſake, for the Gifts and Callings of God are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance;</hi> So that when they ſee the Lord come in the Clouds, even the great King that they lookt for, then they ſhall know that it was he that they and their Fathers have rejected, as well as <hi>Peter</hi> knew <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> which he never ſaw before; ſo that at that time the Spirit of Prayer and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170253:57"/>ſhall be poured out, and they ſhall mourn. So when the Redeemer cometh to <hi>Sion,</hi> at that time ſhall tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion be turned from <hi>Iacob,</hi> Matth. 23.39. Rom. 11.25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33. verſes, Iſa. 27, 6. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare verſ. 9. chap. 25.7, 8, 9. Zech. 12.10. Moreover if it ſhould be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of me, What ſhall be the work of the two Witneſſes? I anſwer, That their work will bee to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the <hi>Iews</hi> againſt the ſlights of the Man of Sin, that ſhall affirm him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be the Chriſt, and diſſwade the <hi>Iews</hi> from beleeving in him, reviving thoſe old Prophecies which have been in obſcurity by reaſon of the miſ-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the people to whom they were made,
<note place="margin">The work of the Witneſſes to prove the Man of Sin to be the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, and not the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah that they look for.</note> for doubtleſſe the <hi>Iews</hi> at this time do earneſtly expect their King, and ſhould they not have ſome to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them, and to expound the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, or Propheſie of them, It is very like they might do ill enough, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially becauſe of that great appearance of the Man of Sin, what by his great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the falſe Signs that ſhall bee wrought by his falſe Prophets, that ſhall cauſe Fire to come down from Heaven
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170253:57"/>in the ſight of men, to deceive them that dwell upon the earth, ſo that their work will not be to preach Ordinances, but to prove that the great perſon that then ſhall be exalted amongſt them, is not the Chriſt that they look for, but the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, or the vile Perſon, or the firſt Gog, or the Man of Sin, though he have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Names, yet is he but one Perſon, which was fore-told by <hi>Enoch</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth from <hi>Adam,</hi> and alſo by <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> and <hi>Daniel, Eſay</hi> and <hi>Joel,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> which was to ſtand up in the laſt days, and alſo fall upon the Mountains of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and ſo I ſhall paſſe both from the Anſwer to the Objection, and the firſt Reaſon, and come to a Second, to ſhew you why there is to be a Temple built, as well as a City.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond Reaſon is, becauſe <hi>Iohn</hi> in his Revelation ſaw a Temple, and was to meaſure it, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.1, 2, 3. in theſe words, <hi>And there was given to me a Reed like unto a Red, and the Angel that ſtood by ſaid, Ariſe, and go meaſure the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, and the Altar, and thoſe that worſhip therein, but the Court which is without the Temple leave out,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170253:58"/>and meaſure it not, for it is given into the hands of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly City ſhall be trod under foot forty two Months.</hi> Hence you may alſo ſee there was a Temple, which Temple <hi>Iohn</hi> was to meaſure; now, that this was a Prophecie of the laſt times, is clear from verſe 18. and as the text reads it, the Court without leave out and meaſure not; the antient Tranſlations read it, the inner Court, or the Court within the Temple, leave out, and meaſure it not, for it is given into the hands of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> and the Holy City ſhall they tread under foot forty and two Months, the which if ſo, it may appear to us clearly, That before the <hi>Iews</hi> have finiſhed their inward Court, which is the Holieſt of Holieſt, the Man of Sin will take it out of their hands, and ſpoyl them of the injoyment of it, for the term of forty two Months, which is three years and a half, upon the account of thirty days to a Month, the which time and times, and half a time, the travelling Woman will be drove into the Wilderneſs, and the remnant of her ſeed perſecuted, and this vile Perſon ſhall then ſet up his Image, which ſhall by the power of the Devil,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170253:58"/>
                        <hi>ſpeak, and cauſe as many as will not worſhip the Image of the Beaſt to bee killed,</hi> Revel. 13.13, 14, 15. chap. 16.14. but ſome have expounded this place thus, and have ſaid, <hi>The outward Court is the Ordinances that were not to be meaſured, that is to ſay, not to be accounted of, ſo as to be practiſed, and the Holy City was the Church which was to be trod under foot;</hi> to which Expoſition, I ſay, That I never could finde God in Scripture comparing the Goſpel-Ordinances to an outward Court, it is well if they can finde it who do affirm it; neither do I find in the New Teſtament where the Goſpel-Church is compared to a Holy City; Chriſt hath compared it to a City, but the word Holy is not uſed in that place; but doubtleſs this Holy City ſpoken of here, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. is meant <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which in Scripture is frequently called a Holy City, as you may ſee if you peruſe theſe Scriptures following, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.3. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.13. <hi>Chap.</hi> 48.2. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Obadiah</hi> 6. <hi>Zephany</hi> 3.11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Chap.</hi> 27.53. So that it will appear, that the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſpoken of in <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.1. was the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170253:59"/>Temple of that beloved City, or Holy City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is alſo as clear that it was a Prophecie of the laſt times, if we compare <hi>Ezekiel</hi> with it; ſo that both <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>John</hi> in their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of the Prophecie of the laſt times, do ſhew, that there was a Temple as well as a City; and ſo I ſhall paſs to the third and laſt Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>The Third Reaſon why there is to be a Temple at the laſt and general return of the <hi>Iews,</hi> is from the words of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> unto the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> where the Apoſtle ſaith, That the Man of Sin ſhall ſit in the Temple of God, which Temple is the glorious holy Mountain before mentioned, even the Temple <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.45. and that this Temple, and the Man of Sin, is to be in the laft Age, is clear, for the Man of Sin is to be deſtroyed, ſaith the Apoſtle, by the brightneſs of his coming, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.9, 10, 11, 12. until the which time of Chriſts coming he ſhall aſſume to make the Temple the Throne of his Glory; and ſo theſe are the three Reaſons in brief why there ſhall bee a Temple built as well as a City; Firſt, becauſe the Lord
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170253:59"/>ſhewed <hi>Ezekiel</hi> a Temple after the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the dry Bones, which was the laſt return of the Captives.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He ſhewed <hi>John</hi> one, and appointed him to meaſure it in his Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And,</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, By the revelation of the Holy Spirit ſaith, the Man of Sin ſhall make his Seat there, and hold it till Chriſt comes. Moreover, the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Lord that was looked for ſhall ſuddenly come into his Temple.</hi> And ſo much briefly, to prove that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall return again to build their City and Temple.</p>

Moreover, this vile Perſon, or Man of Sins riſe, is with all deceiveableneſs, and unrighteouſneſs, fair words, and feigned ſpeeches, deceiving the hearts of the ſimple; and before hee cometh to bee this Eighth and laſt King, he is but a Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Horn, full of eyes, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.7, 8. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Knowledge and Light in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of God, and yet at laſt he hath a mouth given him to ſpeak great words againſt the God of Heaven. The very manner of his ariſing doth declare him to be a great Perſon at the laſt, for at his firſt ariſing three of the Ten Horns were
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170253:60"/>plucked up by the root, that is, three Kingdoms do fall before him, or are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned up into his hands, and ſo grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth great, and by that means he cometh to be one of the Seven that ſhall rule the whole Monarchy, and ſhall not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with that, as I have ſhewed you, but by his power ſhall take away the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Six parts, and ſo changing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment from the hands of ſeven into one, he is called the Eighth, and of the Seventh, and ſo ſhall remain till the Son of Righteouſneſs ſhall diſmiſs his Reign, by caſting him off into the <hi>Lake of fire,</hi> Dan. 7.8. compare verſe 24. ch. 8.25. <hi>Revel.</hi> 17.11. He ſhall ſucceed in time the raiſer of Taxes, but they ſhall not give him the power or honour of the Kingdom, but by flattery ſhall he obtain it, not by a joynt conſent of the people of the Province, but ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Power and Authority by a ſmal number of people. And when hee hath entred into the fatteſt place of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince he ſhall break League, Covenant, and Proteſtation, and work deceitfully; yet to carry on his deſign hee ſhall do that which his Father hath not done, nor his Fathers Father; for by ſtirring
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170253:61"/>up of his courage and valour, hee ſhall take much riches out of the Southern Country, and to get the affections of thoſe people of the Province where hee liveth, he will ſcatter the Prey amongſt them, to the end that his Army may grow great, that thereby he may take ſtrong Holds, and ſenced Cities; and this is the very way whereby hee ſhall grow great, and be helped forward, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted into the Throne, even in the holy Mountain, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.24, 25. ver. 43.45. and ſo by his Victories hee ſhall grow great, and exalt himſelf, and at laſt exalt himſelf above God, and ſhall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the god of Forces, that is, look upon the power of his Army, to be the great Power, that is to ſay, by his own ſtrength he hath obtained that which hee doth injoy, and ſo ſhall puff out great ſwelling words of vanity againſt the God of gods, acknowledging no other God but himſelf, and ſhall place his Throne above the Stars of Heaven; for the proof of it, ſee theſe Scriptures as followeth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.36, 37, 38, 39. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Revel.</hi> 17.11. compare fourteen, Alſo to carry on his deſign, hee

Great <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was a lively Type of this laſt and great Enemy of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for we may finde that hee had many Magicians which did many lying Signs and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to harden the hearts of his People, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.11, 12. So hath the Man of Sin a falſe Prophet, as I have ſhewed you before, and alſo in his Province many that can work by Magick Art, which love to be in Kings Courts, as <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> Magicians did; and that there ſhall be lying Signs or Wonders in that time, ſee theſe few Scriptures in the room of more, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.25. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.24. <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.14, 15, 16.

                     <p>If it ſhould bee Objected and ſaid,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170253:62"/>That this is meant of the <hi>Romiſh Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> I ſhall give you three Reaſons by the which you may ſee that the Man of Sin, or the laſt Antichriſt before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, is not the <hi>Romiſh Babylon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt is,
<note place="margin">The Man of Sin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not to be the Romiſh <hi>Babylon;</hi> by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowfng.</note> becauſe in Scripture the Lord gives the <hi>Romiſh Babylon</hi> the name of a Woman, but in all places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he calleth the laſt and great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt by the name of a Man; and I will prove theſe two in order, the which will make good the firſt Reaſon. <hi>Come down and ſit in the duſt, O Virgin daughter of</hi> Babylon, <hi>thy nakedneſs ſhall be uncovered, thy ſhame ſhall be ſeen, I will take vengeance, and will not meet thee as a man,</hi> Iſa. 47.1, 2, 3. See more verſ. 9. <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.8. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.16, 17, 18. Chap. 3.4, 5. See more, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17.4. <hi>And the Woman was arrayed in Purple and Scarlet, upon her fore-head was a name written, Myſtery,</hi> Babylon <hi>the Great, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Harlots, and abominations of the earth,</hi> verſ. 5. <hi>And I ſaw the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man drunken with the bloud of the Saints, and Martyrs of Jeſus,</hi> verſ. 6. See more, Chap. 18.3, 4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.18, 19. And the next thing to prove is, That
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170253:62"/>the Antichriſt is called by the name of Man, as you may ſee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.12. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare 16. <hi>How art thou fallen from Heaven, thou Lucifer, Son of the Morning? how art thou cut down to the ground, thou that didſt weaken Kingdoms?</hi> They that ſee thee ſhall narrowly look upon thee, and conſider thee, ſaying, Is not this the man that made the Earth to tremble, that did ſhake Kingdoms? And ſo as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures did fore-ſee that he would aſſume to himſelf ſuch a Power, was pleaſed to ſtile him by the name Man, as you may ſee in the Scriptures following, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.17. <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.24. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3. From theſe Scriptures you may ſee, that the laſt Beaſt, which is the Antichriſt, is called by the name Man, and that the <hi>Romiſh Babylon</hi> is called by the name Woman. And ſo I paſs to the ſecond Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The great and laſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, or the Man of Sin, cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the <hi>Romiſh Babylon,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Romiſh Babylon</hi> did, and doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God, and his Son Chriſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they worſhip him in a falſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but the great and laſt Antichriſt
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170253:63"/>acknowledgeth no God, neither will he Worſhip any, but exalt himſelf above every god &amp; acknowledgeth no God but himſelf, who ſhall bee then the God of Forces, and as the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith of him, <hi>The King ſhall do what hee liſt, hee ſhall exalt himſelf againſt all that is God, and ſhall ſpeak marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous things againſt the God of gods, and ſhall proſper till the wrath be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, for the determination is made,</hi> Dan. 11.36, 37. 2 Theſ. 2.4. Dan. 7.8. Jude 5. From hence you may ſee, that this laſt and great Antichriſt ſhall advance himſelf above every god, not acknowledging the God of Heaven; but the <hi>Romiſh Babylon</hi> as aforeſaid, doth acknowledge a God, and Worſhip him, though in a falſe manner. And ſo much briefly to the ſecond Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>The Third and laſt Reaſon why the great and laſt Antichriſt may not be took for the <hi>Romiſh Babylon,</hi> is, becauſe the <hi>Romiſh Babylon</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed by the ten Horns of the laſt Beaſt, that is to ſay, by Ten Kings that have ſupported her; or in a word thus, That the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Babylon</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed before the appearance of Jeſus Chriſt, but the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170253:63"/>great and laſt Antichriſt ſhall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed until the Lord Jeſus come and deſtroy him upon the Mountains of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew you in his time, and place. And now to prove that the <hi>Romiſh Babylon</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the coming of Chriſt, you ſhall ſee it out of <hi>Revel.</hi> 17.16. <hi>And the Ten Horns that thou ſaweſt upon the Beaſt, ſhall hate the Whore, and make her deſolate and naked, and ſhall eat her fleſh, and burn her with fire, for God hath put it into their hearts to fulfil his will, and agree, and give their Kingdom unto the Beaſt, until the words of God ſhall be fulfilled,</hi> verſ. 17. <hi>And the Woman that thou ſaweſt is that great City that reigneth over the Kings of the earth.</hi> And you may alſo ſee more from <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.9. and more might be added, but this to prove brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That the <hi>Romiſh Babylon</hi> ſhall bee deſtroyed before the coming of Chriſt, by the Ten Horns that ſupport the Beaſt, for which cauſe the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Merchants, (viz.) her Clergy, and the Kings of the Earth, ſhall weep for her, and luſt after her, although the Beaſt ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power them, and make them deſtroy
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170253:64"/>her; but the Heavens ſhall rejoyce over her, and the Holy Apoſtles (that is the Churches then in being, and the Goſpel-Meſſengers) ſhewing clearly, That the <hi>Romiſh Babylon</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the appearance of Chriſt, <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> 18.19, 20.</p>
                     <p>The next thing to prove is, That the Man of Sin, or that great and laſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, is to remain until the coming of Chriſt; ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, That the Lord ſhall deſtroy him with the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his coming. And ſo ſaith <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.9, 10, 11. Chap. 11.41. compare Chap. 12.1, 2. <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.19, 20. ſo from theſe Scriptures you may ſee plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That the Man of Sin ſhall remain till the very time that Chriſt ſhall take his great Power and Reign; ſo that neither of theſe Opinions can bee true, that ſaith, That the <hi>Romiſh Babylon</hi> is the Antichriſt, or that ſaith, That the laſt and great Antichriſt is riſen, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready paſt. So thus I have proved the laſt Antichriſt not to be <hi>Babylon.</hi> A word or two to prove him to bee called the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> or the King of <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> and that you may ſee, the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> hath the title of both in the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170253:64"/>Chapter, and verſe fourth, in theſe words, <hi>Thou ſhalt take up this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb against the King of</hi> Babylon, <hi>and ſay, How hath the Oppreſſor ceaſed? how hath the golden City ceaſed? the Lord hath broken the ſtaffe of the wicked, and the ſcepter of the Ruler,</hi> verſ. 5. <hi>He who ſmote the people with a continual ſtroak, he that ruled the Nations in anger, is per ſecuted, and none hindereth,</hi> verſ. 6. So here we ſee he is called the King of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and in verſe 24, 25, 26. in theſe words, <hi>The Lord of Hoſt hath ſworn ſaying, Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I have thought ſo ſhall it come to paſſe, and as I have purpoſed it ſhall ſtand, that I wil break the</hi> Aſſyrian <hi>in my Land, and upon my Mountains tread him under foot, then ſhall his yoke depart from them, and his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den depart from off their ſhoulders.</hi> This is the purpoſe that is purpoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole Earth. Hence you may ſee, that he is alſo called the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> and that you may ſee it is meant the laſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt before ſpoken of, from the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Verſe of the ſame Chapter, and fifteenth. And ſee more, <hi>verſ.</hi> 32. in theſe words, <hi>What ſhall one then anſwer
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170253:65"/>the Meſſengers of the Nations, for the Lord hath founded</hi> Sion, <hi>and the poor of the people ſhall truſt in it.</hi> And that foundation in <hi>Sion,</hi> or <hi>Sion</hi> ſo founded, ſo as it may bee an object for the people to truſt in, which will not bee until the Lord Jeſus is laid as a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ſet as a King upon the Holy Hill of <hi>Sion;</hi> and then the poor of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall truſt in him, and lye down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhadow of his wings in peace, and none make them afraid; and ſomuch brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as to the diſcovery of the manner of the riſe of the Man of Sin, and alſo for the proving of him not to be the <hi>Romiſh Babylon,</hi> and ſo paſs briefly to the Third, which is the diſcovery of the taking of the City and Temple from the <hi>Jews</hi> for a ſmall time.</p>

                     <p>Chriſtian Friend, here is that, the conſideration whereof is ſufficient to bear up thy ſpirit in the worſt of times, it was that which made the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> not

                     <p>The firſt is, That Chriſt ſhall reign as King on the Earth, even in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, That the Saints ſhall have an high Prerogative, ſo as to reign on earth, even as Chriſt. And</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, I ſhall put theſe two toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with ſome other conſiderable par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, ſhewing you that Chriſt and the Saints Dominion ſhall be alike, and that they ſhall reign alike, they being joynt Heirs of one and the ſame King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom alike, only hee in all things ſhall have the preheminence; and ſo I paſſe to the firſt, That Chriſt ſhall have a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom on earth, and in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> This we may ſee the Angel did declare, or make known unto the Virgin, ſaying, <hi>For loe, thou ſhalt conceive in thy Wombe, and bear a Son, and thou ſhalt call his name Ieſus, he ſhall hee great, and he called the Son of the</hi>

                     <p>The ſecond thing is to prove, That the Saints alſo ſhall receive a Kingdom, and reign on earth.

                        <hi>Tribes of</hi> Iſrael. Whereunto he adds alſo another ſentence in the Apocalyps, very pertinent to the proof of this, ſaying, <hi>He that overcometh, and keepeth my works to the end, I will give him power over the Nations, and hee ſhall rule them with a rod of Iron, and ſhall break them like a Potters Veſſel, even as I have received of my Father,</hi> Luke 22.28, 29, 30. Revel. 2.26, 27, 28. From hence wee may ſee, that as the Lord gave unto his Son Jeſus, a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in reference to his Sufferings, and his obedience unto him; even ſo Jeſus the Chriſt will give his people a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in reference to their ſufferings, and obedience to his will; and that this is to be on Eatth I ſhall give you a plain text, even as ſaith the Spirit of Chriſt in theſe words, <hi>And they ſung a new Song, ſaying, Thou art worthy to take the Book, and to open the Seals thereof, becauſe thou waſt killed, and haſt redeemed us to God, by thy bloud, out of every Kindred, and Tongue, and People, and Nation, and haſt made us to our God Kings and Prieſts, and we ſhall reign on the earth.</hi> Moreover, they ſhall injoy that Sovereignty ſo long
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170253:76"/>as the Sun and Moon indures, for ſo ſaith the Lord, by his Prophet, in theſe words, <hi>And in the days of thoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms ſhall the God of Heaven ſet up a Kingdom that ſhall never be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and this Kingdom ſhall not be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to another people, but it ſhall break and deſtroy all theſe Kingdoms, and it ſhall ſtand for ever, and the Kingdom, and Dominion, and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Kingdom under the whole Heavens ſhall be given to the Saints of the moſt High, whoſe Kingdom is an everlaſting Kingdom, and all people ſhall ſerve and obey him,</hi> Dan. 2.44. Cap. 7.27, 28. Revel. 5.10. from theſe Scriptures we may ſee, that the Saints ſhall injoy a Kingdom, in the which they ſhall reign, and rule the Nations with a rod of Iron; ſo that the wicked ſhall be as aſhes under the ſoals of their feet. And this Kingdom alſo we ſee is to be held on earth, neither can there be any other interpretations given upon theſe Scriptures without great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe to the plaine meaning of the Spirit in theſe Scriptures. If it be objected and ſaid, That theſe Scriptures beſpeak, or fore-ſhew the flouriſhing condition of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170253:76"/>the people of God, while they live in this corrupt Tabernacle of fleſh, I ſhall deny, and make this anſwer, That it is the portion of the Saints (nay all of them) to ſuffer in this Life, and the nigher the appearance of Jeſus Chriſt, the greater ſhall the ſuffering be, ſo that through many tribulations they ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.21. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Acts</hi> 14.22. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Rev:</hi> 6.9, 10, 11. and many more Scriptures I might give as to the proof of this, for there ſhall bee ſuch Trials for the godly, that ſhould not the days be ſhortened, no fleſh would be ſaved, but the Lord ſhall cut the work ſhort in righteouſneſs, ſo that when his people are in great trouble, then he ſhall ſtand up as a Deliverer, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.21.22. View well theſe Scriptures, and you ſhal ſee that that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is falſe, that affirmeth, That the Saints ſhall flouriſh in ſuch a condition before mentioned, while they live in this corrupted Tabernacle of fleſh; and ſo I paſs to the Third Particular, ſhewing you how Chriſt and the Saints, ſhall reign together in the Kingdom, and ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the words of the Apoſtle, which
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170253:77"/>ſaith, that the Saints are joynt-heirs with Jeſus Chriſt, in theſe words, <hi>If Sons then Heirs, Heirs of God, and Joynt-heirs with Chriſt, if ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may bee glorified together,</hi> Rom. 8.16, 17. Now we know a Joynt-heir is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual ſharer, or when two are made alike in the injoyment of one thing, for ſo faith the Apoſtle, <hi>Now are we the Sons of God, but it doth not appear what we ſhall be, but when he ſhall appear wee ſhall be made like him,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.1, 2, 3, 4. they ſhall be like him in Glory, in Majeſty, in Honour; in a word, every way like him, only he in all things ſhall have the preheminence. Moreover, I ſhall adde a plain text of Scripture, in the which we ſhall ſee that the Saints and Chriſt ſhall reign together, in theſe words, <hi>Bleſſed and holy is he that hath part in the firſt Reſurrection, for on ſuch the ſecond Death ſhall have no power, but they ſhall be the Prieſts of God, and of Chriſt, and reign with him a thouſand years.</hi> The which alſo agreeth with the words of the Prophet, that ſaith, <hi>A King ſhall reign in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and Princes ſhall decree
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170253:77"/>Judgement, and Saviours ſhall come up of Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>and judge the Mount of</hi> Eſau, <hi>and the Kingdoms ſhall be the Lords,</hi> Revel. 20.6. Iſa. 32.1. Obadiah 21. therefore <hi>let the Saints be joyful in glory, let them ſing aloud upon their beds, let the high praiſe of God be in their mouthes, and a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged ſword in their hands, to execute vengeance upon the Heathen, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment upon the people, to bind the Kings in chains, and the Nobles in fetters of Iron, that they may execute upon them the Indgement that is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, this honour have all the Saints, praiſe yee the Lord;</hi> ſo that <hi>it is a faithful ſaying, if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo reign with him,</hi> Pſal. 149.5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 2 Tim. 2, 12. So having ſhewed that Chriſt and the Saints ſhall reign together unanimouſly; I ſhall alſo ſhew you that excellent peace that there ſhall be in the time of his reign through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Earth, as ſaith the Prophet, <hi>The whole Earth is at reſt and quiet, they ſhall break forth into ſinging, the Mountains and Hills ſhall bring peace unto the people, by Juſtice hee ſhall judge the poor of the people, and he ſhall
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170253:78"/>ſave the Children of the needy, and ſubdue the Oppreſſors, they ſhall fear thee ſo long as the Sun and Moon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth, from generation to generation; he ſhall come down like the raine upon the new-mowen Graſſe, and as the ſhowers that water the earth, in his days ſhall the righteous flouriſh, and abundance of peace ſo long as the Moon indureth; his Dominion ſhall be from ſea to ſea, and from the rivers to the ends of the earth, and they that dwell in the Wilderneſs ſhall kneel before him, and his enemies ſhall lick up the duſt; in that day it ſhall be ſaid, wee have a ſtrong City, ſalvation hath the Lord appointed for Walls and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works; open yee the Gate that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Nation that keepeth the truth may enter in; thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whoſe minde is ſtayed on thee, becauſe he truſteth in thee,</hi> Iſa. 14.7. Pſal. 72.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Iſa. 26.1, 2, 3. From hence wee may ſee, what great peace there ſhall be in the term of Chriſts reign; there is good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why there ſhall be ſuch great peace, upon theſe two accounts; the firſt is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Devil ſhall be bound, and ſhall
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170253:78"/>not ſtirre up Nations to Warre, which is his practiſe when he is looſe. The ſecond Reaſon is, Becauſe that at the great deſtruction of God, (the Great Antichriſt) all the Weapons of Warre ſhall be burnt, and thoſe that remain which were not brought up to Warre upon the Mountains of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſhall bee converted into other ſervice; namely, <hi>Their Swords ſhall be beat into Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares, and their Spears into pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-hooks, for Nation ſhall not riſe up againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learn warre any more,</hi> Ezek. 39.9, 10. Iſa. 2.4. Mich. 4.3. Revel. 20.3. From hence it comes to paſs, that the people in that day <hi>ſhall be led forth in peace, and the Mountains ſhall break forth before them into ſinging, then ſhall the Law go forth out of</hi> Sion, <hi>and the Word of the Lord out of thy</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem; then ſhall the ſaying be made good that is written, <hi>All thy Children ſhall be taught of God, and great ſhall be the peace of thy Children.</hi> So that <hi>be will extend peace to her like a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and the glory of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>like a flowing ſtream,</hi> Iſa. 2.3. cap. 54.13. cap. 55.12. Iſa. 66.10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170253:79"/>Pſal. 127.7. and. 125.5. Nah. 1.15. and ſo I ſhall leave theſe Scriptures, and the Fourth, and paſs to the Fifth thing in order, which is to ſhew you the people whom Chriſt and the Saints ſhall thus rule with a rod of Iron, and that is the ungodly, even ſuch as have afflicted the people of God, and the Sons of them who have afflicted the people of God, for ſo ſaith the Prophet, <hi>The Sons alſo of them that afflicted thee ſhall come bending unto thee, and all they that deſpiſed thee ſhall fall down at the ſoals of thy feet, and they ſhall call thee the City of the Lord, the</hi> Sion <hi>of the holy one of</hi> Iſrael. Agreeing with that of <hi>Malachy, To you that fear my Name ſhall, the Sun of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ariſe with healing under his wings, and yee ſhall grow forth like Calves in the ſhall, and yee ſhall tread down the wicked, for they ſhall be like duſt under the ſoals of your feet, for thus ſaith the Lord, after this glory hath he ſent me unto the Nations which ſpoyled you, for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of mine eye, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I will lift up my hands upon them, and they ſhall be a ſpoyl to their
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170253:79"/>Servants, and yee ſhall know that the Lord of Hoſt hath ſent me. Sing and rejoyce, O Daughter of</hi> Sion, <hi>for I will come and dwell in the midſt of thee, faith the Lord,</hi> Mal. 4.2, 3, 4. Zech. 2.8, 9, 10. Hence you may ſee, that the enemies of God and his people ſhall be ſubdued by Chriſt, and the Saints, like as the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> of old were ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when they came out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> ſo ſhall all the ungodly <hi>Aegyptians</hi> be ſpoyled at the laſt, as you may ſee, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Cap.</hi> 11.2. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.1, 2, 3. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> was to go out of the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the Lord commanded them to <hi>ask every one of his Neighbour jewels of Silver and jewels of Gold, and the Lord gave them favour in the ſight of the AEgyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> ſo that they did obtain what they demanded; by the which the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> were inriched by the ſpoyl of the <hi>Aegyptians;</hi> and ſo it ſhall be at that day, with the people of God, they ſhall injoy the ſpoyl of their enemies, for they are the true Heirs to the riches of the World preſent, and that which is to come, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Math.</hi> 19, 29. So that <hi>they ſhall eate
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170253:80"/>the riches of the</hi> Gentiles, as alſo ſaith the Scriptures, <hi>Yee ſhall be named the Prieſts of the Lord, and men ſhall call you the Miniſters of our God, yee ſhall eat the riches of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and be exalted with their glory,</hi> Iſa. 61.6. Here we ſee, that the Lord is pleaſed to give them the riches of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> (that is to ſay, the riches of Sinners) that <hi>although they heap up Silver like the duſt, and raiment like the clay, yet the juſt ſhall put it on, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent ſhall divide the Silver, ſo that their gain ſhall be conſecrated to the Lord, and their ſubſtance unto the Lord of the whole earth; therefore ſhall thy Gates be open continually, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day nor night ſhall they be ſhut, that men may bring unto thee the riches of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>that thy Kings may be brought for the Nations, and Kingdoms that will not ſerve thee ſhall pariſh, and thoſe Nations ſhall utterly be deſtroyed,</hi> Job 27.16, Iſa. 60, 11, 12. Cap. 66.11. Zech. 14.14. Revel. 21.24. From hence we may ſee, that riches, and glory, and honour, and a Kingdom, nay and Crowns alſo, ſhall be caſt down before
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170253:80"/>Chriſt, and the Saints which ſhall be at their ſteps. King <hi>Solomon</hi> in his glorious Reign was a lively Type of King Jeſus in his glorious Reign, and we know in King <hi>Solomons</hi> Reign there was great plenty of riches and glory, ſuch as was not in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> before or ſince; and that there ſhall be ſo in Chriſts Reign, was ſet out by thoſe who came from the Eaſt to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to worſhip Chriſt, which when they had found him, opened their Treaſures and preſented Gifts, Gold, Myrrhe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.11. which ſhews to us, That when the Lord is King in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> how perſons ſhall come from the utmoſt parts of the Earth, to ſubmit to Chriſts and the Saints royal Dignity, and preſent unto them the choyceſt of riches, which agreeth to the Scriptures before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; ſo having diſcovered that Chriſt and his Saints ſhall reign in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and of that excellent peace and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty that they ſhall injoy in their time, with riches, and the glory of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> I paſs now unto the Seventh Particular, which is the deſcription of the <hi>New Jeruſalem.</hi>

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170253:82"/>written thereon, which are the names of the twelve Tribes of the Children of</hi> Iſrael; <hi>on the Eaſt three Gates, on the North three Gates, on the South three Gates, and on the Weſt three Gates; and the wall of the City had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve Apoſtles of the Lambe, and he that talked with me had a golden reed to meajure the City and the Gates thereof, and the wall thereof, and the City lyeth four ſquare, and the length is as large as the breadth, and he meaſured the City with the reed twelve thouſand Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, and the length, and the breadth, and the height of it are equal, and he meaſured the wall thereof an hundred forty and four Cubits, according to the meaſure of man, that is of the Angel, and the building of the wall of it was of Jaſper, and the City pure Gold, like unto clear Glaſs, and the foundations of the wall of the City were garniſhed with all manner of precious Stones; the firſt foundation was Jaſper, the ſecond Saphir, the third Chalcedonie, the fourth an Emerauld, the fifth Sardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix, the ſixth Sardins, the ſeventh
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170253:82"/>Chryſolite, the eighth Beryl, the ninth Topas, the tenth Chryſophraſus, the eleventh a Jacinth, the twelfth an Amethyſt; and the twelve Gates were twelve Pearls, every ſeverall Gate of one Pearl, the ſtreets of the City were pure Gold, as it were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Glaſs; and I ſaw no Temple therein, for the Lord God Almighty, and the Lambe were the Temple of it; and the City had no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to ſhine in it, for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lambe was the light thereof, and the Nations of them that are ſaved ſhall walk in the light of it, and the Kings of the North ſhall bring their glory and honour into it, and the Gates of it ſhall not be ſhut at all by day, and there ſhall be no night there, and they ſhall bring the glory and henour of the Nations into it; there ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatſoever worketh abomination, or maketh a Lye, but they which are written in the Lambs Book of Life, Rev.</hi> 21.10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27. From hence we may take notice of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170253:83"/>the ſplendency of this glorious City, and the excellency of the foundations; and doubtleſs this was the City that our bleſſed Father <hi>Abraham</hi> looked for, when he did ſo diſ-regard his native Country, and Fathers houſe, that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook it, and was a Sojourner in the Land of Promiſe, a ſtrange Land, as he is recorded of in the Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> in theſe words, <hi>By faith he abode in the Land of Promiſe as in a ſtrange Country, as one that dwelt in Tents with</hi> Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>as heirs of the ſame Promiſes, for he looked for a City having a foundation, whoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and builder is God,</hi> Heb. 11.9, 10. From hence we may ſee, that God did ſhew <hi>Abraham</hi> that glorious City, <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> that afterwards hee and all the faithful ſhould inherit for their Poſſeſſion, the which he did ſee by faith, <hi>for faith is the evidence of things not ſeen, and the ground of things ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for;</hi> ſo that his hope being ſo firm in that Inheritance that he ſhould injoy, it made him ſet light of all earthly inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances, <hi>And they that ſay ſuch things, declare plainly that they ſeek a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, wherefore God is not aſhamed to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170253:83"/>be their God, for he hath prepared for them a City,</hi> Hebr. 11.14. Compare ſixteen. And certainly that City that hath foundations whoſe maker and builder is God, the which alſo God hath ſaid he hath prepared, is the very City that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw come out of Heaven from God, which ſhall be the place of Chriſt, and the riſen Saints reſidence, which doth agree with the words of the Spirit of Chriſt, that faith, <hi>Hee that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh I will make a Pillar in the Houſe of my God, and he ſhall go no more out, and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the City of my God, which is</hi> New Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, <hi>which cometh down out of Heaven from my God, and I will write upon him my new name,</hi> Revel. 3.12. So that hence we may ſee, that as God gave his earthly Son (which is <hi>Adam</hi>) at the firſt an earthly Paradiſical Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or Situation, ſo he gave his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Son, that heavenly Man, a heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Paradiſical inheritance, or ſituation, which is no other than the <hi>New Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> ſituated upon the new Earth; and that this <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> is not Heaven it ſelf, as ſome do conceive, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170253:84"/>it be heavenly) is clear, for Chriſt faith, it ſhall come out of Heaven from his God, and it is the dwelling place of Chriſt, and the Saints, until the Mediatorſhip ſhall be delivered up into the hands of the Father; but when Chriſt ſhall deliver up the Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip unto the Father, then they ſhall be inveſted into the higheſt degree of glory. And having ſhewed you a brief glimps of the glory of the <hi>New Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> I ſhall give you ſeveral Reaſons why that <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> that ſhall be built upon her own heap by the <hi>Iews</hi> at their return, is not the <hi>New Ieruſalem</hi> which mention is made of in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.12. chap. 21. and ſo to the firſt Reaſon, which is;</p>
                     <p>1 Becauſe that the City <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> that is to be built at the <hi>Iews</hi> return, ſhall be built by mens hands, as alſo faith the Prophet, <hi>And they ſhall build the old waſt places, and raiſe up the former deſolations, and they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the City that was deſolate, and waſt for many Generations, and the Sons of Strangers ſhall build thy walls, and their Kings ſhal miniſter unto thee.</hi> And that this is a Prophecy of the laſt
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170253:84"/>and general return, you may ſee, for the text faith, <hi>They ſhall not build and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inhabit, but they ſhall long injoy the work of their own hands,</hi> Iſa. 60.10, 11. cap. 61.4. cap. 65.21, 22, 23. From which Scriptures you may ſee, that that City in the which the <hi>Iews</hi> ſhall inhabit, is built with hands, but the <hi>New Ieruſalem</hi> mentioned <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. chap. 21. ſhall be built without hands, as you may ſee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.10. So much to the firſt Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Reaſon is, becauſe the materials of the <hi>New Ieruſalem</hi> is Gold, and Silver, and precious Stones, and Pearls, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.18, 19, 20. but the materials of the other <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> is Wood, and ſuch like, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 41.16.</p>
                     <p>The third Reaſon is, becauſe in the <hi>New Ieruſalem</hi> there was no Temple, but the glory of God, and the Lambe was the light of it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 20. but in the other <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> there was a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 41.14, 15. <hi>Reve.</hi> 11.1. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.4.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Reaſon is, becauſe in the <hi>New Ieruſalem</hi> we finde mention of no trees but the Tree of Life only, <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> 22.2. Cap. 2.7. but in the other
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170253:85"/>
                        <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> there was every Tree good for food, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.12.</p>
                     <p>The fifth Reaſon is, becauſe in the <hi>New Ieruſalem</hi> there ſhall be no need of the Sun, nor Moor, for God is the light of it, neither ſhall there bee any night there, Revel. 21.23. Compare Chap. 22, 5, but in the other <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> there ſhall be night and day, and thereby there ſhall bee an account of years; they ſhall have the uſe alſo of the Sun, and the Moon, in which time they ſhall have their perfect ſtrength, ſhining forth moſt excellent in their ſplendor, as you may ſee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.26.</p>
                     <p>The ſixth Reaſon is, becauſe that the <hi>New Ieruſalem</hi> ſhall come down out of Heaven from God, as I before have ſpoken, as faith the Scripture, <hi>And I</hi> John <hi>ſaw the</hi> New Jeruſalem <hi>come down from God out of Heaven, prepared as a Bride for her Husband,</hi> Revel. 21.1. That is, it was a City lacking no reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or beautifying, but it was ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trimmed, decked, and beautified, which is called by the Spirit, trimmed as a Bride for her Husband; but the other <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> wanted both re-edifying, trimming, and beautifying. And ſo brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170253:85"/>I have given you a review of that <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> and have proved it not to be that <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> that ſhall be built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her own heap. I have ſhewed you alſo it cannot be meant Heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it came down from God out of Heaven; neither can it bee meant the Saints, as ſome have ſuppoſed it becauſe the Saints are ſaid to walk in the ſtreets of it, which <hi>ſtreets are pure gold like to clear glaſſe;</hi> the Saints alſo are ſaid to have the name of it written in their fore-heads, <hi>but there ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any that defileth, or maketh a lye, but ſuch as are written in the Lambs Book of Life.</hi> The which ſheweth (and much more I could ſpeak to it) that it is a material City, yet not Heaven it ſelf, though hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, as I have ſaid; neither cin it be the Saints, but the City that the Saints ſhall enter into. Bleſſed and thrice hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are they that have their portion in it. And ſo I paſs to the Eighth Particular.</p>

From theſe words wee may take notice, that the Creatures with Man ſhall be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from that groaning condition which they were made ſubject to by reaſon of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, and that there ſhall be a perfect reſtoration of all Creatures, unleſs it be the Serpent, and ſuch men as live and dye in the ſtare of unbelief, and thereby deprive themſelves of that good which otherwiſe they ſhould injoy. But for the better underſtanding of this truth, I ſhall divide the Creation into three parts, that is to ſay, the Creature Man, the creature Beaſt, and the creature Earth, and ſhall treat of them in order.</p>
                     <p>And firſt of the Creature Man, that he ſhall be reſtored unto that Primitive
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170253:87"/>ſtate, that is to ſay, all manner of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to be done away, as namely, Sickneſs, Weakneſs, Faintneſs, Lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Blindneſs, and all other things that are as Corruptions, or defections in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and then ſhall the ſaying be made good that is written by the Prophet, <hi>Then ſhall the eyes of the blinde be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the eares of the deaf unſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, then ſhall the Lame man leap as an Hart, and the tongue of the dumbe ſhall be looſed; for in the Wilderneſs ſhall waters break out, and rivers in the Deſart; neither ſhall the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Land ſay, I am ſick, and the people that are therein ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given their iniquities,</hi> Iſa. 32.24. cap. 35.5, 6. they ſhall not dye in their nonage, in that juncture of time, but ſhall live an hundred years old without frailty in Naure, whereby they ſhall ſee their Childrens Children in great peace, as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>There ſhall not be thence an infant of days, or an old man that hath not filled his days, but the childe ſhall dye being an hundred years old, but the Sinner being an hundred years old ſhall be accurſed;</hi> even ſuch as do not ſubmit to that great King Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,

                        <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.20. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.12. ſo that the weakneſs, and corruptions, and frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Nature ſhall be clear taken away, ſo that thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> that live in the fleſh, (and others, which is to ſay the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> who alſo are living at that time in the fleſh) ſhall not dye by reaſon of any malady over-coming their Nature, but by vertue of Gods appointment, in that ſet time before mentioned; the envie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the Sons of men ſhall depart away, ſo that one ſhall not envie another as afore-time, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.13. And ſo I ſhall briefly paſs to the ſecond thing.</p>
                     <p>Which is, That the Beaſts of the field ſhall alſo bee reſtored from the bondage of their corruption, into that liberty that they did injoy in the time of <hi>Adams</hi> innocency; the envie of them alſo ſhall be taken away, ſo that the Lambe and the Kid ſhall lye down in peace with the ſavage Beaſt, the Lion ſhall not deſtroy the Lambe, neither the Leopard the Kid. There was a lively Type of this thing in <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark, and ſo ſhall it be when Jeſus Chriſt the Ark (that is to ſay, the ſafety of his people) is lifted up as an Enſign in the Nations, for ſo ſaith the Prophet, <hi>With righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170253:88"/>ſhall be judge the poor, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove with equity, for the meek of the earth, and he ſhall ſmite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips ſhall bee ſlay the wicked, and righteouſneſs ſhall be the girdle of his loyns, and faithfulneſs the girdle of his reins; the Wolf alſo (hall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard ſhall lye down with the Kid, and the Calf, and the young Lion and the fatling together, and a little childe ſhall lead them, and the Cow and the Bear ſhall feed the young ones, and lye down together, and the Lion ſhall eate ſtraw with the Oxe, and the ſucking Childe ſhall play on the hole of the Aſp, and the weaned Childe ſhall put his hand on the Coskatrice Den, they ſhall not hurt or deſtroy in all my holy Mountains, for the earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 11.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Cap. 65.25. Hence you may ſee, that there is a time wherein the Creatures ſhall be reſtored into the Primitive ſtate; for in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of <hi>Eden,</hi> in the which they were firſt placed, they lay down in peace, and did not deſtroy each other. The reaſon
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170253:88"/>why they did deſtroy one another after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was, becauſe of the Curſe that <hi>Adam</hi> brought upon the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the tranſgreſſion of the Law of God Hence it cometh to paſs, that the Creature Man deſtroyeth one another, and the Creature Beaſt, but in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it was not ſo, neither ſhall it be ſo in the time of the perfect Redemption, as is clear from the fore-mentioned Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>But if it ſhould be objected and ſaid, That this is meant by the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing ſtate of the Church while they remain in this Tabernacle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> To which I anſwer, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved, That all or every one of the godly ſhall ſuffer perſecution in this Life, that although many ſhall run to and fro in the laſt days, and be purified and made white, yet the wicked ſhall do more wickedly, and ſhall wear out the Saints of the moſt High, ſo as there ſhall be ſuch troubles as there hath not been ſince there hath been a Nation upon the Earth, inſomuch that if the Lord ſhould not ſhorten theſe days, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten his coming, no fleſh ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.21. cap. 8.31. cap. 11.35.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170253:89"/>cap. 12.1. &amp; 10. Matth. 24.21, 22. Acts 14.22. 2 Tim. 3.12. Rev 6.11. Rev. 12.17. Rev. 13.7. and ſo I ſhall leave theſe Scriptures to be peruſed, and paſs to the third Particular.</p>
                     <p>The third Particular is, That the Earth alſo ſhall receive her ſtrength to bring forth, as in its Primitive time, that is to ſay, before it was Curſed, by reaſon of the tranſgreſſion of Man, as alſo ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Inſtead of thorns ſhall come up the Fir-tree, and inſtead of the Brier ſhall come up the Mirtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, and it ſhall be to the Lord for a name, an everlaſting ſign that ſhall not be cut off, then ſhall he give thee rain of thy ſeed that thou ſhalt ſow the ground withall, and bread of the increaſe of the earth, and it ſhall be fat and plentious; in that day ſhall thy Cattel feed in large Paſtures, the Oxen likewiſe, and the young Aſſe that ear the ground ſhall eate clean Provender, which hath been winnowed with a Shovel and with Fan, and there ſhall be upon every Mountain, and upon every high Hill, rivers and ſtreams of water in the day of the great ſlaughter, when the Towers fall. Moreover, the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170253:89"/>light of the Moon ſhall be as the light of the Sun, and the light of the Sun ſhall be ſeven-fold, as the light of ſeven days, in the day that the Lord bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up the breach of his people, and healeth the ſtroke of their wounds,</hi> Iſa. 55.13. Chap, 30.23, 24, 25, 26. From hence we may ſee, that the earth ſhal be reſtored unto her Primitive purity, for thus ſaith the Lord concerning it in the Prophecie of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>For the Lord ſhall comfort,</hi> Sion, <hi>he will comfort her waſt places, and he will make her Wilderneſs like</hi> Eden, <hi>and her Deſart like the Garden of the Lord, and they ſhall ſay, this Land that was deſolate is become like the Garden of</hi> Eden, <hi>and the waſt, and deſolate, and ruined Cities are become fenced, and as inhabited. The Wilderneſs and the ſolitary places ſhall alſo bloſſom as the Roſe, I will open Rivers in high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Fountains in the middeſt of the Valley, I will make the Wilderneſs a pool of water, and the dry Land ſprings of water, I will plant in the Wilderneſs the Cedar, the Shittah-tree, and the Mirtle, and the Oyl-tree, and I will ſet in the Deſart the Firre-tree,</hi>
                        <pb n="162" facs="tcp:170253:90"/>
                        <hi>and the Pine, and the Box-tree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Moreover, <hi>The Plow-men ſhall overtake the Reapers, and the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Grapes him that ſoweth Seed, and the Mountains ſhall drop down ſweet wine,</hi> Amos 9.13. Iſa. 41.18, 19, cap. 35.1, 2. Ezek. 36.35. Iſa. 51.3. From hence we may ſee, that the earth ſhall be reſtored into its Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive purity.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>But if it be Objected and ſaid, That here is mention made of Plowing and Reaping, and therefore cannot be a perfect redemption. To the which I anſwer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, That <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf when he was in his Innocency was to dreſs the Garden, and to receive the fruit thereof; and whether or no this were not ſuch an imployment as might keep the Garden in ſuch a capacity, as whereby he might receive the fruit from it, I leave the Reader to judge, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.15.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As I have already ſaid, That there are ſome that will deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their tranſgreſſions, the which the Prophet ſaith ſhall be their Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.5. and Vine-dreſſers. Moreover I ſay, That the ſtrength of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170253:90"/>their nature ſhall be ſuch, that nothing that they do ſhall or can be a burden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, but ſhall be a pleaſure unto them; like unto a man walking in his Garden, and taking off a degenerate Plant, which is no burden unto him, but rather his pleaſure, for in the time of that perfect Redemption there ſhall be no kinde of weakneſs or faintneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by any thing that they ſhall do will be a burden, as ſaith the Lord, <hi>In that day ſhall the Lord defend the inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and ho that is feeble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them at that day ſhall bee as</hi> David, <hi>and the Houſe of</hi> David <hi>ſhall be as God, as the Angels of God before him,</hi> Zech. 12.8. Iſa. 40.29, 31. And ſo much to the Objection, and to the Eighth Particular, and ſo I ſhall paſs to the Ninth, which is the ſigns of the times of the accompliſhment of theſe Prophecies.</p>

                     <head>The Signs of the times of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of theſe Prophecies.</head>
                     <p>Doubtleſs the Lord hath not hid from his Servants thoſe things that he will do in the latter days, nor the time when
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170253:91"/>they ſhall be performed, though the day and hour knoweth no man, no not the Angels, yet the times and ſeaſons may be known by the ſigns. Moreover, it is lawful and commendable for the people of God to look into the Signs of the times, for as much as we ſee the Lord Jeſus Chriſt reprove ſuch as do not, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>O yee Hypocrites, yee can diſcern the face of the sky, but cannot diſcern the ſigns of the times,</hi> Matth. 16.3. therefore I ſhall briefly give you ſome few ſigns, that ſhall be as it were the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of the Day of Chriſt, or the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Watch, and ſo to the Firſt in order.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Sign of the ſecond coming of Chriſt, is the unſetledneſs of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Nations of the earth, the Government ſometimes here, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there, ſometimes in the hands of one, and ſometimes in the hands of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, men much ſtriving for Honour and Kingdoms; in the midſt of thoſe days ſhall God ſet up his Kingdom that ſhall never be deſtroyed; and that the earth ſhall be thus unſetled, reeling to and fro, is clear from the Word of the Lord which ſaith, <hi>The earth ſhall reel to and fro like a drunken man, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170253:91"/>like a Tent, and the iniquity there of ſhall be heavie upon it, ſo that it ſhall fall and ariſe no more, then ſhall the Sun he aſhamed, and the Moon confounded, when the Lord ſhall reign in Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>and in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his antients gloriouſly; at which time the little ſtone hewed out of the Mountain without hands ſhall become a great Mountain, and fill the whole earth,</hi> Dan. 2.35, and ver. 44. Iſa. 24.20. compare 23. From whence we may ſee, that the unſetledneſs of Nations and Kingdoms upon the earth, and ſtriving for Honour, and change of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is a lively ſign of the ſecond co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Lord Jeſus to be near.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Sign of the coming of Chriſt, Is by the abounding of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or iniquity in the World, as now we ſee it in a great height, even by ſuch as are worn out in their expectation, or waiting for Jeſus Chriſt, who did not like that good condition that they were put in, but having departed from the Faith, and are given up unto all manner of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs. O the ungodly Practices, and horrid Blaſphemies that are now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in <hi>England,</hi> what by abuſing the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170253:92"/>worthy name of God, ſpeaking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully of him, and his Son Chriſt, and ſlighting thoſe Laws and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are given forth to be practiſed till his ſecond and great coming, with the abuſing of themſelves in uncleaneneſs and Luſts of the fleſh, amongſt which they contend for the community of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which is none of the leaſt of their Uncleaneneſſes, and make themſelves worſe than the ſavage Beaſts. Of that ſort are the rude <hi>Ranters,</hi> and the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous <hi>Quakers,</hi> the which have caſt off Civil Humanity, and this generation of men are the men that will cauſe the Lord to ariſe, and take vengeance upon the earth, for ſo ſaith the word of the Lord, in theſe words, <hi>And</hi> Enoch <hi>alſo the ſeventh from</hi> Adam <hi>Prophecied of theſe, ſaying, Behold, the Lord co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth with ten thouſand of his Saints, to execute Judgement upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly amongſt them of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodlily committed, and of all their hard ſpeeches which ungodly Sinners have ſpoken against him.</hi> So that we may ſee, that the Lord will ſend his Son in flaming fire againſt all ungodly
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170253:92"/>men, but chiefly they that walk after the Luſt of the fleſh in uncleaneneſs, as hee once did deſtroy the world, and ſuch like Sinners with an over-flowing Floud, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Jude</hi> 4. compare 14, 15. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare 10. cap. 3.3. compare 10. See al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo verſ. 7. From hence you may ſee, that that ungodly generation of men that are now in the World, is a lively ſign of Chriſts coming. And ſo I paſs briefly to the third.</p>
                     <p>The Third ſign of Chriſts coming, Is the Echo or ſound of theſe two things in the World, as namely, the Preaching of the Goſpel about in the Nations, and the Warres, and rumours of Warres that do accompany it, for when theſe two things go together, then Chriſt ſaith the end is very nigh; and although the Goſpel have been preached before in a private way, that is to ſay, in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Nation, or privately in that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet never was the Goſpel preached to Nations and Rulers as it is in our days.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>If it ſhould be Objected and ſaid. That the Goſpel hath been prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in Nations a great while by
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170253:93"/>the Miniſtery of the Nation? To which I anſwer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> That as the Congregations of the Nation was never called a Church of Chriſt, nor her Teachers the Miniſters of the Goſpel, neither hath that kinde of Doctrine which they have preached been called the preaching of the Goſpel; If it ſhould be demanded of me, what it is, I ſhould anſwer to them in their particuler order; Firſt, the National Church is called by the name of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Nation, which is a borrowed word from Chriſts Church, <hi>Yee are a City ſet upon an Hill,</hi> Mat. 5.14. Rev. 16.19. and that this City of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is meant the National Church is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhall begin to decay and ſink, and ſhall alſo be deſtroyed at the time that <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall come in remembrance before God, whereby ſhe ſhall receive the Cup at his hands; for the Nations, or the National Church, hath been ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is, and ſhall be, with the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or pollutions of <hi>Romes</hi> Doctrine, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.7, 8. Again, if you ſhall ask me what the National Miniſters are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Scripture, I ſhall ſhew you as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, they are called Merchants of the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170253:93"/>Earth, or the Angels of the Waters; now the word Angel ſignifieth Miniſter, as <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.20, and the Waters ſignifie Nations, for ſo ſaith the Spirit, <hi>The Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that thou ſaweſt are Multitudes, Nations, and Tongues,</hi> Rev. 17.15. ſo it is clear, that the Angels of the Waters are meant the Miniſters of the Nations, ſo that they are neither called Miniſters of Chriſt, nor Miniſters of the Goſpel, but the Miniſters of the Goſpel are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by another name in the ſame place, even the Angel of the Altar, and that Chriſt is our Altar is clear, ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.7. Thirdly, Why their Preaching is not called Goſpel-preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, although they make uſe of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, is, becauſe they teach for Doctrine the Traditions of their Fathers; and the Apoſtle calleth not ſuch Goſpel-preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but ſaith to the Galathians, <hi>I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel that you are ſo ſoon moved away from him that called you into the grace of Chriſt unto another Goſpel, which is not another, but there are ſome that trouble you, and would pervert the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 1.6, 7. ſo that thoſe perſons that do pervert any of the ſayings of Chriſt, according to Scripture
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170253:94"/>account, cannot be called the Miniſters of the Goſpel, nor their Preaching Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preaching, which the Miniſters of our Nation have done, that is to ſay, ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Commands of Chriſt with their Traditions, and ſo cannot be meant that Goſpel-preaching which ſhall bee the fore-runner of Jeſus Chriſt; but that the Goſpel ſhall be preached again in the plain way of it, that is to ſay, in the way which Chriſt appointed when hee aſcended up on high, is clear, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth and laſt Sign of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming of Jeſus Chriſt, is thoſe falſe Signs and Miracles that ſhall bee wrought by the falſe Prophets, for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before the coming of Chriſt there will be a Generation of men that will deny the way and Ordinances of the Goſpel, becauſe they are not accompanied with Miracles, and ſo ſhall deny the power of the Word. The Devil ſeeing this, hee ſhall impower the falſe Prophets, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſhall do great Signs and lying Wonders, to deceive by multitudes all incredulous perſons, who will beleeve a lying Sign before they will beleeve that Word that was confirmed by Signs; for
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170253:94"/>when perſons do not like to retain God in their knowledge, God is pleaſed to ſend them ſtrong deluſions to beleeve a Lye; and that there are many ſuch now in our days that have denied the Truth that once they owned, and are grown to ſuch a height as that they do ſhew many lying Signs; if any ſhal queſtion the truth of this, let them but go to <hi>London,</hi> and go to thoſe Meetings that they call the <hi>Quakers</hi> Meetings, and they ſhall ſee it apparently enough. But now to prove that falſe Signs, and lying Wonders before-runners of Chriſts coming, ſee from theſe Scriptures following, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Cap.</hi> 24.24. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.13, 14. <hi>Cap.</hi> 16.14, 15. Friends, I ſhould adde ſome more Signs of Chriſts coming, as the gathering together of the <hi>Jews</hi> into their own Land, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly might eaſily be proved, did we but underſtand the conſultation that there is amongſt them, but the returning of the Fleet from the <hi>Straights</hi> will give us more certain intelligence as to that thing; and ſo I ſhall leave theſe few Signs unto your conſideration, and paſs to the Tenth and laſt Particular.</p>

                     <p>Chriſtian Reader, I having ſhewed you what excellent injoyment the Lord hath laid up for his people, even for ſuch as ſeek him, as for hidden treaſure. Sith the Lord hath ſet before thine eyes ſuch a Kingdom, and ſuch an Immortal Crown of Life, be exhorted to run with patience the race that is ſet before you, What if though troubles do beſet a Chriſtian life, yet theſe <hi>light afflictions which are but for a moment, work in us a farre more and exceeding weight of glory.</hi> Dear Chriſtian, be of the minde of the worthy Apoſtle, that counted all things as dung and droſs in compariſon of the excellent knowledge of his Chriſt, reckoning that the ſufferings of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time were not worthy to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the glory that ſhall be revealed. See, thy bleſſed Saviour hath led thee an example of ſufferings, <hi>Who for the joy that was ſet before him, indured the Croſs, deſpiſed the Shame, and is nowſet down at the right hand of the Father.</hi> I ſay, conſider him who indured ſuch
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170253:95"/>Buffetings, ſuch Crowning with Thorns, nay ſuch ſpitting on, <hi>and yet turned not away his back from the ſmiter, nor his cheek from him that plucked off the hair,</hi> Iſa. 50.6. 2 Cor. 4.26, 27, 28. Rom. 8.17, 18. Heb. 12.2, 3. Again in the ſecond place, let me exhort thee to ſtand always upon thy watch, for the Day of Chriſt, or the day of thy Diſſolution is a very uncertain day, for as it was in the diſſolution of the old World, ſo ſhall it be in the coming of Chriſt; for the day before the Floud, they are, they drank, they married, and gave in Marriage, until the Floud came and took them all away. Even ſo was it with the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> they continued in their ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity until the wrath of the Almighty broke out, and there was no remedy. Moreover, when <hi>Lot</hi> fore-warned his Sons in Law of the Wrath of God upon the City, he ſeemed to them as one that mocked, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.14. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.37, 38, 39, 40. Moreover the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That the Day of the Lord ſhall ſo come as a Thief in the night, that when they ſhall ſay peace and ſafety, then ſudden deſtruction cometh upon them, as tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel upon a Woman with Childe, and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170253:96"/>they ſhall not eſcape,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.1, 2, 3. So, foraſmuch as the Day of the Lord is ſo uncertain, let us labour for a watchful Spirit, for it is a duty of a very high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, both from the example of the Saints that have gone before, and from a command of our bleſſed Saviour and his Apoſtles, as you may ſee from theſe Scriptures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 21.5. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.42. <hi>Cap.</hi> 25.13. <hi>Mar.</hi> 13.33, 34, 37. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.31. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.13. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.6. The Apoſtle alſo gives two maine Reaſons to urge Chriſtians to thar duty of watchfulneſs; the firſt is from this conſideration, That the end of all things is at hand, in theſe words, ſaying, <hi>The end of all things is at hand, watch and be ſober,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.7. The ſecond Reaſon is, becauſe ſaith he, <hi>your Adverſary the Devil like a roaring Lion runs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, ſeeking whom he may devour; whom reſiſt be ſtedfaſt in the faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. the Spirit of God lays down the danger that will follow ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſaith, <hi>If thou ſhalt not watch, I will come upon thee as a Thief, and thou ſhalt not know, whenever I will some upon thee,</hi> Revel. 3.3. <hi>therefore</hi>
                        <pb n="175" facs="tcp:170253:96"/>
                        <hi>bleſſed is he that watcheth, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Garment, leſt he walk naked, and they ſee his ſhame,</hi> Revel. 16.15. Therefore, for as much as it is a duty of ſuch concernment, let us labour to watch, to the end we may know the Signs of the times, ſo as that they overtake us not as a Snare, whereby we be deprived of that glorious Crown that is ſet before us. And ſo I paſs to the ſecond Uſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Uſe</hi> 2.</note> Be informed, Chriſtian Reader, of the vanity, or emptineſs of all injoyments, unleſs ſuch injoyments as ſhall be brought at the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt at that day, under theſe two conſiderations; The firſt is, The inſtability, or breviouſneſs of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. Secondly, from the little peace, or Soul-ſatisfaction they ſpeak to a Soul when they do injoy them, and ſo to the firſt thing conſiderable, which is the inſtability, or breviouſneſs, or ſhort continuance of the injoyments of all things below that inheritance. We ſhall take notice firſt of the Wiſe-mans words that ſaith, <hi>Wilt thou ſet thine eyes upon that that is not, verily riches make themſelves wings and fly towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, riches are not for ever, and the</hi>
                        <pb n="176" facs="tcp:170253:97"/>
                        <hi>crown of them doth not indure to every Generation; for as we brought nothing into the World, ſo it is certain we ſhall carry nothing out, ſo that every man walketh in a vain ſhow, getting goods, knowing not who ſhall injoy them; and thus ſpending their days in wealth, in a moment go down to the Grave, and his bones being full of the Sins of his youth, which ſhall lye down with him in the duſt,</hi> Job 20.11. Cap. 21.13. Pſal. 39.6. 1 Tim. 6.7. Job 1.21. Prov. 23.5. Cap. 27.24. From hence we may ſee, that we have no continuing City here, but all our in joyments are very brevious and full of frugality; ſo that we are like unto Dreaming men, that dream they injoy much, and wake, and behold they have nothing. So it is with all men that have not aſſurance of that Kingdom to come, that Riches and Honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, although they may have much riches in this world, yet when the Lord ſaith, <hi>Return you children of men,</hi> they return to duſt, and be as if they had not been, and all the riches that they have injoyed is but to them a Dream, as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>How are they brought to deſolation, as at a
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170253:97"/>moment, they are utterly conſumed with terror, as a Dream when one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waketh; ſo Lord when thou awakeſt, thou wilt despiſe their Image,</hi> Pſal. 73.19, 20. Heb. 13.13. Pſal. 90.3, 4, 5, 6. Again, wilt thou ſet thy heart upon honor, that is as vain as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: <hi>for men of high degree are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and men of low degree are alike, when they are put in a ballance they are altogether lighter than vanity; their inward thoughts is, that their houſes ſhould continue for ever, and their dwelling pleces unto all generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they call their Lands after their own names: nevertheleſſe man being in honor abideth not, but is like the beaſt that periſheth, this their way is their folly, yet their poſterity approve their ſayings, like Sheep they are laid in the grave, Death ſhall feed on them, and the upright ſhall have dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them in the morning, and their beauty ſhall conſume in their graves from their dwellings, though while he live he bleſs himſelf, and men will praiſe thee when thou doeſt well to thy ſelf, he ſhall go to the generation of his Fathers, and never ſee light, the</hi>

                        <hi>man that is in honor and underſtandeth not, is like the beaſt that periſheth.</hi> Pſal. 49. 11, 12, 13, 14. compared with 18. Again, wilt thou ſet thy heart on pleaſure, that is vain, and but for a moment; therefore <hi>Moyſes</hi> did chooſe rather to ſuffer afflictions with the people of God, than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the pleaſure of Sin for a ſeaſon: knowing aſſuredly, that thoſe that live in pleaſure were dead while they lived, and ſo were an ill ſavor in the noſtrils of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5, 6. and ſo having ſhowed you the inſtability, and the breviouſneſs of all the things of this life, I ſhall alſo ſhow you the vanity, and the little peace that they ſpeak to a Soul here, or at the great day of Account, but rather trouble and vexation of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; as you may ſee from the words of him that had the greateſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that ever any before or ſince had, as you may ſee by the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of what he did injoy, in that which followeth, <hi>I ſaid in my heart, Go too now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleaſure, and behold this alſo is vanity. I ſaid of laughter,</hi>
                        <pb n="179" facs="tcp:170253:98"/>
                        <hi>it is madd, and of mirth, what doth it? I ſought in my heart to give my ſelf to Wine, yet acquainting my heart with Wiſdom, and to lay hold on Folly till I might ſee what was that good for the Sons of men, which they ſhould doe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Heavens all the dayes of their life. I made me great works, I buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me houſes, and planted me vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, I made me gardens and orchards, and planted trees in them of all kinds of fruits, I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that brought forth trees, I gat me ſervants, and maidens, and had ſervants born in my houſe; Alſo I had great poſſeſſions of great and ſmall Cattel, above all that were in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>before me, I gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me alſo ſilver and gold, and the peculiar treaſure of Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I gat me men-ſingers and women<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingers, and the delights of the Sons of men, as Muſical Inſtruments, and that of all ſorts; ſo was great, and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed more than all that were before me in</hi> Ieruſalem, <hi>alſo my wiſdom remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with me, and whatſoever my eyes deſired, I kept nothing from them, I withheld not my heart from any Joy,</hi>
                        <pb n="180" facs="tcp:170253:99"/>
                        <hi>for my heart rejoyced in all my labour, and this was my portion of all my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor; then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that I had laboured to do, and behold all was vanity, and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the Sun; for riches profit not in the day of wrath, but righteouſneſs deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth from death,</hi> Prov. 11.4. Fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſt. 2.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. From hence you may ſee, and many more Scriptures that might be added, the vanity and non-profit (as well as the brevity) of all the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, below that excellent inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that ſhall be given to the Saints at the appearance of Ieſus Chriſt, and therefore gird up the Ioins of your mind, and hope to the end. And ſo I paſs to the Third Uſe.</p>
                     <p>The Third ſhall ſerve to reprove,
<note place="margin">3 <hi>Uſe.</hi>
                        </note> thou art reproved poor Soul, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou art, that art ſo fooliſh, that haſt a priſe put into thy hands, and doeſt not ingage thy heart to make uſe of it, the Lord will reprove thee at his appearance, becauſe thou haſt not made uſe of that Talent he gave
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170253:99"/>thee, and will command that thou ſhalt be bound, and be caſt into ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter darkneſs, where there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. O let that ſad preſident of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau</hi> be a warning unto thee, the which when he had ſold his birth-right, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when he would have inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited the bleſſing, he was rejected, and found no place of repentance, though he ſought it carefully with tears. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.26, 27. <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40. From hence we ſee, that perſons are reproved that do ſo much hunt after the enjoyment of the world, ſo that they thereby loſe their heavenly inheritance; More you may ſee alſo from the words of our bleſſed Saviour, wherein he reproveth an ungodly generation of men, that ſtrive to be rich in this world, when they are not rich in the graces of God, he ſaith, <hi>Thou Fool, this night ſhall thy Soul be required of thee, and then whoſe ſhall all thoſe be that thou haſt labourea for?</hi> Luke 12.16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. See more in the Parable, <hi>But Abraham ſaid, Son re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member

From which words we may ſee, that ſuch as delight more in the enjoyments of the things of this life, then they doe in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for Chriſts ſake, and the Goſpel, looking at that glorious Kingdome that ſhall come, when <hi>Abraham, Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and all the holy Prophets, and all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Saints ſhall enter into that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of glory, they ſhall be caſt out to utter darkneſſe, and baniſhed from the preſence of God and the holy Angels for ever, <hi>Matt.</hi> 8.11. 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 13.42, 43. So we may ſee ſuch Souls are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of reproof, which when the Lord hath beſtowed a Talent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and given them time and means of grace, and yet doe not ingage their hearts to make uſe of it. And ſo I paſs to the fourth Uſe.</p>
                     <p>The fourth uſe is a word of cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">4 <hi>Uſe.</hi>
                        </note> that I ſhall deſire thee, Chriſtian
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170253:100"/>Reader, to lay to heart, which is no other than the ſame that our bleſſed Saviour gave to his Diſciples in theſe words, <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, leſt at any time your hearts be overcharged with ſurfeiting, and drunkenneſſe, and the cares of this life, leſt that day come upon you unawares, for as a ſnare it ſhall come upon all them that live upon the face of the whole earth; Watch ye therefore and pray always, that ye may be counted worthy to eſcape thoſe things that ſhall come to paſſe, and stand before the Son of man.</hi> Luke 21.34, 35, 36. What a ſad thing will it be for Souls that are not prepared for their great Bridegroom, when the noiſe ſhall be made, the Bridegroom comes? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take heed of careleſſe ſecurity: <hi>Take heed, watch and pray, for thou knoweſt not when the time is.</hi> Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>Bleſſed is that ſervant, that when the Lord comes is found watching.</hi> Mat. 25.13.

                     <p>5ly; The fifth uſe is an uſe of dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; In order to the attaining of this heavenly inheritance, firſt ſeek it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and above all things in the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170253:101"/>world, and then I can aſſure thee thou ſhalt find it, the which if thou doſt find, it will fill the cloſet of thy Soul with glorious and durable riches; for proof of this, that thou ſhalt find it, and that thou ſhalt be made rich by it; ſee <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.17, 18, 19. 20. in theſe words; <hi>I love them that love me, and thoſe that ſeek me early ſhall find me, riches and honour are with me, yea durable riches and righteouſneſſe; My fruit is better than gold, yea fine gold, and my revenue than choice ſilver; I lead in the way of righteouſneſſe in the midſt of the paths of judgement, that I may cauſe thoſe that love me to inherit ſubſtance, and I will fill their treaſure;</hi> So that thoſe that ſeek firſt the kingdom of Heaven, and the righteouſneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and ſeek it as hidden treaſure, that is to ſay, above all things in the world, without doubt the Lord will riſe and rain everlaſting righteouſneſs upon ſuch ſouls <hi>Hoſea</hi> 10.12. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.3, 4, 5. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.33.

                     <pb n="185" facs="tcp:170253:101"/>
                     <p>The ſecond way to attain to this inheritance may be obſerved from the wiſe Merchant man, who, when he had found the Pearl of great price, ſold all that he had to gain that price; ſo alſo muſt thou, when thou ſeeſt an excellency in Jeſus Chriſt, thou muſt break off thy ſins by righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and part with all that is near and dear unto thee, for he that comes to Chriſt, and hates not Father and Mother, Wife and Children, Lands and living, nay and his own life, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be his Diſciple; not that I mean that thou ſhouldſt hate the perſon of thy Father, or thy Mother, or Wife, or Children, and the like, neither did Chriſt mean ſo in that ſpeech of his, but to caſt them out of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections when they come in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Chriſt, but ſtill to honour and reſpect their perſons, though ſlight their counſel, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.26, 27. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.34, 35, 36, 37, 38. ſo that this is the ſecond way to attain this Heavenly inheritance or Pearl of great price: Thirdly as thou muſt forſake all, and break off thy ſins by righteouſneſle, ſo thou muſt increaſe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170253:102"/>in thy piety and virtues, thou muſt not ſtand ſtill, but thou muſt add to thy Faith, Virtue, Knowledge, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Patience, and Godlineſſe, for ſo an entrance ſhall be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred into his heavenly Kingdom. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. ſo that from hence thou mayſt ſee, that the way or means to enter into that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly inheritance, is to grow in grace, not to ſtand ſtill, not be luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm, not to have a name to live, and be dead, but to excel in virtue.</p>
                     <p>The fourth: and laſtly as thou muſt ſeek that inheritance above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things, and as thou muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all things for the attainment of that precious inheritance, when thou haſt found it, ſo as to part with all, and break off thy ſins by righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and as thou muſt alſo grow in Graces, adding to thy Faith, Virtue, and ſo forth: So in the fourth and laſt place thou muſt goe on, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere till death, not turn back, or be weary, or faint in thy mind, for that is the way to inherit that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inheritance, even that immortal crown of life, and to ſit down with

                     <p>The ſixth uſe is a uſe of inducement
<note place="margin">6 <hi>Uſe.</hi>
                        </note> to win thee or move thee to priſe that Kingdom, which is to be at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of Jeſus Chriſt, for then the Tabernacle of God ſhall be with men, &amp; he ſhall dwell with them; as alſo ſaith <hi>Iohn</hi> in theſe words, <hi>I heard a great voice from Heaven, ſaying, the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and he will be their God, and God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow nor crying, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall there be any more pain, for the former things are paſſed away, and the redeemed of the Lord ſhall come to</hi> Sion <hi>with Songs, and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Joy ſhall be unto them;</hi> and the great King of the whole earth, who is the Son of the moſt high, and the great Bridegroom of the Bride, ſhall gird himſelfe and make them ſit

But on the other hand, if thou ſhouldeſt loſe that inheritance, and the glorious preſence of that infinite glory, which was ſo glorious, that when <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> ſaw but a glimpſe of it, they ſaid, It is good for us to be here; I ſay, if thou ſhouldeſt looſe chis enjoyment, although by it thou maiſt gain all the friendſhip in the world, &amp; the riches and quinteſſence thereof; yet thou wouldeſt be a great
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170253:103"/>loſer, <hi>Matt.</hi> 17.4. <hi>Mark</hi> 8.36. Chriſtian Reader, thou art not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling to an earthly Kingdom or Inheritance, but <hi>unto Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>and unto the City of the living God, the heavenly</hi> Ieruſalem, <hi>to an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable company of Angels to the General Aſſembly and Church of the first born, which are written in Heaven, and unto God the Judge of all things, and the Spirits of Juſt men made perfect,</hi> where thou ſhalt enjoy the preſence of God, <hi>in whoſe preſence there is fullneſſe of Joy, and at his right hand pleaſure for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> Pſal. 16.11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22, 23.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond inducement is from the Freeneſs of the giver of this Inheritance, that whether thou art rich or poor, high or low, noble or ignoble, thou maiſt attain to this Inheritance; for the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands his Meſſengers to offer it freely to every Creature, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. Moreover he proclaims this his loving kindneſſe by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſaying, <hi>Oh every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no mony, come buy Wine
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170253:104"/>without money, and without price, why do you lay out your money for that which is not bread, and your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor for that which profits not?</hi> Eſay 55.1, 2. From hence we may take notice of theſe two things, Firſt how the Lord exhibiteth himſelf freely to every Creature; and blames ſuch as are contented with Husks, when they may have the Bread of Life freely.</p>
                     <p>The third Inducement or Motive to move thee, or incourage thee to ſeek after this Inheritance, is from the conſideration of thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, when the Lord is pleaſed to caſt his eye of pity upon thee; it is not at that time when thou appeareſt amiable or lovely by reaſon of thy virtues and graces which is in thee, but when thou waſt a deformed Creature, by reaſon of lying in the blood of the pollution of thy Sin, and it was alſo when no eye pittied thee; neither could Angels or men do thee any good: In this appeared the love of God (indeed) as ſaith the Apoſtle; <hi>We know the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that though
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170253:104"/>he were rich, yet for your ſakes he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came poor, that you through his pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty might be made rich,</hi> thus the Lord Jeſus <hi>made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and became obedient to death, even the death of the croſſe;</hi> (and as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) this his great love did extend it ſelf to us, when we <hi>by Nature were the Children of wrath, as well as others, ſcarcely for a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man will one dye, yet peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for a good man ſome would even dare to dye; but God commendeth his love to us, in that while we were Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Chriſt died for us.</hi> Rom. 5.7, 8. 2 Cor. 8.9. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8.

Will not ſuch Souls call for the Mountains to fall upon them, to hide them from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God? Surely they will, and all ſuch faces ſhall gather blackneſs; for

                     <p>The Eighth and laſt Uſe ſhall be for comfort and conſolation to all thoſe that ſhall be Heirs of that Kingdom; Bleſſed are all they who are found watching when the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come, he will gird himſelf, and make them ſit down at meat, and he will come forth and ſerve them. Therefore be glad and rejoyce, for the Lord Omnipotent will reign. Bleſſed are all they that are called to the Marriage Supper of the Lambt,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170253:106"/>for they ſhall enter into that glorious City, even that heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (which I have given you a glimps of) where there ſhall bee ſinging praiſes by the Saints, where there ſhall be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting joy, and ſubſtantial (or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) felicity; therefore I ſay, Bleſſed are all the Dead that dye in the Lord, for they ſhall be glorified at his appearance.
