            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I heard of your sicknesse, (though considering
the wofull miseries of the times I do usually rather
congratulate with men their happinesse, whom
God seemes to favour so much as to call to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and to his owne rest, from being spectators
or actors or sufferers in these calamities wherin this
Kingdome is involved, yet) I assure you I found in
my selfe such a different apprehension of your
state, from that of other ordinary sick men, that I thinke you will not
wonder, if all the Kings Subjects, who wish good successe unto His
Majestie in this warre, cannot impute your visitation to any thing but
to the just severity and revenge of Almighty God upon you, for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
had so strong an influence upon the ruine of this Kingdome and
Church. For, Sir, is it not apparent, that, among others your eminent
gifts of preaching have beene made use of for the kindling of those
flames of Rebellion and civill warre, and most unchristian bloudshed?
Have not you with all the earnestnesse, and (as you call it) zeale
imaginable, perswaded your Hearers to a liberall contribution for the
maintaining of this unnaturall warre? Have not you forsaken your
owne charge to accompany and strengthen the Generall of your Army
in his resolution and attempts, against the just power and life of his
and your <hi>Anoynted Soveraigne?</hi> Does not the whole Kingdome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
almost all the distractions and combustions therein, as much to the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43584:3"/>
seditious sermons of the <hi>Preachers of your faction,</hi> as to the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
of those persons, who set you on worke? Let your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
be your own judge in this matter, and it will tell you, that if all
these new designes should succeed to your wish, if there should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
a change in government, either of Kingdome or Church, you
would thinke your selves wrong'd if you should be defrauded of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
acknowledged very effectuall instruments in that change. These
things therefore being so, you cannot accuse of uncharitablenes those
who think these designes not only unjust but ruinous both to Justice
and Religion, if they attribute it to Gods mercy to them, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
on you, if he take out of the world such a fire-brand as you are.</p>
            <p>Sir, whether your sicknesse be unto death or no, I know not, I am
sure those sinnes (without unusuall and miraculous mercy) will
prove sinnes unto death in all those that are guilty of them, and
die without repentance and amendment, and satisfaction to Gods
Church for the scandall of them. And upon this ground I how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
soever yet by my profession being one of your brethren and
companions in the ministry of the Gospell, thought it my duty to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you in the bowells of Christ to take a survey of your present
condition, with other eyes then heretofore, I doubt, you have done;
And to take it patiently from me, though a stranger to your person, if
I offer you some hints, which your owne better understanding will
make use of for a more exact discerning apprehension and judgement
of the nature of this businesse, now to be decided by the sword: which
though it prevaile to your owne wish, yet it is not the sword or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
will justifie you before Gods Tribunall. Remember Sir, it is not a
<hi>Close Committee</hi> pack't together of your owne freinds or faction, that
must determine the cause betweene God and you, neither are they
any <hi>new invented fundamentall Lawes</hi> of Kingdome or Nature
that are to be your rule, but only the Lawes of the <hi>New-Covenant;</hi>
And from them it is that I intend to suggest unto your thoughts, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
which I desire you impartially to examine, to the end that
when you appeare before the throne of Christ you may be able to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
your selfe, either that you have fulfilled your duty, or if you have
failed therein, yet at least that you have fail'd after a reasonable and
prudent examination by that Rule.</p>
            <p>I suppose you will not assume such infallibility of judgement to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43584:3"/>
your owne person or party, as to thinke that the right is so unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
on your side, that nothing can be objected against you that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
to be considered; since at least an equall part of the best judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the Kingdome, and most learned persons in the Church, are
your adversaries in this cause; And (which ought to be of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with you) since a farre greater number of the Members of both
Houses (though perhaps through negligence or feare not now sitting
in Westminster,) do protest against these proceedings. Let it but be
granted, that all those which oppose you have some seeming probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
on their side; and then I am sure you will judge it necessary especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
for a dying person, (if that be your present condition,) to be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicious
of himselfe, and to hearken to all objections, and to use all pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
meanes for settling of his conscience before he depart out of the
world. If you looke upon this warre (and surely your minde will not
be so busie other waies, but sometimes you will looke upon this war)
the result of your late-two-yeares sermons, the effect of all those pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
lying Pamphlets, and discourses of forged conspiracies, feares
and jealousies, (now so confessedly groundlesse, that they are become a
Proverbe of vanity) it cannot be avoided but you will have now and
then some accusing thoughts among others, they will not be all alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
excusing or justifying. I pray you give mee leave to marshall
in order before your eyes certaine accusing thoughts, and put it to the
tryall of your owne heart whether they doe with any force or justice
accuse you, I assure you I will take upon mee no further then to accuse
you, for it is God onely must be your Judge, and I beseech him to
prepare you for that judgement, and to performe it with all possible
elemency and mercy.</p>
            <p>You have at last Sir, obtained one end of all your endeavours, your
watchings and fastings and prayers and Sermons; you see there is at
length a warre inflameing the whole Kingdome, you have obtained
that it be put to the tryall of fire and sword, whether God will so blesse
both these as by their meanes to purge this Kingdome and Church of
the staines, which you suppose are in them both, and set up that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Scepter of Christs Kingdome, the <hi>Presbytery</hi> or <hi>independency:</hi>
(we know not yet whether is design'd.)</p>
            <p>Now in this warre now raised, I shall principally consider the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>persons</hi> betweene whom it was waged, and the <hi>grounds</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:43584:4"/>
and pretences thereof, and from thence raise such Articles of accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as I must needes feare you cannot chuse but answer guilty unto
them at the barre of conscience. And these I will consider, with an
intention not so much to interpose mine owne judgement concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the legality of them, as desireous to shew that you, as a Preacher
of the Gospell, ought not so to have interessed your selfe in them.</p>
            <p>1. The parties oppos'd and in collision against one another in this
warre are; on the one side the <hi>Kings Majesty</hi> assisted by the most
considerable part of the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> and all the
Clergy that are indeed the <hi>true English Protestant Clergy;</hi> and on the
other side, <hi>No King</hi> (nor so much as an usurping pretended King) but
<hi>onely Subjects,</hi> (or such as ought to be such, and have often sworne
they will be such) and among them, the only forward persons are <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries,</hi>
such as abhorre the established Doctrine and Discipline of our
Church; as appeares in that wheresoever almost that Army comes,
there is all the violence and despight imaginable exercised against the
Leiturgy and Ceremonies of the Church, and persons of Church-men;
witnesse <hi>Canterbury, Worcester, Winchester, Salisbury,</hi> and the other
day, <hi>Lambeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And herein I accuse you first (or rather, I desire you that you would
permit your owne thoughts to accuse you, I doe not yet say to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
you, but accuse you) that you have forgotten or wilfully trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed
the duty of a minister of the Gospell of Peace, in being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to kindle a warre of what nature or with what pretences soever.
Do you in the Gospell, Master <hi>S. Marshall,</hi> (which is your Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion)
find any encouragements, or which is more, any command to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Warre? <hi>From whence are Warres,</hi> in generall, <hi>and fightings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you? S. James</hi> will answer, <hi>Come they not even</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>from your lusts which warre in your Members?</hi> Christ our Master in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
sayes that he came <hi>to send fire and the sword upon the Earth,</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
not what he intended or commanded, but what, through the
wickednesse and malice of Satan and prophane men would be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
of the preaching of the Gospell, even that Gospell which is
not withstanding the Gospell of meekenesse, and patience, and charity,
<hi>viz,</hi> that the enemies thereof would expresse all possible fury and rage
against it. For that fire (as appeares in the text) is the <hi>Baptisme</hi> of
<hi>persecutions,</hi> wherewith Christ himselfe and his followers were to be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43584:4"/>
               <hi>baptized,</hi> a warre wherein he and they were to be patients only and
not agents, he came not to put the sword into the hands but into the
bowels of his owne servants. You stand therefore accused for being
active your selfe, and encouraging other Christians to be active and
invaders in this warre, for being a most unchristian Baptizer of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
with this fire.</p>
            <p>But, secondly, the accusation against you for being a fomenter of
warre, in <hi>Subjects</hi> against their <hi>lawfull Prince,</hi> acknowledged for
such both by you and them, is farre more heavy and pressing: (I
know you have pretty distinctions whereby you can gaine applause of
your hearers, by dividing the <hi>King</hi> from <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> and defending
the one by murthering the other; but remember now it is God &amp; your
own conscience before whom I accuse you, who will prove Judges
too cunning for such distinctions.) For Gods sake therefore lay your
hand upon your heart, and aske your owne soule what pretence or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
can be found for this in any law, either of the Kingdome of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
or Heaven. Is there any one word either in the Common or
Statute Law, which allowes an English Subject with Armes in hand
to resist the King in person? Is he not indeed, and as you have often
sworne to acknowledge him, the <hi>supreame Monarch</hi> in his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
does not all exercise of coercion and power from all Courts is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
by his writ? Have not all subordinate Magistrates their power
from him, and therefore are they not with respect to him, meere pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
persons? Do the two Houses of Parliament themselves in all their
addresses, petitions &amp;c. unto His Majesty assume any other title unto
themselves both severally and joyntly, but onely <hi>your Majesties most
humble and faithfull Subjects?</hi> These things being so, &amp; you knowing
them to be so, I beseech you next search diligently the Gospell, &amp; find
but one clause where you are allowed, or where the least suspicion may
be given you that you may hope that you may in any case be allowed to
dispence with this your duty to His Majesty; and I will confesse that
you and your friends only have shewed your selves good Subjects and
good Christians, and that all we who pray for him and wish him vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
in this warre, are Traitors to him, and Apostates from Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
But no such thing appearing, as you too well know, (for I wish
for your owne sake that it were but ignorance, that has made you so
zealous in the cause as you have been) how can you read or but think
upon the beginning of the 13 Chap. to the Rom. without horrour,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43584:5"/>
and secret wishes that S. <hi>Paul</hi> had had no inke to write words, that
will prove so fatall against you? Is that Chapter, Master <hi>Marshall,</hi> a
part of that Covenant by which you must be judged at the last day?
And can you hope to appeare with any confidence when that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
shall be charg'd upon you? Consider Sir, from whom has the King
His power? is it not from God? Does not S. <hi>Paul</hi> say expressely, <hi>he is
the Minister of God,</hi> His Vice-gerent to exercise some Acts, which
not the consent of all the men in the world have right to invest him
with? <hi>For he beares the sword,</hi> that is, the power of life and death. Has
any man power over his owne life, to relinquish it at his pleasure?
And it being sure he hath not, can he communicate to another the
disposition of his owne life, (over which no man but God only, or
they to whom God delegates his power have Authority?) no certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Master <hi>Marshall. There is no power</hi> (at least no such power) <hi>but of
God, the powers that are, are ordained of God.</hi> Insomuch that you will
not find any example of Capitall punishments in the world exercised
by any, till God gave that power to man, which to my understanding
he first gave, and then only in the case of murder, to <hi>Noah</hi> (Gen: 9. 4,
5, 6.) so that before it was under a dire punishment forbidden to kill
even that murderous wretch <hi>Cain</hi> himselfe. The people then, though
they choose the person of their King (which questionlesse they did by
direction from God at the first) yet not they but God only gives him
this supereminent power <hi>over life and death;</hi> with regard whereto
doubtlesse he call's Kings and all supreame Governours, especially <hi>Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi>
and saith, <hi>By me Kings raigne; whosoever therefore,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul,
resisteth, resisteth the Ordinance of God, and they that resist, shall receive
to themselves damnation.</hi> These will prove sad words Master <hi>Marshall</hi>
to a dying man, that is guilty he hath in so high a nature resisted, and
taught others to do so too: Especially considering, that these precepts
of obedience were by S. <hi>Paul</hi> given to us Christians, at a time when
the world was governed by such prodigious Tyrants, as no History
mentions the like either before or after them; as if God intended
thereby to cut off all imaginable pretences of disobedience for ever.</p>
            <p>Had not the Jewes as great Civill Priviledges as wee, granted by
God himselfe?<note place="margin">Deut. 17. 16.</note> had not they a command <hi>not to set a stranger over them?</hi>
yet when a stranger had violently usurped this power, does not Christ
command us <hi>to give to Caesar that tribute</hi> (a signe and acknowledgment
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43584:5"/>
of that Authority) <hi>which was Caesar's.</hi> Then can zeale for Religion
dispense with you, thinke you? Did Saint <hi>Paul</hi> say, <hi>yee must needs be
Subject not onely for wrath but Conscience sake, and whosoever resisteth
receiveth to himselfe Damnation?</hi> and were not the persons against
whom resistance was thus strictly forbidden, <hi>Caligula,</hi> or <hi>Claudius,</hi> or
<hi>Nero's</hi> Persons, that abhorr'd, and as farre as the whole power of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
could prevaile, endeavoured to destroy Christianity it selfe? And
can setling a new discipline, or rooting out some speculative errours,
allow you to resist a good Christian Protestant Prince? So true a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
according to the established Religion of <hi>England,</hi> that I am
perswaded he hath scarce one Subject more hearty and zealous, and
constant in it, and more ready to sacrifice his life for it, then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
            <p>But you have beene taught of late, and have taught others to say,
that His Majesty is bound by promise and oath to such and such
things, and with these promises received his Crowne, which is forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
when these promises are broken.</p>
            <p>Do you indeed thinke Sir, that any of your Masters beleeve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
when they make such objections? was not His Majesty a King
invested with his full power before he made these promises at his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation?
or does he tell you, that he quits and releases unto you your
allegeance when he failes in any of these promises? He will be answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to God for injustice and perjury if he breake his promises, and
that will be punishment sufficient, without your endeavours to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne
him, and take away his life. The King of <hi>England,</hi> all the world
knowes, is not a Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> or King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> that receives
his Crowne conditionally, with power of revocation when the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are broken. You know this well enough Sir, and therefore I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
you to prepare an answer for Saint <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other ground, whereon the Articles of your accusation shall be
lai'd, does respect the causes or pretences of this horrible un-Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
warre; which are either Civill <hi>viz.</hi> vindication of the <hi>Liberties of
the Subject,</hi> and <hi>Priviledges of Parliament, &amp;c.</hi> or Spirituall, namely,
the <hi>purging of Innovations</hi> in the Church and <hi>setling the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
of this Kingdome in the purity thereof. It may be, you will rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
among Spirituall grounds the dividing all the revenues of
Churchmen, amongst I know not yet whom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:43584:6"/>
For the first, If it did appeare that His Majesty not onely had in
times past, but for the future did resolve to entrench in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
upon both these, (notwithstanding trienniall Parliaments.) yet
let me, speaking to you as to a Clergy-man, from a Clergy-man, aske
you whether the Gospell doth warrant us the ministers thereof, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
and provoke Subjects to warre and bloudshed for any worldly
causes whatsoever. For consider Master <hi>Marshall,</hi> are Christian Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
bound in Conscience not to suffer the effects of Tyranny? Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
they be saved under an oppressing cruell Governour? Is the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
suffering ones selfe to be defrauded and injured by a lawfull Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
become a sinne? Truly Sir, I am so farre from thinking so, that I
cannot find in mine heart to preach against those patient Citizens in
<hi>London,</hi> who without resistance suffer themselves to be plundered, by
these who certainely were not borne their Princes, to whom they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
tooke any oathes of allegiance; neither can I condemne that
man as out of the Gospell, who would rather deliver his purse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a theife, then endanger the wretches life, by resisting him and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for it. This therefore being so that it may consist with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to be wronged (and if it were not so, S. <hi>Paul</hi> would never
have said, <hi>why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer
your selves to be defrauded, viz.</hi> then goe to law &amp;c.) I wonder what
Text you could make use of to bring this within a Sermon-businesse to
perswade Subjects rather then suffer such things, to endanger their own
lives, and the life of their anoynted King; (yea and the soules of both
too) though he had beene a Tyrant! This was certainly a great fault
in you Sir, and your party; Though there had beene not only rationall
suspicions, but apparent proofes, that oppression and Slavery were
threatned to this Nation. You might have found Textes in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
wherein in such cases mention was made, and advises given for
the practice of certain Christian vertues called <hi>meekenesse,</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi>
and <hi>praying for enemies,</hi> and <hi>resignation of our selves to Gods good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi>
and acknowledging that our sinnes have deserved, that for
them, <hi>God should deliver us over into the hands of Tyrannicall Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Textes (which every where offer themselves you should have
studied, and these vertues you should have commended to your hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
as seasonable on such occasions, (which I pray you not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43584:6"/>
to be boasting, If I tell you, that such is my practice in these dayes
wherein there is so great occasions given for the exercise of such
Christian vertues, and given by persons in whose innocence and Justice
you do much confide,) and not resisting and rising up in Armes against
them, and revenging our selves of our sufferings upon the persons and
rights of those, whom we were borne to live under, and to whom we
had taken so many Oathes of Duty and Loyalty. For mine owne part
I assure you Sir, if it should please God that you and your masters
should in the end Legally become our Governours, either in Civill or
ecclesiasticall matters, be as rigorous and austere as you please I do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
you in the presence of God (who knowes me though you do not
and will punish me if I lye,) that I will never exhort any man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
and opposition against you, never will I sollicit petitions to
threaten you, nor tumults to advise you. If you should command me
to do things unlawfull, or enjoyne me to subscribe to doctrines which
I thinke erroneous, I will not do those things, nor professe such do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
but however I will never resist you, but either by flying from
you, or suffering as meekly as I can the punishment and penalties that
you shall inflict on me, and I do here engage my selfe to procure you as
many fellow-patients as possibly I can: these things I take leave to
tell you, upon supposition, that all pretended miseries were indeed
apparently comming on us, and inevitable, but onely by these (to my
understanding) unlawfull meanes.</p>
            <p>But now Sir, since no such thing appeares probable, or almost pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to any man that hath in him left one grain of Christian charitie;
since whatsoever former pressures we groaned under, as Ship-money,
and Monopolies, are not onely so absolutely taken away, as no suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
can remain of their returning (for which many thankes and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements
are due and will be given to his Majestie by all
good Subjects, how insensible and unthankfull soever you resolve to
be) since not onely all the Delinquents in such cases are offered to the
triall and punishment of the Law (excepting onely those whom new
crimes of unthankfulnesse and malice against the King, have rendered
justified and innocent, and unfit to be questioned, for all their former
briberies and extortions) but likewise the most earnest assurances by
solemne and publique protestations and oathes, freely given us by his
Majestie (joyned with unusuall acknowledgements of errours past,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43584:7"/>
and all reasonable offers of satisfaction for them, as particularly; for
his repair unto the House of Commons) and curses on his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and his Children: if those Protestations be not syncere, that surely
they that beleeve not his Majestie (if there be any such, for I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
most of those that say they do not beleeve him, do blaspheme
their own faiths, and are anti-hypocrites of infidelitie) they must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
a renouncing of Christian charitie, <hi>which believes all things;</hi> and
they must thinke his Majestie destitute of ordinary prudence, since it
is apparent that there is no possible way for him left to reigne in splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
or so much as safetie, unlesse he make good these promises by
future actions, (the greatest and most considerable part of that
strength now about him, following him, chiefly upon that assurance,
and out of experience, that the Lawes of the Land, which they see
unregarded and nullified by others, are either to be revived, and
justice executed by him, or not at all.) Sure Master <hi>Marshall,</hi> though
his Majestie be a mightie Prince, yet I may say, it is beyond his power
to give us greater securitie of making <hi>England</hi> the happiest Kingdom
under the Sun in his Government according to Law and Justice, than
he hath already done, unlesse he should dethrone himselfe, and give up
his power and protection of us, his Subjects, from himselfe into
other mens hands, which if he should attempt to do, he should be
perjured. Thinke with your selves of any other lawfull securitie
(that he be not the onely Person in the Kingdom unprotected) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
that which you have already received, and I am very confident
you shall have that granted too.</p>
            <p>Where is then your Christian charitie all this while, Master <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall?</hi>
you that are commanded to forgive and receive into friendship
your brother, <hi>seven times</hi> in one day, though he should offend as many
times in one day, what dispensation do you finde in the Gospell for
this dutie of charitie to your King, whom I am assured, you can never
accuse of ever making any promise with a resolution to break it?
or if you will needs be so hard to be perswaded your selves, where
have you been taught to discourage and forbid others who are more
easie of beleefe to trust him? Remember Sir, when the last fatall
houre comes, if you have any sin lying on you not throughly morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
you must then promise unto Almightie God amendment (if it
shall please him to lengthen your dayes, and wo unto you, and more
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43584:7"/>
too, if God does not believe us, and take our words) you must then
say not onely, <hi>Forgive me, as I forgave, &amp;c.</hi> But, <hi>Believe and accept
of this resolution of mine, as I do, &amp;c.</hi> This you must say, and the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comfort of your soul will be, that God will content himselfe with
promises onely, in stead of performances, notwithstanding an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
promises you did make in your life time against sin, and as many
times you forgot and neglected those promises: Do not therefore
teach Almightie God an evill lesson against your selfe.</p>
            <p>Now besides this extreme and most unchristian uncharitablenesse,
and judging of your King, so as you dare not for all the world adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be judged your selfe, you must expect to be accused of most
intolerable disobedience and disloyaltie to his Majestie. You that are
commanded <hi>to be subject out of conscience</hi> to <hi>Nero,</hi> if he were your
King, <hi>not to resist him,</hi> though he should without Law murder you;
yet you have and for ought appeares, yet do not onely deny obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to a most righteous Christian King, but you have appeared in the
Field among armed Forces against Him; and (as it is affirmed by Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of qualitie, Officers in your Armie that were your Auditours)
whereas you promised your Souldiers, that they should never fight
against his Majestie, yet when that fearfull day of <hi>Edge-hill</hi> came, you
not onely broke that promise with them, but <hi>encouraged them especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to direct their shot toward that place where his Majestie stood.</hi> The
thought of this I am sure will sit near your soul before you die; but
how would it have entred like boiling oyl into your bones, if the shot
which from other hands you aimed against his Person had not swer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?
I assure you, that you have greater cause to blesse God for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
his Majestie against your selfe, that day, than either my selfe,
or any other, the most faithfull Subject he has. It could not be but
pleasure for us to perish after so dismall a losse, but for you to die
with his blood upon your soules, who is Gods Anointed, methinkes
the very thought of the possibilitie of it should be sufficient to banish
from your heart all manner of peace and securitie as long as you live.</p>
            <p>There is one aggravation more for this your disloyaltie, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
will make it a sin that I must accuse the povertie of our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
which will not afford us a name to understand it by, a sin which
the worst Lay-person in the world could not be guilt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of, that is (and
if I remember well, his Majestie hath already in one of his writings
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43584:8"/>
charg'd you with it,) that you, not content with all these expressions
of the utmost kind of disobedience, should take upon you to absolve
certaine soldiers, once his Prisoners, and graciously released upon
their oath, never to beare Armes against him more, of that their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
and oath, <hi>making them twofold more the Children of Hell, then</hi> &amp;c.
I will not make you blush, with asking, whether the <hi>Gospell</hi> will afford
you textes to justifye this. I pray you search the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is not a booke professedly and impudently hellish
enough to warrant this action. For Gods sake, Sir, have so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the honour of our nation, as to use some meanes to wipe of
this Scandall; let not the world thinke, that we English-men, if we doe
not beleeve, yet at least have some suspicion that there is a God, an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger
of perjury. Perjury you know was even by the Heathens ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a sinne, not only destructive to the Authours, but to whole
Cities, and Kingdomes, which have the misfortune to have such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
living in them. Shall Rebellion be reported to be accounted by
any English Protestant, not only a pardonable but a lawfull act, yea a
vertue, yea so eminent a vertue, that like charity it will cover a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of sins, and so fit and necessary to be practiced, that rather then
omitted, perjury it selfe should be swallowed? I hope Master <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall;</hi>
His Majesty hath beene misinformed, and that I am to crave
your pardon for laying to your charge this accusation.</p>
            <p>Other things there are, which though I hope you did dislike, &amp; had
no Active influence on them, yet when you thinke sadly on, I beleeve
you will thinke must prove part of your charge. As those bloudy tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
from the City, whose pretence indeed was Justice and Liberty,
(but hath beene the bane of both:) those printings and preachings of
known lies and calumnies, those revilings and proscribings of His Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Majesty, those shamelesse mocking and upbraidings of Almighty
God to his face and in his owne ordinance, giving him thanks for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
victories or confessed losses, the neglecting of all manner of
Oathes, even of that oath of your owne invention, <hi>the Protestation,</hi>
which alone if it should rise up in Judgment against you what would
become of you? In a word whatsoever almost has beene spoken or
done in order to your <hi>great designe,</hi> that is, the whole businesse of
your brethren especially of the separation, for these two last yeares; I
feare some share of the guilt of all this will cleave to you, so that it will
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43584:8"/>
concerne you, to advise how you may acquit your selfe of it. For M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               <hi>Marshall,</hi> can any Christian deny that all these things have not beene
done? And having beene done, can any excuse be made for them? And
this being so, how could it consist with a good conscience in you,
(although you had no hand at all in any of these things,) to dissemble
the taking notice of them? Not once to preach publikely against them
though you knew many of your chiefe Auditors were guilty of them?
Are you so tender harted, that you cannot endure such sleight staines
in the Church, as the Surplice, Letany, or a few new postures &amp;c.
and can you over-looke such abominations as these? Can you find
nothing against which, to expresse your zeale but only peace, or are
you of that good opinion, who openly maintain'd, that <hi>for a holy end
some evill things might be tolerated,</hi> though S. <hi>Paul</hi> say of such as he,
<hi>their damnation is sure?</hi> Could you admit so much secret Atheisme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your heart, as to expect from designes, built upon such rotten
grounds, and forwarded by such wicked arts, that a good issue could
follow? I assure you for my selfe, though I extreamly greived to see
such things practiced so uncontrolably, yea so kindly and thankfully
received by Christians, and though I was a long time solicitous of the
ruine threatned to this Church; yet since I could not chuse but see the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
I began to be more secure both for Kingdome and Church, since by all
that I had either read or could informe my selfe concerning the course
of Gods most wise and holy providence, I could never find that in the
end he ever crown'd with blessings the designes of persons that so
shamefully dishonoured him, how holy and spirituall so ever their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
were.</p>
            <p>The other great pretence for this warre is <hi>Religion (Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
I pray you thinke of that, Master <hi>Marshall,</hi>) Zeale for the
maintaining of this, has wrested from you your selfe many eager and
loud exhortations, that men would stand resolutely for Gods truth,
that they would neither spare their purses, nor lives in so holy a cause.
Are not you, Sir, one of those Godly Divines that have been consulted
with, as the whole Kingdome, hath beene given to understand? This
is the almost only thing, which is said to make this warre to be, <hi>pium
duellum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for the honour of our Blessed Saviour and his Religions sake
(Master <hi>Marshall</hi>) I beseech you at least in this controversy, search
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43584:9"/>
the Gospell diligently (for that sure must only determine this point,
here needes no conjuring up of Fundamentall lawes of nature or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
nor new unheard of Priviledges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) I say once more search the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
and if there appeare one word, that gives you warrant to provoke
Christians to any kind of warre for the cause of Religion (which yet
is the almost only <hi>Pulpit-cause)</hi> I will confesse my selfe a desertour
of Christ, a betrayer of his Religion, for not daring to flesh mens
swords in this quarrell. But in the Gospell I find, that <hi>the weapons of
our warfare are not carnall, but spirituall;</hi> I find that <hi>the Tares which
grew among the wheat,</hi> that is, the Children <hi>of the wicked one,</hi> Hereticks,
are forbidden <hi>to be pluck't up and destroyed, before the time of Harvest.</hi>
I find that against the enemies and Persecutours of this Religion
Christ Jesus has furnished us with no other weapons, but defensive
only, and those, <hi>patience</hi> or <hi>flight</hi> at the most. I find that by such wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
and such only, Christian Religion prevailed against the power
of the whole Roman Empire. I find not that any one of the antient
Fathers taught, or that without their teaching the primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
made use of any other weapons, but these, or that they thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other weapons lawfull. You know what <hi>Tertullian</hi> speakes in his
Apology, <hi>viz</hi> that the <hi>Christians then (though if they had thought the
sword a lawfull instrument in this cause, they wanted neither numbers, nor
power, yet) durst not betray their Consciences to secure their lives.</hi> It is
much to be doubted, Sir, that it is not superstitions or other impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vanities, which make such antient writers scorn'd or hated by
your freinds, both Separatists and Anabaptists, so much as these ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of patience, and Christian obedience, for which they are so famous,
and wherein you will not be their Schollers. Now all this and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
arguments and reasons beside these, which might be alleadged, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
apparent, whereto may we attribute this your certainly not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Apostolicall way of maintaining true Religion, but only to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
distrust in Gods providence, or in his love unto his Church? that
men fearing lest God should not blesse those indeed only blessed
meanes of suffering, which heretofore when they were used were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
prospered by him, have therefore cast aside this Spirituall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
and have betaken themselves to such as <hi>Mahomet</hi> and the <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
whore</hi> and the great master of both these, the Divell, that <hi>Abad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> hath and doth make use of, for destroying true, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43584:9"/>
introducing false Religion? If it were the truth of Christ that those of
the separation, or their new associates, (though indeed most mortall
enemies,) the Anabaptistes have been so busy to advance: Is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that with all their stratagems and darke counsells and prayers and
fastings, they should not to this day have obteined from God so much
successe as to become the masters of one Kingdome, City, nor village?
excepting only that which they will be ashamed to brag of, the City
of munster?</p>
            <p>Oh Sir, How then will you answer it to Christ (who will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in this case especially be a very severe Judge) that you have made
him who <hi>came not to destroy mens lives but to save them,</hi> a pretence for
the shedding of so much bloud as hath beene and probably will be
spill'd? If it should chance mens eyes should be opened, and that this
should be acknowledged an unlawfull cause of warre, whom can you
expect that those poor soules, who have died in the very gall of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse
and rancour of Rebellion should curse, but <hi>such Ministers</hi> as
you, who have told them (but most falsly) that such a way of expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
themselves to death was not onely acceptable, but absolutely
commanded by Christ himselfe? Sure, Sir, War is a businesse of so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
deep concernment, that it ought not to be undertaken but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
grounds evidently lawfull and warrantable. A War therefore for
<hi>Religion,</hi> and against <hi>a lawfull Superiour,</hi> against whom the Gospell
so apparently forbids resistance, must be proved lawfull at least by as
many and evident Texts, as those are which seeme to discommand it.
O Sir, where are those Texts? Why is not one Gospell quotation
produced for this purpose? Not one Master <hi>Marshall,</hi> not one single
one, that to any thinking, considering Christian will seem of any
kinde of moment at all? Is it incogitancie or ignorance in you Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
that there is such want of the Gospell in these points? No cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
it is meer guilt, or rather a clear confession that you can finde
nothing in the Gospell whereby the Professours thereof may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
to defend it this way. However, let it be supposed that the
lawfulnesse hereof might be maintained in some possible cases; yet it
cannot be denied, but that patience (so oft commanded and blessed
by Christ) is at least a lawfull thing to be practiced too. Now that you
say Religion and Truth is persecuted, and if patience against any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutours,
certainly, then against a lawfull King when he turnes perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutour.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43584:10"/>
How then comes it to passe, that neither you, nor any of your
partie should exhort men to patience or martyrdom now? Is it out
of conscience that you dare not? Will not the Gospell warrant such
exhortations, thinke you? For shame, Sir, let it be confessed at last,
that whatsoever other pretences may seem specious and popular, yet
that this <hi>of Religion</hi> (which notwithstanding boulsters up all other,
and when the rest fail, recruites many of your decayed Regiments)
yet that this, I say, is so farre from making this War lawfull; that it
selfe is more unlawfull, than the War.</p>
            <p>But if <hi>Christian Religion</hi> might be thus defended, must <hi>Discipline</hi>
therefore be so defended? must <hi>no crossing, no kneeling, no ceremonies,
no prescribed prayers,</hi> be so defended? or at last speak out <hi>Plain Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
in this point too: Is it indeed the English Protestant Religion of
the Kingdom that you would thus defend? why<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did the King ever
persecute the Religion of the Kingdome? Did he ever, or any by
his command burne the Liturgie, damne the Articles and Canons, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
the Homilies of the Church? Do his Souldiers tear Surplices,
and threaten to murther the wearers of them? For starke shame
then say not that you defend the established <hi>English Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
against the King: that King who scarce ever was once absent
from his own solemne Prayers and Sermons. By the way remember,
Master <hi>Marshall,</hi> your uncharitable suspicions, your unreasonable,
groundlesse declamations against his Majestie in this point of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
are yet farre more unexcusable than before.</p>
            <p>But to take the maske quite from off your faces, remember that this
King whom you know to be so constant a lover of the Religion
wherein he was bred, yet this King in a charitable, religious compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with you, offers to yield to any reasonable alterations, and to
take away whatsoever doctrines or practices may seemingly be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
to tender consciences: onely, I believe he would be unwilling
to have that exposed unto the world for the confessed Religion of
the Kingdom which shall be agreed upon by an Assemblie over-vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or over-awed by such as professe themselves at least strangers, if
not enemies to this Church; for let the effect of such a meeting be
what it will, it cannot be called the Religion of <hi>England,</hi> it is but at
most <hi>A Religion for England.</hi> Therefore, for Gods sake, let the
King be stiled in this War not an Invader, but onely, as it is apparent
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43584:10"/>
he indeed is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>A Defender,</hi> rob Him not of the Title of his Crown<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for does He take up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Armes either for any new additions to his former
Prerogatives, for any new Lawes to the prejudice of His Subjects
liberties, or for any new Articles of Religion which he has a minde to
introduce by the sword? Would he infringe any old Lawes, or Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
or Articles? Have not you forced him to unsheath his sword
meerly to prevent innovations in all these? Which is then the <hi>inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>
and which is the <hi>defending side?</hi> If you be sicke enough, to be
weaned from worldly respects, I shall not desire a fitter person to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
this question.</p>
            <p>Now these are Sir, the principall Heads or Articles of crimes, of
most of which I must needs confesse I doubt (and I hope in Christ I
shall not be found uncharitable, though I should chance to be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken)
that you M. <hi>Marshall</hi> are guiltie. For Christ his sake thinke
sadly on them, and advise with some grave and holy men of our
Clergie, as well as your own, such as are M. <hi>Shute,</hi> D. <hi>Oldsworth,</hi> &amp;c.
These are matters Sir, that certainly deserve all possible examination.
Aud you who I believe would not trust an ignorant Lawyer, though
your friend and fellow Sectarie about your estate, you should in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
at least be as carefull of your soul. And withall, I pray you take
this also into your consideration, that if you prove indeed guilty of
these things, as I must fear your are, then if it should happen that God
should deal so mercifully with you as to convince you of them, and
to give you repentance for them, it will be likewise most necessary
that you should endeavour to satisfie Gods Chuch for this extreme
scandall given, by professing your repentance, and attempting to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive
others. And who knowes, whether since those crimes, how
fearfull soever in their own nature, yet were the effects chiefly of ill
education and prejudices in your judgement not Christ, or want of
love to him, who knowes I say, whether Almighty God may not
be pleased to accept of even a death-bed repentance for them.</p>
            <p>I hope Sir, you will be pleased to write or cause to be written some
few words in answer to this. For so much methinkes charitie backe
again to me (who professe my selfe contrary to you in all these points)
will require from you. For certainly, either these things which I call
accusations, are extreme great vices, or extraordinary vertues,
they cannot possibly be things <hi>indifferent;</hi> so that one of us, in the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43584:11"/>
state we both are, must needs want some speciall Christian Graces,
without a concurrence of all which you know there is no possible sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
Now if you be so pleased to extend so much charitie to me,
you shall make your own conditions either of secrecie, or what else
you please, onely my desire and expectation is that I may hear some
thing from you, if at all, by the xvi<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of this present moneth.</p>
            <p>Now the God of mercie and comfort be with you, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
all the breaches of this poor Kingdom and Church,
I am Sir,</p>
