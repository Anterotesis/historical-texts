            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Too much playing with the phantaſie, (the diſeaſe of theſe times) marreth a good vnderſtanding.

Many are ſo rauiſhed with their owne anticks, and conceit of their owne knowledge, and all-ſufficiency, that it is enough for them to heare for va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie, and compariſon ſake, new inſtruments, new voyces, to looke the Preacher in the face, but in the meane while, like Cut-purſes, to haue their ſacrilegious hands in his pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and to ſalue the ſmarting ſore with a dinner or a ſupper, ſawced with oyly words, with deceitfull hollow courteſies, which fill the eye and the phantaſie (bewitchingly) but drie vp the bloud in the veines; for wee are fooles, but they are wiſe. <hi>Their heart goeth after their pride, after their couetouſneſſe, Ezech. 33. 31.</hi> Plenty of the word hath bred loathing thereof, and plenty of Preachers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of them.

               </gap>, they are armed in the ſtrongeſt fort. For the hand of God doth all, that men might feare before him, and not leane to their owne wiſedome. Yet vaine man would be wiſe, ſeeing he is but a wild Aſſes Colt, ſaith <hi>Iob.</hi> He would be happy, being but a maſſe of mortalities. For being the moſt compound and vniuerſall nature, as concerning his plaſme, and ſo the moſt excellent by creation, he is the moſt miſerable by degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. <hi>Nam bonum optimum corruptum fit peſſimum.</hi> And how much greater then is the corruption of his ſpirit? That is to be ſeene by the corruption of the moſt excellent ſpirit. Both haue their reſtraints, and limitations; yet hath not God left man in deſperation, but in his eternall wiſedome prouided meanes of reſtauration, which here is begun, and there finiſhed, whence the Authour of corruption fell. This reſtauration is firſt the renouation, or change of the centre, the roote of man, I meane his heart or ſpirit of his minde; then of his ſpirits veſſell, I meane the brutall nature, or inferiour part, which I take to be the ſperme, or quinteſſence of the vniuerſe, and then are all things renued with him; <hi>2 Cor. 5. 17.</hi> Felicity therefore is here to be had, and by the holy endeauours of renewed wiſedome to be obtained. But this good in this vale of miſery is imperfect, yet in continuall motion, and progreſſe to perfection, though the whole en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine with all the furniture thereof, man, and euery condition and ſtate of life, ethike, politike, eccleſiaſtike, groane vnder the burthen of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Here then is wiſedome and worke for the curious Alchymiſt, who ſurpaſſeth common capacities. Here is the skill that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth gall out of hony, and hony out of gall. Here is the Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſtone, that turneth yron that baſe mettall, into gold the pureſt mettall, euen the ſoueraigne good that ouercommeth euill, yea, that turneth things in their natures curſed, into bleſſings, the beginnings of endleſſe torments into eternall glory, the light that expelleth dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the life that ſwalloweth vp death, the ſpirit that weareth out the leproſie, canker, and rottenneſſe of the ſpirit, of the veſſell, of the
<pb facs="tcp:3539:7"/>
perſon, of the outward ſtate. To omit the many learned dotages of the worldly wiſe, and madneſſes of ſelfe-willed Idiots; ſome man thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth himſelfe happy, if he knoweth the euils of this life, and with all hath knowledge to auoid them, and in procuring of good vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for his bodily eaſe, comfort, and pleaſure, thinkes that by this wiſedome he hath obtained the chiefe good, and ſo kiſſeth his hand, and ſacrificeth to his net, his ſubtle, ſound pate, as he iudgeth. Here is his vttermoſt extent, in this ſphere is he rowled as the Sow in the mire. Secondly, ſome man againe eſteemeth ſuch a one but brutiſhly ſubtle, becauſe he doth not good to others as well as to himſelfe, as the principle of humanity requireth; <hi>Quod tibi vis fieri, fac alijs,</hi> Doe as thou wouldeſt be done to. Therefore becauſe he is cautelous, and prouident for himſelfe, and communicateth to others alſo, he iudgeth himſelfe to be that happy man. He excelleth indeed the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer brute, as he againe doth that vegetable one; <hi>Eccles. 4. 8.</hi> euen as the ayre excelleth the water, and that the earth. But the wiſedomes of theſe three conioyned by vnion into one indiuiduall, are but as an excellent veſſell, or receptacle for this laſt. Laſtly, another who is truly wiſe indeed, excludeth this man from happineſſe yet, becauſe he is but as a beautifull body without a quickning ſpirit, which is pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the ſoule or ſupernaturall ſpirit, enlining the reſt. So that neither the wiſe vegetable, nor the wiſe brutall or ſenſible, nor the wiſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable or humane, but the wiſe ſpirituall organized with the reſt (as I may ſay) is onely capable of this ſoueraigne good of <hi>Solomon.</hi> This onely knoweth what is good in euill things and ſtates, what euill in good things and States, what is good for himſelfe in both, in this vaine life, according to that line and meaſure that God dealeth to man. This wiſedome ordereth and enliueth the other wiſedomes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſupernaturall gift, the diuine influence of the ſanctifying Spirit: For they being ſeuered from this, are but an eye without the optike ſpirit, which indeed is no eye, but a dead member. The like we ſee in the ſtructure of mans veſſell, <hi>id eſt,</hi> in the vegetable and brutall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, but the reaſonable ſoule enliueth, moueth, and ordereth them both, or rather her ſelfe in and by them, by vertue of her vnion with them, whereby they become rationall.</p>

               <hi>1.</hi> To be in a calling, according to Gods generall decree; <hi>Gen. 3. 19.</hi> Otherwiſe a man is a <hi>belial,</hi> a ſluggard, a diſſolute, diſperſt, incompact member, out of fauour with God and man, and his owne conſcience, and lyeth open to many miſeries, as he is the fitteſt ſubiect to be <hi>ſentina malorum,</hi> the ſinke of euils.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> To labour in that lawfull calling, to exerciſe his talent, that his Lord may receiue his owne with aduantage.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> To labour with diligence, <hi>Chapter 9. 10.</hi> of this booke. Hereby many bodily miſeries, and occaſions of ſpirituall temptations alſo are auoyded. For a man to be negligent in his buſineſſe, is to be brother to a waſter, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith elſe where.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> To comfort and ſolace the body with the fruits of our labours, all the creatures from the higheſt heauen to the centre of the earth, ſeruing to no other purpoſe then the reparation &amp; conſeruation of the ſoules fraile, corruptible veſſell: For the ſoule her ſelf is enliued, fed &amp; conſerued by another World, the Word of God effectuall by the ſpirit that ſpeaketh therein. The body is <hi>ex limo terrae,</hi> of the ſlime or ſeede of the vniuerſe; but the ſoule is <hi>ex alia propagine, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5.</hi> As we haue receiued good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo to be faithfull diſpenſers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>viz.</hi> to communicate to others, wherein the eſſence of charity conſisteth. Communicating of mutuall duties, is the bond of ciuill or ſociable life, whereby a man in any condition of life, in harmefull occurrences, and vnfortunate accidents, is preſerued, helped, relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and the beneuolous aſpect of neighbours congratulating his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous ſtate, is a lightſome, pleaſant, and comfortable thing. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, <hi>danti dabitur, &amp; qua menſura metimini, vobis metietur.</hi> But this communicating is of all gifts and duties, towards equals, ſuperiours, and inferiours, euen of euery one in their place and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling towards others, in oeconomike, ethike, politike ſtate. Thus farre the Heathen man goeth, but here he makes a ſtand, he cannot tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend his Orbe. All things are made for man, ſaith <hi>Cicero,</hi> and man is borne for man, to be ſeruiceable and comfortable one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſociable life. Therefore all theſe degrees doe but as it were conſtitute the veſſell of the quickning ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>6.</hi> The ſixt and laſt degree therefore of felicity, is piety towards God, ſincerity in diuine worſhip, briefly ſhut vp in this word, <hi>Feare</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3539:8"/>
               <hi>God, and keepe his Commandements.</hi> It is <hi>totum hominis,</hi> or <hi>totus homo,</hi> the whole man, without which he is but <hi>praeſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſimum brutum.</hi> What this feare, and obedience is, is ſet downe in the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> at large, which is more largely and plainely expounded by the Prophets, and they againe by the life and doctrine of our Sauiour Chriſt, and that againe by the Apoſtles, and they by Paſtors and Teachers to the Worlds end. This is that compleate ſoueraigne good, of ſoule, body, and ſtate, poſitiuely taught in this Treatiſe. Which in a word is this, the wiſe demeanor of a man to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himſelfe, towards others, towards God, in things concerning his owne body, and perſon, concerning communicating, or ſympathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing others, concerning diuine worſhip according to the direction of Gods Word. Theſe degrees muſt not be ſundered, but kept intire of him that would be compleatly happy, ſo farre forth as happineſſe can be obtained in this confuſed, enormous World. Men being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of this ſixe-fold vnion, fall into many errours, run out into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny extremities, and plunge themſelues into a gulfe of miſeries, yea, and digladiate among themſelues, prayſing, diſprayſing, blaming, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing they know not what, euen toſſed in a labyrinth. But he that builds on this ground, and walketh in this light, riddeth himſelfe and others out of many, euen infinite errours, and miſeries of this vaine life. One man will be very deuout and zealous, but what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences runneth he into, when he neglests his particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? and of the practiſe of how many duties and goods that by him might be done, is he depriued? <hi>Cert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in quo peccaueris, in eodem puniêris.</hi> Wherein a man ſinneth, therein ſhall he be puniſhed; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, debt, impriſonment, &amp;c. ſhall fall vpon him, and the obiecting of his profeſſion to ſcandall, is no ſmall matter. <hi>Sed peccat in tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiorem partem;</hi> But I ſay, what inforceth that offence at all? He that ſaith, <hi>Deum timè,</hi> feare God; ſaith alſo, <hi>Mandata eius ſerua,</hi> Keepe his commandements; whereof diligent labour in a calling is one. For want whereof a man omitteth much good, and offers himſelfe to many temptations, and ſnares. Another labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth diligently, and worſhippeth God, but neglects the duties of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, whereof in theſe dayes there are not a few. Saint <hi>Iames</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playneth of ſuch. Another inſiſting on duties of charity, neglecteth the duties of piety. But to reckon vp the extremities, and errours
<pb facs="tcp:3539:8"/>
of men in the breach of this vnion, which yet would all be wiſe, and ſeeme happy to themſelues, is an endleſſe worke. A ſound and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſpirit within a man, is better then a World of Bookes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, that thoſe few leaues of the Goſpell by him penned, among a World of Bookes that might haue beene made of Chriſts ſayings and doings, are ſufficient, what needeth more? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the whole Scriptures, nor the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>olumes of the Fathers, nor what can be vttered by voyce, can preuaile, where an heart is wanting. And who can giue man an vnderſtanding heart, but God onely? yet are men preſumptuous, therefore they come not to the fountaine of wiſedome, and ſo liue and die in vanity. Thus haue I briefly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the very life, and ſubſtance of this Treatiſe of the wiſe and aged King, whoſe ſentences, though they ſeeme to be difficult and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, collected by ſome that haue taken them from his mouth, vpon occaſions vttered; yet are they doubtleſſe a continued ſpeech, purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly penned, euery thing orderly cohearing, and methodically colliming at the ſame obiect. The more wiſe and aged, moſt commonly the leſſe diſcourſiue; and much talking is tedious, their ſentences are briefe, fundamentall, and pithy, and their words ſeeme oft times very independent. Beſides this, <hi>Solomon,</hi> without regard to artificiall ſtructure, vttereth his experiments, and that from the heart to the heart, not from the braine to the eare, (as common vſe among many is in theſe heartleſſe dayes) and alſo as the ſanctifying Spirit of God moued him. Therefore are his words pure without tincture, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of ſpirituall relliſh, and without any taſte of the caske. For his maine drift is to caſt man wholly out of himſelfe, that he might be found in Chriſt alone, or elſe be vtterly loſt. <hi>Cap. 12. 13. Phil. 3. 8. 9. 10.</hi>

            <p>Now my earneſt deſire, reuerend, religious, and learned Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, louers of learning, ſpeciall fauourers, and friends of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and vertuous, is, that you would iudge theſe labours of mine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, worthy your acceptation, rather valuing the ſame in your generous ſpirits, according to the mind of him that honoureth, and loueth your vertues, then reſpecting the dignity of the worke it ſelfe, which notwithſtanding ſhall be ſuch like as it ſhall pleaſe you to accept, and the Lord to worke by it in the hearts of the Readers without whoſe quickning Spirit, the whole Scripture is but a dead

letter, but into whoſe noſtrils the Lord ſhall breathe againe the breath of eternall life, it is to them no noſe of waxe, as the Papiſts ſay, but a plaine euen way, a lanterne to the feete, a light to the paths. Howſoeuer, we are vnto God the ſweet ſauour of Chriſt in them that are ſaued, and in them that periſh; <hi>2 Cor. 2. 15.</hi> And vnto you this publike teſtimony of my obſeruance, and loue for your loue to our gifts and calling, I truſt ſhall be acceptable; which I ſhall recompence againe with my continuall and hearty prayers to Almighty God, the Father of lights, and fountaine of all good, that the true felicity and chiefe good reuealed to, and penned by <hi>Solomon,</hi> and here explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, may be plentifully conferred vpon you, to your greateſt comfort here in your ſpirits, ſoules, bodies, ſtates, and perfect glory of all in the Kingdome of glory.</p>

All things are moſt vaine,</hi> becauſe man can reape no profit, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation of minde, no quietneſſe of heart of all the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, cares, labours of body and minde, wherewith in vaine he wearieth himſelfe all the dayes of his life. The argument is figured by a <hi>communication</hi> or queſtion, to intimate the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and infallible truth thereof: For both the ignorant and the wiſe, euen euery man that commeth into the World, is wholly carried with an opinion of an earthly felicity; to the obtaining whereof, there is, as he iudgeth, an aptitude in man, and a poſſibility in the things of the World. The moſt learned and wiſeſt placed it, ſome in diuine contemplation without the word of God, ſome in morall vertue onely, ſome in vertue and worldly proſperity together, ſome in riches, ſome in honour, ſome in one thing, ſome in another. And euery man feeling manifold miſeries, troubles, and wants, wherewith he is compaſſed and filled, doth imagine to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a poſſibility of deliuery and freedome on the one ſide, and an happy enioying of the contrary good on the other ſide. Ah that I were freed once from this, or that; if I had but this, or that; I could doe this, or that; I would euen deſire no more; I ſhould thinke my ſelfe happy, &amp;c. doth euery man imagine. Hereupon hee beginneth to buckle himſelfe to his worke, to gather his wits together, to beſtirre his ſtumps, and either ruſheth violently forward, as the Horſe ruſheth into the battaile; or elſe he proceedeth warily, wiſely, fundamentally, as they that ſpend all in ſearching out the Philoſophers ſtone, but neuer finde it. Of thoſe <hi>Zophar,</hi> one of <hi>Iobs</hi> kinſmen ſaith; <hi>Iob</hi> 11. 12. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aine man would be wiſe, though man be borne like a wild Aſſes Colt.</hi> The reaſons of this vaine proiect, are</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe man cannot looke beyond the world; he is confined within the limits of the Spheres, hee is in bondage vnder the curſe; his <hi>phronema, mens,</hi> or pureſt wiſedome, is

nothing elſe but luſt, or brutality. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>All that is in this world, as the luſt of the fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not of the Father, but of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> But man knoweth not this his miſery, and how than ſhall hee know the right way to be rid out of it? So than euery natural man is a foole. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 22. <hi>A beaſt; Ier.</hi> 10. 14. <hi>A wild Aſſes colt; Iob</hi> 11. 12.</p>
               <p>Secondly, being but a foole, a beaſt, a wild Aſſe, hee loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth on the glory, the riches, and the beauty of the world, and iudgeth according to the outward appearance thereof, neither conſidering the vanity that is in himſelfe, nor that which is in the creatures: For Sathan taketh away his heart, and bewitcheth him with the pleaſant ſhewes of that which is not. So he ſet the World before the eyes of Chriſt, in a glorious ſhew or viſion, to rauiſh him with the loue thereof: So he ſet before the eyes of our firſt Parents a better &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier ſtate, than that wherein God had placed them. Thus he doth with euery man; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. He is the God of this world, blinding the eyes of men with the ſhew of a worldly glory and felicity, that the true glory and felicity of the Goſpell might not appeare to them, but rather ſeeme ignominious, baſe, and contemptible: That he ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>olleth, and preferreth, this he debaſeth, and ſuppreſſeth by all meanes, as we ſee how he worketh in and by his inſtruments, worldly minded men. The like to this we ſee in the flickering painted Harlot, who by her ſubtle ſhewes, lookes, geſtures, glaunces, rauiſheth the young man hee knoweth not with what vehement fancies. <hi>Amor tollit de cardine mentem.</hi> He looketh at her, he longeth after her, he dreameth on her, ſhee is as an Angell in his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; the full poſſeſſion of her is his felicity: But when hee findeth by experience that this felicity is nothing but the ſtocks, poxe, and gallowes, ſhee is now a loathſome carrion, and as a ſcab'd vlcerous iade, and a limme of the Diuell to company with.</p>
               <p>Whence commeth this deluſion? Firſt, it ariſeth out of mans owne vaine heart, and is cheriſhed by Satans fotures. The ſicke and weakly, thinketh the ſtrong and healthfull happy. The deformed, admireth the beautifull. The poore
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3539:12"/>
bleſſeth the rich. The ignorant and baſe, admire the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and men of authority and power. The pleaſant ſeate, ſumptuous buildings, gorgeous apparrell, delicious fare, proud attendance, variable delights and pleaſures of the rich, rauiſh the minde of him that lacketh theſe. He lookes on theſe, and pineth, iudging according to the outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. <hi>Sed latet anguis in herba.</hi> Hee conſidereth not the vanity, and ſorrow of this ſplendide miſery, this beautifull Harlot. It is like a beautifull picture drawne with white and red colours in ſackcloth, which afarre off is very louely, but neere by it is like the filthy matter of a ſore or wound, puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent rottenneſſe, or the backe of a galled Horſe. No man euer yet found any conſtant contentation in any ſtate: yet may his outward appearance deceiue others, and anothers him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, therefore this deluſion ariſeth from the vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorie and pompe of the world, deceiuing, and being decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. It is the common corruption of man to pride, to boaſt, to ſet forth himſelfe, to bleſſe himſelfe, as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith; to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and couer his vanitie from others, to draw them into admiration of him, and to be admired of others is his ioy and delight: For their falſe teſtimony of his happineſſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigateth, rather blindeth the ſight of his vanitie, or miſeries from himſelfe, (for of thoſe doth euery carnall man deſire to be inſenſible, that he may more freely reioyce, and ſolace himſelfe in the fleſh.) Who is the happy man? ſaith <hi>Craeſus</hi> to <hi>Solon.</hi> Euery one flattered him, and if this Philoſopher had done the like, he would euen haue runne madde, and ruſht, as <hi>Alexander</hi> did, out of mankinde into the ranke of the gods. To what purpoſe did <hi>Ezechiah</hi> ſhew all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of his Kingdome to the Embaſſadours of the King of <hi>Babel? Eſay</hi> 39. 2. And what one man almoſt in the world hauing friends come to his houſe, doth not the like? See an example hereof in <hi>Haman, Heſt.</hi> 5. 10. 11, 12. Wee would all ſeeme to haue this imagined worldly happineſſe, faine would we bleſſe our ſelues, and be admired of others: But we are but proud bankerupts, gentlemen to day, feſtiuall and gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous, and to morrow beggars, and caſt into priſon. All is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3539:13"/>
but the crackling of thornes vnder a pot, a great flame, a loud noyſe, light aſhes, follie, vanitie, nothing. To conclude, euery naturall man imagineth that profit, yea, <hi>jithron,</hi> durable profit, is to be found and wrought out by wit and labour in the world. There is a felicity to be had, and all mens ſtudy is to find out the right way to attaine it: He thinketh his game to be good, if hee can but rightly play his cards. If but one poore tradeſman hath gotten goods together, and through the increaſe of a ſmall ſtocke, hath at length made a great purchaſe, and left it to his heire, who ſtill increaſeth it, and putteth his ſonne to the Innes of Court, &amp;c. whereby he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth a gentleman, and ſo forward, than are all beggars in hope. This one example ſerueth to cut off all deſpaire, and impoſſibility; yea, prouoketh a thought of the like proiect, that lyeth dead in the bottome of the braine. But if the world beginne to runne a little on the beggars ſide, his hope is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently kindled, thought ariſeth after thought, and calleth vp this dead proiect, his bloud riſeth, his pulſes begin to beate, as he that hath found a purſe full of gold, he ſtirres about, his heart panteth, his minde is in the top of the world, why may he not be a <hi>Tamerlane?</hi> But of Gods Kingdome and glorie there is no thought at all in him. Doth any man doubt of this that I ſay? Why doe men ſo ſtudy, and breake their braines night and day for preferment? Why do they ſo wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry themſelues with heaping vp riches? Why doe they ſo climbe to honors? And why doe they euen ſell their ſoules and bodies to the Diuell, to obtaine worldly prerogatiues, if there were no profit, no contentation, no felicity in them? Surely they doe not thinke that they are filling a bottome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe tub, but fore-caſt great profit, pleaſure, and contentment of minde to ariſe of their labours hereafter; which thing the rich man, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. vainely boaſted of. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 11. <hi>Their inward thought is,</hi> (the vaine imagination of euery carnall heart) <hi>that their houſes ſhall continue for euer, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.</hi> Euery man knowes that he ſhall die, yet hee laboureth and ſtriueth, and putteth off from day to day, as though hee ſhould liue for euer. The Diuell ſo bewitcheth him, yea, ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3539:13"/>
away his heart, that hee knoweth, and neuer thinketh what he knoweth; he beleeueth, and doubteth: Therefore ſaith <hi>Dauid, Lord teach me to number my dayes, that I may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie my heart to wiſedome.</hi> The manifold glaunces, ejaculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and fancies that luſt ſuggeſteth, and Sathan ingeſteth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the minde of man, are ſtrange and wonderfull: But it is more ſtrange, that contrary to the truth, which he heareth, ſeeth, knoweth, they ſhould carry him away, at leaſt make him a mindleſſe, dreaming, vnprofitable wanderer, like a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the winde, without all reſolution. The caſe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: A foole hath alwayes a knaue attending on him; hee heareth his friend truely counſelling, and carefully admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, he knoweth him to be without deceit; yet the knaue whom he ſuſpecteth and feareth, carrieth him away. A foole is bound to his luſt, the diuell and the knaue worke vpon the luſt, which hee calleth humouring, and ſo catch the foole.</p>

When we looke vpon the earth, let vs remember our birth and buriall. Our bodies, names and workes ſhall be all alike, euen as the duſt blowne into the ſea with the winde, and as the ſmoake vaniſhed in the ayre.

               <p>THe ſecond particular. As the generations of man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for whom all other things were made, are not durable, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are the things of man, his counſels, and acts durable, but new generations differing from the former ſucceede: ſo likewiſe the Heauens, the Sunne and other Starres are reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in their motions, and changeable in their courſes; ſo that when we looke vpon the Sunne, or but open our eyes to behold the light, we may cleerely ſee the Sunne acting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, as it were on the ſtage of the firmament, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtedfaſt condition and periſhing ſtate of man, hauing his circular motion, after the ſimilitude of the heauens, yea, and alſo cauſed by the heauens, which are ſecond cauſes or vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall inſtruments of God for the foture of all things, both elements and elementarie bodies, and in that reſpect may well be called the <hi>baſis</hi> or firmament of the world. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily by accident, that is, by reaſon of corruptibilitie, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, want of vigour in the creature, and in man aboue the reſt, which is the effect of the curſe denounced, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. they are the conſumers, and deſtroyers of all things. For as the Sunne is the generall inſtrument, or moſt remote cauſe of generation and preſeruation, <hi>(Sol et homo generat hominem,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle,)</hi> ſo by accident it corrupteth, and deſtroyeth all things, and that both by his diurnall and annuall reuolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>to wit,</hi> from Eaſt to Weſt, from South to North, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Day and Night, Summer and Winter, with other ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the day and yeare.</p>
               <p>To conclude: The life of man as concerning his bodily ſtate, is a continuall paſſage from the wombe whence it iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth, to the graue into which it falleth, as the Sunne ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to riſe out of the earth, and to deſcend into the earth; and man in his iſſue or progenie may be ſaid to returne cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly againe, with the Sunne, out of the earth, out of the wombe into the horizon, into the world. Againe, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his outward ſtate, he hath his aſcending, &amp; deſcending,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3539:15"/>
birth, and buriall with the Sunne. For there is no conſtancie of any ſtate, or kindred, though one continue longer than another, as the Oake out-liueth the Aſhe, and the Aſhe the Willow, yet all dye, and vaniſh in their time: For the Lord raiſeth vp the poore out of the duſt, and the needy out of the dunghill, that hee may ſet him with Princes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113. Againe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. 40. <hi>He poureth contempt vpon Princes, and cauſeth them to wander in the wilderneſſe, where there is no way,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 7. <hi>He maketh poore, and maketh rich, hee bringeth lowe, and lifteth vp.</hi> So that with the Sunne there is a double motion of mankinde; one of life, which is diurnall, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſtate, which is annuall, I meane, the houſe, or king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of longeſt continuance. Laſtly, in this certaine and ſtedfaſt motion there is nothing but vncertaintie, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtedfaſtneſſe, therefore no felicitie but vanitie.</p>

               <p>THe third particular. As the Sunne is wheeled about with reſtleſſe motion, ſo are the windes alſo whirled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout according to their manifold circuits.

So that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we be in a dead ſleepe, drunke with ſenceleſſe carnality, we cannot but remember the brittleneſſe of our bodies, the incertainty of our liues, the inſtability of our ſtates, and all things with vs running in their circuits; as the windy exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations aſcending out of the earth to the region of the cloudes, are from thence flung backe by contrary and diſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant qualities, and ſo run circularly in the aire from South to North, or from what places ſoeuer they ariſe, towards the ſame places againe.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3539:16"/>

               <p>THe fourth particular. Not onely the winds ariſe, make a noyſe for a little ſeaſon, and then die, after which others ariſe againe in like ſort; but the waters alſo are circularly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, by perpetuall ingreſſe and regreſſe, into the ſeate, and from the ſeate of waters, the Sea. As the Sea is the receptacle of freſh waters, ſo doe her ſalt waters re<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>paſſe through the veines, and conduit pipes of the earth, ſtrained and qualified by diuers Mines, and tempers of mould of magneticall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which appeareth in this, that the Sea is not filled. For the earth thirſteth for moiſture, and attracteth from the Sea, as the hand, fingers, toes, and all members doe blood from the liuer, by many net-like veines ramified all ouer, which breake through the breaſts of poroſe and rocky hilles, through clefts of quarries, and ſo runne downe into the Sea, from whence they came: Whereof aroſe that ſpeech, He that kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not the way to the Sea, let him ſeeke for a Riuer to be his guide. As it is no maruell that the bloud ſhould aſcend out of the liuer to the higher parts of the body; no more wonder is it, that the waters ſhould ſpring out of the high mountaines, as milke doth out of womens breaſts, ſeeing that the earth, nay, whole nature is magneticall, or alchymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall. Wee maruell not that bloud and milke ſhould be ſweete, though we eate ſalt meats, and as little cauſe haue we to maruell at the other. The Fiſhes of the Sea are freſh, not ſalt; for the Sea is their element, as the earth is to her crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: And when a creature beginneth to reſemble his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3539:16"/>
it is a token of diſſolution, as when blew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> greene, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low colours, &amp;c. beginne to appeare in the fleſh, which we call earthly, and dead colours. So ſprings and torrents are the fruits of the Sea, or rather the Sea is the aliment of the earths body, which conuerteth her ſalt waters into milke, for the nouriſhing of all that ſpring out of her wombe. Or, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thinketh, that the waters are conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into liquid, or rorid ayre, which is ſuckt in of the earth, by her magneticall thirſt, and congealed into many diſperſed ſmall droppes, as moiſture attracted through the poroſe and ſupple bladder becommeth a torrent of vrine: which va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours gathering together in the veines of the earth, for that purpoſe ordained of God, breake forth of the hilles. But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the former doctrine, theſe drops are rather eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated and ſweat out from thoſe veines, to ſuſtaine and moiſten the rootes of vegetables in the vpper parts of the earth. As for the attraction of liquid ayre, dewes, and raines, the earth hath her <hi>Syſtolen, &amp; Diaſtolen,</hi> her dilatation and conſtriction, which wee call the breath in liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſhee continually draweth in, and ſendeth out. Liuing creatures alſo are not onely fedde by the roote of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, but by the ayre drawne in, and ſent forth by the breath, which is temperature of the hearts heate, nutritiue of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall and vitall ſpirits. and purgatiue of vnnaturall vapours. As the humours haue their purgatiue paſſages, ſo haue the ſpirits. The eare is a purgatiue veſſell, as well as the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of hearing; and ſo of the other ſenſes. To conclude, which way ſoeuer this paſſage of Riuers is, they returne from whence they came; and ſuch a circular motion is there of man, and all humane things: Therefore in this world there is no firme ground for man to build vpon; But the ſecureſt man, and the ſureſt ſtate ſhall be diſſolued, diſperſed, and brought to naught: Wherefore let euery wiſe man build vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rocke Ieſus Chriſt, and his worke ſhall remaine for euer.</p>

               </head>
               <p>A Generall concluſion of all the particulars. As the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations of men, the heauens, the windes, the waters, are reſtleſſe; ſo are all things in their kindes inconſtant, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory, fleeting. They trauaile in paine with man, they groane vnder the burden of corruption with him; and their diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, enmity, infirmity, miſery, corruption, vanity, ſheweth forth to man that he is euen ſuch like; yea, his condition is worſe then theirs: For whatſoeuer is within man, is without him; and whatſoeuer is without him, is within him. So that whereſoeuer he turneth his eyes, he may behold his vanity. The plaſme, or veſſell of mans ſoule, is his brutall nature, which we call the body, which is the centre of the world, or vnion of the whole, or an vniuerſall nature, wherein all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars are vnited. For doe we not ſee how euery creature is the <hi>Chaos</hi> to his ſeede, as the matter whence it firſt ariſeth and iſſueth, and the ſeede againe is the <hi>Chaos</hi> of the creature that ariſeth, and iſſueth thereout, <hi>whoſe members,</hi> as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>are faſhioned day by day, when as yet there was none of them? Pſal.</hi> 139. 16. Therefore of man there is a twofold Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, one of his body into members, another of his bodily nature into coſmicall parts or natures, whereof he is termed the little world. As man hath a ſimilitude, and proportion of members with all liuing creatures, ſo hath he alſo of their natures, and is an vnion or mixture of their natures. So that man is the text, and euery word in this text hath his Gloſſe, or Common-Place, <hi>to wit,</hi> ſome creature to explicate &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt it. He that would know the worke of the Spirit in the ſimples, the heauens and elements, might know it in the compounds, and how one compound is of like, or vnlike conditure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> affected, and diſaffected to another, kinde vnto kinde, and kindes among themſelues. All things in their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were placed in ſubordinate order, both in themſelues, and in reſpect of others; but by the curſe was that diſſolued, and contrary <hi>ataxie,</hi> or diſorder, and confuſion brought vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3539:17"/>
them. To proceede, the creatures of one element haue the proportion, and ſimilitude of the creatures of another element, and is the ſame as neere as the matter, and condition of the element will affoord. And euery element hath his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of creatures, whereof one commeth neerer to mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than another; and one is more particular and vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall than another: but all are full of enmity, impotency, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, vanity. Therefore in the creatures a man may behold his condition, his qualities, his ſhame, his brutiſhneſſe, his miſery, his vanity. For being the moſt compound, and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall nature, he is ſubiect to moſt corruptions, infirmities, diſeaſes, paines, aches, yea, to all the vanities, and miſeries of all the creatures, but yet according to the manner of his vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or mixture, whereby he is indiuiduated, and differenced from all. Hence it is that naturall men in the Scriptures are compared to beaſts. For this brutality is mans nakedneſſe; <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 7. ſhewing forth it ſelfe moſt in thoſe parts. When a man keepeth himſelfe in his ſpirit, his nakedneſſe is couered; when he breaketh forth into paſſions, yeelding to his brutall plaſme, <hi>id eſt,</hi> veſſell or body, his ſhame is diſcouered: but when his ſpirit ſeeketh to ſatisfie it in the luſts thereof, as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picures doe, he is a very beaſt, and worſe than a beaſt. For a beaſt is but his plaſme, his veſſell is himſelfe, but man hath a ſpirit to gouerne his veſſell, to couer his ſhame, of which he is termed a man. But mans naturall ſpirit is falſe, a diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler,
an ignorant, impotent, vaine. It couereth ſhame indeed, but with a net, nay, with a menſtrous cloth. For as he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide to be likened to a beaſt, ſo he ſtriueth to make himſelfe glorious, and by dignifying his perſon, and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his body, and by diſguiſing and masking his beſtiality, to beget and maintaine in the minds of men a reuerend and diuine eſtimation of him. This is indeede neceſſary for all men to doe, as the light of nature teacheth, and for Princes and Gouernours eſpecially; yet cannot the Blackmoore change his skinne, nor the Leopard his ſpots. Yea, in ſeeking to couer ſhame, he moſt of all layeth it open, (not knowing ſo much) as our apparell now adayes, and the putting on thereof doth teſtifie; and in ſeeking to auoide brutality, and to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3539:18"/>
be as a God in the eyes and mindes of men, hee moſt of a l runneth into brutalitie, and becommeth a <hi>Leuiathan, Behe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth,</hi> the moſt beaſtlie of all men. It is the ſpirit of God that renueth, not couering, but taking away ſhame, not diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, masking, and colouring, but transforming. Chriſt was not naked, nor aſhamed: In him are we built vp new againe, our leproſie cleanſed, and the workes of the Deuill are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued; He that is in him, neede not be aſhamed of any thing, though the world count it ſhame to be in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16.

               <p>
                  <hi>All things are full of labour.</hi> By <hi>things,</hi> hee meaneth, 1. All Creatures. 2. All Actions and humaine affaires, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee ſtriueth for this imaginary happineſſe, like a foole, a madde man, a wilde Aſſes colt. By <hi>Labour,</hi> he meaneth the ſphericall motion, the inſtability of things riſing, decaying fading, fainting, falling, fraile, and impotent; vncertaine, and corruptible, inordinate, and full of enuy, one againſt another, and all againſt man; and thoſe that are in ſome ſort obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and ſeruiceable to man, are full of croſſenes, auknes, and vncertainty, and ſo are men among themſelues, in all their courſes and actions. As there is no bond of loue, ſo there can be no coordination or co-working of things together for mans good, nor of men among themſelues for their owne good. All is rents, ragges, and diſtractions: Euery thing is for it ſelfe, and euery man is for himſelfe, as a ragge or peece rent out of a garment, or limbe cut off, imagining a felicitie to himſelfe, but by this meanes running into Gods curſe, and mans hatred. Euery man ſtriueth to make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, or to bring in a confluence of all things, <hi>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But againſt euery hill there is a dale, God hath ſet aduerſitie ouer-againſt proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, euery thing is croſſe, and peruerſe, and runneth out into
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3539:18"/>
extremities, quite out of created harmonie, and concord. There can no happie contentation be at all obtained indeed, but by their reconciliation, ſoliditie and conſtancie. But that can neuer be in ſtate of corruption, all things are ſo vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, croſſe, and fraile, yea, ſo rotten, like an old houſe, or corrupt body, that one part being repaired, another falleth downe, and one ſoare being cured, two breake out in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place. Hee therefore that laboureth to make this apt concurrence of things to obtaine his imagined happineſſe, doth but goe about to gather together wilde beaſts of all ſorts, that runne out on euery ſide, and being with infinite labour gotten together, will deuoure one another, or elſe all ſet vpon him; and to bring many men together to effect a worke, that are at variance among themſelues, and all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to him.</p>
               <p>Concerning humaine affaires, they are full of alterations and changes. Common-wealths, priuate ſtates, publike buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, domeſticall workes, and actions, are full of inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, vncertaintie, croſſeneſſe, trouble and griefe. Such croſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is there in euery thing, ſo manifold euents contrarie to mans intendments, that the beſt gameſter hath commonly the worſt lucke: And euen thoſe things, whereof mans wiſedome and prouidence ſeeme to haue moſt power and command, doe fluctuate vpon vncertaine iſſues, in ſo much that he is altogether vncertaine, whether his intents ſhall ſucceede at all, and how, and whether they ſhall turne to his benefit, or hinderance, to the raiſing vp of himſelfe, or ouerthrow of himſelfe, and that which to day hee hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely determined, is to morrow through vnknowne oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curences changed and quite diſanulled. To conclude: Of all theſe vanities, there is a conſtant reuolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Man cannot vtter it.</hi> An illuſtration by a compariſon of the <hi>Leſſe.</hi> The reuolution, inſtabilitie, vncertaintie, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of man in himſelfe, in his eſtate, in all his wayes, and imaginations, and alſo of the creatures with him, is more than man by word or writing is able to expreſſe. How vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, and vnknowne are the ordinances of Heauen? And who hath ſet the dominion thereof in the earth? <hi>Iob</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:3539:19"/>
38. 33. Who can foretell the ſeaſons of the yeare by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable configurations of the ſtarres? Yet hath God ſet them for times, and ſeaſons. And one vnſeaſonable Summer, or Winter, Seed time or harueſt, turneth all mens ſtates vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide downe, inriching one, and impoueriſhing another. Now the ſeede rotteth with too much moiſture; than both graſſe and graine is ſcorched with heat, and how ſlipperie is monie, and cattle vncertaine? Man and his eſtate therefore ſtanding vpon ſuch foundations is altogether inſtable, and vncertaine. And how ſure a foundation is that of the windes and the waters? Yet the Marriner muſt apply and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelfe to them, he muſt obey them. Whether he ſhall returne home againe he knoweth not, nor when, nor which way, whether poore or rich. And whether the Sea, or Land be the ſafer habitation hee cannot determine. As the water ſwalloweth vp, ſo the fire deuoureth, danger is euery where. The continent is inconſtant, as the waters. <hi>For the earth is full of darkeneſſe, and cruell habitations. All the foundations of the earth are out of courſe.</hi> High-wayes, bye-wayes, and hedges are full of robbers, wilde beaſts, and ſerpents. A man is ſafe no where: One lyeth in waite for his tongue, another for his purſe, another for his body. Againe, things profitable, and good in their kinde ſometimes afford no profit to the owner, and ſometimes hurt. Contrarily, things of leaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and that are as it were made for euill, doe a man the moſt good. What is good, what ill for a man, by all his wiſedome he cannot certainly know, no not for a moment, and blinde hope is doubtfull and fearefull. Whence then is ioy and full contentation? How long could it laſt if a man had it? The heathen ſhewed forth this inſtabilitie and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie of mans eſtate, in their card-play, and dice-play. For theſe playes are nothing but a ſportfull imitation of Gods prouidence, vnder the names of chaunce and fortune, with a wiſe diſpoſing of thoſe chances for the moſt good, and leaſt loſſe, that fortune dealeth. The beſt play, ſo the beſt courſe, hath oft times the worſt euent, and contrarily. So chancefull, changeable, and vncertaine are all worldly things.</p>

Although the wiſeſt, and moſt exerciſed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the creatures, and humane affaires ſtriue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo much to ſatisfie his curioſitie in ſearching out the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne paths of God in all things, yet can he neuer finde it out, nor comprehend in minde the firme foundation of God in ſuch infinite contingencies, caſualties, inconſtancies, appearances, diſparences, courſes, and recourſes of all things: Yea, the counſels of God are ſo deepe, and his waies paſt finding out, that man imagineth that there is no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, nor gouernement at all, or that he ſwayeth great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters onely, which maketh him ſo truſt to his owne wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and prouidence, and thereby to worke out this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe conceiued in his vaine minde. Moreouer, the fraile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all creatures in themſelues, and miſchieuous diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons one againſt another, and all againſt man, are infinite. Euery thing is but a Lyon in the grate, their obedience is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
compulſion, not inward affection, as in their creation. But the frailty of mans body, inſtabilitie of his eſtate, the malice of his heart, the wickedneſſe of his actions againſt God and man, are wonderfull, his inuentions are innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. The wicked ſubtilties of a woman in inſnaring the fooliſh, and the madneſſe of fooles is endleſſe, <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith that hee could not comprehend it, <hi>Chapter</hi> 7. God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is able to deliuer a man. The miſeries, troubles, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe, vexations of man, in the beſt common-wealth, are manifold and great. Euery one is ſuſpitious, and afraid of other, the hearts of men are ſo deceitfull, their ſimulations, and diſſimulations ſo many, &amp; their diſpoſitions ſo variable. All things are carried by extremity, neither doth reaſon rule, nor good affection moue. And this is a common deceit in euery one, in euery matter to make an alledgement, &amp; ſhew of reaſon, and good will, when it is nothing but the awe of the Magiſtrate, or ſome other compulſion, or that one may make

vſe of another for the time. In which caſe euery one loueth himſelfe, but neuer one another. Miſchiefe, enuy, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is in the heart of euery one naturally. And a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticke regiment is a grate for wilde beaſts, euery one hauing an habitation by himſelfe, and Lawes are iron chaynes for madde men: If the chaynes were broken, and the grate bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp, we ſhould be as wilde beaſts in a forreſt. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny headie beaſts are there, craftie Foxes, ſubtle Serpents, that by monie, fauour, and all deuices ſeeke to wreſt, and cracke theſe chaynes? How many violent and moody beaſts, ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the ſides of the grate, making the houſe to ſhake in the parts, and ſometimes in the whole, euer waiting, watching, wiſhing, trying now and then to breake all open? This is the qualitie of euery wilde thing in hold. Surely if a man looke into the ſpirits of men, in their dealings and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblings, hee ſhall not onely ſee a forreſt of beaſts and ſerpents, but an hell of wickedneſſe and miſeries. All is ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loue and hatred: hence commeth ſuch feare and ſnatching; For otherwiſe men would not ſo much care in whoſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion the goods of the world were, ſeeing the reaſonable, wiſe, liberall, louing, and right diſpenſation thereof accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the law of nature, and of Chriſt. Thus it was for a little while, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 34. 35. but that feſtiuall day laſted not long, nay rather it laſteth ſtill among the faithfull, to the worlds end. But that is another argument. Here wee ſpeake of the condition of the darke and euill world, and the imaginarie deceitfull good thereof without Chriſt.</p>
               <p>To conclude: Hee that looketh on the frailty of man, and all the creatures with him, the interchangeable courſe of all things and ſtates, and conſidereth the depth of cauſes, and reaſon of things, ſhall be forced to ſeeke for felicitie, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable reſt, or happy contentment, ſomewhere elſe than in the confuſed, diſordered, tranſitory World: For all is <hi>vanitie,</hi> nothing, to none end, like the actions of a foole, and talke of a man in his dreame. This ſecret God reuealeth to his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ones: As for the men of the world, they will be wiſe, great, glorious, and doe great matters; they heare, they ſee, they liſten, they ſtudy, and ſtriue, imagining that by a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3539:20"/>
and deeper reach they ſhall finde good: For they are wilde aſſes colts. As the <hi>Spartanes</hi> indigitating or deifying <hi>Alexander,</hi> at his command, contrary to their owne liking, wrote; <hi>Becauſe Alexander will be a god, let him be a god:</hi> So I write; Becauſe theſe will be wiſe, will be great, will be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, will be what they will be; then let them be ſo. But <hi>Alexander</hi> dyed like a man, in the flower of his age: euen ſo there is more hope of a foole, than of one of theſe wiſe (mad) ones. To conclude: As the ſoule of man working eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by the organs of eye and eare, cannot finde perfect contentation in things and times abſent; neither euer ſhall it doe in time to come, for all things paſt, and to come are the ſame in their kindes, as the ſeaſons of the yeere are the ſame for euer: So that there is no poſſibility that the ſoule ſhould be ſatiſfied and filled with good in worldly things, through the miniſtery of the chiefeſt ſenſes, but rather with irkeſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wearineſſe and loathſomneſſe.</p>

There is a circular reuolution of all things, counſels, deeds, euents, as well as of the ſpheres of heauen, windes and riuers. There is a riſing, falling, aſcending, deſcending, appearance, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence of all things. Let the profoundeſt ſpeculatiſt, or curious practitioner, turne the edge of his wit which way he will to finde out ſome new thing, the like whereof was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer yet knowne, nor heard, yet ſure it is, the ſame things haue beene, and the ſame deedes were done of old, and they are nothing but the circular reuolutions of the former. The heart of man is the ſame that it hath beene of old, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth ſuch effects good or euill; it cannot alter it owne kinde, but is wheeled about in it owne ſphere. Some haue ſought for a felicity in the ſtudies of Wiſdome; ſome in riches and ſenſuall pleaſures; ſome in Honour, pompe and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence: but no man euer yet found contentment in his preſent eſtate, without mixture of griefe, griefe accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it, or ſorrow following him hard at heeles. Many haue thought, and thinke others happy, but none euer yet found himſelfe happy. <hi>Suos quiſque patimur manes.</hi> If none euer yet reaped profit of his endeauours and labours, neither then ſhall euer any doe it now, or hereafter. Euery man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playneth of the preſent ſtate of the world, and ſaith, it was neuer ſo bad, but it is not worſe, nor yet better then it hath beene, neither ſhall it be otherwiſe. The ſame complaints and diſcontent hath beene, and ſhall be, in all generations. If a man liue neuer ſo long, hee ſhall neither ſee nor heare other things then heretofore haue beene, neither is it in his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3539:21"/>
power to alter or mend any thing; for the world is nothing but an alteration of alterations in it ſelfe. A man hath no more command of it, than the Sea men hath of the windes. Some violent and hautie ſpirits haue ſtriuen forcibly for the full fruition of an earthly happineſſe, but hauing obtained their deſires, that ſeemed ſo beautifull a farre off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they found themſelues no whit the better, but rather worſe, yea, nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to miſerie, whereof they thought to rid themſelues for euer. Therefore it is better to ſit ſtill, than to riſe and fall; to liue in obſcuritie, than to be a publique ſpectacle of follie, as the moſt ſubtile and violent workers of old haue beene, and ſo ſhall they be ſtill. Euery man hath great hopes, as of old, neither can he be diſſwaded from this vanity, till old age bring him to ſee, by long experience, this reuolution of all things, and then beginnes he to diſpaire and to be weary. He is full of teaſtineſſe, anger, and impatience when he ſeeth nothing but vanitie, follie and madneſſe in men.</p>
               <p>It may be obiected. If there be ſuch a conſtant reuoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all things, then there is a certaine knowledge of all things to be had, and a fore-knowledge of things to come, which a man may attaine to, and ſo obtaine contentation of minde in the ſpeculation of diuine wiſedome, in the frame and gouernement of the world, and in this ſort to be vnited vnto God by communication of his ſecret counſell, is a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie. I anſwere, the particular or indiuiduall things, and actions, with their proper circumſtances, are now, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer were before, nor ſhall be againe, but the things and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in their kinde, and nature, and intent, are the ſame that were of old.

               <p>All bleſſings and curſes were but caſualties, chances, lucks, naturall effects, and euents, to them that beleeued not, nor applied the Sermons of the Prophets; which cauſed <hi>Ieremie</hi> to complaine, <hi>Thou haſt ſtricken them, but they haue not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; thou haſt conſumed them, but they haue refuſed to receiue cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.

And if we Miniſters were gifted with ſpeciall reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations as the Prophets were, who would beleeue vs more now than they did then the Prophets? And though our prophecies were fulfilled in their eyes, yet would they not ſo apply them. The ſame things come to paſſe now that did then, though they be not now fore-told in ſuch ſort; and ſhould haue done ſo than, though they had not beene fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, (for both the nonage and rudeneſſe of the Iewes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſuch ſpeciall reuelations) and the people with all their ſayings and doings are now that were then.

We are the ſame people, and ſuch are our words, workes, and behauiours; and ſo is God the ſame God, not partiall, not vnequall: Wherefore if the old preuaile not, neither will the new.

The Scriptures ſet forth the ſtate of the World for the ſubſtance, nature, and condition thereof, to the Worlds end, and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth throughout all generations, which are the ſame, and ſo is it the ſame, and to be preached to all generations. There is no man, good, or bad, no thought, word, or worke, but there may hee ſee himſelfe, his workes, and thoughts of his heart plainely depeinted forth. It is accompliſhed, and fulfilled in euery generation; but the eyes of the wicked are holden. Therefore if there were new propheſies, new miracles, yea, a new Bible, it ſhould be but the ſame, that which now is, in the nature, kinde, ſubſtance, and ſcope thereof, differing onely in reſpect of circumſtances. To conclude. All things whatſoeuer a man can particularize, are the ſame, that haue beene; the ſame I ſay, <hi>Specie,</hi> in kind or nature, not <hi>numero,</hi> the very ſelfe-ſame without indiuiduall or circumſtantiall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>

Happy, yea, thrice happy, are the eyes that can ſee this, and the heart that can vnderſtand it: but that is not giuen to all.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3539:24"/>
the righteous, and ſay, if they had beene in the dayes of their Fathers, they would not haue beene partakers with them in the bloud of the Prophets. True iwis, if <hi>Moſes</hi> had beene there, they would haue ſhewed themſelues tender-hearted Wolues. For <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. 28. They were <hi>Moſes</hi> Diſciples, not <hi>Chriſts;</hi> and yet is <hi>Moſes</hi> fulfilled in him, and <hi>Moſes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to heare him. <hi>Abraham</hi> reioyced in ſpirit to ſee his day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 56. and they boaſt themſelues to be his children, <hi>

But if <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould haue beene rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the dead, (as was <hi>Lazarius,</hi> or as <hi>Diues</hi> would haue had one riſen from the dead to warne his brethren) to haue accompanied Chriſt in preaching &amp; teaching theſe his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; they would haue done the ſame to their Father <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and to <hi>Moſes,</hi> that they did to him. They would haue crucified both <hi>Abraham, Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> with him, as the Pope would doe <hi>Peter</hi> now. They boaſt that God is their Father, <hi>verſe</hi> 41. but God was now among them, not in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty and terrour, as he appeared in Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers at the giuing of the Law, but incarnate, appearing in their owne nature, humble and meeke, teaching them all things in mildeſt manner, with ſufficient teſtimony of his God-head: yea, euidently ſhewing forth the maieſty and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his God-head, whereof themſelues were conuicted. What blinded them thus? what deceiued them? what bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched them? Euen their luſts. They were full of pride, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe, enuy; in a word, carnally minded, hauing a ſhew of religion and deuotion, in doing the outward letter of the Law, and ſtrictly obſeruing their owne cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and traditions, thereby deluding the people, and themſelues alſo; but what the ſpirituall intendment of the Scriptures was, they were altogether ignorant. Faith in Chriſt their Redeemer, and the deniall of themſelues, the world, the fleſh, and the deuill, was farre from them. They could not goe before an earthly felicity, a fleſhly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, therefore they looked for a worldly redeemer of their ſtates from vnder the power of the Romanes, &amp;c. Their deuotion was but a maske of worldly craftineſſe, policie, and deuilliſhneſſe, to blinde the people with, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3539:25"/>
alſo. The people groaned vnder their burden, and in hope of liberty thronged in ſuch multitudes after Chriſt; but when ſuch fleſhly hopes failed, <hi>Iudas</hi> betrayed him, and they cryed, Crucifie him, away with him, (hee is not for our profit) to pleaſe their deuout tyrants againe, whom they had diſpleaſed in following him. Behold the condition of theſe brutiſh hypocrites. They follow and flatter the Preacher of the Goſpell. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 26. 27. Not beleeuing and humbling themſelues, as <hi>Mary</hi> did, but like rebellious belly-gods, Papiſts, to ſet vp a Pope againſt their King. For when they found him to be a ſpirituall King, Shepheard, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, they perſecuted him with deadly hatred, and had rather be vnder any tyrant, than vnder his ſpirituall regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Goſpell is the moſt grieuous burthen that can be borne, and the Preacher thereof the greateſt tormenter. Ah, that Papiſts, common-Proteſtants, Libertines could lay theſe things to heart! How many ſtand vp at Creed, but fight againſt the Goſpell! How many receiue the ſigne of the Croſſe in their foreheads, but fight vnder the deuils ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner! How many make a vowe to God in Baptiſme, but caſt the payment thereof vpon their ſureties, like brutiſh ding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thrifts, running out like <hi>Cham,</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> and deuils, foorth of Chriſts preſence, which in ſpirit cry out againſt their tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, <hi>What haue we to doe with thee, art thou come to torment vs before the time?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude. All that is, and ſhall be done, hath beene done of old, but wee know not ſo much. Shortneſſe of life is a great cauſe thereof: For few men liue ſo long to ſee the reuolution or circular courſe of many things. And ſome things and ſtates are of longer continuance than others. Moreouer, this kinde of obſeruation, moſt profitable to man is neglected of moſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the wiſe obſeruer can fore-tell ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things to come, or neerely ayme at them. Furthermore, the remembrance of things paſt dyeth with the preſent ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, &amp; a wonder laſteth but nine dayes, and but a few memorable things are deriued to the next, which alſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh more and more out of their mindes, and at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine with very few, vaniſhing as a ſound or loud noyſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3539:25"/>
by little and little, and as a bird of the ayre vaniſheth out of ſight. In like ſort, all things, now ſaid, and done in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent generation of the world, ſhall in future ages be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and the like alſo may be ſaid of all things in ages to come, in reſpect of ages following them. To conclude: See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that man, and all things with him are ſo vnſtable, and changeable, there can no good remaine to man of all his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, no contentation of minde, no quietneſſe of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. He muſt ſeeke that elſe-where: For his foundation here, ſhall be but laid on the ſands, and his buildings ſhall be but the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> and fall downe like the Tower of <hi>Siloam,</hi> on the head of the builder. Therefore all is vanity.</p>

               <p>HEere beginneth the latter part of the Chapter, wherein <hi>Solomon</hi> ſheweth that he found not onely by obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but alſo by experience in the ſtudies of wiſedome, that all things are but vanity and vexation of ſpirit, both the things themſelues, and mans wiſedome and knowledge of the things alſo. All things are inſtable, fraile, and full of corruption, no ſure thing can be built vpon them, no felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can proceede out of vanity, no perfection out of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. For the curſe is on man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and on all things with man, therefore there muſt needs ſuch like effects proceede from them. For a cleane thing cannot come out of filthineſſe, <hi>Iob</hi> 14. 4.</p>
               <p>His purpoſe is to ſhew that hee made ſearch in the beſt things, wherein there was appearance of any good, which man moſt deſired and admired. And firſt he beganne with wiſedome, which of all other things being meerely tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is the flower. For as for other things they are not ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent, becauſe fooles, and beaſts may be partakers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as well as the wiſe, <hi>to wit,</hi> riches, honours, friends, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, beauty, ſtrength; but wiſedome is proper to the wiſe onely, by which a man is a man, and commeth neereſt to the diuine nature: Therefore true happines was likelyeſt to be found in wiſedome.</p>
               <p>The argument whereby he confirmeth the vnprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of humaine wiſedome, and things ſeeming good, is drawne from the teſtimonie of his experimentall knowledge of things ſubiect to knowledge and ſcience, in the reſt of this chapter, and of things ſubiect to mans bodily vſe, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. The things ſubiect to knowledge are eyther naturall with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:3539:26"/>
their cauſes, properties, effects, or elſe morall, both good and euill, both wiſedome, madneſſe, and follie. The teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of experimentall knowledge hee declareth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to be firme and good by two arguments. The firſt is drawne from the perſon ſearching out the knowledge of things by obſeruation and experience, <hi>verſe</hi> 12. Secondly, from his diligent trauaile therein. Of this trauaile, Firſt, hee propoundeth his counſell, <hi>verſe</hi> 13. Secondly, he declareth the effect thereof. Thirdly, he expoundeth both his reuiew; and determination or iudgement thereof, <hi>verſe</hi> 14 His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination he confirmes by a reaſon, <hi>verſe</hi> 15. All is figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a <hi>prolepſis, verſe</hi> 16. 17. and concluded, <hi>verſe</hi> 17. which is confirmed, <hi>verſe</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>The firſt argument confirming the certaintie of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentall knowledge, is drawne from the condition of his perſon, <hi>(King)</hi> and therefore of fartheſt extent, and reach, of de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>peſt apprehenſion, and largeſt comprehenſion, as he that on an high hill ſeeth fartheſt, and comprehendeth moſt. Men of priuate ſtate are but of priuate, ſtraight, and and particular wits, experienced, and exerciſed in few and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour things, and alſo diſturbed many waies. But a King is as the Sunne, comprehending all things, ſuperiour, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour within the compaſſe of his ſight, and is eleuated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as I may ſay, aboue the troubled regions of the Aire, (all things being placed vnder him) and free from all obſtacles in a firmely eſtabliſhed and peaceable common-wealth, as this of <hi>Iſrael</hi> now was: In a word, hee is Gods vice-gerent, the neereſt attendant to him, of his priuie counſell, euer in preſence and ſight, on whoſe hand, as I may ſay, the great King leaneth. <hi>Dauid</hi> was a man of warre, but God gaue <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> peace with all nations, and all nations were ſeruice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him: Wherefore? The more freely to liue in eaſe, and fleſhly pleaſure? To doe as brethren doe oft times falling at variance among themſelues for want of an outward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie, againſt whom they may ioyne in vnitie of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Or that the members of the body ſhould deuoure and conſume one another for want of matter to worke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the ſtomacke? No ſuch thing: For that is bruitiſh
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3539:27"/>
and ethnicall: But he gaue him peace that hee might build him an houſe, a glorious houſe. Hee gaue him wiſedome with peace, to gouerne his people prudently, and to teach them the feare of the Lord, to ſtabliſh the whole worſhip of God in perfection, according to the Law. To glorifie the Lord in erecting his houſe, and ſtabliſhing his worſhip, that the beauty of both might be an aſtoniſhment to the nations, that the God of Iſrael might be glorified in all the earth.</p>
               <p>To conclude, his Kingly office is amplied by the ſubiect, or obiect <hi>(Iſrael)</hi> the people of God, and therefore the moſt excellent, and glorious King. Laſtly, by the place, <hi>(in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem)</hi> Ieruſalem the citie of God, the beauty of holineſſe, the paradiſe of the world renewed, the ioy of the whole earth. Now being a King, hee wanted no meanes to attaine to knowledge, neither authority to enquire and demaund the opinions, and iudgements of others, nor ability to get and vſe all meanes requiſite for exquiſite knowledge.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe ſecond Argument, confirming the certainty of his experience drawne from his diligent trauaile and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate endeauour. As hee wanted not power and ability to procure and vſe all meanes; ſo neither wanted hee deſire and diligence: For hee gaue himſelfe wholly, not onely to ſeeke by wiſedome to know things, but to ſearch out by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation and tryall, according to wiſedome, the cauſes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and effects, and the reaſon of all things that are, and are done vnder heauen. But this hee did not in pride and curioſitie, but in modeſty, accordingly as he found himſelfe gifted of God, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 33. For God is the father of lights, the gifts of his ſpirit are lights ſhining in darkeneſſe. Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is with God, and proceedeth out from the throne of God, which whoſoeuer wan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eth can neuer attaine to the true knowledge of him, becauſe his worldly heart is full of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3539:27"/>
For God hath ſubdued all things vnder vanity, which the blinde world knoweth not, or but dreamingly noteth, (which maketh fleſh and bloud ſo proud) from which no man can rid himſelfe, ſtriue hee neuer ſo much, but rather doth ſtill, as the proud curious heritickes did, encreaſe vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, errour, and folly, as the hydropical body by thirſting and ſtriuing to quench thirſt by drinking, doth increaſe the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, and in the end deſtroy it ſelfe. The heathen kept nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meane nor meaſure in the curious and ambitious ſearch of the wiſedome of God in the world, and his ſecret counſell in the vſe of his creatures: But for as much as the end of their endleſſe labours was not the glory of God, euen ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection to him in feare and thankefull obedience, but their owne vaine-glory, praiſe, pleaſure, fooliſhneſſe, impietie, they found not that which they ſought for: For a foole, ſaith <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſeeketh wiſedome and findeth it not, but wearieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in a Labyrinth; and ſo became vaine in their worldly imaginations. Wherefore becauſe they ſought to know God out of his Church, and to aſſume the glory thereof to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by returning their owne eyes, and the eyes of men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, to exalt and magnifie them; as hee that ſeeketh praiſe by the curious deſcription of a cunning worke, but forgetteth, yea deſpiſeth the workeman himſelfe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thought and ſought to comprehend the infinite maieſtie and wiſedome of God, in the creation and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by humane capacitie, and trauaile, without the Spirit and Word of God, therefore were they blinded, like the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites ſeeking <hi>Lots</hi> doore, groping all their life after that which they could neuer finde, attaining onely to ſo much as ſerued to quicken the worme of their dead conſciences to make them inexcuſable.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, as God hath by a generall decree in the beginning laid ſore trauell on man to humble his pride thereby, in ſo much that nothing can be gotten without great labour ſince the fall; ſo neither can he attaine to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of wiſedome without diligence: For the gift is indeed freely giuen of God, but we muſt receiue it by the appointed meanes. Therefore although hee granted the requeſt of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3539:28"/>
                  <hi>Solomon,</hi> in giuing a wiſe and vnderſtanding heart aboue all that were before him, or after him, yet he applyed himſelfe to the ſtudy and contemplation of all things, and to finde out the ſecrets of Gods wiſedome by carefull obſeruation, and experience. So that in the ſtudies of knowledge, there is great affliction both of body and minde: Firſt, becauſe ſome neuer attaine to true wiſedome, but fall into vaine imaginations, and manifold errours, and ſo when they thinke to be wiſe, they become fooles. The iuſt iudgement of God on their proud preſumption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 22. Of thoſe kinds of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies theſe wordes of <hi>Solomon</hi> may be vnderſtood, <hi>This ſore trauaile hath God giuen,</hi> &amp;c. Secondly, they that are mooued, and directed by the ſpirit of God to the right end, and ſo attaine to wiſedome, are greatly humbled with infinite toyle as well as the husbandman; and in the end ſee nothing but vanity, euen matter of griefe, both in the things that are knowne, and in the knowledge it ſelfe. For they are ſtill as farre from contentation and peace of conſcience, as euer they were. For no worldly thing can make a man happy. So that although a man had all knowledge, without Chriſt it is nothing; <hi>Paul</hi> eſteemed it but loſſe and dung, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.

               <p>Here wee note that there is twofold learning or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in a man; the one is obtained by reading of mens bookes, the other by reading in the Bookes of God. The former kinde of wiſedome is imitation, which we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call learning: It is gotten by imagination and ſtrength of memory: It is a talkatiue learning, which a man relateth from the mouth of another, not from an vnderſtanding heart.

The bloud of Chriſt onely muſt purge it. The wiſeſt Philoſophers, Naturaliſts, and Moraliſts, when they had done all they could, yet their crookedneſſe remained in them.

               <p>A Reaſon why that ſeeking after knowledge, both of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and folly, there is no contentation of minde, but vexation of ſpirit. For the further that a man ſearcheth into the bottome of things, to giue fuller ſatisfaction to his heart, the more griefe he findeth, and ſorrow is increaſed with knowledge: For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, the accurate ſearch, and diſcuſſing by examination and iudgement of that which is fought, is a great affliction to body and minde.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when a man hath done what he can, hee hath onely attained to the ſight of that great darkeneſſe of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that is in him, Chap. 7. 23. 24. which he thinking by ſtudy to expell, doth more increaſe it, that is, hee more and more ſeeth into what a deepe dungeon, hee and all men are fallen by the ſinne of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is difficult, troublous, full of intricate queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and diſtracting doubts, endleſſe, and withall tranſitory. It is neither perfectiue of him that hath it, nor perfectiue of other men, or their matters.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the more that a wiſe man knoweth, hee ſtill more, more and more beholdeth greater corruption, vanity, folly, madneſſe, and miſery, wherewith his ſpirit is diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and grieued, his heart is heauy, his minde diſpairefull. So that he is farther off from happineſſe then the ignorant, that knoweth nothing. For he worketh and eateth, and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and ſleepeth ſoundly, he is without care, he is heartily merry, and ſo is ſtrong and healthfull.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, when a man hath tranſcended common capacities, his darke parables, inſtructions, and counſels, of many ſhall be had in contempt, of others hee ſhall be enuyed, and his wiſdome ſhall be but the white of a But to be ſhot at, of ſome he ſhall be ſuſpected, and ſuppreſſed, for Princes are ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of the godly-wiſe-learned, I thinke becauſe their rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and nakedneſſe lies open to their iudicious eyes; which
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:3539:32"/>
made <hi>Nero</hi> kill his maſter <hi>Seneca;</hi> or elſe deſire ignorance that the thouſand-headed beaſt might be better held vnder the yoke of gouernment: For if they be wiſe and godly, the rude Princes thinke that their nakedneſſe lyeth open, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of contempt followeth. This is ethnicall pollicie. Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, the wiſe and godly Prince ſhall by his wiſedome, and godlineſſe bind the conſciences of his people, and cauſe them to reuerence and dread him, as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaid of himſelfe. This is the onely ſecurity of a Prince, as of <hi>Iob, Dauid, Solomon, Ioſiah.</hi> Moreouer, if the wiſe would haue the benefit of his wiſedome to redound to many, he muſt deſcend to their meanneſſe, and rudeneſſe, and of a plentifull ſeed-ſowing moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reape little, and ſometimes nothing.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, he ſhall ſee the foole oft-times graced, countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, preferred for money, and other ſiniſter reſpects, when he for all his wiſedome ſhall not be regarded, but be buried in obſcurity, and obliuion.</p>
               <p>Seauenthly, If a man vnderſtand all miſteries, and all knowledge, and that no ſecret be hid from him, all cannot free him from death, but it ſhall rot in the graue with him: Wherefore if a man know not himſelfe to be in the number of Gods Elect, if in the curious ſearch of all things, he cannot find that in himſelfe, what contentation, reſt, ioy, quietneſſe of conſcience, what happineſſe can knowledge bring him? nay rather it will increaſe his ſorrow. Wherefore all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine knowledge is vaine, euen nothing, and worſe then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. For when a man hath attained to all knowledge that can be comprehended in mans braine, the Deuill hath ſtill more then hee: For he hath been in the kingdome of glory, and ſeene God face to face. And if a man had as he hath, how much ſtill ſhould he be the better? Surely, if a man know not onely the depth of Gods wiſedome in the world, but the ſecrets of the kingdome of glory, and of the damnation of hell, &amp; alſo could by words vtter them, he ſhould notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding liue in miſerable perplexity all his life, till hee had this ſauing knowledge, which ſhould be his onely ioy and comfort both in life and death.</p>
               <p>This onely ſhould ſweeten all the miſeries of this life,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3539:33"/>
whereas the other doth exacerbate, and turne all the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues, delights, and pleaſures of this life into gall, and wormewood. There is no felicity on earth but this; feare God, and keepe his commandements: For he that hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all worldly wiſedome, cannot by the ſame worke out a felicitie to himſelfe in this crooked ſtate, and vaine conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all things.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Olomon</hi> hauing found no profit, no happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation in knowledge, nor in things ſubiect to knowledge, purpoſeth now to try what conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation may redound to him by the vſe of the creatures, all care caſt away, whereof aboue other men hee had the full poſſeſſion and fruition. This verſe containeth 1. a declaration of his counſell about the finding out of the chiefe good, by the tryall of another way. 2. his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or cenſure, which is amplified by a note of attention, or aſſeueration, <hi>I ſaid in my heart,</hi> &amp;c. As if he ſhould ſay, I haue already tryed what profit the ſtudies of wiſedome can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford; but neither in contemplation, nor in experimentall knowledge found I any thing, ſaue onely much affliction of the fleſh, and vexation of minde; for contentation cannot be attained, nor grieuances auoyded thereby. Well, then I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in my heart to proue what profit the vſe of worldly things might bring vnto me: And firſt of all, tis before I ſubdued my body to the ſpirit of my minde, ſuppoſing that the chiefe good wherein the ſoule reſteth contented, was to be traced out by that path whereby a man commeth neereſt vnto God, but found no contentment at all, yea contrarily ſorrow; ſo now on the contrary, I fell into a conſideration of the vſes of the manifold creatures of God, for mans ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3539:33"/>
comfort, and delight. Therefore now I began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and exerciſe my wiſedome in the cheering, and pampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the fleſh, in bathing my ſelfe in the pleaſures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the ſonnes of men: I with-held nothing from the deſires of my heart, but yeelding my ſelfe to all my bodily appetites, as farre forth as lawfully I might, to try what more profit and better contentment I, or any other that is moſt delighted in this way, might finde in this courſe of life. But when I reflected my ſpirit vpon the conſideration of this way alſo, I ſaw that here was nothing but vanitie. For there is no ſtedfaſtneſſe in the things that conſume away euen with the moderate vſing, and the body together with them alſo, and the immoderate vſe thereof would be a greater burden to the fleſh, than the immoderate ſtudyes of Learning. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe immoderation in this kinde would bring a ſure and ſudden deſtruction both to body and ſoule. Wherefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the moderate nor immoderate vſe thereof was there any felicitie, but vanity.</p>

                  <q>I ſaid of laughter, it is mad: and of mirth what doth it?</q>
               </head>
               <p>A Confirmation of the cenſure: <hi>Mirth and pleaſure are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</hi> For when I had ſought out and tryed what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment epicuriſh and ſenſuall liuing could afford to him that is moſt addicted to it; I ſaw that laughter was madde, and mirth reaſonleſſe, both vaine. For indeede the matter of laughter is mans ſhame, or nakedneſſe; it is follie, or bruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to be lamented, not laughed at. For let a man laugh at what he will, and but ſmile at any thing, when he returneth to ſobriety of heart, and to the prudent conſideration of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and the thing that he laughed at, he ſhall finde it to be follie, vanitie, miſerie, I meane a ſlippe, or defect of that wiſedome, prudence, prouidence, and reaſon in ſome ſaying, deede, or euent which is not in the perfect image of God, nor in man as he is man, <hi>to wit,</hi> graue, wiſe, reuerend, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, perfect in this imperfect ſtate that no light con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of him, his words, actions, euents in the mindes of men ſhould moue laughter. For what matter of laughter is there
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3539:34"/>
in the perſons, ſpeaches, deedes, euents of reuerend Sages, Kings, Iudges, of Chriſt, and of God? Our Sauiour Chriſt often ſorrowed, but we cannot learne that euer he laughed, neither yet conceiue at what he ſhould laugh. It is recorded in ſtories that the Philoſopher <hi>Heraclitus</hi> alwaies wept and ſorrowed, becauſe he ſaw nothing but vanities and miſerie, yea, bruitiſhneſſe in all the dealings of men, whether in their ſobriety or laughter. Contrarily, <hi>Democritus</hi> alwaies laughed. What was the matter or obiect of his laughter? Euen the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, madneſſe, vanitie, brutalitie of men, which by laughter he neither reioyced at nor approued. Finally, whenſoeuer a man laugheth at things great or ſmall, let him by gathering onething of another but diue to the ground of his laughter, and he ſhall finde ſome matter of griefe and repentance, both in the perſon, or thing laughed at, and in himſelfe, or at leaſt in the one. For if <hi>Adam</hi> had neuer fallen, there ſhould neuer haue beene laughter, nor weeping, but an heart poſſeſt with heauenly ioy, euen ioyfull ſobriety.</p>
               <p>The epicuriſh and ſenſuall laughter therefore that <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> here ſpeaketh of, is madneſſe, euen the corruption and intemperance of reaſon, the froath of vaine imaginations, the ſuperfluity of the ſpleene, corrupted by the fall, and bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth oft times much ſinne in the ſoule, which bringeth griefe and repentance. And as laughter was madneſſe, ſo was mirth vnreaſonableneſſe, or fooliſhneſſe. For it neither cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaily bringeth out of it ſelfe, nor yet accidentally occaſioneth any profit.</p>
               <p>It is ſhort, and vaniſhing, dying with the action, like the ſtroke of an inſtrument, and the taſte of honey: The one whereof in the continuall vſe groweth weariſome, and is in the end the greateſt toyle; the other groweth bitter, and is in the end very loathſome: Neither affoord ſolide content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For hee that maketh the time of this life but a play, is as hee that maketh it but a market: Both ſhall receiue the ſame iudgement; the one for his Iouil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y, as the leud Iauils of theſe dayes tearme it, the other for his drudgery. Both are their owne Idols, oppoſite one to another, and both to God. Therefore are both, the carefulneſſe of the one, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3539:34"/>
carefulneſſe of the other, a burden to the conſcience. So that in laughter and mirth, wine and women, diſſoluteneſſe and luxury, there is no felicity, but vanity, no contentation, but deſperation. Yet notwithſtanding all this we muſt put a difference betweene the common frailty of mans nature, which God paſſeth by, and the ſinful laughter of the wicked.</p>

For Cedars and ſiluer were as plentifull with me, as ſtones in the ſtreetes, and <hi>Sycomore</hi> trees in the dales. Of gold I had abundance.

All my drinking veſſels were of gold, and all my veſſels of the Forreſt of <hi>Lebanon</hi> were of pure gold. I had alſo abundance of precious ſtones, Iewels, ſpices, oyntments, odours, and what precious things

To this foole, ſhame and reproch belongeth. He is full of miſchiefe, proud, wilfull, wrathfull, reuengefull, raſh, and is inwrapped in many dangers, and troubles. For as he gloryeth in his craft, and is miſchieuous, ſo miſchiefe falleth on him, it is his portion. The ſpirituall foole is euery carnall Profeſſour of the Goſpel in outward ſhew without the power thereof, who hath a generall illumination, confuſed, and broken princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but his manners and all his courſes are heatheniſh, and brutiſh, being captiuated to his luſts. Yea, and he is a foole alſo, that hath vnderſtanding, knowledge and learning, but yet ſerueth not God but his owne luſts thereof, deceiuing his owne heart. There are abundance of ſuch fooles now a dayes. Of all theſe fooles <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſpeaketh, but more ſpecially, I thinke, of the reaſonleſſe fooles. To diſcouer the vanity, and folly of ſpirituall fooles more at large. This foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe is that common mediocrity or meane, which world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſe-men, polititians, and moraliſts, and all fooles doe falſly imagine to be vertue, or the beſt profeſſion, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in the middle of their extreames. But in caſe of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their darke hearts neuer rightly conceiued what either extreames or middles were. For this common meane, is a mixture of light with darkeneſſe, good with euill, ſweet with
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3539:38"/>
ſowre, wiſedome with ſenſuality, pretious with vile, religion with carnality. But ſuch indifferences are hatefull and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome before God, and vpright men. This the Scriptures tearme folly, and ſuch wiſe ones, fooles and hypocrites, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>Vnderſtand therefore the deceitfulneſſe of the heart, and the deluſion of Sathan, euen that deepe ſophiſtrie, by which whole multitudes doe periſh, yea euen all, except the very E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. For what is that common wiſedome, reaſon, indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, honeſty of men, but a certaine mediocrity or meane mixt of linnen and woollen, of ſowre with ſweet, of religion with fleſhly morality; as though that all things, religion and all ſhould onely tend, and ayme at a happy worldly ſtate, or glorifying of the fleſh or outward man, or to approach as neere to this marke as may be. This was the ſinne of <hi>Saul.</hi> He did not aime at the ſole glory of God, but mingled the holy commandement and his owne luſt, euen his vaine-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, together. He would not looſe his owne glory in that tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph: Therefore <hi>Samuel</hi> told him that hoe was become a foole. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 13. Such fooles were the Iſraelites. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 21. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 1. Such fooles were the Phariſes, Princes, people of the Iewes. The diſciples being yet but rude, and weake were tainted with this folly, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. 22. Yet in them it was but infirmity, becauſe they were in Gods election, and actually beleeued, and followed him in ſincerity. Euery pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour of the Goſpel, not inwardly renued by the ſpirit of ſanctification is a foole, but we muſt take heed of iudging, and cenſuring: For the worke of the ſpirit in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate is not to make a mixture of heauenly &amp; carnall things, but by mortification to ſub due all things to himſelfe, euen to conuert the whole man inward and outward into ſpirit, to bring euery thought and imagination, euery word and worke into captiuity vnder Chriſt, which is true wiſedome and liberty. So that whereas it is ſaid, that in ſtate of grace we are partly fleſh, partly ſpirit, in all our actions and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is not meant of mixture, for where there is mixture, there is no ſound, no ſauing conuerſion, but the Foxe will to his kinde; but that we are as the ruſty Iron in the fire, the

But what this meaneth, our common, honeſt, reaſonable, wiſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different minded men, neither will nor can conceiue. For they know not through the hardneſſe of their hearts, that the ground of their Chriſtian profeſſion, is the vtter denyall of themſelues, or the vtter deſtruction of the fleſh, and the beſt things thereof, as enmity to the grace of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 7. that they might be wholly in him, and for him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19. 20. which is the maine ſcope of this preſent treatiſe of <hi>Solomon.</hi> To redreſſe this beautifull, but funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall euill, let vs remember, and lay to heart theſe two Texts of Scriptures. The firſt is <hi>Dauids</hi> charge to <hi>Solomon</hi> his ſonne, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 9. <hi>And thou my ſonne Solomon, know thou the God of they father, and ſerue him with a perfect heart, and willing minde: for the Lord ſearcheth all hearts, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts.</hi> The ſecond, is the ground and life of euery word and worke, which maketh it acceptable in the ſight of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>Whatſoeuer is not of faith, is ſinne.</hi> He that wanteth true faith ſhall periſh euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly, whatſoeuer, how great ſoeuer his workes be.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Solomon</hi> here confirmeth his experiments, with the conſiderate and iudicious view thereof, by the conſcience of his ſufficiency in wiſedome, and experience, which is figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a <hi>Prelepſis,</hi> or preuention of an obiection, thus.

Watchmen in the top of a Tower, are watchfull, diligent, and circumſpect, fore-ſeeing euill a farre off, and preuenting it before it ſurprize them. So in the eyes of a wiſe man there is vnderſtanding, diſcerning, iudgement, ſobriety, heedfull diligence, fore-ſight. Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ordereth all the wayes of a wiſe man, he eſcheweth dangers, miſchiefes, inconueniences, and euery hurtfull thing; he procureth commodities on all ſides, he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and pleaſure in the workes of his hands. Whereas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, the foole is blind, he knowes not what he ſaith, nor what he doth; he obſerues not perſons, times, and place, but ruſheth headily forward, committing euery word, and deede to fortune. He falles into the ditch on euery ſide, hee daſheth his head againſt euery poſt, he wrappes himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong buſhes and briars, as they that walke in darkeneſſe, and vnknowne places, and is rent and torne, and if he ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle out, he is neuer the neerer, but is by and by in new dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, becauſe hee wanteth the lanterne of Gods Word and Spirit, to direct him into the right pathes, and to guide him therein, that onely is it that maketh the ſimple wiſe, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth man knowledge.</p>
               <p>The World is Gods Booke, euery thing that a man hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth or ſeeth, is a leafe, or a line, wherein hee may reade ſomething to his owne inſtruction, and further edification. The wiſe man beholdeth the wiſedome, prouidence, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and iuſtice of God in all things. Againe, he beholdeth the deprauation and corruption of all things, brought in by the enuie of the Diuell. Hee diſcerneth the vprightneſſe of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:3539:40"/>
godlineſſe, and the tortuoſity of wickedneſſe, the plaine pathes of wiſedome, and the peruerſe wayes of folly in all things, and in euery thing. The one hee chuſeth, ordering himſelfe in all his wayes according to wiſedome, the other he refuſeth, and correcteth, and retracteth himſelfe by wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. So that the vnderſtanding, ſober, heedfull, watchfull eyes of the wiſe, looke not on the things themſelues, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearances, but on Gods wiſedome, goodneſſe, iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in the things; yea, hee beholdeth Sathans malice, and mans miſery, and diſcerneth the times, and the ſeaſons, the workes of God therein, and the counter-workes of the Diuel. <hi>But the foole walketh in darkeneſſe.</hi> The foole hath as it were no eyes, or eyes wherein the ſight is periſhed. He looketh on things, as doth the wiſe, but he ſeeth into nothing. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prou.</hi> 17. 24. <hi>The eyes of a foole are in the ends of the earth;</hi> that is, light, heedleſſe, wandring eyes, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the confuſion of many vaine imaginations in the head, but no diſcreete apprehenſion, no ſobriety of wiſedome, no prudent obſeruation. He looketh on outward appearances, and obſerueth childiſhly. But hee cannot ſee one whit how the Scriptures, teaching the whole knowledge of God, and of our ſelues, his wiſedome, mans folly, his grace, mans ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, are continually fulfilled before his eyes. Hee that is in darkeneſſe, diſcerneth not colours, no more doth the foole things that differ. The foole gathereth vp follies, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth in ſome imitatiue wicked ſubtilties, and a parable or wiſe ſentence is harſh, and odious in his mouth. The foole hath the eyes of a beaſt, iudging, chuſing, refuſing, according to his carnall affections and luſts, &amp;c. <hi>And I my ſelfe percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued alſo that one euent happeneth to them all.</hi> Here is his reuiew of the euent of wiſedome, and the wiſe.

vaniſhed out of minde. <hi>And how dyeth the wiſe man? as the foole.</hi> Here is the latter argument, whereby hee confirmeth the vanity of wiſedome, by the ſame condition thereof with follie, figured by a communication, or rather an exclamation, intimating, that the wiſe is greatly to be commiſerated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he receiueth no more fruit of his worthy labours, then the mad and fooliſh, that liue in ſenſuality and bodily plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, after the manner of beaſts.

               <p>A Confirmation of the reaſon, figured by the preuention of an obiection, thus: That a man ſhall leaue his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to another, is no cauſe of griefe: For ſeeing that hee muſt not alwayes liue here; for one generation paſſeth, and another commeth, it is a mans ioy, and comfort rather, yea, the proſperous ſucceſſe of them in their continuance to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture generations, giueth great contentment to the heart.</p>

And if ſo be that a man muſt either depriue himſelfe of life, or elſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long his dayes in perpetuall ſorrow, then the world ſeemeth to be made for none other end, then to be an engine of torture vnto men. Anſ.</hi> Not ſo neither. For though I haue already prooued that a man can obtaine no true profit, or happy contentation by the things of the world, nor by any thing that can be knowne or done by mans wiſedome: yet it followeth not therefore that there is no good in all things made for mans vſe, by which he may be inabled and helped both to liue, and to order his life according to wiſedome, and vertue. But there is a good in them for which cauſe God hath created them, and imparted the ſame to euery one according to his owne pleaſure. And this good, is not to depend or reſt on them, nor to truſt in them; for therefore hath God made them vncertaine, and vaine, nor yet by treaſuring them vp to depriue a mans ſelfe, or others of their vſe, nor to lauiſh them out, as though they would neuer haue end: but to feede, cheere, and comfort the body therewith, with tranquility of minde reſting on Gods mercy, and ſo to paſſe the time of this life with ioyfull contentation in honeſt labor, not in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

               <p>SIxtly, there is an opportunity to rent old garments, when they are worne, to be put to other vſes. If they be rent before they be worne, that is vnprofitable; if they be worne too long, that is in-decent, and occaſioneth contempt, and I know not what euill conceit of a man in the mindes of men, as the ſonne of <hi>Sirach</hi> ſaith; <hi>The apparell, countenance, and geſture, declare what a man is.</hi> Contrarily, there is a time to ſow garments, both for neceſſity, and comelineſſe. But the ſuperfluity of ſowing bringeth pouerty, and diſcouereth ſhame. For God bleſſeth his owne ordinances, and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his owne opportunities. But there is no time ordained of God in his will and ordinance for the inuenting, and bringing in of ſtrange faſhions; That is an opportunity ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the permiſſion of God from the Diuell.

               <p>SEauenthly, there is a time to loue, as there is a time to ſpeake, and this opportunity of loue is as commonly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered of God. Loue or true friendſhip is the bond of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſociety. By the bond of loue, all the members of the body are knit together into one head: It is the ſinewes of the Church, and common-wealth. Where loue faileth, all ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to diſſolution. God is all loue, the Diuell hath know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and faith, but hee hath no loue at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore the vertue and power of opportunities, in getting, making, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and vſing friends, is excellent, and neceſſary. Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, there is a time to hate, to know our enemies, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, and contend with them, to beware, and auoid them, to encounter and flie away, yea, alſo to make good vſe to our ſelues of the wrongs that are offered vs. For howſoeuer a man ordereth his life, and behaueth himſelfe in all things, loue and hatred, concord and diſcord, good will and enuie ſhall ſift and toſſe all affaires.

To this purpoſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 17. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence to no man euill for euill, which is to be ouercome of euill, verſe</hi> 21. <hi>but ouercome euill with goodneſſe,</hi> darkeneſſe with light, corruption with grace; <hi>if it be poſſible, haue peace with all men.</hi> How is that? <hi>Auenge not, verſe</hi> 19. <hi>but if thine enemy hunger, giue him meate, and if he thirſt, giue him drinke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo ſhalt thou heape coales of fire vpon his head: to wit,</hi> either winne him with thy benefits, or his owne conſcience ſhall witneſſe againſt him, that the fire of Gods wrath hangeth ouer his head, who will not ſuffer wickedneſſe to goe vnpuniſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which terrour of his conſcience thou muſt not deſire, nor reioyce at in way of reuenge, or for eaſe of thine owne ſtomacke, leaſt God turne his wrath from him vnto thee, but rather pitty him, yet ſo as God might haue the glory. Therefore by turning of the cheeke, is not meant that a man ſhould make himſelfe a prey to contentious men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> malapert, and violent perſons, and a voluntary obiect of their cruell contempt: but to be of ſuch moderation and equity, as to pacifie and winne them with ſufferance, goodneſſe, kindneſſe, or what good meanes ſanctified reaſon can deuiſe, not to be incenſed with hatred, to oppoſe and wracke them, and ſo be ouercome of Sathan by theſe his inſtruments, both to bring the Goſpell into
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:3539:48"/>
ſlander &amp; hatred, &amp; to fall into the ſame condemnation with them. Wherefore we are to pray for the conuerſion of them, and Gods protection of vs, not to contend with them in their kind, that by the vertues of the ſpirit appearing forth in vs, the corruption of nature, &amp; malice of Satan in them may be by their owne conſciences condemned. But all this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringeth not the law of nature, which is to kill rather then to be killed, without the lawfull courſe of ciuill iuſtice, nor yet diſanulleth the politike law, which God hath ordained to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the iuſt, to bridle the violent, and to reforme the vitious and iniurious. Let vs take heed how we cauill, and ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the ſimplicity of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>All this is explained, verſe 44. <hi>Loue your enemies:</hi> Your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; not Gods enemies, which we are to hate, yet to take heede of raſh iudgement: For though the cauſe or fact be hatefull, yet that argueth not ſimply hatred of the perſon. Wherefore loue them, that is, deſire their conuerſion, not their confuſion; for we know not whether they be in Gods election, but charity hopeth the beſt. Whom God hath caſt off, and who haue caſt off God, we muſt caſt off, leſt wee be partakers with Gods enemies; therefore we muſt not bid an obſtinate heretike God-ſpeed. Neither would the diſciples haue eaten bread with <hi>Iudas,</hi> if they had knowne his plot of treachery, but Chriſt reuealed him not: And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, haue no fellowſhip with the vnfruitfull workes of darkenes. If a man can haue no fellowſhip with their workes, neither with their perſons, ſpecially ſuch perſons, as on the one ſide make a mocke of all good edification, and on the other ſide, are ſtrong corrupters. For what could Satan incarnate and in ſubiection to the ciuill power doe more? To conclude; We muſt doe good to our enemies willingly, reſiſt their euils peaceably, make the cauſe Gods, not our owne, contend with them lawfully, liue among them warily, commit the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to God, caſt no ſtumbling blocks before them, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offer meanes, and further their conuerſion, that they may glorifie God in the day of viſitation, that is, when it ſhal pleaſe God to open their eyes to ſee, and diſcerne the truth. To conclude. Loue and hatred in priuate perſons, warres and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3539:49"/>
peace in publike ſtates, haue alwayes beene, and muſt be to the end. For throughout all nature there is an oppoſition of one thing to another, as well diſcord as concord, tares as wheat, becauſe God will be glorified as well by iudgement as by mercy.

               <p>A Concluſion of the principall argument, that a man hath no profit of all his labours, Chap. 1. 3. The Propoſition or <hi>Maior</hi> is, Chap. 3. 1. The Reaſon is framed thus:</p>
               <p>If there be a time to euery thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to euery purpoſe vnder the Sunne, then a man hath no profit of all his labours, ſeeing that all things depend on the inſtability of times.</p>
               <p>But the Antecedent, or former part of the reaſon is true, as I haue already proued by many examples, of things naturall, neceſſary, voluntary.</p>
               <p>Therefore the conſequent or latter part is true alſo, namely he that ſtudyeth, endeauoureth; worketh, hath no profit in all his labours.</p>
               <p>For the beginning, proceeding, finiſhing, euent, depend all on vncertainties. And euen in that he knoweth not what ſhall become of his labours, who ſhall haue the benefit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a wiſe-man or a foole, his friend, or his foe, doth as much afflict the minde, as to be croſt in the beginning and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his workes by infortunate caſualties; what greater vanity and griefe is there then for a man vpon the reueiw of his labours to ſay, <hi>Opera, &amp; impenſa perijt.</hi> All is loſt?</p>

               <p>A Commoration, amplifying this concluſion to verſe 16. In this verſe he ſetteth downe the cauſe of this vanitie of mans labour, and that is the iudgement of God vpon his pride. For thus hath God alwayes auenged the ambition, and curioſity of mans heart, that he ſhould intangle himſelfe in infinite buſineſſes, perplexe his minde with endleſſe cares, ſpend all his dayes in troubles, griefe, anger, ſorrow, ſickneſſe and till the day of death to be forgetfull of death, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull of the euent of his toyle. But that hoped contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind, which he dreameth of, ſhall he neuer obtaine, and if he doe obtaine it, it ſhall haue matter ſtill of greater miſery in it.

Yea, the wayes of God are paſt finding out. Yet this is the madneſſe of thoſe, whom we call vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, wiſe, prudent, and politicke men, to frame a world in, and according to their owne hearts, as if they were gods, or rather Gods Apes, that is, firſt, to purpoſe with themſelues what they will haue, and what they will be, and then by their wiſdome, and ſtrength, to turne all the world, and euery thing about to this point, to winde and wring in euery man, and euery matter by craft or violence, by feare, by flattery, by ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, diſſimulation, to make in the end a generall concurrence or confluence of all ſtreames into this Ocean. This impoſſibility is that, wherabout he beateth his braines, vexeth his minde, diſquieteth his heart, toyleth his body, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priueth himſelfe of all ioy, and comfortable reſt all the daies of his life.

And though they glorifie themſelues, and are as gods in their owne eyes, and cauſe others to fall downe, and humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto them, whereout they ſucke no ſmall aduantage, yet ſhall they die like men, and come to the ſame end that beaſts doe, yea; they are more miſerable then beaſts, which are not ſubiect to ſinne, nor culpable of iudgement.</p>

But the ſpirit of a beaſt is nothing but the quinteſſence, the pureſt and prime of his body, or his life, which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the harmony or vnion of the elements, and ſo not being another eſſence ſeparable from the body, it dyeth with the body. <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is indeed the holy and diuine truth, but now ſpeaking of the worldly, outward, and miſerable ſtate of man, as it appeareth to humaine ſenſes and reaſon, who can by any ſigne or token, or skill of Anatomy find out any differing wayes of theſe ſpirits? What man can ſhew me the aſcending of mans ſpirit into heauen, or the deſcending of the beaſts ſpirit into the earth; namely, the diſperſing thereof into the elements? If a man ſay, that the ſpirit of man aſcends vpwards into the firmament, how can he let me ſee that? but if it doe, then doth the beaſts ſo alſo. For the firmament is but the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:3539:55"/>
quinteſſence or prime of the elements, as the ſpirit is of the body, according to <hi>Plato.</hi> And be it that by humaine rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a man may eaſily demonſtrate the immortality of the ſoule, as the learned heathen haue all done, yet what is that to the outward worldly ſtate of man liuing? Man whiles hee is man, (and of man we onely ſpeake, not of ſpirits) is no better then beaſt. So that to conclude; Seeing that it is with man, as with beaſt, there is no profit, no contentment, no reſt, no durable proſperity, no happineſſe at all in this curſed, confuſed, brutall world, but all is vanity.</p>

               <p>A Concluſion of the right conſideration, regard, and vſe of worldly things inferred as before, ver. 12. And <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 24. Seeing that there is nothing but vanity and miſerie, I perceiued that it was but vanity and folly to ſeeke for any happineſſe in any worldly ſtate. And that it was the point of true and ſolide wiſdome for a man to reioyce his heart in the honeſt getting, comfortable vſing, and prudent diſpoſing of things put into his hand by the prouidence of God, while it is his, euen in his hands. For this is a mans portion, yea, all the good that can be found in them, and by them. <hi>For who can bring a man to ſee what ſhall be after him?</hi> Chap. 2. 18. 19. The knowledge of after-times belongeth to God onely, and when we are gone, then is all out of our hands, and none of ours, but left to Gods diſpoſing, which how God vſeth and beſtoweth, or what good is done therewith, is no thankes, no reward to vs. Therefore it is but folly for a man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue himſelfe of the benefit of his workes, and to diſquiet his heart and minde in vaine, with prouiding and plotting for after-times; namely, for his poſterity, whereof hee hath no certainty. What greater folly is there, then for a man to torment his body, vexe his ſpirit, torture his conſcience, loſe his ſoule, for thoſe that come after him, which either ſhall be wreſted from their goods, or die preſently after him, or waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:3539:55"/>
ſpend them, working out their damnation in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall ſpending, as he did in the couetous getting. But if they doe enioy them, and doe good with them, yet is that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to him that is now in torment. For it is not by vertue of the goods gotten, and left by him, but of Gods grace, and that doth good as well without thoſe goods, as with them. For it is not how much we doe, but how well, not what, but what God accepteth. For all is his owne, wee can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for him, nor giue any thing to him.</p>

But his reaſons are grounded on his luſt, and according to his luſt, for that is his law. <hi>Better it is to haue an handfull with quietneſſe, then both hands full with trauell &amp; vexation of ſpirit.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, it is better for a man to content himſelfe with a little with reſt, then to toyle himſelfe as the drudge doth, carking and caring night and day hee cannot tell for whom. What ſhould a man doe, but eate and drinke, and play, and be merry, and take his naturall reſt? A man cannot tell how long hee ſhall liue, wherefore then ſhould hee make a beaſt of himſelfe? He were as good ſpend his goods himſelfe, as let another ſpend them. A man may labour all his life to gather goods for his children, and they may hap to be rather the worſe, then better for them. For as he hath freed them from care to get them, ſo will they but care how to waſte them. Againe, he that ſtriueth to be rich, ſhall be intangled in manifold buſineſſes, troubles, ſuits, and be diſquieted with a multitude of ſeruants and labourers, which will ſpend it as faſt as they get it. Moreouer, he that hath much, is but a prey to theeues, robbers, and catch-poles, ſo that vnleſſe hee looke well and warily to himſelfe, hee ſhall be inſnared one way or other, and be hated and enuyed. Now for a man to liue, and lie continually thus at defence, is a great vexation, and better were it that his goods were farre enough, then to liue in continuall feare, and drudgery. Therefore I hold it

a wiſer courſe for a man to take his eaſe and pleaſure, to be content with a little, let the World runne which way it will.

but a talker, a familiar friend is but a diſturber of his thoughts, and hindereth him from his buſineſſe. So feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and carefull, diſtruſtfull and deſpairefull is a man, when God leaueth him to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he is deſcribed by his vnreaſonableneſſe, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued by the negation of the impulſiue cauſes of his carefull drudgery. <hi>He hath neither child nor brother, kinſman, nor alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> at leaſt that ſtandeth in neede to be helped with his goods.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he is deſcribed by his exceſſe. <hi>There is none end of all his labour.</hi> Hee is inſatiable, his heart is a bottomeleſſe gulfe that cannot be filled, his deſires are inlarged as hell. All that he looketh vpon with his eyes, he deſireth to haue. And if he had it, yet could not that quench his thirſt, nor ſtay his hungry appetite. He is a <hi>Leuiathan,</hi> a Sea-dragon, or Whale, that wanteth roome in the maine Ocean.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he is deſcribed by his ſenſeleſneſſe. forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, want of diſcourſe, and vſe of reaſon, being in vtter bondage to his luſt, and ſo wholly degenerated into the nature of a beaſt. <hi>He neuer ſaith, for whom doe I labour, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue my ſoule of good?</hi> Hee is carried euen forward like the plant by his inclination, or like the beaſt by his appetite, like euery irrationall by his inſtinct, neuer reflecting his reaſon vpon himſelfe, or his trauell, to conſider the end thereof, and vſe of worldly things, nor vpon his owne end, though hee ſee death in others, both elder, younger, and equals euery day before his eyes, and euen feele the cauſes, fore-runners, or warnings of death in his owne fleſh and bones ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him to iudgement. This perſon moſt wiſe, moſt good in his owne conceit, commeth farre ſhort of the rich man, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. who in the fulneſſe of wealth was able to ſay; <hi>Now ſoule take thy reſt, thou haſt goods enough, eate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> drinke, and be merrie.</hi> He commeth farre ſhort of <hi>Nabal,</hi> that ate, and dranke, and was drunke, and ſlept ſoundly vpon it. Nay, he neuer bethinketh himſelfe how all the things of this World ſerue for nothing elſe but meate, drinke, apparell. For he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priueth himſelfe of theſe as neere as may be, and layeth them vp for the wormes, mothes, and canker. This ſeruice is the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:3539:59"/>
euent of his labour, as much as in him lyeth, (for death, not he, putteth others in poſſeſſion and vſe thereof) what other end ſoeuer he confuſedly dreameth of, but neuer obtaineth.</p>
               <p>The whole verſe laboureth of a <hi>Gradation,</hi> thus: He care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully laboureth for no cauſe; and not onely ſo, but there is none end of his labour; and not onely that, but he is neuer ſatisfied, neither that onely, but he affords no comfort to his body therewith. He planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit; he feedeth a flocke, and eateth not of the milke, he is an oxe treading out the corne, and muzzleth his owne mouth, yea, when his bread is before him, he layeth his knife to his throat, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, ſcarcity is vpon his table. This is a vanity, and a ſore trauell. It is one alone indeed, for there is nothing in nature to compare him to. For euery creature deſireth the perfection of it ſelfe, but this ſeeketh his owne deſtruction. He is like a Water-mill.</p>

               <p>The firſt example, is of two working together. Two or more labouring, or trauelling, or doing any thing are helped, furthered and comforted one by another. And that worke, or exerciſe whereabout they are buſied, hath better ſucceſſe by much, then when one is alone. Man by nature is the moſt ſociable creature, as his reaſon and ſpeech doth manifeſt. As for other liuing creatures they are ſociable alſo, but yet by naturall ſympathy, and ſo are plants alſo. They are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered or ſeuered by their manifold differing kinds, and by ſympathies and antipathies in their kinds: But reaſon and ſpeech vniteth men into one ciuill body, and ſeuerall men are
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:3539:60"/>
ſeuerall members of that body. And whereas no member can ſerue it ſelfe, maintaine or comfort it ſelfe without the other, nor if it be ſicke, lame, &amp;c. can relieue it ſelfe without the other: ſo neither can any one man liue without the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working, nor comfort himſelf without the aid &amp; compaſſion of another. But if he ſtriue to doe it, or can doe it in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things yet it is altogether imperfectly, vnprofitably, vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably done, and of no continuance. For the whole ſtate of one member is ſo by diuine prouidence intangled and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited with another, that in the perfect wel-fare of one there muſt be a concurrence or communion of all, as wee ſee it to be in the members of the body, which though they haue ſeuerall offices, yet cannot one execute his office to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect good of it ſelfe, without the communion of the offices of the other members. What can the man doe, whom all men forſake and leaue wholly to himſelfe? what can the eye doe when all the other members leaue it? what profit hath it by ſeeing? Therefore the more that a man is ſeperated from ſociety, and community of life, he is the more imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, comfortleſſe, miſerable. But now this <hi>Miſanthropicall</hi> drudge hath no ſociety with God, and little with men, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is a member deſtitute, imperfect, yea worſe then a beaſt.

But from the firſt verſe to the ninth, he maketh a digreſſion from vanities in temporall things, and ſheweth the vanities that are rife in the Word in the ſeruice of God. As before hee declared the vanities of all humane things, both inward and outward, and withall ſhewed the good that was to be found in them, euen the comfort of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; ſo here hee ſetteth downe the true felicity and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of man, and where it is to be found, <hi>to wit,</hi> not in worldly wiſedome, worldly wealth, worldly pompe, but in the reuerend feare, and true ſeruice of God. It was not to be found in the Schooles of humaine learning, but in the houſe of God. And withall he ſheweth the vanities and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſies of men, corrupting themſelues in this his ſeruice, to the <hi>verſe</hi> 8. and the occaſions of their hypocriſies and fainting in his ſeruice, <hi>verſe</hi> 8. as doubtings of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence and adminiſtration through oppreſſions; which ſtill increaſeth vanity.

The ſoule is carried vpon the affections, as the body is vpon the feete. Therefore the meaning is, take heede to thy ſoule, to thy ſelfe, to thy ſpirit, to thy affections.

So alſo the commandements are diuided into two tables, the former containing duties of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards God, the other duties of charitie towards men. So the twelue articles teach vs what to beleeue concerning God, Father, Sonne and Holy Ghoſt, and what concerning the Church. The diſciples being yet but children and of confuſed knowledge vſed this prayer onely (I thinke) in ſolemne praying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as children and ignorant people are firſt taught the articles of faith, the commandements, and this prayer. But they that hold it enough to ſay the Lords prayer onely; namely, this forme of words, may as well lay it is enough to faith and obedience, onely to beleeue the Creede, and doe the commandements, refuſing the particulars of the Law and the Prophets, the Prouerbes of <hi>Solomon,</hi> &amp;c. the writings of the Euangeliſts, and Apoſtles, and all expoſitions and applications, as indeed they doe. But when the Apoſtles
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:3539:66"/>
were indued with full meaſure of the ſpirit they could frame prayers according to all circumſtances, &amp; exigence of times, and occaſions, as <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 24. &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 36.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conclude, as a mans knowledge of the truth is, ſo let him pray generally or particularly; yea both, according to the direction of the Lords prayer, and that is according to the doctrine of the whole Scripture of Chriſts kingdome. Euery right prayer is a branch of the Lords prayer, ſo euery doctrine a branch of the Creed, and euery worke of the ten Commandements. Aske, beleeue, doe. If theſe ſeeds be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vs, they muſt branch forth all ouer, as veines doe from the liuer, and ſinews from the braine; yea, if their branches fill the world, it is but the perfection and plerophorie, or fulnes of prayer, faith, obedience. As a man abounds in knowledge, ſo may he abound in all prayer and thankeſgiuing. But he that will inſiſt onely vpon the briefe collections or formes of the Creed, Lords Prayer, and ten Commandements, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry likely to deny all in particular, that in generall hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly confeſſeth, ſaying as it were, that fruit, that br nch neuer came out of that kernell which I had in my mouth ſeauen yeares agoe.

ſore euill, <hi>cholah,</hi> or euill diſeaſe, euen a ſickeneſſe to death, that a man ſhould ſpend all his dayes in trauell, depriuing his body and minde of recreations, and ſuch comforts as the vſe of riches bring, that in his latter dayes his ioy may be full, and perfect, without any mixture of care, or feare of want, either for himſelfe or for his children; but then it ſhould fall out quite contrary to his expectation; namely, that thoſe things which were gathered, kept and preſerued for his good, ſhould be to his deſtruction in their euent. This was the euent of <hi>Hamans</hi> aſpiring to promotion and honour, wealth, friends &amp;c. Hee little thought that all his plots for honour and wealth ſhould haue beene a rope and a gallowes to hang him on, whereas many others had been hanged with leſſe coſt and labour. But the more coſt the greater infamy, the higher riſe the greater fall.</p>
               <p>The builders of the tower of Babel intended to make themſelues famous in the earth, but the euent was their labor for their trauell, and the iudgement of God vpon their pride. It became a bable good for naught, but to proclaime their folly to all ages of the world. The deuill and the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thought that all was firme and ſure to them and theirs, when they had crucified Chriſt, and in his ignominious death had expoſed his name, doctrine, and all that beleeued in him, to ſhame and perpetuall contempt. But the euent was the downe-fall of Satans kingdome, and the ſhame and confuſion of them and their children, as it is in the parable of the vineyard. They that beleeue in him ſhall neuer be confounded, nor aſhamed. Much a doe a long time alſo, hath there been about the building and eſtabliſhing of the Romiſh Synagogue, and <hi>deifying</hi> the great <hi>Gull,</hi> but confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſhame ſhall be the euent. The rich man. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. prouided and laid vp great ſtore of wealth, for his caſe and ioy in his old age, but when he begins to ſay, Now ſoule caſt off all care, take thine eaſe, eate, drinke, and be merry, the euent was quite contrary, for his goods preſſed downe his ſoule to hell.</p>
               <p>Finally, to how many and moſt lamentable miſeries may a man and his family be expoſed by reaſon of his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,

               <p>To conclude, this is a vanity and a grieuous euill belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to worldly goods, whoſoeuer getteth them, or keepeth them; namely, oft-times to occaſion his ruine. This genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie doth <hi>Solomon</hi> principally intend.</p>

               <p>AN amplification of the vnprofitableneſſe of riches, by their common adiunct. They are bodily, temporary, momentany. Man is euerlaſting in his better part, whereof he is denominated a man. But riches ſerue onely for the time of this our life. There is no ſtrength in them to free a man from death, but they leaue him in the iawes of death. They ſerue onely for his expence by the way, till he come to the place of his accompt, and his iudgement vpon his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:3539:75"/>
Riches are like an Harlot, which hauing intangled a man with the loue of her, maketh a ſhew as though ſhee would not depatt from him; but when he is arreſted by the Sergeant for debt, ſhee vtterly forſaketh him, and followeth other cuſtomers, whom ſhee mocketh in like ſort. <hi>The rich man can carry away nothing in his hand of all his labour,</hi> to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord any helpe, or comfort to him after death. <hi>Diues, Luke</hi> 16. doth witneſſe this, who of all his earthly abundance, could not enioy ſo much as a droppe of water to coole his tongue. The rich mans departure out of the World, is illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by a compariſon of his comming into the World. <hi>As he came naked, ſo ſhall he returne.</hi> It will be ſaid; That is the common condition of euery man, and no more griefe to the rich then to the poore. <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is indeed the common condition of all men, but yet a miſery peculiar to the rich: For he hath onely laboured for riches, he hath put his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his riches, his ioy, delight, comfort, was all in his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; he knew none other God, but his Idoll. Now as it is the torment of hell, to be quite ſeparated from the preſence and protection of God, from the company of his Angels and Saints: ſo is it the greateſt miſery of the rich man, to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the preſence and protection of <hi>Mammon:</hi> When he and his Idoll are parted, then he falleth into deſperation. This we ſee verified by the practiſe of thoſe, who being yet aliue, and likely to liue long, make away themſelues, yea, oft times for a ſmall loſſe, but their feare is great: for they haue now none other God to truſt on, or to fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therefore how much ſoeuer a man is addicted to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinne, how great ſoeuer his deſire, his loue, delight be in any vice, yet for this onely is he termed an Idolater. And this is the cauſe, why the Scriptures impute this common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of man with all creatures, to the rich, for a ſpeciall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 17.

               <p>AN amplification of the vnprofitableneſſe of riches loſt, by a compariſon of the common condition of man leauing his riches. For a man by death to leaue all behinde him, is a miſery. But it is a greater miſery for riches to leaue a man before death. Commonly riches accompany the rich to the graue, and there giue him his farewell, which indeed is a miſery to goe as he came: but this man hauing gotten them with exceſſiue toyle, is depriued of them before his death, ſo that in all points he goeth as he came. This is a double miſery. <hi>Diues</hi> his miſery was great in that hee muſt part from his wealth, yet he was honoured with a pompous funerall; but <hi>Iobs</hi> was greater, that being beſtripped of all, hee ſhould die before his death, and be buried before his graue was open, as yet hee knew nothing to the contrary. For firſt his whole ſtate was diſſolued, all his ornaments, all his neceſſaries vtterly diſperſed, dead in his eſtate, dead in his children, the World was a dead thing to him, and hee a dead thing to the World, as the Prouerbe is, <hi>Who is ſo woe begoue, as firſt a man ſince none.</hi> Againe, he was buried in the graue of ſorrow, and couered with the moulde of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uion, and contempt. Therefore ſaid <hi>Dauid</hi> in his deiection alſo, <hi>I am a worme, and no man, I am as a dead man out of minde;</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 4. <hi>I am not better then my Fathers were.</hi> This then is alſo a ſore euill.

the <hi>Equals,</hi> in this word (alſo). As it is a grieuous euill for a man to periſh by occaſion of his riches; ſo is it alſo as grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous an euill, that his riches ſhould periſh from him. For his life ſtandeth in his riches. And as <hi>Dauid</hi> in his mourning for <hi>Abſolon,</hi> wiſhed that he had died for him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 33. So the rich man in his mourning for the loſſe of his goods, wiſheth himſelfe dead, or that he had beene dead, when by ſuch or ſuch a folly he incurred ſuch an incurable damage. How many a man hazardeth, yea, looſeth his life to ſaue his goods?

to haue his abiding among the creatures of God, to liue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, and to be in the Church of God, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he licked the duſt with the Serpent, and drunke water, and were filled with all the temporall afflictions of this life, was an heauen. Now as this vale of miſery was to <hi>Diues</hi> in torments an heauen without miſery: ſo are vaine riches a paradiſe of pleaſure to the godleſſe rich, being now in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty.

               <p>A Particular explication of the propoſition in theſe two next verſes, wherein this vanity or euill plague, is ſet forth to the view of the eyes, by an <hi>hypotipoſis</hi> or liuely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. There is a man, that as hee hath thirſted after worldly goods, as the Iſraelites hungred for fleſh, ſo God hath giuen him his hearts deſire: He hath riches, hee hath wealth, and the abundance of all things ſeruiceable for the welfare of mans life; he hath honour, or the place, and title of dignitie to which he hath aſpired, neither doth hee want any thing that his ſoule luſted after, but hath inioyed all the full meaſure and perfection thereof. Here is the outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of happineſſe: But God withholdeth his grace from him, that he cannot vſe it to his comfort. He is like an aſſe loaded with gold, and victuals, but eateth thiſtles, and in the end a ſtranger that neuer ſweat for it, one vnknowne to him, yea, it may be one that was his enemy ſhall haue the vſe thereof. So that it plainely appeareth at the laſt to all men, that this happy man was the drudge, the Purueyor, the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the aſſe of other mens burdens. Here is the vnprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and vanity of his labour. And this is an euill diſeaſe, or grieuous ſickeneſſe. This euill diſeaſe than conſiſteth, 1.

               </head>
               <p>THe ſecond part of the Chapter: which is, a concluſion of the weakeneſſe, and inſufficiency of riches to ſatisfie the deſire of man, to the end of the Chapter. Man conſiſteth of an immortall ſoule and corruptible body; that is ſpirituall, this is earthly: yea, that is a ſpirit, and the body is but a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, or inſtrument vnited to it, without compoſition or mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This veſſell is the ſperme of the World, the duſt of the earth, that is to ſay, an elementary matter or ſubſtance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of a mixture of the elements, and therefore it is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained and maintained by elementary foode; So that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, <hi>to wit,</hi> hunger, and thirſt, is earthly alſo. Now what is the end of all the labour of man? wherein doth he labour? what is the obiect or ſubiect whereon he worketh? Is it not all to ſatisfie the bodily appetite? Whence proceedeth, and whether tendeth this appetite? Nature it ſelfe declareth the matter. The appetite of the Tree is the more ſimple moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, or rather iuyce of the earth, and it cannot, neither wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to goe beyond his kinde: For the appetite is limited to the kinde, which onely deſireth the perfection, and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation thereof. And ſo of all creatures liuing and ſenſible, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their kindes. But mans veſſell being the moſt compound, not that it hath more elements then other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but the moſt vniuerſall nature, hath an vniuerſall appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite: And the whole World, with all the creatures therein, ſerue onely for meate, drinke, and cloathing. The whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of heauen and earth are onely for theſe three ſeruices of mans body, either immediately, or mediately; that is to ſay, either foode, or elſe preparatory veſſels, Miniſters, Officers, or Tradeſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>men, ſubordinate one to another for man, who is the centre of them all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sheepe and Oxen eate the iuyce of the earth, not immediately, but by the preparatory veſſell, the greene hearbe, by which it is transformed into foode agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the nature of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:3539:81"/>
wormes, and vileſt things, are by ſubordinate veſſels from one to another, prepared to his mouth, and for his mouth. The moſt vniuerſall inſtrument by whoſe foture the life of the World, and of all his furniture is maintained, is the light in the Sunne, which God therefore created before any other creature. Then the Starres, nextly the matter of the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereof the ſtarres were formed: Theſe are ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. So that the heauens are an vniuerſall cauſe or veſſell, by whoſe foture the elements are ſuſtained. Againe, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are an vniuerſall cauſe of ſuſtenance of their creatures produced out of their wombes, and formed of them. Laſtly, the mixt creatures are preparatory veſſels one for another, till at length all come to the belly and backe of man, euen his body, the centre of them all: For all is meate, and meate includeth medicine alſo. Now euery man hath in him the nature of all men, ſo that all men are but as one man, this one man is the ſperme or ſeede of the whole World, ſuperiour and inferiour nature, as the kernell containes the tree with all his branches, leaues, colours, vermiculations, fruits, &amp;c. &amp; as the ſperme of the liuing creature containeth the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, faculties, qualities, operations, &amp;c. of the creature from whoſe body it is propagated, and is by the vniuerſall fotures of the light, ſtarres, firmament, elements, &amp;c. produced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to growth and perfection, which are but the vniuerſall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory inſtruments, which this ſperme vſeth and applyeth for the building vp of it ſelfe with the next foode or matter, which is apt to be adapted, and incorporated into the nature of it ſelfe: This matter or foode it onely deſireth. And ſo doth man alſo in his kinde. Of the animall and ſpirituall foode and appetite it is impertinent here to ſpeake. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>all the labour of man is for his mouth.</hi> The heauens, the elements, the creatures, worke, and prepare for him, by their influences, inclinations, appetites, for to ſatisfie and fill his appetite. Their mouthes are made for his mouth, their skinnes for his clothing, and building alſo is but a cloathing or couering. All things are for the neceſſities and delights of the body. In this reſpect alſo is he the Image of God, in that all things are for him, and he is for himſelfe, as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:3539:81"/>
the creatures. For all are ſeruants to him, but he is ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant to none: If he be, that is his degenerating, his curſe, his fall, his brutiſhneſſe: for he that ſerueth any thing, body, or bodily things, is a beaſt in that reſpect. But who almoſt now a dayes maketh not an Idoll of his body? therefore when we would be as gods, then are we euill beaſts, filthy beaſts. But bodily things are for the ſeruice of the body; the body for the ſpirit, and that for the Lord. Otherwiſe, as <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſaith; <hi>Euery man is a beaſt by his owne knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And yet the appetite is not filled.</hi> Or as the Hebrew ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth; <hi>The ſoule is not filled.</hi> What the extent of mans appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite is, both perſonall, and bodily, may well appeare, by that which is already ſpoken, and alſo by the two examples fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. The firſt is ſufficiently teſtified by the example of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, who was not contented with the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the continent or Land, nor yet of the Sea, when he had heard <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> diſputing of the plurality of Worlds; and when he had conquered all, hee muſt needs be a god, pretending a title to heauen alſo. The appetite of man is not limitted to the materiall World, till he be transformed, or degenerated into the nature of a beaſt, which is when his light is fallen downe into the confuſed <hi>Chaos</hi> againe, the lees of his concupiſcence, which is vtter darkeneſſe. The ſecond is teſtified by the example of <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> the monſtrous glutton, who was ſerued at one ſupper with ſeauen thouſand fiſhes, and fiue thouſand fowles, and had ſixe hundred bawdes and harlots following him in chariots, and gaue great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to him that could inuent any new pleaſure. Who is not an <hi>Alexander,</hi> and an <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> if God ſuffer him to range? God hath alwayes permitted ſome to runne out into extremities of vice, as the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> that all men may ſee what horrible filth lyeth in the heart of euery man, which God reſtraineth for the preſeruation of man-kinde for his Elect ſake, otherwiſe the Diuell is come downe, and rideth vpon mans appetite. The appetite multiplyeth it ſelfe infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely. For of all the millions of the liuing, among whom the World is diuided, euery one hath an appetite of all, which ſheweth it ſelfe in the vehemency, and extreamity of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:3539:82"/>
mens ſtriuings, and aſpirings higher and higher, one roaring waue or billow beating forward another to ouerflow the banks, and to conuert all into ſea, if God had not limited their line, within which euery man is bounded, when hee hath inhiated, ſtriuen, and done what he can. His might ſhall neuer be to his moode. For God hath ſet hill againſt dale, and contrarily. But what the appetite of him that hath but one acre of ground to liue on, and but one wife, is in the nature and kinde thereof without outward reſtraint, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grace, and indeed both, plainely appeareth by theſe two examples, which may ſerue for all. Therefore all the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of man is for his body and bodily ſtate, <hi>but the appetite is not filled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreouer, if the bodily appetite ſhould be ſatisfied with meate, drinke, apparrell, with the delights of the ſonnes of men, and pleaſures of the eyes; and that the perſonall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite were alſo ſatisfied with honor and Soueraignty, which happened neither to <hi>Alexander,</hi> nor to <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> nor to any naturall man; yet cannot the ſoule be ſatisfied with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite worlds. For the food of the ſoule is not the world, but God in the world.</p>
               <p>The excellent beauty of Gods wiſedome ſhining forth in all things, enamoureth the ſoule with the loue thereof. And the more that a man knoweth, the more he thirſteth and longeth for knowledge. But this appetite is not filled, for it worketh on an infinite obiect, which cannot be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nor contained in the ſoule, at leaſt, while it worketh by earthly organes. So that neither <hi>Alexander</hi> nor yet his Maſter <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> nor <hi>Plato, Ariſtotles</hi> Maſter could be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied herewith. Their appetites could not be ſtanched. Hee that goeth about it, maketh God an Idoll, becauſe he limiteth the infinite. But if he be comprehended of any creature in heauen or earth, then is he limited. I conclude, though the appetite of the body ſhould be filled, yet the appetite of man could neuer be filled. Then full contentment or felicity is not to be found in this world, nor by this world, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite that will not be filled with a little, ſhall neuer be filled, howſoeuer men commonly deceiue themſelues, thinking
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:3539:82"/>
that if they had but this, or that, they would ſet vp their reſt. Yea, euen as <hi>Diues</hi> would haue ſet vp his reſt, if he had gotten but one drop of water to quench his feruent thirſt. The truth is, the more fuell the fire hath, the more hot it burneth. But the ſpirit of Chriſt is the water that cooles this heate, and quencheth this thirſt, his body and blood ſatisfieth this hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. When the appetite, the attractiue, retentiue, digeſtiue powers worke on this foode, the other becommeth an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion or expulſion.</p>
               <p>But againe, though we enioy Chriſt and the kingdome of glory by faith, yet ſo long as we are here in the fleſh, wee haue not the full poſſeſſion thereof, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 1. and therefore deſire to be with him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. 2.</p>
               <p>To conclude; Neither the appetite of the brutiſh man, nor of the animall or carnall man, nor of the ſpirituall man is here filled. And what ſhal fill the vegetable man, or locomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue tree, which deſireth not meat, drinke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cloathing, women, children, buildings, &amp;c. <hi>Eccle.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>And yet is there none end of his labour?</hi> Men now a dayes grow as thinne as Oakes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to grow, and all is filled with brutes and vnprofitable vegetables.</p>

The ſhadow is longeſt in the morning, and it doth nothing but vaniſh till noone, where it ſeemeth to make a ſtand, but doth not, but by increaſing it vaniſheth quite away. If the ſhadow grow ſhorter, time ſpends, if it grow longer time alſo ſpends: ſo is the time of life a continuall ſpending, as the Snaile that continually waſteth her ſelfe. Now in this fleeting time, who can tell what is good for a man, ſeeing that man, and all things with him vaniſh away like a ſhadow? Againe, as there is no conſtancie of dayes, in regard of their naturall qualitie and diſpoſition, but are variable and contrarie, ſo neither is there of the ſtate of man in the decourſe of his life: Euery day bringeth new trauels, new cares, new trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, alterations, and changes, and euery one is doubtfull and fearefull of after times. And this is a vanitie.</p>
               <p>Againe, euery man ſeeth his imprudence, and manifold errors, committed in the dayes that are paſt; he ſeeth his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate courſes, his ouer-ſights, the weakeneſſe of his vnderſtanding and iudgement, in contriuing things to the beſt, for which he vexeth himſelfe with griefe and anger all his life after, and ſo recompenceth vanitie with vanitie. Againe, when he ſeeketh to redreſſe that which hath beene amiſſe by a new and better courſe, he falleth rather into greater errours, as hee that is in a maze, or vaſt deſart. Therefore neither can a man himſelfe, who is beſt knowne to himſelfe, tell what is good for him, neither can any other man. <hi>For who can tell a man what ſhall be after him?</hi> A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the former. No man can tell what is good for a man throughout the whole courſe of his life, ſeeing that life is vaine, and euery day of life is vaine. But why cannot a man tell what is good for a man? Becauſe that he that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell what ſhall be after a man, either in after times of life, or when he is dead, cannot tell what is good for a man to doe for the preſent; but the former can no man doe, neither can he doe the latter. If a man could tell what would be cheape, what deare, he would be rich in a yeere. But God

               <p>And his maine ſcope herein, is to ſet downe thoſe better things for certaine remedies, whereby to auoide thoſe vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of life, or to extenuate and mittigate them, and to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what good may redound to man by the right ordering

Therefore God hath ſubiected all things to vanitie, out of which a man can by no meanes extricate himſelfe, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſtriuing runne further in. But yet ſeeing that there is an happie ſtate of man here begunne, which a man is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and ſeeke for, in God, (not in worldy things) and euen that in this vaine life, which in that reſpect is not vaine, there are certaine ſalues for theſe ſores, and remedies for theſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities: <hi>Solomon</hi> therefore, that he might take away from men diſcontentment, and diſpaire of their eſtate, doth here deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer rules of direction and comfort, that they may haue wherewith to arme themſelues againſt the troubles and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of this vaine life, and in ſome good meaſure be able to alay and mitigate the ſame, which God laid vpon <hi>Adam,</hi> and all his ſonnes, for a iuſt puniſhment of his fall.</p>
               <p>The firſt rule or remedy is in this firſt verſe: <hi>A good man.</hi> A good reputation or report, being the teſtimony of good men, of the vertuous life &amp; honeſt conuerſation of a man, is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallbleſſing of God, arming the heart with great ioy and comfort againſt many, yea, all outward loſſes, and want of bodily things. The excellencie of a good name is illuſtrated by a compariſon of the beſt and moſt delicious things, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by ointment, by a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> of the <hi>Speciall.</hi> The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon is both of the qualitie and quantitie. Firſt, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the qualitie: euen as the pretious ointment hath a fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant ſcent refreſhing and delighting the ſpirits of the ſenſes, whereby the body and minde is cheered; ſo a good name and deſerued eſtimation is of all outward things the moſt pleaſant poſſeſſion, comporting the heart in euery ſtate of life: For it originally proceedeth from a good conſcience, and is the perfume of a godly and faithfull heart, yea, hee that hauing a great meaſure of the annointing of God, which is the graces of his ſpirit, to be a patterne to the rude, a light to the blinde, a guide to them that know not the way, doth alſo refreſh, encourage, and cheare the ſpirits and hearts of all that loue God, and his truth among the filthy ſents of corrupt examples, fleſhly faſhions, and ethnicall behauiours, that are noyſome and grieuous to the eyes,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:3539:87"/>
eares, and mindes of men of gracious diſpoſition, and as a freſh gale of ſweet ayre to him that laboureth in the earth, that liueth among earthly men.</p>
               <p>Concerning the quantity, the argument is from the leſſe to the greater.</p>
               <p>A precious oyntment is of great value, a chiefe treaſure, and eſteemed with the moſt precious things, but a good name is of more worth then it, or any earthly ſubſtance. For coſtly oyntments, and other treaſures are of times more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull among the wicked: For the ſenſuall are all for their ſences, but this is peculiar to good men alone. They may be bought for money, but this is the gift of God, not to be purchaſed with baſe mettall. They are corruptible, this is euerlaſting. They leaue a man in death, and betake them to a new maſter, but the praiſe of the iuſt man remaineth ſtill, and ſtill, his owne. It both tarrieth behinde him on earth, and goeth with him to heauen, and will crowne him with glory at the laſt day. For although it be darkened for a time amongſt the goates, as <hi>Naboth</hi> was, as <hi>Pauls</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids,</hi> yet ſhall it breake forth as the rayes of the Sunne from vnder a cloud. It may be couered, but it cannot be polluted with vnclean tongues, yet it becommeth more bright as met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall rubbed with duſt or myre. Whereas contrarily, the falſe and forced praiſe of ſinners that are prone and ambitious, turneth to their greater ſhame, as that of <hi>Herod, Senacherib,</hi> and the Phariſees did. And ſo ſhall <hi>Antichriſts</hi> doe, as did that of <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the day of death, then the day of ones birth.</hi> Theſe words are a ſecond rule, to arme the man that feareth God againſt temporall miſeries. Concerning their dependence vpon the former, they are an anſwere to an obiection framed thus: A good report in this life affords little comfort, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that death commeth after it, which is the miſerable end of all men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The day of death is better then the day that one is borne. It is better then the time of life, and the tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things of life. Yea, it is better then a good report it ſelfe,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:3539:88"/>
becauſe it is a comfort to extenuate the afflictions of life, but this vtterly aboliſheth all vanities. The birth-day is an entrance into all woe and miſery, but the day of death is a paſſage into life. The body is but a priſon and a racke to the ſoule, but by death it is ſet at liberty: For by death are all miſeries ended, all dangers, paines, aches, diſeaſes, ſorrowes, teares, and that grieuous warre and conflict of concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, or fleſhly luſts, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11. doubtings, vnbeleefe, feares, pride, ignorance, couetouſneſſe, ambition, enuy, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, luſt, which fight againſt the ſoule, are dead, from which <hi>Paul</hi> ſo earneſtly deſired to be freed, <hi>Romans</hi> 7. 24. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8.</p>
               <p>Againe, by death a man is freed from euils to come, <hi>Eſay</hi> 57. 1. He is deliuered from the weariſome company of petul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus goates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 120. 5. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 4. and from the aſſaults of Sathan, yea from all fightings within and without, to reſt, and raigne in glory with Chriſt, and the bleſſed company of heauen: This of the rule or remedy principally aymed at. Now for the ſequele or collection concerning vanity, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from hence is thus. If the day of death, which to carnall reaſon is miſerable, be better then the day of birth, ſurely this life is a thing moſt vaine. But ſo it is.</p>

               <p>A Second rule or remedy whereby a man is armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the vanities of life, is mortification, which is the ſuppreſſing of ſinne, and curbing of the motions of ſinne in the heart ſimply, becauſe it diſpleaſeth God, and is the onely thing whereby he is diſhonoured. Other mortifications are but either philoſophicall, or ciuill, or ſubtle; the firſt whereof is of naturall conſcience, the ſecond of vaine glorious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, the third of a diuelliſh heart. But this is wrought onely by the Spirit of God, who is a purifying fire, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging

He is bleſſed whoſe ſpirit is not guilefull, though he be ſubiect to many infirmities. Now that this rule may be operatiue, and of force, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſetteth downe the meanes and courſes that are to be taken, whereby to produce and nouriſh it, for the comfort of the ſoule, in this vale of miſery. The gift is of God, from whom euery good ſeede of grace proceedeth; the other are but artificiall, imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and coyned: yet this ſeede of God groweth not but by planting &amp; watering, as all other ſeeds doe, and that is the vſe of the meanes. The meanes therefore of the growth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of this grace, <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſetteth downe, illuſtrating the ſame by a compariſon of the contrary vanities, and they are foure, in the foure next verſes.</p>
               <p>The firſt meanes of mortification, are the outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocations thereunto, <hi>to wit,</hi> ſuch places, and companies whereby that good ſeede of grace that lyeth in the heart may be preſerued and increaſed. For euery ſeede muſt haue his proper place, and outward foture of warmth and moiſture to concoct it to perfection, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth, Riga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>It is better to goe to the houſe of mourning,</hi> to viſit the ſorrowfull, and ſad in heart, to goe to the graue of the dead, to frequent the companies of mourners, to weepe with them; <hi>then to goe to the houſe of feaſting,</hi> where there is ſinging, dancing, merriment, vanity, and prouocations to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity moſt commonly. <hi>For that is the end of all men.</hi> A confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this rule, or reaſon of the compariſon, by the <hi>anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,</hi> or contrarietie of the adiuncts.

               </p>
               <p>Let a man feed, pride, and beautifie his body as he will, yea, as moſt doe now a dayes make an Idoll of it, yet ſhall it be a dead carkeis buried in the earth, as other dead carrion is,

and more vile then other. <hi>Bonum optimum corruptum fit peſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum.</hi> The more compoſition the more corruption, as in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches increaſed there is more vanity. So that if it muſt needs be an idoll, yet ſhall it be but a carrion idoll, and ſuch are all they that adore it in feaſts and pompous meetings, as did the Phariſees.</p>
               <p>Againe, let a man put away all remembrance of death out of his heart, to ſource himſelfe in the fleſh, to boyle in pleaſure, ſeeking out companions, and prouocations of luſt, (which are planters and waterers alſo in their weedy kinde) yet ſhall it be turned in the end to lamentation and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, vnleſſe that curſe be laid on a mans death, that none ſhall mourne for him, but rather eate him vp, as the dogges did <hi>Iezabel,</hi> one worrying another for his goods and lands, and the wicked poore roaring like greedy Lions for his fleſh, that care not who dye, nor how many, ſo that their bellies be filled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the lining will lay it to heart.</hi> A reaſon or proofe of the conſecution of the former argument, which was this:</p>
               <p>If in the houſe of mourning there be the end of all men, then it is better to goe thither, then to the houſe of feaſting.</p>
               <p>But the antecedent is true.</p>
               <p>Therefore the conſequent alſo.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of the conſequence is, <hi>the liuing ſhall lay it to heart.</hi> Theſe words ſhew the effect of death and mourning, (which are termed, <hi>the end of all men)</hi> namely, a ſerious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of the ſtate, and condition of man. All men are apt to forget themſelues to be but men, ſpecially in their fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings, and iolity, iouil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y, and ribaldry; but this end of all men, and them being expoſed to the ſenſes, eyes, and eares, doth occaſion them to remember whence they came, what they are, whether they are to goe. So then this ſerious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation or remembrance, is the effect of the impulſiue cauſe. For by the dead corpes and mourning, a man is occaſioned to remember himſelfe. The inward impulſiue or precedent, is the gracious diſpoſition of the heart, to take ſuch good oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, or ſuffer himſelfe to be moued therewith: for the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:3539:89"/>
wicked heart is ſtony, brawny, without remorſe, full of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity; therefore hee maketh this contrarily an occaſion of more epicuriſh and ſenſuall liuing, yea, at this time ſeruing his belly and his luſts, as hee that cutteth purſes euen before the bench. And the eye of the foole is mindleſſe, wandring in the corners of the earth. The outward impulſiue, I ſay, is the occaſion, <hi>to wit,</hi> the dead corpes and mourning, the houſe of mourning, and the graue of the dead. What is a man by this occaſion moued to lay to his heart?</p>
               <p n="1">I. His owne death, for euen ſo muſt he die, and be mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for of his wife, children, kinsfolkes, &amp;c. caſt into the graue, and be putrified in the earth.</p>
               <p n="2">II.

               <p>A Third rule or remedy, whereby a man is armed againſt the miſeries or vanities of this life is patience. Patience is a voluntary &amp; continuall ſuſtaining &amp; bearing of euils and euill men, the more freely to ſhew &amp; bring forth the fruits of the ſpirit, for the comfort of our owne hearts, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of our aſſurance, and for the conuerſion of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our enemies. For in contending with the wicked in their kinde (otherwiſe the righteous contendeth with them) and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:3539:93"/>
reuenging of our wrongs, wee ſhall obſcure the graces of God, and fall into the ſame miſchiefe, and condemnation with them, which thing the enemies of grace deſire. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy is ſet downe in the foure next verſes. The <hi>Analyſis</hi> whereof I take to be this. Patience is firſt illuſtrated by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the contrary, <hi>to wit,</hi> impatience, expreſſed by the fountaine or cauſe thereof (pride of heart) <hi>verſe</hi> 8. Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is deſcribed, firſt by the effects, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. Secondly, by the euent, <hi>verſe</hi> 8. Moreouer, patience is amplified by a dehor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>verſe</hi> 9. and figured by a <hi>prol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pſis, verſe</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>This verſe then is a deſcription of impatience, or the proud ſpirit, by the effects thereof, oppreſſion, and peruerting of the Law. Oppreſſion ſtandeth in racking, wronging, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenging. <hi>Surely oppreſſion maketh a wiſe man mad.</hi> As a mad man is without the vſe of reaſon, being violently carried with a corrupt humour, ſaying, and doing nothing from any ground of good vnderſtanding, but according to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of broken and confuſed phantaſmes, cauſed by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of blood: euen ſo the wiſe being carried with inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate affections and luſts, to wrong, oppreſſe, reuenge, and catch from euery man to grind the face of euery man, in len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and betting, to wreſt the Law for aduantage, bewrayeth not onely fooliſhneſſe, but madneſſe, harming himſelfe, and miſchieuing others, as other mad men doe. The difference betweene them ſtandeth onely in this, that the one is but a bodily madneſſe, cauſed moſt often through the ſuperfluity of an humour, the other is ſpirituall, inſpired and incenſed of the Diuell. That is in the blood, this is in the heart: that is brutall, this is diuelliſh; that is common to all, this peculiar to the children of the Diuell: that hath not reaſon, this vſeth not reaſon, or rather that cannot vſe reaſon, this will not vſe reaſon.</p>
               <p>Finally, there is a ſpirituall frenzineſſe in fleſhly ſobriety. Theſe are Sathans wildings, whom he hath blinded, and ſo rideth them at his pleaſure. They are taken of him at his will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Apoſtle ſaith. The propoſition is amplified by a vehement aſſeu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:3539:94"/>
                  <hi>heart.</hi> This is another effect of impatience, peruerting of the Law for bribes: In <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 19. <hi>A gift blindeth the eyes of the wiſe, and peruerteth the words of the righteous;</hi> that is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the words of him that elſe would iudge righteouſly, or the matters of the innocent, for the Hebrew word <hi>Dabar,</hi> ſignifieth indifferently both, and both are one. Here it is ſaid, a gift deſtroyeth the heart, corrupteth the heart, taketh away the heart, all are one. Who is ſo blind as he that will not ſee? And ſo fooliſh as he that wil not vnderſtand? What heart is more corrupt then that which condemneth it ſelfe in that which it alloweth, or rather condemneth it owne thefe, in giuing ſentence vpon anothers? yea, which preſſeth it ſelfe to death, in giuing ſentence of death, or abſoluing another from death? And what words more peruerſe then thoſe of <hi>Iudas, Quid mihi dabitis?</hi> What will ye giue me, and I will betray the innocent into the hands of his cruell aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries? When the Magiſtrates eyes are blinded, then is he led by the ſtring of the briber, and the briber by the ſtring of the Diuell, and they both fall into the ditch. As the ſight of the Apple deſfroyed the heart of <hi>Eue;</hi> ſo the ſight, or feeling of a bribe, deſtroyeth the heart of the wiſe, that knoweth the Law, and diſcerneth iudgement. Our firſt Parents for an apple loſt Paradiſe, and woon hell; ſo euery child of <hi>Adam,</hi> like <hi>Eſau,</hi> for a ſweet bit will ſell his ſoule to the Diuell, and his brother to a lying bribing thiefe, yea, partake with the thiefe, as <hi>Iudas</hi> did with the Phariſees, and all for a bit. We, wiſer children, thinke that it was a great folly in our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, that hauing ſo much, and ſo much choyce of other fruits, would notwithſtanding taſte of the forbidden ſruit, without any neede at all. It is euen as great folly, for a man in his abundance to deſtroy himſelfe, and his brethren for a bribe, a trifle of no value. The briber is the Diuels meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: Now when he preſents his Maſters baite to the bribe-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, then is the Diuell at hand to inflame the luſt of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe in him, whereby the bribe ſeemeth pleaſant to the eyes, as the apple did to <hi>Eue.</hi> The gift dazzeleth the eyes, it hath a bewitching power in it, it taketh away the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> heart,

               <p>THeſe words containe the complaint of impatient peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and are a common obiection of wrathfull fooles, whereby to excuſe, yea, approoue, and cherriſh their moody and reuengefull paſſions, which wanting particular cauſes of iuſt anger, open their mouthes wide againſt the world, but indeed againſt God himſelfe, in whoſe hands the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world is. This complaint is continually in the mouthes of the wicked moody, and the wicked needy. The moody Papiſt would murther all the godly that haue Scripture in their mouthes, yea, and liues alſo: For they be <hi>Canaanites</hi> and <hi>Hagarens.</hi> And the needy prophane would murther the rich, for they are lyons in the grate. What theſe would doe appeareth by their complaints, groaning like mute theeues and murtherers vnder the preſſe: For the weight of the Law lyeth heauy vpon them by occaſion of their owne malice. For to the iuſt and godly euery law is a law of liberty. <hi>Say not thou, why were the former dayes better</hi>

For they will deſpiſe the wiſedome of the wiſe, and tread vnder foot their precious pearles, and glory in their mad contempt. Yet to try whether the foole will leaue his folly I will giue two or three anſweres to this idle obiection not worth the anſwering.</p>
               <p>Firſt, let him recount from the dayes that God placed man vpon the earth, till the preſent time, and ſhew mee when this good world was, <hi>(antiquae meliora: The more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, the purer, ſaith the prouerbe in another reſpect.)</hi> How good were the dayes that <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> liued in? How good were the dayes of the old world, till the Flood? The dayes of <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Cham?</hi> The dayes of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> in <hi>Canaan?</hi> Of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt?</hi> How good were the dayes of the Iudges? The dayes of the Kings of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael?</hi> How good were the dayes of <hi>Solomon,</hi> thoſe peaceable and wealthy dayes? Did not the people complaine of the grieuous burden of thoſe dayes, and were ready to rebell, as afterward they did? How good was the world in the dayes of Chriſt, and of the Apoſtles? If it were not then good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when ſhould it be good? How good in the times of the Primitiue Church, boyling in the heat of perſecutions and hereſies? How good were and are the times of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt? Of all times we find grieuous complaints. And of the times of Popery <hi>(hinc illae Lachrymae)</hi> we find great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:3539:96"/>
in the Fathers. Theſe times were full of warres, bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, maſſacres, treaſons, rebellions, robberies, &amp;c. cauſed by that man of ſinne. Fryar <hi>Mantuan</hi> diſcouereth the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the world then: And <hi>Euerard</hi> Arch-biſhop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury, wrote a volumne (called <hi>Obiurgatorium temporis)</hi> the Rebuke of the time. Wicked and monſtrous were thoſe daies, yea, exceeding the heathen about two hundreth yeares agoe, the goodneſſe whereof our wicked ignorants ſo much admire. But <hi>Elmerius,</hi> a Monke of <hi>Malmeſbury,</hi> counted them the dayes of greateſt woe and miſery, and thereupon gathered the certainty of Anti-chriſts preſent raigne? Full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well doe theſe proud murmurers ſhew their tyrannicall, and rebellious hearts: When they had a Pope to abſolue them from their alleagiance, and to quench their thirſt with the blood one of another, the world was good: When the Pope partly with ſubtilty, partly with violence wreſted Nobles, yea, Kings out of their poſſeſſions, yea, whom he luſted, after one manner or another, then was there cheapneſſe and plenty: The Fryars made <hi>Robin-hoods</hi> penny-worthes, and this is all that theſe greedy blood hounds commend the old world for. The Fryars bound the commons to them by making good penny-worths of other mens liuings, both of the Cleargy, and Laity, wrung from them by all deceitfull meanes, for which the Commons were but their ſlaues, and fooles praiſed their bounty for giuing them a cake of their owne meale. It is an eaſie matter to be liberall on other mens purſes. Neither yet conſidering the times then, were there any ſuch penny-worths. Your fore-Fathers groaned vnder the burthen of thoſe penny-worths ſurely, when they put vp a bill in a <hi>Parliament,</hi> in the dayes of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, the contents whereof was to take away Temporall Lands, inordinately ſpent by the Cleargie: Which Lands were ſufficient to maintaine fifteene Earles, fifteene hundred Knights, ſixe thouſand and two hundred Eſquires, one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Almes-houſes, fifteene hundred Prieſts, and to allow twenty thouſand pound yeerely to the King; allowing to euery Earle, three thouſand markes by yeere: to euery Knight
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:3539:97"/>
one hundred markes, and foure plow-land; to euery Eſquire forty marks and two plow-land; to euery Almes-houſe, for to maintaine ſuch ſurpluſage of poore, as Cities, and Townes were not able to maintaine, one hundred markes; and to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prieſt ſeuen markes. <hi>Fabian. chron. in Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>ann.</hi> 1410. Say not therefore, <hi>Why were the old times</hi> (in thoſe reſpects) <hi>better then theſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſecond anſwere is, that ſinne and death hath ouerſpread all places and times, all the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> are ſinfull, and the curſe lyeth on them, and the deuill is their Prince, who is the Lord of the fleſh: but God hath gathered a Church to himſelfe, which is peſtered with Hypocrites alſo, and the children of God themſelues, partly by meanes of theſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting hypocrites, partly through the temptations of the reliques of luſt within them, are drawne aſide out of the way oft times. The iuſt God therefore puniſheth the one, and chaſteneth the other. His meſſengers or inſtruments are, the Plague, comprehending all infirmities, diſeaſes, and maladies; the Sword ſignifying all miſeries and troubles that way; and Famine. Say not therefore, <hi>Why were the old times</hi> (in that reſpect alſo) <hi>better then theſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A third anſwere is giuen by <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelfe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 9. 10. <hi>The thing that hath beene, is that which ſhall be, and that which is done, is that which ſhall be done, and there is no new thing vnder the Sunne. Is there any thing whereof it may be ſaid, ſee this is new?</hi> The foole perceiueth nothing of all that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, why? Becauſe he diſcerneth not the ſubſtance of things when they are cloathed with other circumſtances. Therefore what is new, what old, hee knoweth not, neither can obſerue how the variable imaginations of all generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all their deeds, and manners are fixed in their centre, to the nature whereof all things are conuerted.</p>
               <p>A fourth anſwere therefore ſhall be this. Leaue off mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, complaining, and diſputing againſt God, mortifie wrath, reuenge, and couetouſneſſe, betake thy ſelfe to the word of God, with a wiſe and vnderſtanding heart in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, exer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the world be well with thee, the righteous ſhall reſort to thy company, they ſhall reioyce with thee, and commiſerate with thee, and the peace of conſcience ſhall ouercome all things. If the world be an hell of euils, yet ſhalt thou be in heauen; contrarily if the world were a paradiſe of pleaſures, yet ſhouldeſt thou be in hell. Some are full of feare and deſpaire, and moſt greedy in time of plenty; ſome are ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, hopefull, and content in time of ſcarcity. He that hath aboundance, and no children is a care full drudge, and hee that hath but little ſubſtance, and many children liueth in comfort. Therefore auoyde wrath, let goe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure let the world runne his circuits, heare thou for thy time what the Lord ſaith to thee, and doe his will while thou liueſt, and then ſhall it be as good a world to thee as euer it was.</p>
               <p>To conclude; If all theſe old worldlings would mortifie thoſe rebellious affections and luſts which reigne in them, and heare what he ſaith, who ſpeaketh to all generations, the world ſhould be as good as they can imagine it euer yet was. But when the Lord calleth to them, then are they euer ready to call vp their fore-fathers, to ſet them in oppoſition againſt the Lords, as the Phariſees did, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. 28. <hi>We are none of this mans diſciples, we are Moſes diſciples.</hi> The truth is, they were the deuils diſciples, and ſo are theſe Sauages. If theſe anſwers ſatisfie not, the rod of the Magiſtrate is for the fooles backe, and the yoke for the beaſts necke.</p>

               <p>A Confirmation of the former reaſon by the effects of Gods ſecret and wonderfull prouidence, ſeeming quite contrary to reaſon, and to be intollerable indignities, which he further confirmeth by the teſtimony of his owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall knowledge. <hi>All things haue I ſeene.</hi> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that can be conceiued, and knowne by the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and reaſon of man, but I haue had the obſeruation and experience thereof. For from the prudent obſeruation, and experience of the workes of God, haue I gathered rules of wiſedome, for the inſtruction and direction of others. He addeth, <hi>In the dayes of my vanity;</hi> to ſignifie the fulneſſe of his experience of good and euill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of wiſedome and folly. He hath ſeene both in himſelfe, and obſerued in others the workes of God. This briefly of the teſtimony. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ſubiect of the teſtimony, are two particular effects of Gods prouidence. The firſt is, <hi>There is a iuſt man that peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth in his iuſtice;</hi> namely, for truth and righteouſneſſe ſake. So <hi>Abel</hi> was ſlaine by his brother <hi>Cain,</hi> becauſe his deedes were righteous, and his owne wicked; 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 59. 15. <hi>Hee that departeth from euill, maketh himſelfe a prey. Naboth</hi> was ſlaine for keeping a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. The Prophets, our Sauiour Chriſt, the Apoſtles and Martyrs, ſuffered death for the truth. Many are murthered, ſpoyled, vexed, rayled on by the wicked for righteouſneſſe ſake, and euen the laſt end of the righteous oft times ſeemeth to be without honour, as the wicked in hell confeſſe they erroneouſly iudged in time of their iouill life; <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 5. And this is a thing contrary to carnall reaſon, and hard to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 16. 17. And therefore are many offended thereat, and take occaſion to depart from the way of truth. For they fully know not this point of wiſedome, namely,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:3539:101"/>
to relie on the prouidence of God, contrary to humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and that he is moſt honoured when we truſt him on his bare word.</p>
               <p>The ſecond effect is contrary to this. <hi>And there is a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man, that prolongeth his dayes in his wickedneſſe.</hi> Contrarily againe, ſome there be that neither feare God, nor reuerence man, without conſcience, without truth in words and deeds, ſwearers, blaſphemers, oppreſſours, deſpiſers of the good, mockers of grace, couetous, iniurious, and yet flouriſh in proſperity, haue the World at will, haue children at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, build houſes, plant vineyards, purchaſe Lordſhips, yea, they are honoured of men, and praiſed for their wiſedome; they liue in health, and die without ſickneſſe; <hi>Iob</hi> 21. 13. <hi>Lazarus</hi> periſhed in hunger, <hi>Diues</hi> liued in pleaſure. Chriſt was ſoone cut downe; but <hi>Herod</hi> liued long, euen till he was foure-ſcore yeeres old. If a man iudge according to outward appearance, theſe things argue that there is no prouidence at all. But it argueth infidelity, and pride enough, when a man will beleeue nothing without ſo many reaſons and proofes, nor doe any thing at Gods command, till he ſee his wages; <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 14 Righteous men die, and mercifull men are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away; <hi>Eſay</hi> 57. 1. that they might not ſee nor feele the euils to come on the World, as <hi>Lot</hi> was taken from among the Sodomites: And wicked men liue to their further ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance and ſorrow, as did <hi>Herod.</hi> The righteous are chaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with death, and the wicked liue to increaſe their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 32. They are taken away, leſt wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhould alter their vnderſtanding, and deceit beguile their minde; <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 4. 10.

The extremities are exceſſe, or defect. The exceſſe is an errour on the right hand, when a man by pride abuſeth his wiſedome, in ſtretching it beyond the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits &amp; bounds of humane capacity, either in defining there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by what is iuſt, what vniuſt, or what is truth, what errour. <hi>Be not righteous ouer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>much.</hi> A man cannot be too righteous in reſpect of obedience to the Commandements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet if he be ſo much addicted to one or ſome, as that hee deſpiſeth the reſt, he bewrayeth hypocriſie and folly, and may well be ſaid to be too iuſt. For a man is not to cull out what hee thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth good, thereby to iuſtifie himſelfe, and to condemne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, to haue reſpect to all the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, elſe ſhall hell limit his obedience, and ſerue God, or rather ſeeme to ſerue him according to his owne liking; but reſeruations and exceptions God abhorreth. But a man may make himſelfe too iuſt, when hee preſumptuouſly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpon him beyond his apprehenſion, to define what is right, what not, in this confuſed diſorder of the World, and ſtate of frailety, wherein all things are full of difficulty. For no man muſt preſume aboue his gift, or ſtretch himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the line either of all mens capacity, or his owne. This is but to intrude a mans ſelfe into the roome of God, and to make himſelfe a Law-giuer, rather then an vnderſtander and doer of that which is already giuen, and ſo in the end be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come rather zealous of his owne Lawes, and fancies, then of Gods; as the Phariſees were, and Papiſts are, and other here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes haue beene. <hi>Neither make thy ſelfe ouer-wiſe.</hi> As thou muſt not ſet vp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a iuſtice, or zeale of thine owne, ſo neither a wiſedome, or doctrine of thine owne. And this a man doth, when he will ſearch further into the wiſedome of God, then he hath reuealed in his Word. But ſith the moſt perfect hath
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:3539:102"/>
hardly attained to the fulneſſe of reuealed wiſedome, how ſhall a man pierce into that which is not reuealed?</p>
               <p>Surely, he that will needs behold the Sunne with open eyes in his glory, ſhal looſe his eye-ſight, and ſo ſhall he looſe his wits that will pry too deepely into the ſecrets of God. If a man will ſearch further then God hath reuealed to man, or beyond the meaſure of his gift, he cannot but fall into he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, and fooliſh fancies, which euen to common iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhall be ridiculous or wicked. Therefore ſaith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> why ſhouldſt thou be deſolate, or deſtroy thy ſelfe? Why ſhouldeſt thou prouoke God to anger, by proudly prying into him, and not rather honour him by humble obedience, admiring rather his wonderfull wiſedome in his workes, then ſeeking to comprehend his infiniteneſſe to pride thy ſelfe withall, or yet to limit him to thy reaſon, and ſeeking for ſatisfaction in things that cannot be had, rather then to do good workes, as many proud barren talkers do now a dayes. The foole ſeeketh wiſedome, and findeth it not. The <hi>Iewes</hi> will be righteous without Chriſt, they will haue a Church of their owne making, and a Chriſt of their owne forming: (So will the <hi>Browniſts</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Greekes</hi> will be wiſer then Chriſt, both <hi>lew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> will be wiſer and better then God. For whoſe doctrine was madneſſe, and life ſinfull, and end ſhamefull, if not Chriſts? whoſe lawes and traditions are preferred, inforced, and vrged more then Gods? But the one is wicked, the other fooliſh, both are both, and ſo are they deſolate. For God hath deſtroyed the Iuſtice of the one, or them for their Iuſtice and Goodneſſe, and the wiſedome of the other.

               <p>If the Scriptures be hard, then muſt thou pray more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, and labour more diligently. But the Goſpell is hid to them that periſh, not to others. Becauſe there is, and all

and ſubtlety, or meere madneſſe.</p>
               <p>The difficulty of the former hee declareth by his owne experience in this verſe. <hi>All theſe things haue I tryed by wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> that is to ſay, that which I haue ſaid concerning the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities and mediocrity for the eſtabliſhing of the heart in patience and comfort, I haue ſeene and tryed by the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of wiſedome. Neither yet is a man moderate and wiſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, becauſe he is able to bridle impatience, but he muſt diligently bethinke himſelfe as well of that which is to come, as of that which is paſſed or preſent, whereupon the happy iſſue or euent of things preſent doe depend.

For of innumerable things paſt, there is no knowledge at all, and of a few memorable things there is ſome generall conceit; but the condition, or conditure, or circumſtantiall exiſtence of the times, and things paſt, is vaniſhed, and that which was moſt common, is now become moſt difficult. And the learned is perplexed in ſearching out that which was once moſt triuiall. It is a difficult thing to calculate the whole figure or countenance of the heauens, in any one day of the moneth, ſixe hundred yeeres agoe, &amp;c. But it is more difficult to know the whole condition or ſtate of that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration then liuing, though we may gather much by thoſe that wrote in thoſe dayes. The Papiſts for want of this wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome are become ſophiſticall ſots in the interpretation of the Fathers, and Scripture. If this calculation were granted to vs, as it was to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and very much to <hi>Solomon,</hi> all the Scriptures and all Lawes ſhould be moſt plaine and moſt eaſie to be vnderſtood of him, whom the god of this World hath not blinded. <hi>And exceeding deepe, who can finde it?</hi> If things paſt be difficult, as the arrow or bird in the ayre vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing out of ſight more and more, inſomuch that a man can onely ſay; Yonder is a Bird, but what kinde, what colour, and many more indiuiduall differences, he cannot tell, but gueſſe by coniecture as well as hee can; then are things to come much more difficult, being buried as it were in a darke dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, or pit, into which the eye can diue but very little.

the former Chapter, ſhewing here alſo what the practiſe of wiſdome is in ciuill ſtate, to arme a man ſtill farther with this remedy againſt the miſeries and euils that in this regard alſo may befall him, that ſo he may obtaine ſome meaſurable ioy, contentation, and comfort in this life.</p>
               <p>This firſt verſe is an <hi>Eulogie,</hi> praiſe or commendation of wiſedome, and that by the excellence of wiſedome, and the effects thereof, The excellence is ſet forth by a compariſon of <hi>equals</hi> denyed, figured by a <hi>communication,</hi> and that againe by an <hi>exclamation,</hi> or <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> more ſignificantly or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically to expreſſe the worthineſſe of wiſedome <hi>Who is as the wiſe?</hi> What man of any eſtate, degree or quality may be compared to a man of wiſedome?

               <p>THe principall propoſition of a mans duty towards the higher powers, wherein the practiſe of wiſedome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth. The words are an admonition or counſell. <hi>I counſell thee to obſerue the kings mouth,</hi> or <hi>word,</hi> or <hi>to keepe his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,</hi> according to the intent thereof, as it commeth from his mouth, and is maintained by his power, and that not ſo much for feare of his power, and puniſhment, as for the oath ſake, in faithfulneſſe and conſcience, whereby thou art bound to God, and to him vnder God. In old times ſome of the kings of <hi>Iuda</hi> cauſed the people to ſweare that they would ſerue the Lord, and cleaue to him, and renounce ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. This loyall obedience is ſubordinate to our obedience to God, and is our obedience to God, foraſmuch as rulers and gouernours are ordained of God, to which therefore we muſt ſubmit our ſelues vnder him, and to him in them, and to their lawes being agreeable to his lawes, and groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on his lawes. For the lawes of God are generall for all nations, and generations of the world, and reſpect the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie of mans nature thereunto, and therefore continue the ſame for euer; but the lawes of Princes are alterable, and changeable, at their diſcretion, according to the condition of times and people, but yet by the direction of the lawes of God. This is godly wiſedome, godly policie. For the maine intendment, ſpirit, and life of mans law, is the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and keeping of Gods law, that thoſe that haue not an inward conſcience and feare, yea, loue wrought within them by the preaching of the word, or light of naturall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples before the word commeth, that thoſe may haue an outward conſcience, to which they ſhall be inforced by the power of the magiſtrate, to make brutiſh men ciuill, and ciuil men religious, if God giue grace, and religious men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue religious.</p>
               <p>And therefore as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> termeth the Goſpell of Chriſt,

his Goſpel, which according to his wiſedome and diſcretion, hee propounded, vſed, and applyed to the beſt, for the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and further building vp of the Church; ſo is Gods Law the Kings Law, and his word the Kings word, as he taketh it into his cuſtody to impoſe it, and to inforce the obedience thereof vnder God vpon all men, and to puniſh vnder God the breakers thereof. <hi>Eſt enim medicus reipub.</hi> Therefore muſt wee chearefully, readily, willingly, faithfully obey the ſame, as if wee had receiued it immediately from the mouth of God.</p>

Therefore doe not vnaduiſedly, or in diſcontent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of his preſence, nor in ſuch ſenſe or appearance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine from his preſence, leſt the diſpoſition of thy heart be ſuſpected to be rather from him, then towards him. For that is the ſeede, or beginning of a diſeaſe, which doubtleſſe ſhall be purged, or with diſgrace curbed, or at leſt he ſhall alwayes haue a iealous eye ouer thee, and how doubtfull things may be interpreted in that caſe, conſider. For great euils may come vpon thee cauſeleſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but yet vnknowne; for he that is in an ill name, is halfe hanged. Howſoeuer, thou haſt giuen
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:3539:113"/>
aduantage to thine enemies, and laid a way open for them to come betweene him and thee.</p>
               <p>To conclude, boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, neither arrogate any thing to thy ſelfe, be not too wiſe before him, as though thou wert an inſtructer or teacher, or haddeſt a reach beyond him; but let thy wiſedome and counſell be ſo couertly ingeſted, as that rather it may appeare to him to be his owne, thy words being as it were an occaſion to bring it to his minde, ſo ſhall he conceiue and vtter, and doe that which thou wouldeſt haue him, without any impeachment of his honour at all, ſeeing that that which was thine, is made his owne, and ſo is his owne counſell and will, not thine. Put not thy ſelfe forth before the King; <hi>Prou.</hi> 25. 6. Leſt thou car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the ſhew of a corriuall, or part ſtake, but be modeſt, and humble. And herein <hi>Ioab</hi> did wiſely, when he ſent to <hi>Dauid</hi> to come and take <hi>Rabbah</hi> himſelfe, leſt the victory ſhould be imputed to him, but <hi>Saul</hi> vndeſeruedly enuyed <hi>Dauid,</hi> for the ſongs that the women ſang of his victory of <hi>Goliah. Stand not in an euill thing.</hi> Stand not in a thing proudly, though thou beeſt in the right, as it ſeemeth to thee, neither ſtand in an euill without pride. For pride marreth a good ſubſtance, and euill marreth a good circumſtance. If thou ſtand in an euill thing of errour, it ſhall bring preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and if it be of pride, it ſhall bring preſent deſtruction. In this caſe therefore aske counſell of wiſedome, and ſhee ſhall giue thee true direction to come out of both, to auoid both. It is diſcredit enough to erre before a great man, to ſtand in an errour is diſgrace, for it betokeneth folly, but to ſtand in it in pride, is ſtubbornneſſe and madneſſe. <hi>For hee doth whatſoeuer pleaſeth him.</hi> A reaſon to inforce the former admonitions. It is in vaine, and a point of greateſt folly to contend with him that hath power in his owne hands, yea, who onely hath power, which cannot be oppoſed without iuſt puniſhment. For contention controuleth and rebuketh, and then is power no power, and the heart that prepareth it ſelfe to reſiſtance, intrudeth it ſelfe into his roome, who hath ſole command vnder God: an euill matter indeed may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:3539:113"/>
but neither the perſon, nor place. Well, concerning the cauſe, there is great wiſedome to be vſed, be not thou for thy part too iuſt, nor too wiſe, as was ſaid before, leſt thy cauſe be conſtrued to be but a pretence, and the beginning of a diſeaſe in the Common-wealth. For the King is the Common-wealths Phyſitian. By <hi>King,</hi> we may vnderſtand euery man in authority, by <hi>going out of his ſight,</hi> to depart from duty and obedience.

Therefore may too quicke obedience diſpleaſe afterwards, as well as preſent ſlackneſſe. Againe, a Prince is not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but all his ſubiects incluſiuely, euen the whole body or ſtate of the Kingdome: So that in a King there is not onely an vnion of body and ſpirit, as in all men, but alſo of his perſon, and the politike body or ſtate.

               <p>AN explication of the anſwereſhewing a reaſon, why that a wiſe man obſeruing time and iudgement, ſhall feele none euill, at leaſt ſo farre forth as by mans wiſedome can be auoyded. <hi>Becauſe to euery purpoſe,</hi> &amp;c. All things are in the hands of God, and the hearts of Kings alſo, and his purpoſe in the leaſt thing is vnchangeable. So that for euery thing there is a time prefined of God, together with a moſt wiſe, and right meanes and manner, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon euery euent neceſſarily dependeth. Now he that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth this worke of God, ſhall auoide all euils. A thing in his kinde good, may by euill vſage be made naught; and a good deede muſt be ordered by time and iudgement. If time be preuented, it ſhall be fruſtrate, yet afterwards, though otherwiſe effected. For God doth all in time and ſeaſon, and will haue them cloathed with his owne circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances alſo; but the vaine imaginations of man are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, and hee is giuen to take too much vpon him, as though all things were in his hand. But God will make him know that hee is but vaine man. <hi>Therefore is the miſery of man great vpon him.</hi> A conſequence or collection of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold and great miſeries of man, applyed to the diſobedient, and ouer-wiſe: Becauſe there is a due time, and right meanes, and manner in the prouidence of God, for euery thing to his owne glory, which is the ground and guide of good wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; therefore is there ſo much vanity in all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, wordes, and workes, and the endleſſe troubles and miſeries of preſumptuous man are occaſioned from hence.</p>

               <p>A Reaſon why that the vanitie and miſerie of man ſhould be increaſed by the moſt wiſe and good prouidence of God. <hi>For he knoweth not what ſhall be.</hi> The good wiſedome of God is not the cauſe of vanities in politicke ſtate, but an occaſion, and mans ignorance and malice is the cauſe. For being depriued of wiſedome and iuſtice through his owne malice, his imaginations are all fooliſh and vaine, and his follie is vpon him. The deliberation of the wiſe ſtandeth in comparing things paſt and to come, but the one is farre off, and the other is deepe, as was ſaid in the former chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But fooliſh men, impatient, and ouer-wiſe, are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant of that which ſhall be, neither doe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard whether it ſhall be, or no, in the prouidence of God, but they haue a prouidence of their owne, a falſe, coyned, or apiſh world, to which by their ſubtilty and violence they thinke to cauſe all things to incline, and to make Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence and wiſedome to ſtoupe downe to theirs, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themſelues that that ſhall be which they haue purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and cloſely plotted, and deuiſed the meanes, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how it ſhall be effected. Here is vanity and miſery enough. If a man ſtand in oppoſition for a good thing, he cannot tell whether that good thing ſhall be or no. For there are many things good in our vnderſtanding, which are not ſo in the wiſe prouidence of God. But as it is good, ſo muſt it be well, and it cannot be well, but in Gods appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time, with all circumſtances fitting. <hi>Who can tell when it ſhall be?</hi> Although this good to be effected, or euill to be reformed, is to be taken in hand becauſe it ſhall be done in the common iudgement and deſire of men, yet who can tell a man when it ſhall be done, and how it ſhall be done? If a King himſelfe would doe a thing, he muſt depend on Gods prouidence, and tarry till the appointed ſeaſon. For
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:3539:115"/>
God is the chiefe Pilate of the ſhip, and the Watch-man of the city. And if a thing ſhall be done by him, yet the time and manner is vncertaine. Hee muſt not ſtriue againſt God, neither muſt thou being a particular branch, of particular capacitie, ſtriue againſt the root that beareth thee and all the branches, whoſe generall good, firſt, and conſequently particulars in their kindes, it reſpecteth, as thou doeſt thine owne. Well, ſeeing that a man either knoweth not what ſhall be, or elſe knoweth not how and when it ſhall be, his contention intangleth himſelfe in great errours, troubles, and dangers, and his diſobedience, and contention ſhall be puniſhed, he ſhall not eſcape: He muſt depend vpon the prouidence of God, and opportunitie offered of God, and not ſtand in an euill thing, nor euilly in a good thing before the higher power.</p>

                  <hi>There is no diſcharge in that warre.</hi> There is no caſting of weapons then to ouer-power the kings power, which is to alter and change the ſtate of a kingdome, a great worke of Gods prouidence. For when the king in iuſtice exacteth his life, the whole burthen of the kingdome preſſeth him to

death. But if there be iniuſtice, or rigorous extremitie in the matter, who ſhall ſtand vp in defence for him againſt the king? Who ſhall take vp armes with him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither ſhall wickedneſſe deliuer thoſe that are giuen to it.</hi> It is the cuſtome of the wicked to ſeek to auoid imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers by euill meanes, as <hi>Caiaphas</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> did, but he that feareth the froſt, the ſnow ſhall fall vpon him: Many thinke to auoid pouerty with theft, vſurie, couetouſneſſe, but all in vaine. Neither ſhall violent nor craftie courſes preuaile or helpe a man. It is impoſſible to breake off the whole poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke body in him. If the king will be auenged of him that hath offended, who ſhall ſtand on his part to deliuer him? For who ſhall expoſtulate or examine the cauſe? Who ſhall bring the King into iudgement? If the caſe be all mens, and euery mans, there is indeede an equiualence in the matter, for the whole body matcheth the head, and the head is not for it ſelfe but for the body. Surely it is an hard caſe, that the head ſhould make all the body ſicke. For the diſvnion of the head and the body is lamentable. When the body of <hi>Iſrael</hi> tooke a new head to it, namely a king, God was diſpleaſed. God appointed them Iudges, but they had rather imitate the nations, then ſtand to Gods ordinance. Againe, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when it tooke another head to it, <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Nebat,</hi> what was it the better? That was not the ſalue for their ſore. It is one thing to change a ſtate, or an head, and another thing to purge out a corruption, or in time to weare it out. Wickedneſſe can neuer deliuer thoſe that are giuen to it. Surely if one man, then all men in one body muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide the triall, and the rod of correction. For if they will needs auoid the ſcourge of God one way, they ſhall bring a ſcourge vpon themſelues more grieuous to be borne ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. Not the Senate of Rome, but the whole world executed <hi>Nero:</hi> For he was an enemie of mankinde, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facer of the image of God, a reſolute diſſolute tyrant. Hee was no gouernour, but a deſtroyer, and put himſelfe out of office, and left the body of his dominions deſtitute,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:3539:116"/>
and for his part expoſed it to diſſolution. So did not <hi>Saul,</hi> nor <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> nor <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> nor <hi>Amon,</hi> &amp;c. Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is not to be reformed by wickedneſſe in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, but euill is to be ouercome with goodnes ſaith the Apoſtle. This of the duties or practiſe of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in ciuill ſtate, whereby to auoid, at leaſt to mitigate the vanities, troubles, and vexations of this miſerable life. Whereupon wee may gather by neceſſarie conſequence what vanities or miſeries a man is ſubiect to in a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke ſtate. And for a man to liue out of ſuch an eſtate is miſery it ſelfe: For men ſhould be, as in old times diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed people haue beene, more vile then beaſts, and better is the worſt common-wealth then none, and the worſt peace then the beſt warre. All which things argue the neceſſitie of vanity: And the practiſe of wiſedome, is to mitigate the ſame, by reducing mankinde to the beſt of miſerable eſtates, according to the prouidence and ordinance of God, and to abide an inconuenience to auoid a miſchiefe.

Of which good euery ſtate and condition of life is partaker (elſe could it not be the chiefe good) becauſe all worldly things are but ſubſeruant to this good, God hauing turned the curſe into a bleſſing to them that beleeue, and is therefore ſubſeruant to this good alſo.

Our owne things pleaſe vs beſt, but other mens we ſee a farre off, and are coldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. So we deale with God. But the kingdome of God ſtandeth not in meates, drinkes, wedlocks, &amp;c. which are worldly and tranſitorie things, but in a new creature. For no ordinance of God is to be diſanulled. But if we be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, all things ſhall become holy to vs. For to the pure, all things are pure and holy: otherwiſe, the beſt things are vncleane to vs, and defiled by vs. We are not vnder the bondage of any thing, but all things are ſubſeruant to vs, and lawfull, except in caſe of offence. <hi>Go thy way.</hi> The firſt particular is of the comfortable vſe of meates and drinkes. Giue ouer thy carefull and vnprofitable ſtudies, and idle ſpeculations, leaue ſecret things to the Lord; be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with that which he giueth by lawfull meanes in a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full calling; deſire not other mens labours, pled not in diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, hard and vneuen by-paths with griefe and greedie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, but <hi>eate thy bread with ioy,</hi> liue comfortably of that

Obſerue here, that firſt we muſt pleaſe God by faith in him, which is his owne gift and worke. Secondly, when he is thus pleaſed, then doe our perſons pleaſe him, we are his, and accepted of him in his Sonne, in whom we beleeue.

                  <hi>Liue ioyfully,</hi> &amp;c.

To this end the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 13. exhorts Chriſtians <hi>to liue honeſtly as in the day, not in glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony and drunkenneſſe, nor yet in chambering and wantonneſſe,</hi> for marriage is honourable, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. 4. and the lawfull vſe of Matrimony in theſe words, <hi>and the bed vndefiled.</hi> Which words are oppoſed to whooredome, and adulterie, whether it be with another, or a mans owne wife, the affections &amp; imagination being fixed on anothers. To bee briefe, his meaning is, that the continuance of coniugall amity, or firſt vnion of affections, which is the inward bond of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, is a great meanes to auoyde much vanity, which ariſeth of the violating of this vnion.

               <p>
                  <hi>For that is thy portion.</hi> An argument of confirmation. As he ſaid before, that the comfortable vſe of worldly goods gotten with great labour, was the gift of God, or remedie to cheere the bodie in the vanitie thereof, Chap. 3. 13 and 5. 18. ſo here he ſaith, that the ioyfull, cheerfull, and comfortable vſe of wedlocke in the feare of God, is a mans portion, euen the chiefeſt and beſt good of outward goods, which who ſo wants, he can haue no ioy in any thing. For if in ripeneſſe of age he want this coniugall comfort, he is but halfe himſelfe, ſolitarie and mournefull.

               <p>
                  <hi>In this life.</hi> Many men imagine to themſelues a more complete and full portion then this, whereof they make this to be but a part, but yet it is the principall part, and remaineth to man when other faile. For whether a man be
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:3539:128"/>
in proſperitie or aduerſitie, in ſickneſſe or health, this is a liuing comfort, euen a ſpeciall remedie, and vniuerſall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie appliable to him in euery ſtate.

For this is certaine that there is no certainetie in any thing, that man might feare God, and onely depend on him, and know that whatſoeuer he is, or hath, it is Gods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in Gods diſpoſing to his owne glorie, who will do with his veſſells what pleaſeth him, he formeth thee, and vſeth thee in his wiſedome according to his owne will; but the vaine ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of man are infinite. <hi>I returned and ſaw vnder the Sunne.</hi> A confirmation of that which followeth by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of his owne obſeruation. <hi>That the race is not to the ſwift,</hi> &amp;c. This haue I conſidered, that the vſe of thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of body and minde, which God hath beſtowed on man, eyther in his birth, or by his induſtry, is not in mans power. For the race is not to the ſwift, nor battell to the ſtrong Againe, if a man being indued with theſe faculties, doth alſo vſe them, and vſe them well; yet the profite and fruit thereof is not in the power of him that vſeth them rightly. For doe we not ſee that bread is ſometimes wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the wiſe, money, meate, drinke, and apparrell to the learned, wealth to the prudent and men of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding fauour and grace to men of learning and skill? Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both the facultie and gift it ſelfe, the exerciſe of the gift and the benefit of the exerciſe is to be referred to God, who is the author and diſpoſer of all gifts and euents. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this ſeemeth to be a great vanitie and grieuous to carnall reaſon, that the ſwift ſhould looſe the benefit of the race, and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:3539:130"/>
another that ſitteth ſtill receiue it; that the ſtrong man. ſhould looſe the reward of the battel, and the wiſe man who procureth much good vnto others, ſhould want neceſſary foode and payment; that the prudent and man of counſell, by whom publique and priuate ſtates are ſettled, vpheld, and maintained, ſhould want riches, and that men of skill, ſhould want good will and fauour. Againe, the ſwifteſt man ſometimes in running, looſeth the race, the ſtrong ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie looſeth the battell. So <hi>Abraham</hi> with his three hundred ſeruants put foure Kings to flight, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 14. <hi>Gedeon</hi> with the found of Trumpets murdered the hoſte of the Madia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, <hi>Iudges</hi> 7. <hi>Dauid</hi> ſlew the Grant <hi>Goliah,</hi> 1. <hi>King.</hi> 17. <hi>Leonidas</hi> with ſixe hundred men maſſacred fiue hundred thouſand of <hi>Xerxes</hi> hoſte. <hi>Tomyris</hi> Queene of <hi>Scythia,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouted vp the whole hoſte of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> whoſe force <hi>Babylon</hi> could not reſiſt.

For the one taketh away the Miniſters food to giue it to dogs, and feed horſes, and for voluptuous liuing; and the other plucks off his coate, to further the beautifying of a carrion-Idoll.

The one will get a kingdome by wicked wiſedome, and the other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue their kingdome by wicked wiſedome. But good is neither gotten nor preſerued by euill. For God wil be God, and glorified only, and man ſhall be a beaſt. The miſchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous imaginations of the wicked ſhall not proſper. Such is the wiſedome of Antichriſt, and to conclude, of the Diuell and all his children. All euill proceedeth of them, and in the end falleth vpon them, as the dew that riſeth out of the ground, and falleth downe vpon the ground. Therefore, how profitable and wiſe ſoeuer the counſel of a wicked man ſeemeth to be, yet giue no eare vnto him, though our ſelues (being euill) are euer inclinable to the worſe part. For his counſells and doings (in the end) will marre all. He will but ſhew foorth witty folly, and bring deſolation, ſhame, and perpetuall ignominy.

                  </gap> be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by contrary vanitie, ſeeing that there is a wiſedome of God in theſe vanities not vaine and vnreſiſtable. The ſcope hereof is to teach modeſt and ſubmiſſe behauiour in wiſedome towards Princes: for they are either the faithfull ſhepheards of God, or elſe the rods of his correction. <hi>If the ſpirit of the ruler,</hi> &amp;c. If the Ruler hath taken a diſpleaſure againſt thee, if his anger be kindled againſt thee, that hath authority and power ouer thee, leaue not thy place, oppoſe not diſpleaſure to diſpleaſure, though he be wrongfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, go not out of his ſight in anger, nor moue thy ſelfe from place to place, nor vſe any geſture or countenance

               <p>The precept is confirmed by three reaſons. The firſt is contained in theſe words drawne from the effect of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. The ſecond from verſe 5. to verſe 12. The third, from verſe 12. to verſe 16.

And this ſhall, in the end, giue great content, and bring thee into greater fauour then was the diſpleaſure. Whereas contrarily on the one ſide thou ſhouldeſt prouoke him to deuiſe euill againſt thee, whileſt that he contendeth for his honour, or to quiet his minde by reuenge; and on the other ſide, inwrappe thy ſelfe in endleſſe troubles by ſiniſter courſes.

               <p>A Particular explication of the euill or diſorder before generally propounded, and illuſtrated in theſe two verſes; <hi>Follie is ſet in dignitie or height, and the rich in lowe place.</hi> Follie, a <hi>Metonymie</hi> of the <hi>Adiunct,</hi> for foole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By <hi>foole,</hi> is not meant him that is deſtitute of reaſon or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, but him eſpecially that hauing both, vſeth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or abuſeth both. As the fruit of crackt or craſie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is follie, ſo of corrupt or wicked reaſon alſo.

This is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of <hi>Salomon,</hi> that vnreaſonable, and reaſonleſſe men ſhould ſit on the Throne, and the Bench.

               <p>A Third reaſon of the precept, <hi>verſ</hi> 4. The words of him that ſpeaketh in wiſedome are acceptable, and procure him fauour and grace, as they proceed from a gracious heart. For he knoweth what is beſt pleaſing to God for him to ſpeake, and what is moſt acceptable for good men to heare, and what deſerueth to be accepted for faithfulnes and truth. For by his wiſe handling of the matter, the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thereof is found out, and fauoured by reaſon of his forcible and good arguments vſed in his defence. Alſo his milde and ſubmiſſe behauiour and patient ſpeech, worketh
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:3539:142"/>
vpon the Prince to pacifie his diſpleaſure, and mitigate his fierceneſſe; yea and he ſtirreth vp friends by his wiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to ſtand in his defence, and to intercede for him, whereupon his cauſe beginneth not to be his owne, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens alſo, and ſo is the Ruler ſoone perſwaded. By <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Ruler</hi> is meant euery ſuperiour. <hi>But the lips of a foole will ſwallow him vp.</hi> An illuſtration of the reaſon by an <hi>antitheſis</hi> or oppoſition of the contrary. As the mouth or gracious and acceptable ſpeeches of the wiſe deliuereth him, and reconcileth the Ruler, and procureth him fauour: ſo contrarily the mouth of the foole deuoureth him, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth him. For the foole neither knoweth nor regardeth thoſe things, but vomiteth out peruerſe ſpeeches, ſuch as tend to rebellion, and ſhew forth a rebellious diſpoſition, an heart implacable and reuengefull, whenſoeuer opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie ſhall offer it ſelfe to do euill, contrary to the practiſe of <hi>Dauid.</hi> So <hi>Ioabs</hi> ruſtiei ſpeeches were but harſh, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 5. if his good counſell had not qualified the rigour thereof, and at this time ſtrength was in his hands.

For he knew not the intent of the Kings heart, yet he vttered his ſuſpition in moſt wiſe ſort, with a ſecret implicite reproofe, verſ. 3. For it was not his duty to demand reaſons of his maiſter, becauſe he was but a ſeruant: and a ſeruant is but the hand, not the heart, the foote, not the head of his maiſter. That which a man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be contrary to Gods commandement, he may refuſe to do, yet wiſely, though he ſuffer perſecution for it. For then is God perſecuted, and not he, the cauſe is Gods. For euery maiſter is but a commander vnder God, as he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God, <hi>Nemo ſui iuris eſt praeter Deum.</hi> And euen things indifferent muſt not be enormous, but haue relation to things neceſſary, whence they are to be deducted by good conſequence.

So there are good words in the diuels mouth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 6. but they are wickedly applied and vſed. The words are an argument of comfort to the children of God, drawne from their ſafe protection by the Angels of God: but Sathan diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torteth the true intent thereof, to perſwade Chriſt to refuſe the ordinary meanes of Gods appointment to tempt God. <hi>If the Angels haue charge ouer thee, caſt thy ſelfe downe head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.</hi> When we doe without warrant or command, we put our ſelues out of the Angels charge, for they are faithfull attendants on God, wholly depending on his will, not on our diſobedience and rebellion. To proceed, the foole hath not wit, but will, he will not be perſwaded nor diſſwaded by ſound reaſon; but what he willeth, he hopeth, and what he hopeth, ſhall not be to him impoſſible, for he maketh all things chance and lucke. And ſo deriding wiſedome, he dependeth on fortune. Whereas fortune is nothing but our ignorance and improuidence. The more wiſedome and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, the leſſe fortune; but fooles terme thoſe things the fortunes of the wiſe, which they by wiſedome foreſaw, and by counſell and right meanes brought to paſſe.

               <p>The foole is ſo hopefull and chancefull, that he careth not much what he ſaith, how hee ſpeaketh, to whom hee ſpeaketh, when he ſpeaketh, or doth any thing. How ſpake ſuch a one? How did ſuch a one? Why might not I ſay this, or doe that? (ſo <hi>Eſopes</hi> Aſſe immitated the Dogge, fawning and leaping on his maiſter) what can come on it? It is as it is taken, as it falleth out, who can tell vntill hee trie? What knew I whether this or that would haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed? who can tell any thing? muſt not all be as God will? The foole indeede ſtands all vpon trialls according to his luſt, but what the reuealed will and commandement of God is, he regardeth not, he is an enemy to that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. But the wiſe knoweth that there is a conuenient ſeaſon, and due time for all things in the appoynted time of God, that euery ſeaſon, and euery conditure or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of time produceth his owne words, and deedes, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or ſurceaſing.

Sixtly, when being addicted to licentiouſnes he cruſheth the Church, the godly and ancient, through the falſe ſuggeſtions of prophane Princes, as <hi>Ioaſh</hi> did, but openeth the mouthes, and ſtrengtheneth the armes of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked flatterers, yea ſuppreſſeth the one, and countenanceth the other, as children loue to be pleaſed, and are kinde to deceitfull flatterers, but they hang downe their heads, and runne away from their true hearted friends and beſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers. Briefly, when he ſeeketh not Gods glory in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his word, but his owne glory, as <hi>Saul</hi> did. Therfore <hi>Samuel</hi> told him that he was become a foole.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of the woe, is the riotouſneſſe of the Nobles and officers, which giue themſelues to pompe and prodigalitie, not regarding the welfare of the people, but their owne bellies, which is meant by <hi>eating in the morning.</hi> They meditate not, ſtudy not, conſult not in the morning, when wit and memory is freſh, for the welfare of the Church and commonaltie, but for couetouſneſſe, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, pride and pleaſures, as it is ſaid of the idle ſhepheards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

They ſhould binde Kings with chaines, and Nobles with fetters of iron, much more the commons, ſuch honour haue all his Saints, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149. 8. 9. And why ſhould not Kings be Saints? It is
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:3539:146"/>
no diſparagement to their royaltie, though wicked <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah</hi> bade <hi>Amos</hi> propheſie no more at <hi>Bethel,</hi> becauſe it was the Kings Chappell, and the Kings Court, <hi>Amos</hi> 7. 13. yet not many wiſe, not many noble, not many learned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh hath God called, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. And it is hard for the rich to enter into the kingdome of heauen, yet are all things poſſible with God that ſanctifieth. When Princes are not godly and gracious themſelues, their owne conſciences breed iealouſies and euill ſuſpitions in them, euen when there is no cauſe at all. For the wicked man flyeth, when none purſueth, when none oppoſeth, as <hi>Saul</hi> purſued <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> and grew at length into ſuch extremities as to ſlay the Lords prieſts, and to account them his enemies and worſt ſubiects that feared God moſt, and moſt lamented his caſe, whereas his cauilling clawbacks brought him to a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble end.</p>

               <p>AN expoſition or explication of the woe or miſerie, eſpecially of the former part thereof, verſ. 16. illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and inforced by a compariſon drawne from the euill, and diſorderly oeconomie or gouernement of a priuate houſe or family, which ſheweth forth it ſelfe in the euill v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the outward building. Theſe euils are ſlouthfulneſſe, and careleſneſſe, or idleneſſe. The former is a vice of the minde, the latter of the body. A careleſſe minde, an idle hand. Where thoſe vices reigne, the houſe not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth, but rotteth, and droppeth vpon the head of the improuident, ſlouthfull, vnthriſtie houſholder. A man in reſpect of his perſon is knowne by his apparell, counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and gate what manner of one he is, as touching his
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:3539:147"/>
ethicks or morality, ſaith the ſonne of <hi>Sirach.</hi> Againe, he is knowne by his houſe, yard, grounds, cattell, ſeruants, and children, what manner of man he is, as touching his economie or husbandry, <hi>Prou.</hi> 24. 30. 31. The houſe of the ſlouthfull man is ruinous, and droppeth through, his yard is like a vaſte deſert, the fences and walls broken downe, as a vineyard layd waſte, his fields are ouergrowne with thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and briers, his family is diſordered and idle, one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending and quarelling with another, girning one at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all maiſters and vnruly. Thus it is in the houſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digals, drinking ſlipthrifts, and Belials, do naughts. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in reſpect of his politicks or magiſtracie he is knowne by his ſubiects. For as the houſholder is in his houſe or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, ſo is the magiſtrate in the citie, and the king in his dominions. An houſe is a part of a ſtreete, a ſtreete is a part of a citie, the citie is a part of the kindome. The king is the head, the kingdome is his body, conſiſting of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, whereof ſome are ſuperiour, as thoſe that are placed in gouernment vnder him, and are ſubordinate one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, others are inferiour,</p>
               <p>Whereas the Prince feareth not God, but is either coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous or waſtfull, careleſſe and diſſolute, then the Church and common wealth go to wracke. The gouernours are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uening Harpies, and riotous, deuouring the commons, and feeding themſelues of the flocke, yea euery one after their examples preying one on another. The vngodly, flatterers, luſt-ſeruers are aduanced, and placed in offices for money or fauour, for there is no care nor feare of God in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, but euery one that feareth God is diſhearted, and he that ſpeaketh vprightly is hated in the gate, and he that rebuketh is abhorred, <hi>Amos</hi> 5. And amongſt thoſe wicked ones, there is nothing but enuie and contentions, euery one being giuen to oppreſſion, pride and ambition, and all enemies to God and godlineſſe. Whereupon it commeth in the end to be a vaſt deſert of wilde beaſts, and as a vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard lying waſte, ſpoyled with foxes and wilde boares, like a field ouerrunne and cropt vp with cattell, and paſtures rooted vp with ſwine, and ouergrowne with thiſtles

and briers. Such deſolations doth the Lord threat vpon carnalitie and contempt of his word. All theſe things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what the Prince is, and by what manner of ſpirit the commonwealth is inliued and moued. For as the ſpirit of a thing is, ſuch is the thing. If the ſpirit be weake, the body is ouergrowne, and ouercome with diſeaſes, as we ſee in plants, in beaſts, in men. Now the ſpirit of houſhold go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment is <hi>pater familias,</hi> the good man of the houſe. The ſpirit of polity, or commonwealths gouernment, is the king.

               <p>AN explication of the complaint or woe, eſpecially of the latter part thereof, verſ. 16. which was this, <hi>Thy Princes eate in the morning,</hi> that is, ſpend their whole time, euen the morning it ſelfe, wherein nature it ſelfe bindeth vs to ſobrietie and ſolitary ſtudy, in eating, drinking, pleaſures, like to the Sodomites, and beaſtiall Princes of Iſrael. It is il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated by the contrary, and right vſe of eating, drinking, and other expence. <hi>A feaſt is made for laughter.</hi> The vſe of meate, is the reparation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conſeruation of the body in health and ſtrength, that a man may be enambled to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the duties of his calling, wherein God hath placed him. He muſt keepe his body in temperance, ſobriety and chaſtity, that the minde may be more cleare and free, of greater ſtrength and vigour in the functions thereof, both for deliberation and execution. As for a feaſt, that is made for laughter, for a recreation of the minde and body at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine conuenient times, and to preſerue common ſocietie and neighbourhood, or rather to teſtifie friendſhip and loue one towards another, though particular buſineſſes and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities haue diſtracted them, and drawne euery man <hi>ad</hi>

But to be addicted to feaſting, to make a trade of pampering the body, as epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhneſſe, and beaſtlineſſe. For beaſts regard nothing but the belly; they are all body, and to feede well, is their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And wine maketh merrie.</hi> Wine alſo hath the ſame vſe that is of meates. He that giueth himſelfe to drinking and companiſhip, is a drunkard, although he neuer be drunke. Therefore the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> denounceth a woe againſt them, that are able to drinke ſtrong drinke; Woe be to them, for they ſpend not onely the time of life idlely, and waſtefully, but alſo make others drunke, and glorie in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. But wine is not for Kings, nor ſtrong drinke for Princes, <hi>Prou.</hi> 31. 4. but for the ſicke to recouer health, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid vnto <hi>Timothie,</hi> Drinke a little wine for thy ſtomackes ſake and often infirmities; and wine is for the ſorrowfull to reuiue the ſpirits, and diſperſe the blood of the oppreſſed heart to forget his pouertie and miſerie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And money anſwereth to all things.</hi> This vetſe may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted thus. Their feaſt is made for laughter and prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galitie, not for recreation, &amp;c. and their wine maketh them merry to caſt off all care, that they may more freely liue in pleaſure, <hi>Eſay</hi> 56. 12. and their money or abundance an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth to all theſe things, that is, to none other vſe, but to maintaine epicuriſh liuing, as is all ready ſayd. Or elſe they may haue dependence vpon the former verſe; <hi>The Building of them decayeth, and their houſes droppe through, who prepare feaſts for laughter, and wine for rioting, and Luxuriouſnes, and their money ſerueth to all theſe things, to none other vſe, but to prouide for feaſtings, drinking, and epicuriſh meetings.</hi> This interpretation may well ſtand. But to proceede in the former. <hi>Money anſwereth to all things.</hi> Hauing ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the right vſe of eating, and drinking, hee now ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the right vſe of money. Money ſerueth not for prouiding, and mayntaining of feaſts, delicious fare,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:3539:149"/>
pompe, and pride, but for all things. For money is not as other mettalls, limited to certaine workes, veſſells, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, but it hath in it, by humane conſtitution, the nature of all things, and is all things. So that hee which hath money wanteth nothing that the world can affoord. Therefore it is ſo loued and deſired of worldlings, yea euen of all men. If it were of a particular nature and vſe, it then ſhould be leſſe deſired, and of ſome not at all. It is made for change, and ready ſupply of euery mans neede, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one might be helped by other. Money therefore is all things, and for all things; not for feaſts and drinkings, but to be layd out to other vſes both diuine and humane; not to be hoorded vp from vſe, which is theft, becauſe no man is for himſelfe, but for others alſo, and others for him, which is the eſſence of Charitie. Hee that giueth money, giueth, meate, drinke, cloathing, and lodging. Hee that hoordeth it vp burieth all theſe neceſſary things in the ground, from God and the poore to his power: ſeeing that without money they can not be had; yet both money and all things vnder the Sunne, and the Sunne it ſelfe, ſerue for nothing but backe and belly. Mans body is the centre of all materiall things. And if the body be the temple of the holy Ghoſt, there is neyther money, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing elſe, for the body, but all for God. If all men were for God, there ſhould be no ſuch hungring for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. It ſhould be the vileſt mettall of all other. For yron is better then ſiluer. If man were perfect in innocencie and holineſſe, he ſhould neede no money at all; it would be more trouble to him to carry money, then it is now to want money. The ſelfe-loue, hatred, and miſery of man appeareth in this, that hee which hath no money wanteth euery thing; and he which hath abuudance of mony wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth nothing. Where abundance of money is, there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of couetouſneſſe, oppreſſion, and all miſchiefe; euery rich thiefe ſtriuing who ſhall buy, nay wring and weary the poore out of all. Contrarily, when there is little money, there is greateſt contentation and loue amongeſt neighbours; but when money commeth in, it ſetteth all
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:3539:149"/>
on fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and parteth friends. The diuell commeth in with it, for it in flameth the deſire; and the diuell bloweth the bellowes, and they that are in loue with it, are beaſts, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters, the children of the Diuell. For it is his baite and his hooke, whereby hee catcheth them, and as it were han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them vp by the chappes.</p>

This denunciation is made by man from God, but the execution is in Gods owne hand.

As before he hath diuers times taught, that the good of worldly things conſiſted in the bodily vſe thereof, the ſuſtenance or comfortable mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the body; ſo now he farther teacheth the ſpirituall vſe thereof, or good of the ſoule, which conſiſteth in the exerciſe of ſaith and charitie therewith. For in doing good, and communicating to others that need our helpe, we make our loue to God, and faith in Gods promiſes more certaine to our ſelues. In theſe times many ſearch into the ſecret counſell of God for their aſſurance, and are much perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:3539:151"/>
about predeſtination, but in the meane time are full of pride and couetouſneſſe, and worldly pompe, which in baptiſme they haue promiſed to forſake. Their ſpirit is full of guile. If they could by deep ſearch know their election, they would aſſuredly beleeue in him, and confidently rely on him, and cheere their fleſh in theſe tranſitory dayes. If they can attaine to this aſſurance, but ſome doubt ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexeth them, they will yet be ſure of one thing, to liue in pride, pompe, pleaſure here on earth. So that whether they be ſure, they will liue in pride and pleaſure, or not ſure, they will liue in pride and pleaſure. Whatſoeuer elſe they can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to be ſure of, this in the meane time they will be ſure of. But whiles they follow the pride, pompe, couetouſnes, eaſe and pleaſures of the world, as many doe, they ſhall be alwayes in perplexitie as many are. Shew me thy faith by thy workes of loue or charitie, ſayth Saint <hi>Iames</hi> to ſuch like Chriſtians in his dayes, and I will ſhew thee my faith by my workes; ſo ſhall we not deceiue our ſelues, nor be deceiued one of another. Men imagine many things, and talke of many things, but the worke done, ſheweth the reſolution of the ſpirit. The whole courſe or frame of life is the ſpirit. The condition of life ſheweth infallibly the conditure of the ſpirit. Simulations and diſſimulations are but friuolous couerings. Summer will ſhew it ſelfe to be Summer, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the weather be; ſo will Winter ſhew it ſelfe, let the weather be as faire as it will be. An hypocrite will ſhew himſelfe, do what he can to the contrary; and he that truly feareth God, cannot be hid with infirmities or ſlanders. The thick clouds cannot turne day into night, nor the brighteſt Moone, night into day. He that is dead to the world, and to the luſts thereof, and beleeueth in God, is mercifull and liberall: but faithleſſe worldlings will needs breake into Paradiſe againe without Chriſt, which <hi>Solomon</hi> in this book reclaimeth them from. The diuell and the fleſh are their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers and helpers, and ſo their whole life is nothing but a <hi>Gigantomachie,</hi> the Giants battell againſt God, his word, his Miniſters, his people. They liue like pompous and proud beaſts, and die like filthy beaſts, their glory is to
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:3539:152"/>
their ſhame, that minde earthly things. To conclude, this Chapter hath two parts: firſt a <hi>Cataſcue,</hi> inſtruction or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, to verſ. 7. Secondly, an <hi>Anaſcuè,</hi> deſtruction or refutation, from thence to the end.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt, it is an inſtruction or remedy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by way of exhortation. This remedy is liberality or bountifulneſſe, grounded on faith and confidence in God alone, and contrary to humane reaſon. If wee doe good to others, God cannot do ill to vs: and if we beleeue in him, his promiſes cannot faile. But why doth <hi>Solomon</hi> here aboue all other vertues bring this for a ſpeciall anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote againſt the former vanities and miſeries of this life? Go aske Saint <hi>Paul</hi> why he ſo extolleth charity aboue all gifts, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. Againe, what vertue more becommeth a Chriſtian then charity, which is to ſhew mercy as he hath receiued mercy, and to do good as he hath receiued good. He that receiueth good, and doth none, maketh God his ſeruant, and himſelfe a god, a god of this world, or diuell. Againe, God requireth the practiſe of this vertue of vs more ſtrictly, and inforceth the ſame, and imprinteth the ſame in the memory by his owne example, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 4. to verſ. 17. here is the vertue of charity dramatically ſet forth before their eyes, and things ſeene cannot be forgotten. Alſo <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 12. Laſtly, we ſhall be iudged by the workes of charity at the laſt day, Math 25. <hi>Come yee bleſſed of my Father,</hi> &amp;c. but this is not meant of morall, or ethnicall workes, Phariſaicall, Popiſh workes. For ſinners are boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull to ſinners, they giue and lend, and that freely ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſuch like as themſelues in fleſhly reſpects. But Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Whatſoeuer ye did to the leaſt of my brethen, yee did to me.</hi>

                  <hi>Caſt thy bread vpon the waters.</hi> Euery word of this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is emphaticall. <hi>Caſt,</hi> that is to ſay, giue with a good heart willingly, and readily, and freely, not being bound at all to the loue of earthly things, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>If riches increaſe, ſet not your heart vpon them, Pſal.</hi> 62. 10. and God loueth an open heart, or cheerfull giuer, that giueth confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently without feare, and freely without compulſion.
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:3539:152"/>
This goodneſſe of the heart in this reſpect conſiſteth of theſe particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Thankefulneſſe,</hi> when vpon conſideration of Gods mercy and bounty towards vs in Chriſt, we deuote in way of thankfulneſſe our goods, not onely to our owne vſe, but to the poore, and to the Church. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5. The Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians firſt gaue themſelues to the Lord, and after to the Apoſtles, and to the poore at their requeſt. And the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>Tyrus</hi> being conuerted, deuote their merchandize and gaines to the Lord, <hi>Eſay</hi> 23. 18. <hi>Her merchandize ſhall not be layd vp and kept in ſtore, but it ſhall be for them that dwel before the Lord, to eate ſufficiently</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Loue,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3. If a man giue all that he hath, and hath not loue, it is nothing. Many build Hoſpitals for the poore, and ſo do Turks alſo; but the Lords poore, the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of Chriſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. they know not: nay, they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take from ſuch poore.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>Compaſſion.</hi> We muſt reioyce with them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, and weepe with them that weepe: wee muſt relieue them that want, and make their caſe our owne. The wicked churle ſayth, do as they will, ſhift as they can, &amp;c. when he diſpoſſeſſeth a poore tenant for a little more rent; for one poore man will oppreſſe and diſpoſſeſſe another, and this is like the raging ſtorme that deſtroyeth all things. It is the voice of a beaſt, not of a man; euery beaſt careth onely for himſelfe, and when one is fallen, the other tread vpon him, and goare him, and ſo do beaſtly men.</p>
               <p n="4">IIII. <hi>Simplicitie;</hi> and that is when we aime at neither profit nor praiſe, but intend to obey the commandement of God. Therefore ſayth Chriſt, <hi>Math</hi> 6. 3. <hi>Let not the left hand know what the right doth.</hi> Giue in vprightneſſe and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie of heart, whether in priuate or publicke; otherwiſe he that giueth, giueth not to God, but to himſelfe; that is the meaning of theſe words.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>Cheerfulneſſe.</hi> Rich men muſt diſtribute and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, for God loueth a cheerfull giuer. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6 16 <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſayth, <hi>Prou.</hi> 3. 28. <hi>Say not to thy neighbour, go, and come againe to morrow, and I will giue it thee, if thou haſt it now.</hi>

For we muſt not onely helpe a man when he is fallen, with our almes, but aſſiſt him before he fall with our reliefe, and ſuccour, both by giuing and lending. The deceitful hearts of hypocrites and churles is herein damnable. They will relieue or aſſiſt no man, but ſuffer him to fall, yea occaſion, and cauſe his fall to buy vp all that he hath, for neede ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth good penny worths. Then will they; nay, then muſt they relieue him on the common almes, wherin the churle for his part will beare the leaſt charge. And if for his great penny worth hee doth any thing of free will, hee thinketh that hee hath done a great worke, deſeruing great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, and reward at Gods hands. Theſe are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good workes and almes of the deceitfull world. They are moſt commonly like vnto perſecuters and robbers that doe giue (ſometimes) to the poore part of their ſtollen goods. It is (indeede) nothing but the offering of a Dogs head, and Swines bloud in facrifice, yet they thinke to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit heauen therewith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thy bread.</hi> Therefore thou muſt giue thine owne, not as mercileſſe churles doe, guilefully; nor yet as their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thieues doe, which ſteale much from one, and giue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>little to another; or benefit one, and hurt many. The thiefe that robbeth by the highway giueth to the poore, that beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth by the highway, and hee is counted a good maiſter, but hee ſhall be hanged for his goodneſſe, if hee be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. Conſider this ye couetous perſons, extortioners, vſurers, and all vnlawfull getters, that enrich your ſelues by the hinderance of other men, God indeede may in mercie accept your repentance, but your gifts and great workes
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:3539:153"/>
are abhominable in the ſight of God without repentance, and deniall of all your deceitfull and falſe goodneſſe. For God is no receiuer of ſtollen goods. If yee bee contented with that which ye can lawfully get in a lawfull calling, and truſt in him, giuing a little of a little, yee ſhall pleaſe him better, then otherwiſe with thouſands. Be thou content, and let them do great workes into whoſe hands God hath put much wealth. If they will not, their damnation ſhalbe the greater, and God ſhall diſpoſe of their wealth as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him, it may be, to thee, or thine. The widdowes mite ſhall be as great a gift, in the ſight of God, the rewarder of euery worke, as the great ſummes of Princes in the eyes of men. As for the gift of the couetous perſon, vſurer, extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, or oppreſſour, it is but the ſacrificing of a dogges head, and ſwines bloud, as I ſayd before, it is but a bribe to make God partaker of their theft and robberies, <hi>Amos</hi> 2. 8. vnleſſe it be in the way of reſtitution vpon vnfained repentance, as <hi>Zacheus</hi> did. Many, chiefly Popiſh world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings will doe no good whiles they liue, but at their laſt end they thinke to merit heauen with a great funerall feaſt, or gift of money, of an houſe, or of ſome land out of their ſuperfluity. They haue indeed made many good bargaines in their life, and this is one of the beſt. The earneſt penny indeede is offered, if it will be receiued, but heauen cannot be ſo bought. A wiſe man goeth forth to his worke in the morning, he taketh the day before him; but this perſon will beginne at Sunne-ſet (if at all) when the gates of the Citty are ſhut. In the time of life I heard him ſay often, that all things may be done for mony, and with the bribe hath he procured himſelfe much fauour, and auoyded de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued puniſhment, and the beaſt thinketh now to deale ſo with God. For I ſee no token of a penitent and contrite heart, nor ſorrow for ſinne, but iuſtifying of himſelfe, no reſtitution, but onely a gift giuen out of ſuperfluity; and ſometimes nothing at all.</p>

                  <hi>Vpon the waters.</hi> An illuſtration of the right manner of giuing, by a ſimilitude of Seede or Bread ſowne or caſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Seas, ſignifying not only the ſincerity and freedome
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:3539:154"/>
of the heart in giuing, but alſo the perſons to whom it is giuen. The wiſe worldling thinketh that whatſoeuer is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen is loſt; and if neither profit, nor praiſe of men, nor any thing redound at all to him againe, hee counteth it quite loſt. Therefore reſpecting himſelfe onely in euery thing, (neither can hee doe otherwiſe) hee counteth that which is giuen to the poore Miniſter, who is neareſt vnto God, cleerly caſt away, becauſe the worldling is either Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh or Turkiſh, either an hypocrite or plaine ethnicke, neither would he haue any man that feareth God to haue any thing. His ſpirit telleth him that he is of the world, and hath his portion in this life onely, therefore he clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the world as his owne right to himſelfe, and ſuch as are ſeruiceable and pleaſing to his fleſh. Their ſpirit, I ſay, ſayth as their father the diuell ſayd, <hi>Luc.</hi> 4. <hi>All is mine, and I giue it to whom I will.</hi> The children of God are not for the profit or praiſe of worldlings, therefore would they haue the world rid of them. They cry with open mouth, away with them.</p>
               <p>The perſons to whom we muſt giue, are the poore, ſuch as need our reliefe and almes, that is, ſuch as are not able to labour for liuing, by reaſon of ſickneſſe, age, &amp;c. Theſe poore are either good, or elſe prophane, idle, Belials, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naughts. The good are thoſe that liue honeſtly, and labour truly for their liuing as health and ſtrength will permit, and are thankfull to God and to their benefactors. Theſe are a fertile ſoyle, worth the coſt and labour, and plenty of good ſeed. For that which is done to them, is done to Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. He calleth them his brethren, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. 40. and his little ones. To theſe muſt we doe good eſpecially, or elſe it is a ſure token that the loue of God is not in vs. <hi>For he that ſeeth his brother haue need, and ſhutteth vp his compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the loue of God in him?</hi> Againe, the Law ſayth, <hi>Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe.</hi> The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians were willing to their power, and beyond their power to relieue their poore brethren, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 3. yet it is not meant that a man ſhould eaſe others and burthen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as he that lendeth his money without increaſe to him
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:3539:154"/>
that is richer then himſelfe, and in the meane time wanteth neceſſaries, verſ. 13. but to make an equality in ſupplying one anothers want, verſ. 14. Neither is this meant to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found callings, for euery one muſt be content with his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth of ſeruants, &amp;c. but to relieue mens wants in their callings, yea and friendly to helpe them forward; not to enuy and ſuppreſſe on euery ſide, that we our ſelues may be aloft alone, and haue all at our owne diſpoſing. Neither yet in wants is it meant of an Arithmeticall equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but Geometricall, as the Philoſophers ſay, that reliefe be giuen according to the need and worthineſſe of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. I ſay worthineſſe; for the houſhold of faith is ſpecially to be relieued, though our <hi>All-alikes</hi> can abide no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, except in this, that as the world loueth his owne, ſo do they moſt affect their raſcals and claw-backs. Herein they make a difference, for to theſe are they very boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, when they will not beſtow a good looke vpon a poore Miniſter, nor honeſt poore man, theſe muſt licke their liuing of the thorne, and chew vpon the bridle. They will haue no difference at all of grace and morality, (this difference the Papiſt cannot abide) morality and flattery, infirmities and prophaneneſſe, but all muſt be alike. But when all is alike, that is to ſay, darkneſſe and carnality, (for that their ſpirit intendeth) then will their pride make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions and degrees enough. And this is nothing but to draw all from God, that they themſelues might be gods, cenſuring and iudging, iuſtifying and condemning, helping and forſaking men accordingly as they pleaſe, and as they are pleaſed.</p>
               <p>The other ſort of poore are neuer-goods or doe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naughts, that haue liued idlely, and brought themſelues into want, and in want are ſtill idle and thankleſſe, abuſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues euen in that litle which they haue, and is giuen them. Theſe are a barren ſoyle for a man to caſt his ſeede vpon. They are water that conſumeth and rotteth the ſeede or bread that is caſt into it; and ſo in reſpect of them it is loſt. For they are rather ready to ſpeake euill, and doe uill to thoſe that doe them good, and walke about with
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:3539:155"/>
lies; yet in their neceſſity and miſery muſt we help them, though they be naught, becauſe we our ſelues are good, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the children of God, and followers of God, who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the raine to fall, and the Sunne to ſhine vpon all. Chriſt healed the nine vnthankefull Leapers, as well as the tenth, and he did good to vs when wee were his enemies. He prayed for his perſecuters, for he came to ſaue, not to deſtroy. And <hi>Salomon</hi> ſayth, Doe good for the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement ſake. Relieue the godly in loue, the euill in pittie: we may be ſure of this, that our gift to the euil in that ſenſe ſhall doe vs good, and him good alſo, and more happly then we are aware of; this being excepted, that wee mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter not matter to his wickedneſſe. I meane, that our libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie be not meanes to maintayne his idleneſſe, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whooredome, &amp;c. to our knowledge. (Yet many are too wiſe, too circumſpect heerein; they proue naught in ſeeming to be too good.) In this caſe lend to the poore, and lend not) and if he be without grace or gouernment, put thy meate into his mouth, but let him not finger thy money, neyther be ſurety for ſuch, leſt the weight of his folly be layd on thy backe. For hee hath the plague, and would haue all alike with him. The prodigall loueth not parſimony. His nature is to vndoe all that deale with him, and follow his humours; neyther regarde his ſerpentine tongue, it is no ſlaunder. As his necke is, ſo let him chew ſuch a bit. For <hi>Salomon</hi> ſayth, That a wiſe man ordereth his affaires by diſcretion. Be not aſhamed, ſaith the ſonne of <hi>Syrach,</hi> to beate an ydle ſtubborne ſeruant to the blood. And Nature teacheth vs to caſt out vnprofitable Drones. But what Drone can be worſe then thoſe that curſe, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure, and ſpeake euill of their Benefactors, when as they ſhould pray for them? Laſtly, the Law ſayth, Reſpect not the poore for his pouerty, giue righteous iudgement. By all this we learne what to do with an euill tongued Drone, and a ſturdy loynes, and what courſe to take with the wicked labouring man, that ſpendeth all, and ſpareth naught, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Pariſh muſt keepe his children. Some ſuch like poore there are. Laſtly, we muſt do good to ſtrangers
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:3539:155"/>
whom wee neuer ſawe, and are neuer like to ſee agayne; which are ſignified by waters alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For thou ſhalt finde it after many dayes.</hi> A reaſon to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force this duty. Thy benefit ſhall not be fruitleſſe, though it ſeeme to be caſt into the Sea, and vtterly loſt; yet it is in the hand of the Lord, who ſhall reſtore it to thee agayne with aduantage. The Seede that is ſeattered abroade vpon the ground, ſeemeth to be loſt; yet it groweth by little and little, and commeth in the end to a plentifull harueſt; ſo ſhall that doe which is ſowne on the waters. The poore are compared to ground, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. ready dreſſed and tilled to our hands, and our reliefe is ſeede caſt vpon it; and for our paynes and coſt in ſowing it, we are promiſed to reape the whole croppe our ſelues. For he ſaith <hi>Deuteron.</hi> 15. 10. <hi>The Lord thy God ſhall bleſſe thee in all thy workes, and in all that thou putteſt thine hand vnto, Prouer.</hi> 19. 17. <hi>He that hath pittie on the poore, lendeth to the Lord, and that which he hath giuen will he pay him againe.</hi> Alſo <hi>Math.</hi> 10. 42. <hi>He that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth but a cuppe of colde water to one of theſe little ones, in the name of a Diſciple, ſhall not loſe his reward.</hi> A cuppe of colde water giuen in this ſence, is better then thouſands and millions in a carnall reſpect. For God reſpecteth the intent of the heart onely, as for the gift it ſelfe, that is Gods owne already; the whole world is his owne, he hath no neede of our gifts, it is his already, and he can giue it to whom hee will, hee maketh heires; therefore hee reſpecteth not the greatneſſe of the gift, but the ſinceritie of the giuer; hee needeth, I ſay, nothing from vs, who can feede his poore at his pleaſure, but we haue neede of faith and obedience, that he might be glorified in our ſaluation, whoſe glorie is not diminiſhed, though we were all damned. If God bleſſe and proſper a man in his perſon, familie, cattell Lands, he ſhall ſoone be rich, although his beginning be right little. For it is not to be regarded, how much a man hath, but how it proſpereth. Corne, hempe, flaxe, trees, hearbs grow in a ſhortſpace, but no man ſeeth how; ſo is it with him whom God proſpereth. For firſt, God giues him wiſdome, and a right forecaſt. Secondly, there is a bleſſing vppon it,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:3539:156"/>
which is aboue all indeuours. Some man groweth rich, no man knoweth how, nor himſelfe neyther. Agayne, ſome becommeth poore, hee knoweth not how; neyther can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man well tell him. Moreouer, beſides the continuall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of his labours, God ſtirreth vp others to doe good to him after many dayes vpon long triall of his faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie; and the Lord maketh heyres at his pleaſure, lands and goods are in his diſpoſing. But the wiſedome of the fleſh is quite contrary. The way to be rich, is to ſpend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to giue nothing, to oppreſſe the poore, to detaine their wages &amp;c.</p>
               <p>There was in a certaine place, one that went among the neighbours to craue ſome beneuolence towards the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters maintenance, three of the richeſt and wiſeſt (ſo repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) gaue theſe anſwers.

Or, they are an illuſtration of the rich mans duty or ſtewardſhip, and vſe of worldly goods, by the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes or examples of clouds and trees, vegetables and meteors, euen all the creatures. As the clouds being full, doe not withhold their raine, but powre it downe vpon the earth; ſo the rich man muſt not hoord vp his treaſures or goods from others. When the merchants of <hi>Tyre</hi> repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they left off to hoord vp riches and gaine, according to their old manner, and dedicated them to holy vſes. Our Sauiour ſayth, Giue almes, and lay vp treaſure in heauen. Thus did <hi>Iob,</hi> and the faithfull in the Primitiue Church ſold their poſſeſſions to communicate to the needy.

So the truly merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, namely he that is receiued to mercy, ſheweth mercy on all, his compaſſion is extended to all; which generall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is a print or ſtampe of Gods mercy ſet in his heart, to wit, that he is receiued to mercy, and is againe truly mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, a fruite of the former.

The rich mansfulneſſe is not for himſelfe, but for all, and he muſt enuy the ſame to no man, for that is hatefull to God and man.

               <p>THe former exhortation is figured by a double <hi>Prolepſis</hi> in this and the next verſe: wherein the anſwers are wholly ſet downe, figured by an <hi>allegory,</hi> but the obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are vnderſtood. The firſt is concerning the time, and perſons. Firſt, for the time. They ſay, that now they are not prouided to giue, they haue rents to pay, they haue an hard Landlord, <hi>(it is becauſe thou art hard to the poore, Mat.</hi> 7. 2.) they haue a purchaſe to pay for. They haue layd all out vpon houſe, land, cattell, they will hereafter do ſomething. When they die, they will make a bequeſt to the poore. <hi>(Qui non eſt hodie, cràs minus aptus erit.)</hi> Mony is ſcant, <hi>(but grace is more ſcant,)</hi> they feare a dearth, <hi>(that is the churles deſire)</hi> therefore they cannot yet do good.</p>
               <p>Secondly, concerning the perſons. They alledge that they ſhould haue bene more prouident and painfull in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, that they are vnworthy of any thing; that they are leud and wicked <hi>(like thy ſelfe)</hi> and will ſpend it naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily <hi>(as thou getteſt it,)</hi> that all is loſt which is put into a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen diſh <hi>(not in a cloſe chest,)</hi> they muſt not doe for euery one <hi>(that do all for themſelues,)</hi> and ſo out of their ſelfeloue, diſtruſt and infidelity, they pretend a thouſand excuſes and delayes, they find innumerable obſtacles to hinder them that they ſhall neuer do any good thing at all.</p>
               <p>The anſwer hereto, is illuſtrated by a ſimilitude of the ſower and the reaper. <hi>He that obſerueth the winde, ſhall not ſow.</hi> He that ſtands vpon winde and weather, calme and ſunſhine, ſhall neuer ſow his ſeed in the ſpring. Now it is rainy, now a driſling fog and claggie, now ſnow-like, now froſty and dry, now windy and ſtormy, &amp;c. no weather pleaſeth, he will tarry for a more conuenient ſeaſon, and that comes to be out of ſeaſon, and ſometimes, when earing time is paſt. It is colde, threfore the ſlouch will not plow, <hi>Prou.</hi> 20. 4. It raineth, the land will be too heauie; it driſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

will blow his ſeed on heapes; it is ouermoiſt, that will cauſe weeds; it is ouerdrie and froſt-like, the ſeed will not come vp; it is a faire day and a conuenient ſeaſon, but there is a Lion in the way. So the wicked rich cannot ſow the ſeed of good workes, for want of a conuenient time and perſon. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the weather or land is not in tune, becauſe himſelfe is out of tune. But the ſtrong man attaineth to riches, the good husbandman ouerpowreth the weather, and the ſtars: ſo a good heart of gracious diſpoſition can do good at all times, and to all perſons, hee is armed againſt all wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he that regardeth the clouds, ſhall not reape.</hi> Hee that will tarry for a conuenient ſeaſon of his owne deuiſing, ſhall reape his owne deuice, euen nothing. He that will not ſow till he ſee and be ſure of faire weather, ſhall haply neuer mow, but let his corne, rot on the ground, or be all eaten with beaſts and birds. We muſt take the time as it is, and reape the fruites as they are. As we ſerue others, ſo are we ſerued againe. Some man will do good when he is old, ſome when he dieth, ſome after death by his laſt will; ſome feare pouertie and want hereafter; ſome haue now no leiſure; ſome alledge the vnworthineſſe and vnthankfulneſſe of the poore: but none of theſe can finde a time when, nor a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to whom to do good, till death ſummon them to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and then come they with their talent tied vp in a napkin. Their reward ſhall be according to their workes.</p>

Hee hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, thou muſt obey without reaſons. He hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, thou muſt beleeue without interrogatories; thou muſt not binde him to times and meanes. His ſecreſie is his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, none is of his counſell, neither is any worthy or able, for his wiſedome is infinite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his goodneſſe is to all, and his mercy is ouer all his workes, and on them that feare him throughout all generations. As thou knoweſt not the way of the winde, when it ſhall come, whence it commeth, or whither, or how it goeth: and as thou knoweſt not how the bones doe grow in the wombe, ſo neyther canſt thou know the workes of God, who maketh all by the word of his power, and gouernes all by the word of his prouidence;
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:3539:160"/>
he onely is all in all, ſhewing mercy and iuſtice on all. Feare and obey therefore, truſt not thine owne counterfeit ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, make not a world nor an eſtate to thy ſelfe after thine owne will, for all that ſhall be but as the cracking of thornes vnder a pot. Thy flame ſhall ſeeme great, thy noiſe loud, but both ſhall ſodainly vaniſh into light aſhes: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods bleſſing thy riches ſhall neuer doe thee good, thy prouiſion ſhall come to naught, none of thine for whome thou art ſo carefull ſhall be the better for it. For a curſe is vpon it. God bleſſeth his owne gifts, not thy gatherings, his owne ordinance, not thy deuice. The <hi>Manna</hi> gathered on the weeke day by Gods appoyntment, proſpered, but that which was gathered on the Sabaoths morning by the couetous, fearefull, and diſtruſtfull, was putrified and full of wormes; and they that were not content with Gods al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, but would haue fleſh, had their deſire; but their deſire was wicked, therefore their fleſh brought a plague with it. Neither did the Manna nor the fleſh of their owne gathering and deſiring doe them good. For there was the man, but the meate was taken away; here was the meate, but the man was taken away. So it is now. Therefore, be thou contented, hope in him, bee doing good, and thou ſhalt haue good, and thy good ſhall be good to thee, and continue with thee. Be ſure of this, that of doing good there can come none euill, neyther can wickedneſſe proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. If thou haſt goods in thine owne hands, and canſt looke vpon them, thou art joyfull; and if they be in the hand of God, not yet giuen thee, diſtruſt not. That which is in Gods hands, is (by faith) ſurer to thee then that which is in thine owne hands, if thou doeſt but looke vpon thy ſinnefull and polluted hands aſwell as vpon thy goods in them. Thy ſinnes ſhall take theſe from thee, and thy faith ſhall bring the other to thee. Note this worke of God in the world. There is many a rich heyre that can neuer be at eaſe till all his patrimony be ſpent. Againe, there is that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not thriue till his foule inheritance be cleane waſhed away, or his hands cleanſed of that filth, and then afterwards he proſpereth and attaineth to riches. For the man that ſets
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:3539:160"/>
his heart to gather for his children, withdraweth himſelfe commonly from relieuing the poore, and ſo bringeth a curſe on his houſe and lands, the executioner whereof is the heyre for whom he laboured. Hee that hath grace to beleene, to truſt in God, to doe good, whether hee hath much or little, is heyre to all things, and ſhall want nothing that is for his good: and God knoweth what is for our good better then we; he is our father, <hi>the Ancient of daies,</hi> moſt wiſe, wee are but children, &amp;c. Therefore feare not, God ſhall bring it to paſſe, caſt thy care on him, onely be doing good. The good Counſellor ſhall want no Clients; the good Phyſition no patients; the good Tradeſman no cuſtome; the man that feareth God no friends and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. For the hearts of all men are in Gods hands, and his workes aboue reaſon, and beyond expectation are infinite; to conclude, limite not God, but conſidder how the Lord brought <hi>Ionas</hi> to <hi>Nineue;</hi> and by what meanes he aduanced <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and prouided for <hi>Iacob</hi> with his ſonnes in the great and long famine of <hi>Canaan.</hi>

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:3539:161"/>
and turned thy backe, as the laſt word after a farewell for a memoriall and good enſample to the liuing. While a mans name is in memorie, and his works in fight, he is not dead, but liuing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For thou knoweſt not whether ſhall proſper, either this, or that,</hi> &amp;c. A confirmation drawn from the vncertainty of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of morning &amp; euening ſowing, whether ſhall bring a better harueſt, or both alike, thou canſt not tell. Therefore do good, worke at all times, from morning till night; from youth till olde age, and as at all times, ſo to all men, good and bad, knowne and vnknowne. For neither doeſt thou know which ſhall be moſt fruitfull, nor which God will moſt reward. A word in due time is like Apples of golde with pictures of ſiluer; and ſo is a good deede, which can neuer be out of due time. A gift of ſmall valew oft times doth great good to a man, and procureth great good to thy ſelfe, for God will heare the prayer of the poore for thy ſake, and reward thee, when thou haſt forgotten and kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt wherefore it is. Euen as God doth puniſh age for the ſinnes of youth, elſe would not <hi>Dauid</hi> haue prayed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 7. <hi>Remember not the ſinnes of my youth:</hi> ſo doth he reward the good workes of youth in olde age. For hee that giueth in youth, laith vp for age: becauſe, whatſoeuer he ſeemeth to caſt on the waters to his preſent hinderance, ſhalbe paid him agayne with aduantage. What then? wilt thou giue becauſe of aduantage? That is vſurie, which God hateth. Giue freely, of a faithfull and obedient heart, looking for nothing againe at all. But thou wilt ſay, many receiue no ſuch reward. I anſwer, God knoweth the heart of the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and thou muſt remember the reſurrection of the Iuſt, as well as preſent things. God hath a better thing in ſtore for thee, let not the trifles of this nonage diſcourage thee. This is a ſure ground, well doing ſhalbe rewarded. If thou ſeeſt not ſuch a reward heere, thou art more bleſſed becauſe more aſſured of the reward hereafter. For the wicked alſo receiue temporall rewards of externall, and hertleſſe good workes. Doe good therefore continually, and to all; ſaue not thy meate, and loſe thy life as <hi>Nabal</hi> did. Shall I giue
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:3539:161"/>
my meate, drinke, money I know not to whom? So the foole reaſoned. But <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> by ſhewing kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to euery one, entertayned Angels vnawares. If they had beene as wiſe as <hi>Nabal</hi> thought himſelfe, they might haue periſhed in the fiery deluge of <hi>Sodom,</hi> as <hi>Nabal</hi> ſhould haue periſhed by the ſword. But bountifull <hi>Abigail</hi> could not periſh, no more then <hi>Lot;</hi> for the Lord deliuereth the mercifull and libetall in time of trouble, and plenteouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeth the proude doer.</p>

               <p>THE ſecond part of the chapter, or <hi>anaſcoue,</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the former precepts by a confutation or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the corrupt and luſtfull imaginations of mans worldly heart. It is figured by a double <hi>Prolepſis;</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer whereof is generall. The obiection is figured by a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopopeia,</hi> which is figured againe by an Allegorie in this verſe. The anſwer is giuen in the next; <hi>Truely the light is ſweete,</hi> &amp;c. By <hi>Light</hi> is meant worldly proſperitie, <hi>Eſay</hi> 58. 8. <hi>Then ſhall thy light breake foorth as the morning.</hi> By the <hi>Sunne</hi> is meant an happy outward eſtate, excelling all other, ſplendide and pompous, whereof the worldly heart is ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured, as the onely felicitie, <hi>Iob</hi> 31. 26. <hi>If I beheld the Sunne when it ſhined, or the Moone walking in her brightneſle.</hi> That is, if mine heart was enamoured on my flouriſhing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, if I bleſſed my ſelfe for my wealth, power, and honour. To proceed, wheras <hi>Solomon</hi> hath before recalled men from coueting earthly things, and ſelfe-loue to charitie, and good workes, that he might more firmely ſettle this grace in their hearts; hee now rooteth vp the weedes of fleſhly pleaſures, and worldly delights, by bringing in the careall man objecting or replying againſt him for himſelfe, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vpon his good admonitions to retract him cloſely, clinging to his dirty god Mammon, as Crabbes cleaue to the rocke, and one to an other when they are pulled away.</p>
               <p>Ah! but for all that, a goodly inheritance is a ſweeto

thing: it is a pleaſant thing to be well ſeated in a fertile ſoile, in an wholeſome aire, neare to the riuer, not farre from the citie or market, to be free from all troubles and cares that pouertie bringeth. What an heauenly life it is when a man need do nothing, but walke about his grounds for his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ouerſee his workmen, looke on his cattell, &amp;c. <hi>(as the couetous rich man did, Luk</hi> 12.) when hee is prouided of the beſt houſholdſtuffe and lodgings, and withall able to make his friend welcome, to entertaine a gentleman, to keepe gentlemen companie, to keepe a couple of men and a good gelding, to ride with credit, and to change the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion with the better ſort, and to haue mony alwayes in his purſe, to be able to pleaſure a friend or a gentleman at his requeſt in his need, to be able to maintaine his wife in the gentlewomans faſhion, and to bring vp his children in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for greater preferment. Ah, this is a louely and deſirea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſtate aboue all things, ſay what they will. I will go la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and ſpare all that I can, and caſt about euery way, that I may haue as ſuch a one hath, and liue as he doth, or might do if he were wiſe. Ah, what good could I doe, if I had as he hath, or had bene ſo well left? He dwelleth in a ſweete ſeate, what goodly and ſweete grounds hath he adioyning to his houſe? what ſweete fields of wheate? what goodly paſtures? what a goodly roote of wood? what pleaſant groues? ſome ſay, it will be ſolde ere long. He proſpereth not, he is indebted; who but a foole and a beaſt would make away ſuch a goodly thing? Ah, would to God I had money to buy it, I would neuer part from it; well, I will haue mony if I liue, I will make all cracke elſe. I ſhall liue in pleaſure and comfort hereafter when I am old, and my ſonne ſhall be a fine yong gentleman, of good account among gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens ſonnes, well accepted of the beſt ſort, and ſhall eaſily attaine to greater dignitie, as I meane to bring him vp, and place him in mariage. [What a zealous man is this! how his bowels yerne with pitie on the poore, and poore Miniſter! how he firſt of all ſeeketh the kingdome of God and his righteouſneſſe!] He meaneth to be firſt, a couetous beaſt, to rake mony together by all meanes, <hi>quo iure, quaque iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>

               <p>AN anſwer to the reply, proponnded by way of admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition. The argument is drawne from the contrary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunct. Youth and proſperitie are ſubiect to age and death, which beginneth in age, and formeth him from the graue. Whereupon he inferreth the common concluſion, to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way this and all other replies, <hi>All that commeth is vanitie. But if a man liue many yeares,</hi> &amp;c. Put the caſe <hi>(Dato, non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſo)</hi> that a man enioyed that conceited happineſſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſting in a free worldly proſperitie, that earthly men ſo dreame of, and aime at in all their courſes. Say that he liue long, which is a thing deſired of all men, chiefly the rich, and that he reioyce as freely as it is poſſible for a man to do in this confuſed and diſordered world; yet let him remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that which he cannot alway forget, nor altogether for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in his freeſt iollitie, namely that he is mortall, that his flower fadeth, his leafe withereth, his verdure vaniſheth te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie and tedious old age haſteneth, light ſhall be turned into darkneſſe, pleaſure into paine, delights into weariſomneſſe, and the darke dayes of olde age and death exceed in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the lightſome dayes of life; I ſay, the darke dayes of old age and death, becauſe old age is the infancie or childhood of death, as the ſun ſetting to vs is the ſun riſing to the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes?</hi> For theſe pleaſant ſunſhine dayes, wherewith thou art ſo rauiſhed, are but a worme gleame, and momentanie glance; but contrarily, the dayes wherein the body muſt lie in the darke graue, are many.

                  <hi>Many,</hi> is put for innumerable, endleſſe, eternall. It may alſo be a <hi>ſynecdoche</hi> of the <hi>ſpeciall.</hi> Let a man remember all this, and it will abate his luſtfull courage, it will take downe the pride of his fleſh, it will mitigate the eagerneſſe of his deſires, and the luſhiouſneſſe, lothſomneſſe of his worldly zeale, and make him more out of loue with his tender dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, his body, it will gather home his wilde diſperſed fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and his rouing thoughts into their hold, and hang them on their right hinge, and bring backe the prodigall vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond home, laſtly it will recouer his wits, and reſtore him to his right mind. Therefore be ſatisfied with this, be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed hereby to contentation in things preſent, ſtriue not for an imaginary happineſſe, but exerciſe thy ſelfe in workes of charitie, rather doe good, which bringeth the true good, then ſeeke for it in goods which cannot affoord it. For all that commeth to man in this life as concerning the outward, man, is vanitie, ſeeing that old age commeth, and death followeth after, and that is eternall.

               <p>THis verſe is an anſwer to the ſecond obiection, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, which is more particular, to wit, concerning the yong man, for whom there is ſome colour of reaſon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the wicked ciuill. The reply is directed againſt the former anſwer, but it is not here expreſſed, but vnderſtood by the context of the words. I grant indeed, that when a
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:3539:163"/>
man is full growne, and growne full, elder and richer, hee ſhould be helpfull to the poore, and letting all youthfull tricks paſſe, haue a care of his family, and follow his huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandrie, that the poore may be relieued, and his children well prouided for. But youth will be youth, youth muſt not be abridged of libertie, yong men muſt be borne withall, if they be not too leud. But indeed if they beginne to fall to whoredome, and vnthriftineſſe eſpecially, they muſt be bridled, elſe ſhall they loſe their good name, and ſpend that which their friends haue left them, which is worſt of all. Againe, when a man growes into age, he muſt beginne to thinke of his end (it is time I thinke) and come to Church duly to ſerue God (after that the diuell is firſt ſerued) and at his laſt end haue a chiefe care to ſet all right and ſtraight. For when things are rawly left, I ſee oft times that variance growes among his children<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and much heart-burne, and vaine expence, the Lawyer getteth all in the end, and they all become beggars. That is the very fruite of thy wiſedom and workes, it is Gods iuſt iudgement vpon the worldly wiſe, which ſeeke not Gods kingdome, deſire not his grace, nor teach their children the feare of the Lord, but aime all at worldly wealth and credit, euen that imaginary happineſſe which <hi>Solomon</hi> here confuteth.</p>
               <p>The anſwer to this obiection, is directed to the vaine i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations of the yong man. Firſt it is propounded, and figure by an <hi>ironicall conceſſion,</hi> and after rendered in plaine words, by way of correction and threatning. Secondly, it is amplified by a milder, but graue exhortation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reioyce, O yong man,</hi> &amp;c. Concerning the imaginations of the yong mans heart, which <hi>Solomon</hi> here meeteth with, they are three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some yong men imagine the time of this life to be but a market of buying and ſelling, to heape vp treaſure, and to ſet themſelues into a couetous courſe, and ſo fall into innumerable ſinnes of that kind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some imagine it to be but a play. Theſe enter into an Epicuriſh courſe of life, and innumerable ſins of that kind. Yet of theſe contrary liues, there are ſundrie degrees and
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:3539:164"/>
faſhions, and the latter ſort are moſt incident to youth, the other to age.</p>

The other two are madneſſe, and this is folly. For in man there is no true wiſedome, nor true goodneſſe. As one holds on couetouſueſſe, the other on voluptuouſneſſe, ſo the third on pride and worldly pomp, wherein ſoeuer it ſtandeth. He is meanely couetous which he calleth parſimonie, and meanly prodigall which he ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth liberalitie; but extremely vainglorious and proud, and as reprobate to euery truly good worke as the other.

Remembrance is hiſtoricall, or practicke and effectuall. The former is the bare vnderſtanding and bearing in mind of a thing paſt, as not pertaining to vs, but the wiſe man maketh vſe of euery thing. The latter is the vnderſtanding remembrance of that which pertaineth to vs to do, or a dutie to be performed. It is particular or generall. Particular, is of euery mans dutie in that calling wherein God hath placed him. Generall, is of Chriſtian duties to be performed of all. Particular callings and duties, are ſanctified by the generall, and comprehended vnder it. Therefore this remembrance is holy and generall; holy, becauſe it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of God, and his glorie; generall, becauſe it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to the whole man, inward and outward. Therefore he ſaith, <hi>Remember thy Creator</hi> that made thee in his image, and all things for thee. Remembrance therefore is to direct all faith, hope, loue, feare, obedience, euery action of life, and cogitation of the mind to God onely, euen to his praiſe

Contrarily to forget, is to be vnthankefull and diſobedient, <hi>Deuteron.</hi> 8. 11. <hi>Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God, not keeping his commandements, and his lawes, and his ordinances,</hi> &amp;c. 14. <hi>Then thine heart be lifted vp, and thou forget the Lord thy God,</hi> &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore this word <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,</hi> implieth continuall obedience in euery thing, or perpetuall thankefulneſſe.</p>

For wee are not our owne, but the Lords, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth to Seruants; <hi>Serue the Lord, not men.</hi> And to ſpeake as the thing is, the whole time of life is a Sabbath. The Sabbath was ordained for the reliefe and helpe of our infirmitie, and alſo to ſhew forth our conſociation and fellowſhippe with our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members, and fellow-ſeruants in the Church triumphant, as farre foorth as the neceſſities of our bodies heere below
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:3539:166"/>
will permit. For eternall life is heere begunne. Therefore wee owe nothing to the fleſh, not one minute of time, nor one thought of the heart. We are the Spouſe of Chriſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth, he preſented the Corinthians a pure Virgine to Chriſt. Wee muſt be chaſte, as the Angells are beautified with all chaſtitie. Concerning olde age there is no doubt made. For euery one thinketh that a man muſt then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to draw neare vnto God, but they imagine yong age to be a time of libertie. But heerein theſe indifferent min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded men are like the ſacrilegious Iewes, <hi>Malach.</hi> 1. 13. 14. They offer, the torne, the lame, the ſicke, the corrupt, the leane, as <hi>Caine</hi> did. Therefore are they accurſed, verſe 8. <hi>Goe offer it to thy Prince, will hee be content, and accept thy perſon?</hi> It is the offering of an olde Dogge. Men common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offer health, ſtrength, beauty: Youth to their luſts, to the world, and to Satan; but ſickeneſſe, weakeneſſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form tie, olde age to God. When they can ſerue the world no longer, then come they to God, the adulterer, and the olde whoore The world is an harlot, when her louer is quite ſpent, ſhe caſteth him off, then commeth he to God with his olde carkaſſe. Thoſe things that the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneth, or little regardeth, muſt God haue; but howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, the world muſt haue the firſt offer. Pouertie and baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe we can be content to giue to God, but riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to our ſelues, and the diuell. For he ſaith indeede, <hi>All is mine. Luke</hi> 4. 6. <hi>God must be ſerued of Lazarus: Diues</hi> is too great, too good; therefore hee muſt not abaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to ſtoupe ſo lowe, but rather honourably deuote him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to his belly, and to the Diuell the lord of the belly. The virginitie of the tender beautifull woman, is too good to be conſecrated to the Lord, to liue chaſtly, ſo the lewd lourdaine thinketh. So <hi>Nabal</hi> thought any morſell of his meate, or bottle of his drinke, too good for <hi>Dauid,</hi> but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was enough, nor good enough for himſelfe. So the Churle can ſpare nothing to the poore Miniſter, nor giue one houre of the weeke to God. But the olde whoore, the olde thiefe, the olde adulterer, the olde <hi>Nabal,</hi> &amp;c. that are ſodden, and rotten in their luſts, can be well content to giue
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:3539:167"/>
their carkaſſes vnto God. And when they haue at their laſt end diſpoſed their goods to their children, and their rich friends and kinsfolkes, they will happly ſend for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to inſtruct them, and to pray for them, but they will not yet remember the afflictions of <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> And wherefore to pray? that God would now accept that carrion-idoll, and receiue it into the kingdome of glorie, and company of the Angells of Light. Theſe wicked beaſts thinke that they owe no more ſeruice to God all their life but this.

If there be firſt willing mind, God accepteth according to that which a man hath. Let vs carefully husband our talent while we haue time and ſtrength. The Spring produceth all things out of the earth, that were buried in Winter; euen ſo what lyeth buried in childhood, ſheweth forth it ſelfe in youth. Corruption muſt not ſhew it ſelfe forth now, but

The Summer ripeneth what the Spring brought forth; let middle age bring to maturitie and perfection that which hath bene taught vs in our yong age.

               <p>Now that the conſideration of old age may take the dée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per impreſſion in the heart of the yong, he depainteth it out by an allegoricall <hi>hypotypoſis,</hi> or liuely deſcription, firſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in theſe words, and after particularly in the next ſix verſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>While the euill dayes come not.</hi> By euill dayes in generall is meant pouertie, weakneſſe, ſickneſſe, lameneſſe, blindnes, and other afflictions of body and ſtate, whereby a man is diſabled from the actuall performance of ſuch duties as hee is called vnto. Whatſoeuer abilitie or gift a man hath, that is his talent. And in all affaires and workes of this life, men take the appointed ſea on, and vſe the time with diligence; night letteth, raine letteth, winde and tempeſt letteth, theſe lets men redeeme with diligence, (and ſome with double diligence) and reſerue ſome workes for letting dayes, that euery moment of time may be ſupplied; ſo they will neuer be idle, that meane to be wealthy. So it muſt be with vs in our Chriſtian calling. We muſt worke with the Oare while we haue ſtrength, and after ſit at the ſterne. Let euery man do good while he is able. Let him take grace when it is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and vſe it whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is bidden. The Law ſaith, yea the heart and whole drift of the Law is this, Loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart, minde, ſoule, ſtrength, ſoule and body, ſuperiour and inferiour powers, euen while thou haſt an heart, which firſt liueth, and laſt dieth, while thou haſt a minde and a memory, while thou haſt ſtrength, while thou haſt health, while thou haſt wealth. Suffer no gift to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull. Euery talent muſt fructifie. Secondly, by <hi>euill dayes</hi> more ſpecially is meant the diſeaſe of olde age. For olde age is a diſeaſe, it is the conſumption of the whole body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man is diſabled from doing any thing. It is grieuous and weariſome. The lame is paſt labour, and the ſicke paſt

Men draw forth as liuely as they can, the pictures of their yong age, that in old age they may ſee their youth before their eyes, this is but a vanitie; yet may good vſe be made hereof. So contrarily, <hi>Solomon</hi> draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out the picture of olde age, that men in time of youth may ſee and looke vpon, and remember their olde age, and death which followeth, and their account which followeth that. This is an inſtigation to workes of charitie and pietie. Better it is for a yong man to haue the picture of death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, then for an old man to haue the picture of youth in his eyes. An old dotard is odious, and an old babbler hatefull.</p>

The marriner ſpeaketh of the windes, the ſhepheard of his flocke, the plow-man of his grounds and cattell and the old man of his diſeaſes, infirmities, aches. His relations of things paſt are conciſe, independent, confuſe; he cannot manage and vſe his experiments and obſeruations to profit withal: yea his former practiſes are but ſpeculations to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, much more to another, therefore he hath no liſt to ſpeake, all things are quite altered the world is new, it ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth his skill. And thus it is with euery old man through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all generations of the world, inſomuch that if they which haue bene long dead ſhould riſe againe as but out of an hundred yeares ſleepe, they could not know the world nor the way of it, and might as well cauſe the Sunne to go backward, as to reduce it to the former ſtate; and though it

ſhould be the ſame, and continue like it ſelfe, yet ſhould a man be vnlike himſelfe; and ſo ſhould the world one and the ſame in it ſelfe, appeare in new and ſtrange formes to him. As for example; All things are full of vanitie, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and griefe to the afflicted, and to him vpon whom God turneth his backe; whereas contrarily at the ſame time it is a paradiſe of pleaſure to an other. It is now an heauen, but if God inſtantly forſake a man vtterly, it is an hell. And as <hi>Diues</hi> deſired to be out of hell, ſo would he deſire to be out of the world; whatſoeuer his eſtate ſhould be heereafter, he had rather ſtand to the hazard then liue. If health, ſtrength, wealth &amp; honor could, at an inſtant, be put vpon the poore, ſicke, lame, blind beggar, the world ſhould be a new world, and ſuch a world as hee neuer imagined, the other dayes world ſhould be paſſed as in a dreame, and as but a dreame. And ſo doth olde age wonder at the change of the world, hee longeth after the former generation, and deſires to be dead. All is vanity, vexation and wearineſſe. But the yong generation thinketh not ſo. Their endeuors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> expectations, and hopes are ſtrong and poſſible; but the aged deſpaireth, and ſorroweth, and is vexed to ſee vanities, and fooliſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions.

And the bloud is ingendered and purified in the middle of the liuer, which containeth the maſſe of the foure humours.

It is the earthly ſowre or tart part of the chile, and is called blacke choler, or melancholy. Againe, the lighter ſuperfluitie boyleth vpward, which is the fiery, bitter or ſharpe part of the chile called yellow choler, which is caried by a veine into the gall. Vnderſtand by melancholy and yellow choler, not the pureſt thereof, which is mixed with the bloud, but the ſeparate ſuperfluitie or impuritie thereof. Thirdly, the wateriſh ſuperfluitie is caried to the kidneys and paſſages of the vrine.

               <p>AN amplification of the concluſion, by an admonition begun here digreſſiuely, figured by a <hi>Prolepſis,</hi> the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection whereof is vnderſtood, and is ſuch like; we are not bound to giue credence to all things contained in this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, ſeeing that no man is ſo perfect in this life, but that he may erre, and is defectiue and weake in the truth it ſelfe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, the inordinate life of thoſe that write, to inſtruct and admoniſh others, is a meanes to diminiſh their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and to make their labours fruitleſſe. The anſwer is, verſ. 9. 10. 11. wherein he procureth authoritie to his doctrine, by ſundry arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe the Preacher.</hi> The firſt argument is drawne from his perſon or office. He is not now <hi>Solomon</hi> ſeduced by his idolatrous wiues and flickering concubines, he is not <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> giuing the reins to inordinate deſires, not <hi>Solomon</hi> ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured with the glory of the world and worldly delights; but <hi>Solomon</hi> aged, experienced, prudent, repenting, morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, reconciled to the Church of God, neare to death, neare to iudgement. Therefore is he the fitteſt, and moſt able to admoniſh others by reaſon of his knowledge and much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Was wiſe.</hi> The ſecond argument drawne from his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary wiſedome. He was wiſe, yea the moſt wiſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are his admonitions to be regarded and followed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſtill taught the people knowledge.</hi> A confirmation of the admonition, by the end and vſe of his wiſedome, which was the godly gouernment of his people, not meerly politicke for his owne tranquillity and pleaſure, and vainglory of his owne perſon, but diuine and religious, that the people might be contained in obedience, euen in the religious feare of God, rather then either by plaine force or other begui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling deuices, without care or loue of Religion, which come to naught. 1. <hi>King</hi> 3 7. what the intent of <hi>Solomons</hi> prayer

there is, and his meaning here, is euident, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 19. 20. by the charge of <hi>Moſes;</hi> the King muſt be continually exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the booke of God, that he may learne to feare the Lord and obey his word, without arrogating libertie to himſelfe to decline either to the right hand or to the left, that his hart be not lifted vp aboue his brethren to tyrannize and rule in his owne name, but to ioyne in the worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God with them, yea to be a patterne and example of vertuous and godly life vnto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yea he gaue good heed.</hi> The third argument is drawne from his carefull obſeruation and experience. He was wholly and continually attentiue to heare, to ſee, to diſcerne, to iudge, as the Hebrew word <hi>aizzen</hi> of the coniugation <hi>piel</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſought out.</hi> As he was attentiue and heedfull, ſo was he induſtrious and painfull to know much by liuely and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experience; this is the fourth argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſet in order many prouerbes.</hi> A confirmation of his knowledge, attentiueneſſe and induſtry, by the effect or fruite thereof, as 1. <hi>King.</hi> 4. 31. 32. 33. 34. He was wiſer then all men, then <hi>Ethan, Heman, Chalcol</hi> or <hi>Darda;</hi> he ſpake three thouſand prouerbes, and his ſongs were an hundred and fiue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſpake of all the creatures, and there came of all people to heare his wiſedome. By all theſe arguments we learne what the calling, gifts, and duties of true teachers are. Curſed therefore are theſe Popiſh ignorants, and our Athei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall politicians. They are both alike enemies to knowledge and the true feare of God.</p>

               </head>
               <p>A Fifth argument drawne from the profitableneſſe of his doctrine. <hi>The Preacher ſought to find out words of delight,</hi> or acceptation, not vain ſpeculations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> carnall inuentions, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable fables, curious and fruitles fancies, vain ianglings; but wholſome doctrine profitable for edification in faith and

There is none end of their hearing, new inſtruments, new voyces, new tunes, new formes, new ſtiles, they are all for nouelties, full of the itch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> full of curioſitie, but their heart goeth after their pride, after their couetouſneſſe. Theſe extreames are at length co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incident. There is none end of ſpeaking and writing to the ſluggiſh and curious. They are both a great burden to their teachers, they will neuer be pleaſed. <hi>Solomon</hi> therefore in theſe words willeth them to be doers, and diligent practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, the one ſort to humble themſelues, the other to rouze themſelues to obedience, that they may haue experience, and feeling in themſelues of the grace and wiſedome of God; <hi>(manus eſt cauſa ſapientiae)</hi> and then ſhall they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, not weary to death their teachers, as many doe. But thoſe greedy eares, proude and couetous, that are ſo zealous to heare, and yet their teachers but figge-frailes, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſucking ſpiders, caſting them out when they haue ſuckt them as they doe their oyſter ſhells, are but gadding carnalls and bloud-ſuckers. When they would be ridde of their teacher, then will they put him out of breath; and when he cannot preach twice a day, hee may ſit vnder the Iuniper tree with <hi>Elias,</hi> to be fedde with Rauens. I ſpeake not this to ſet dogges on barking, to whom all things are alike; but the God of order hateth confuſion) which take vp all occaſions of euill ſpeaking, but rather to ſtoppe their mouthes, by putting a difference betweene the truely reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and truely deuoted, and gadding talkers, whoſe
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:3539:179"/>
backs and eyes are full of pride and adultery. But our <hi>All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alikes</hi> are not for differences, but confuſion. But when they haue once made a confuſion of good and euill, ſowre and ſweete, light and darkneſſe, then in the fleſh will they make differences, they cannot abide confuſion, euery one ſtriueth for ſuperiority and preheminence, euery one preferreth him ſelfe before other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and glorieth in his riches, in his learning, in his knowledge, in his skill, in his friends, in his ſtrength, and men acknowledge ſuch differences; but of light and darkneſſe, carnall and ſpirituall, precious and vile, they will admit no difference: all muſt be alike; and the more carnall the more acceptable. The ciuill and orderly vicious, the beſt garniſher of vice in vertues robes and colours, is the moſt wiſe, and moſt commended.</p>

                  <hi>And much ſtudy is a wearineſſe to the fleſh.</hi> Hee ſpeakes not this of the paines of the holy writer, nor of the reader, that ought to exerciſe himſelfe day and night in the Scriptures, and that with delight, but of thoſe erraticall extreame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, of whom I ſpake before, both writers and readers. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> exerciſed himſelfe continually in the Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 2. but he got wiſedome by doing it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 98. 99. 100. And <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith. <hi>Manus eſt cauſa ſapientiae.</hi> When a man hath diſquieted and tormented himſelfe long about predeſtination, &amp;c. yet ſhall the ioyfull and cheerfull practiſe of Chriſtianitie ſuſtain him, and faith in Gods mercy towards him ſhall be his onely comfort in life and death. For all our felicity is in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation: and he putteth none away that conſtantly ſeeke him with their whole heart, that is, ſincerely, not guilefully, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 2. Neither doth he forſake any that do not firſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him. The vnderſtanding of this may we ſee in <hi>Iudas</hi> the guilefull diſciple, and the eleuen true diſciples. Know thy maiſters mind, heare what he ſaith to thee, and apply thy ſelfe to do his wil without ſeaching into his ſecrets, and thou ſhalt neuer loſe his fauour, nor be turned out of his ſeruice. For he is not ſo eaſily diſpleaſed, but beareth with innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable imperfections and infirmities in his children, whom he meaſurably chaſteneth, and deliuereth not ouer to death. He is moſt wiſe, moſt good, moſt mercifull, if thou doeſt not
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:3539:179"/>
account his mercy greater then thy ſinnes, thou doeſt limit him who is infinite. To know thy ſinnes, to acknowledge and confeſſe them, and to deſpaire of righteouſneſſe and ſaluation in thy ſelfe and by thy ſelfe, is that which he requireth: for then thou wilt flie to him, truſt in him, rely on him, and be euer thankfull to him. Surely, when thou art none of thine owne, then art thou his. Much reading and ſtudying is indeed a wearineſſe, but it is a delightfull thing to do the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements. Experimentall knowledge is full, delightfull and comfortable. A litle that one eateth, is better then all that a man can heare of, reade of, ſtudy of, dreame of. Greedy ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatiſts and hearers, are but dreamers, they are neuer ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but ſoone weary of well doing: but God will be heard of vs, ſeene of vs, and ſerued of vs as if he were a King in bodily preſence. This is the fulneſſe of ſound faith, feare and obedience, not fantaſtick dreaming, as they that would ſeem to be as deuout as <hi>Mary,</hi> and yet are as proud as <hi>Iezebel;</hi> as zealous as <hi>Dauid,</hi> but as couetous as <hi>Nabal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </head>
               <p>THe generall concluſion of the whole ſcope of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doctrine and exhortation. For all is but the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the old man, and the quickning or renewing of the inner man, and both theſe are one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They are one motion, and differ but in reſpect of the termes, <hi>à quo, &amp; ad quem.</hi> For what is that which mortifieth but life?

<pb n="338" facs="tcp:3539:180"/>
the knowledge of the way; and the maine end and drift of euery inſtruction and action, is firſt to be weighed. What is the end of all writings, but to feare God and keepe his commandements? He that doth not this, knoweth nothing, and is but a dreamer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Feare God and keepe his commandements.</hi> This is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the concluſion, conſiſting of two precepts; the one whereof concerneth the inward man, or the affection; the other concerneth the outward man or the action; the one the heart, the other the life. Concerning the firſt; by <hi>feare</hi> is meant a reuerent awe of Gods maieſtie, proceeding from faith, whereby through the feeling of his loue, as well as the weight of his diſpleaſure, we are afraid to offend him. <hi>Feare</hi> is put for the whole worſhip of God, by the figure <hi>Synecdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che.</hi> It is the principall part of Gods worſhip, and keepeth all the other in their duties, all euill being committed where it is wanting. Therefore ſayth the Scripture, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway.</hi> It is the beginning of wiſedome, true and ſauing wiſedome, <hi>Prou.</hi> 14. 16. and the perfection of piety. For the better vnderſtanding hereof, I wil inſiſt a litle vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it.</p>
               <p>There are ſundry ſorts of feare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Dabolicall, Iam. <hi>2. 19.</hi> The diuels beleeue and tremble.</p>
               <p>Second<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Naturall.</hi> It is an affection or paſſion of the heart, whereby we feare not onely death or diſſolution, but dangers and euils that are deſtructiue of our good eſtate or welfare. This feare is by naturall inſtinct in all ſenſible creatures as well as in man, and in the godly as they are men, and in Chriſt as he was man, ſubiect to our infirmities, not to ſin. This feare of it ſelfe is not a ſinne, for Chriſt could not ſin, but in vs it is ſin, by reaſon of our corruption, becauſe we do not order it according to the law of God; but Chriſt in fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring death did alſo ſubmit himſelfe to the decree of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to the commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with all thine heart,</hi> &amp;c. So feare was ouercome of loue, or rightly ordered by loue. So the godly after the example of Chriſt, though they feare death, yet they humble themſelues to death and to all croſſes, becauſe the loue of God taketh away or extenuateth feare.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:3539:180"/>
Third, <hi>Worldly feare.</hi> This is the corruption of naturall feare, when as men do forſake or deny God and Chriſt, in what meaſure ſoeuer, that they might not loſe their goods, good name, pleaſures, preferments, &amp;c. The worldly, iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, zealous, deuout, are full of this feare. Their feare is great and continual; but it is a pernicious and damnable feare: and all that they feare, be they neuer ſo ſubtil and prouident, ſhal fall vpon them. <hi>Math.</hi> 10. 28. <hi>Feare not them which kill the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, &amp;c. Ioh.</hi> 12. 42. many beleeued on Chriſt, but durſt not confeſſe him, leſt they ſhould be put out of the Synagogue, and incurre the diſpleaſure of great ones. This was <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> his infirmity, <hi>Ioh</hi> 3. 2. The Princes, Prieſts and Phariſes were drunke with this feare, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11 48.</p>
               <p>Fourth, <hi>Seruile feare.</hi> It is proper to the wicked. For their conſcience being guilty of ſin, they feare the wrath of God, both temporall and eternall, <hi>Prou.</hi> 28. 1. <hi>The wicked flie, when no man purſueth. The wicked are like a raging ſea, Eſay</hi> 57. 20. It hath two effects: Firſt, it reſtraineth from groſſe crimes, and conſtraineth to outward duties, at leaſtwiſe it mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the extremities of ſinners, as doth alſo the ſword of the magiſtrates, which curbeth thoſe that are ſenſleſſe, or haue but a dogs conſcience. Hence the Poet ſayth:
<q>
                     <l>Oderunt peccare boni virtutis amore,</l>
                     <l>Oderunt peccare mali virtutis amore.</l>
                  </q>
When as <hi>Paul</hi> diſputed of righteouſneſſe, temperance, and the iudgement to come, <hi>Felix</hi> trembled, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 25. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it worketh hardnes of heart and deſperation in ſome, when it groweth to an height of wicked reſolution, all hope being vtterly quenched.</p>
               <p>Fifth, <hi>Filiall</hi> or ſonlike feare. This is proper to the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, who by this feare are moued to auoide ſinne and to liue godlily and righteouſly. It ariſeth from the knowledge of God and out ſelues, and from the feeling of his accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; loue of vs, wrought in our hearts by the holy Ghoſt. Of this <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Prou,</hi> 1, 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Pſal,</hi> 111. 10. <hi>The feare of the Lord is the beginning of wiſedome, a good vnderſtanding haue all they that do his commandements. Iob</hi> 28. 28. <hi>The feare of the Lord is wiſedome, and to depart from euill is vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:3539:181"/>
More plainely, this feare is thus begotten.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When a man heareth the Lawe, what is there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded and forbidden, the Holy-Ghoſt commeth and taketh away the vaile of naturall blindneſſe, and ſlumbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, cauſing him to ſee his ſinne, and to beholde the wrath of God vpon him euen to lay them both to his hard heart, whereupon feare troubleth the conſcience, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the hard heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When a men in this caſe heareth the Goſpel, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Ghoſt inlightneth his minde to vnderſtand, and beleeue, and to apply the promiſes to himſelfe, whereupon hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to feele quietneſſe, and peace of conſcience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more and more perſwaded that hee is beloued of God. Now on this perſwaſion ariſeth the loue of God for his loue, grace, and mercie in Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> On this loue ariſeth a new feare, namely, to diſpleaſe God ſo louing and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. 4. <hi>There is mercie with thee that thou mayeſt be feared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this filiall feare there be foure degrees expreſſed by the feare of children toward their parents, whereof there are foure degrees.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a childe loueth his parents, and flieth to them as his chiefe refuge, yet is he held in obedience with threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threatnings, and feare of the rodde. Secondly, partly by reaſon, partly by the rodde. Thirdly, leſſe by the rodde, and more by reaſon. Fourthly, by reaſon alone without the rodde. Now to apply this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, children haue a ſincere loue to their parents, and a generall diſpoſition to be conformable to them in al things; yet being left to themſelues, they are carried by their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh fancies and vaine deſires, both vnprofitable to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and to their parents for want of reaſon. Hence <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſayth, <hi>Follie groweth in the heart of a childe, but the rodde of correction fercheth it out.</hi> So the regenerate newly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted haue a ſincere, though weake loue of God, and a generall diſpoſition and right motions to obey God in all things; yet without the conſideration of Gods iuſtice, and feare of puniſhment, or rather corrections, they are apt to
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:3539:181"/>
be carried and ouercome with the luſts of the fleſh, allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world, and baites of Sathan. Therefore <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> ſayd; <hi>It is good for me that I haue beene in trouble.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11. 32. <hi>When we are iudged, we are chaſtened of the Lord, that we might not be condemned of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, parents inſtruct their children in what is to be done, and what to be eſchewed, and that with threatnings of puniſhment. And for feare of the rodde more then vpon conſideration of their owne good, they obey, becauſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is yet weake, and they haue but ſmal diſcerning of good and euill: So likewiſe, God teacheth vs what we ought to beleeue, what to doe to his glorie, and our owne good; with threatnings of temporall puniſhments, and croſſes of ſundry kindes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which we are held in awe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and contained in duty till we come to more perfection and diſcerning.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when a childe, by reaſon of age, is riper in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and reaſon, hee beginnes to know his parents, and his duty towards them, and what is for his owne good. Therefore he is held in obedience, not for feare of the rod, but inſtruction and exhortation preuaileth moſt. So wee, growing more perfect in the knowledge of God our father in Chriſt, what his loue hath beene towards vs, what hee hath done for vs, and will doe for vs, are mooued to obey him, not ſo much for feare of puniſhments, as by inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which we deſire, and exhortation vnto which wee yeelde with delight. And as faith and loue growe ſtronger, ſo doth the Lawe with the threatnings and curſes thereof growe the weaker. The Lawe is our Schoolemaſter in our nonage, but when the fulneſſe of yeares are come, wee are our owne inſtructers, and able to gouerne our ſelues by our owne reaſon.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, when the childe commeth to perfect reaſon and diſcretion, the feare of the rod goeth away. For, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing now the perfect knowledge of the loue, care, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of his father towards him, and alſo of his duety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him againe, he performeth obedience with willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, delight, ioyfulneſſe, fearing to diſpleaſe and offend him, and is aſhamed of childiſh follies: So wee growing
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:3539:182"/>
ſtronger in faith, and perfect men in Chriſt, doe willingly, cheerefully, and with delight worſhip and ſerue God, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to diſpleaſe him vpon conſideration of his greatneſſe, goodneſſe, mercy, and benefites towards vs, <hi>Galat,</hi> 3. 25. <hi>After that faith is come, wee are no longer vnder a Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſter,</hi> that is, the ceremonies and threatnings of the Law, childiſh rudiments and feares, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. <hi>Yee haue not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the ſpirit of bondage to feare againe, but the ſpirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c. He is called the ſpirit of bondage, when he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth weakely in vs, as in babes and younglings, whom the Lawe terrifieth from ſinne, and compelleth to obedience. He is called the ſpirit of adoption, when he worketh more ſtrongly in vs, or hath brought vs to a greater perfection of the degrees of faith, hope, loue, whereupon we are termed perfect men in Chriſt. The Magiſtrate is not terrible to the innocent, nor the rodde to the man of age, <hi>Romans</hi> 12. 3. <hi>Wilt thou be without feare of the power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doe well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thou ſhalt haue praiſe:</hi> So likewiſe, wilt thou be without feare of the curſe, of wrath, of hell? be ſtrong in faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hope, loue, and thou ſhalt delight, in God, in his word, Miniſters, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. His word ſhall be thy delight and joy. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>And keepe his Commandements.</hi> This is the effect of true feare, The roote is faith, the ſappe or iuyce is feare, the fruit is obedience. As is the inward man, ſo is the outward man, the heart is deceitfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the hypocrit cannot be hid, for the tree ſhall be knowne by his fruite, not by the ſight, or outward ſhew thereof, for the wilding maketh a fairer ſhew then many a good apple, but by the taſte. Who is he that in ſincerity keepeth the Commaundements? Hee that ſetteth God alway before his face. Moreouer, obedience is Legall, or Euangelicall: of the latter <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſpeaketh. For both the curſe, and rigorous exaction of the Lawe is remoued away from them that beleeue, which are the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous and free borne ſonnes of God. In theſe times there
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:3539:182"/>
are many maiſters, but few doers; therefore ſhall they receiue the greater condemnation. They would haue good done, ſo that they themſelues haue no hand in it. Here is no feare of God, but a deceitfull and wicked ſpirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For how much a man doth, ſo much he feareth. He that doth the commandements is true, the reſt are babblers. Neither haue there bene ſo many tongue-tied Chriſtians in times of Popery, as there ſhall be phantaſticall babblers and deceitfull Sataniſts in theſe laſt times, whoſe words and deeds are all falſhoods and lies: yet it is but that multitude of malignants, who wil either be ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, or Atheiſts, of a falſe religion, or of no religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For this is the whole dutie of man.</hi> A reaſon drawne from the end of creation and redemption, which is nothing elſe but to feare God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and keepe his commandements, which who ſo doth not, is a ſon of perdition. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>He hath choſen vs in Chriſt, that we ſhould be holy, and blameleſſe before him in loue. Tit.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>He gaue himſelfe for vs, that he might redeem vs from all iniquitie, and purifie vs vnto himſelfe, a peculiar people, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of good workes.</hi> By <hi>zeale</hi> he meaneth not the bare pulpit zeale, but deuotion. Many can counterfeit zeale, as vpon a ſtage, but when they are out of the pulpit, they are of a quite contrary faſhion, gallants, proud, ſtately. But the Frier ſhall riſe vp in iudgement againſt them. To conclude, to feare God and keep his commandements, is the adequate, obiect or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of the whole man inward &amp; outward. To this one thing muſt a man haue reſpect in euery thing. Hither muſt he refer all his ſtudies and labours, if he will be partaker of true feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie.

reſiſted by ſtrength; moſt iuſt, not to be corrupted with bribes; moſt wiſe, not to be blinded with cauils, <hi>Euery worke with euery ſecret thing.</hi> A declaration of the iudgement by the obiects, viz. things knowne, whether words or workes, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke or priuate; and things vnknowne, not onely done and ſpoken in ſecret, but the thoughts and imaginations of the heart, with the affections and diſpoſitions thereof. All which are amplified by a diuiſion in reſpect of their qualities, good or euill. As euery perſon ſince the creation till the laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation ſhall be ſummoned, and not one eſcape; ſo ſhall euery deed, word &amp; thought be iudged, not one ſhal eſcape. For the bookes ſhall be opened, and euery ſecret thing ſhall be reuealed, the booke of Gods omniſcience, and the booke of mans conſcience. That which is now forgotten as a thing in ſleepe, ſhall then be brought to remembrance as a thing to a man awaked, which is as freſh in memory, and more freſh then it was before. As the roote lying buried in the earth in Winter, ſheweth forth it ſelfe in the Spring; ſo ſhall all things now buried in forgetfulneſſe, be then made manifeſt vnto vs, as if they were layd before our eyes. All hearts ſhall be layd open, to the diſcouery and terror of the wicked, and to the manifeſtation of the godly, whoſe faith and truth ſhall now appeare, and theſe ſhall enter into euerlaſting reſt and ioy, but the other ſhall go into euerlaſting fire.</p>
