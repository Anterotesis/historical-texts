            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

You desired that nothing might be tumultuously attempted, but all things <hi>orderly</hi> reformed. You engaged your Honour to them that what Plate you found in places fit for Plate, the Treasury or the Buttery should remaine untouched, and most Societies engaged themselves by a solemne promise, that they would never give their consent that their Plate should be put to any other use then what was sutable and according to their oath, and the intention of the

You did not impose any <hi>Taxes</hi> upon the <hi>University,</hi> you did not go about to perswade them that <hi>Guns</hi> were <hi>Mathematicall Instruments,</hi> and therefore they might buy <hi>guns</hi> with that very <hi>money</hi> which was bequeathed and set apart for <hi>Mathematicall Instruments;</hi> you did not importune any Scholars to list themselves in your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, nor did you desire that <hi>Doctours</hi> would turne <hi>Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> or that any <hi>Commanders</hi> should be created <hi>Doctours,</hi> or <hi>boyes</hi> created <hi>Masters,</hi> lest there might be an <hi>Anarchy</hi> even in <hi>Convocation</hi> by such a Premeditated Confusion; and yet such counsells and practises have been suggested by some, that are none of the meanest Ranke.

            <p>The time would faile me, or at least the Readers patience, should I shew how the <hi>Socinians</hi> agree with the <hi>Noetians,</hi> who maintained, that there was but one person in the Godhead: with <hi>Macedonius,</hi> who denied the Holy Ghost to be a Person: with the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> concerning their deniall of the Image of God in <hi>Adam</hi> before his Fall, and their maintaining of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, and denyall of originall sinne since the Fall. In a word, how they agree with the <hi>Valentinians, Marcionites, Cerdoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Manichees, Apollinarists, Sabellius,</hi> the <hi>Donatists, Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cees, Papists, Anabaptists, Schwenckefeldians, Antinomians,</hi> and I know not how many more of the like stampe, hath beene shewen by others already, and the manifestation of their errors in the ensuing Treatise will sufficiently declare. I will passe over many things very observable, because I would willingly discourse at large of some later passages, and subtile inventions by which <hi>Socinianisme</hi> was introduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to forraine parts, and in some parts established by the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage and subscription of too many eminent wits, and great Scholars.

To this effect the Senate answered <hi>Valentines</hi> subtilties; I have put it close together, that I might not be tedious, and yet manifest upon what grounds this great wit was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by that grave judicious Senate.</p>
            <p>He had one question more, which he tooke much pride in, namely, <hi>Utrum Essentia concurrat in Trinitatem?</hi> to which the Senate answered, <hi>Essentia non concurrit ad distinguendas personas, nec tamen personae sine essentiâ sunt—Veteres ad Personas tantum nomen Trinitatis retulerunt—Quarum rerum dices esse</hi>

This is all the account that can be given of him for 35. yeares. I doe not heare of any great brags (though the <hi>Socinians</hi> doe make loud brags of him) of his Logique, Philosophy, Schoole-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, the learned tongues, onely he spent some two or three yeares in digesting his Uncles Notes, and then thought he had learning enough to <hi>contradict</hi> all the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councels,</hi> and undertooke to censure all the Reformed Churches, and to dispute with the greatest Scholars in the world: the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of his wit, besides the badnesse of his cause, did betray him to his adversaries, especially in the first prizes he

            <p>I should tyre out my Reader, if I should but reckon up the tricks and devices of this <hi>Faustus;</hi> for he pretended just as our Translator here, to be a Reformer of the Reformers, nay of the Reformation it selfe; he makes many glorious pretences in his booke called <hi>Solutio Scrupulorum.</hi> God (saith he) in this last Age intends to make many new discoveries, and to Reforme his Church more thorowly then ever. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> he confesses hath discovered truths enough to carry us to Heaven; <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> reformed the Church in matters of great weight and moment; they are justly to be extolled, because they have purged the Church from superstition and Idolatry, and caused all false worships

He hath written two other pestilent Books, in which he hath most cunningly vented his poyson, one is a booke which I never saw, <hi>De SS. Scripturae authoritate,</hi> which <hi>Calovius</hi> tels is one of his most subtile pieces, and seemes to be one of his first Essayes: <hi>Dominicus Lopez</hi> a Jesuit was so taken (or mistaken) with it, as to print it in the yeare, 1588. The other Pamphlet is a briefe discourse, <hi>De causâ ob quam creditur aut non creditur Evangelio Iesu Christi.</hi> In this second he speakes plainer then in the former, as they say who have read both, and they conceive that it was purposely put forth as a Commentary upon the other; for <hi>Socinus</hi> did speake more freely still every yeare then other, accordingly as hee saw his Discourses entertained and applauded by potent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettours; he did not put his name to his Commentary upon <hi>Iohn,</hi> till he saw how it would take; <hi>Libuit antequam nomen nostrum prodamus aliorum exigui hujus laboris nostri judicius cognoscere.

And <hi>Calovius</hi> saith, he did not put his name to it till whole Churches (Congregations I suppose he meanes) had subscribed to <hi>Socinus</hi> his Tenets, <hi>Calovius de Origine Theol. Soc.</hi> p. 19. He gained very much by his feigned modesty, he saith it was his hearty desire to bring all men to his opinion, yet such was his charity and modesty, that he would account them brethren, who coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him an Hereticke, and held his opinions to be pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, upon condition they did their best, to live in obedience to Christs precepts, and sought in a faire way to convince him by Scripture, <hi>Explic. cap. prim.

But though he pretended to be ruled by Scripture, it is most evident that all his Art was to withdraw men from hearkning to the plainest Texts of Scripture which doe contradict blinde car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

reason. He taught the world a new way of disputing in Divinity; we were wont to argue thus, Whatsoever God saith is true: but God saith thus and thus; <hi>ergo:</hi> but he taught us to prove, That such and such a proposition is true by the causes and proper effects first, or else saith he, it is absurd to thinke that God said any thing but truth, and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it can appeare by some demonstrative argument, that such a proposition is true, we must not pitch upon that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, as the minde of the holy Ghost in any Text of Scripture; what ever the words of the Text seeme to hold forth unto us, wee must goe looke out for some other sense which is agreeable to right Reason. <hi>Rationis lumen quo Deus nos donavit aperte ostendit non debere nec posse corporalem poenam quam unus debeat ab alio persolvi, idque etiam omnium gentium ac seculorum legibus ac consuetudinibus perpetuo &amp; maximo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensu comprobatum sit,</hi> as <hi>Socinus</hi> in his Tract <hi>Deservatore;</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how the light of Reason, the Laws, nay the Customes (and perchance some of them unreasonable) of Nations must over-rule God, so that God himselfe shall not be believed, if he doe not speake consonantly to my corrurpt reason, and our vaine Customes. It is cleare and evident, that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Socinus</hi> produces against Christs satisfaction, or our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, is a meere figment of his owne braine, for he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urges some colourable arguments, which have but a shew or shadow of reason. But I shall not instance in more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars now, because I desire to passe on and discover <hi>Socinus</hi> his subtilty, in scattering his errors abroad in <hi>Sarmatia, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sylvania, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore this shall suffice for the Rise of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianisme.</hi>

Besides, if there were a necessity of it that there must be a Church on earth, then Christs people would not be a free willing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and so there would be no spirituall Church, if they are not left at liberty, to accept or refuse Christ; sure that is a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Liberty,</hi> for a liberty to reject Christ, is a liberty to rebell.</p>
            <p>No man they say need inquire after the true Church, much lesse is it necessary that he should be a member of the true Church, <hi>Ubinam quaeso est scriptum Christum praecepisse ut unusquisque inquirat, &amp; norit quaenam sit vera Ecclesia?

            <p>They would not have any marks given of a true Church, I suppose for fear theirs should be discovered to be a false; but especially they deny, that the pure preaching of the word is a

note of the true Church, for with jeasting <hi>Pilate</hi> they aske, What is Truth? How shall it appeare, say they, that any Church preaches the saving Truth? Nay <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> both tell us, that there is no need of preaching: saving Truths are sufficiently manifested they say, and yet it seemes it is not sufficiently manifested to them, for they cannot tell what it is. They doe not see any great use of the Sacraments, they cannot believe that the sprinkling of water upon the body, should have any spirituall effects upon the soule; they cannot believe that our faith can bee strengthened, our pardon sealed, Christ and his benefits im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to us by eating of Bread, and drinking Wine. Now sure a Church that is without Ministers, Sacraments, markes or signes of a true Church, would be but an empty Titular Church, and to such a Church onely should <hi>Socinians</hi> be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Socinians</hi> are not to be suffered in any <hi>State,</hi> for they will not shew any obedience or respect to Magistrates; they say, they have no power to punish hainous offenders in time of peace, nor have they power to defend themselves or the people by the Sword, in time of Warre. But especially, they charge the Magistrates to beware how they meddle with good honest Hereticks, for all Hereticks in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> (who speake favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in their owne cause) are good pious men.

            <p>The Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> complains of his Grace, for he first protected <hi>Wederburn,</hi> when he fled from <hi>Scotland</hi> for fear of the Church-censures, because this <hi>Wederburn</hi> had poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned the young students in Divinity with <hi>Arminianisme</hi> in the new Colledge at Saint <hi>Andrews;</hi> his Grace made the same <hi>Wederburn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Dumblane,</hi> that so he might be Dean of the Kings Chappell, and vent all his <hi>Arminian</hi> er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in the <hi>Royall Chappell,</hi> in despight of all the <hi>Presbyteries.</hi>

Is there nothing written in Scripture concerning the eternall Deity of Christ? this is just indeed as <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, <hi>Nisi Deus homini placuerit, Deus non erit.</hi> This book was printed <note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Page</hi> his answer to that Treatise; and a little box of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes against some infectious passages in a Tract concerning Schisme.</note> in the year 1635.

I should doe him wrong if I should deny it; and though there are some passages which sound ill, yet I have charity enough to put a good construction upon most of them; but if a prudent Reader will but compare that book and the enlargement of it together, which was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the yeare 1639. he will find a great deale of altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that second Edition, or rather second book, for it is indeed another book. I shall give you a taste of some pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in the latter book which are not in the former, that you may see how much <hi>his Grace</hi> had altered his <hi>Religion</hi> in those 15. yeares.</p>
            <p>In the 76. Page he saith, the <hi>Mysteries of Faith doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict Reason, for Reason by her</hi> own light <hi>can discover how firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the principles of Religion are true. He doth not say</hi> reason <hi>by</hi> the <hi>light of Scripture,</hi> or by the <hi>light of the Spirit,</hi> but <hi>reason by her own light can discover how firmly the Principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are true.</hi> The <hi>Socinians</hi> lay this <hi>principle</hi> as their <hi>foundation,</hi> and keep so close to it that they reject the weightiest Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Christian faith; because Reason cannot discover them to be true by her <hi>own light,</hi> that is <hi>reason (ante Spiritus sancti illustrationem) before the illumination of the Holy Ghost,</hi> as they explain themselves in their <hi>Brevis Disquisitio, cap.</hi> 3. <hi>de Spiritu Sancto.</hi> And upon the same ground they doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Received interpretations of <hi>Scripture,</hi> because <hi>Reason</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:48402:25"/>
cannot discover how firmly they are true. Can the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> make it appeare by the light of Reason, that there shall be a <hi>Resurrection</hi> of these selfe same bodies; that there are three persons and one God: that the <hi>Word was</hi> made <hi>flesh;</hi> that <hi>God</hi> was made <hi>man;</hi> that Christ was born of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; that God justifies many thousands of the ungodly by the obedience and satisfaction of one man; must we not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve these Articles till Reason by her own light, without the illumination of the Holy Ghost, doth discover them to be true, and how firmly they are to be beleeved because true? for that I suppose the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> means, when he saith, Reason can discover how firmly these principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are true: Why doe the <hi>Socinians</hi> so often challenge us to be tryed by reason, by common sense, by the Judgement of all men, but because they conceive, Reason by her own light can discover how firmly the principles of religion are true? I know the <hi>Socinians</hi> doe talk much of the offices of Christ, but they receive nothing from the Scripture, concerning Christs offices, but what is as they say agreeable to Reason. They say likewise that it is necessary to salvation to know the promises of God, but they affirme that it will suffice, if a man be but acquainted with the substance of them, if he doth but hope for a better life after this, which even some Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens did without the knowledge of Christ or his Gospell. Reason by its own light did discover unto them that the good and great God had prepared eternall happinesse for our immortall soules: if this then be enough (as the <hi>Socinians</hi> say it is) to receive all things as Principles of Religion which Reason by her own light can discover to be true, (and how neer the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> comes to them, let the Reader judge) then the <hi>Philosophers,</hi> especially the <hi>Platonists,</hi> were in an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py condition, &amp; it will be lawfull for a man to cry out aloud, <hi>Sit anima mea cum Philosophis,</hi> and he shall never be thought an <hi>Atheist,</hi> nay shall passe for a good Christian.

               </note> saith, <hi>it is sufficient for a mans salvation to know what God hath commanded and forbidden; and if he erre in other points, he shall not be shut out of Heaven, for such errours as reason cannot by her own light discover to be errors.</hi> In like manner the <hi>Arch-Bishop,</hi> if he will be true to this Principle he hath laid down, must affirm that no man shal be da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned for rejecting any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Christian Faith, which reason by her own light cannot discover to be true, and so manifestly true that they ought to be firmly beleeved. If this be not <hi>Socinianisme</hi> in the highest, let the impartiall Reader judge. That the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> hath added this passage to his old book (perchance upon Master <hi>Chillingworths</hi> weighty inducements) will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear if the Reader be pleased to compare the 76. page of his new Book with the 21 page of his old Book.</p>
            <p>There is another suspicious passage in the 25. section of the <hi>Arch-Bishops</hi> Relation, he descants upon a place of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius,</hi> pag. 185. and 186. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> said, that in <hi>Peter</hi> were found even <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, The very <hi>Niceties,</hi> and <hi>exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctnesse</hi> of the Christian faith, saith the <hi>Arch-Bishop,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently gives this reason. For he professed the Godhead of the Sonne and of the Holy Ghost, pag. 186. How will the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> triumph when they heare the <hi>Primate</hi> of all <hi>England</hi> discoursing of the <hi>Godhead of Christ</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> as <hi>Niceties?</hi> I grant the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is most commonly used in an ill sense, but certainly <hi>Epiphanius</hi> used it here in a good sense, which the Arch-Bishop could not but see, and therefore used the word <hi>exactnesse,</hi> but to gratify the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:48402:26"/>
he puts in <hi>niceties,</hi> as if he had said, <hi>If you</hi> will be <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act,</hi> you may say that <hi>Christ is God,</hi> but <hi>that's but a nicety,</hi> somewhat <hi>more then needs,</hi> a man may be <hi>saved without it;</hi> for the <hi>Arminians</hi> say <hi>Athanasius</hi> was too bold to prefixe that Proud Preface before his Creed, Whosoever will be saved, &amp;c. and I make no doubt but his <hi>Grace</hi> was led much by them, he had such high thoughts of the <hi>Arminian</hi> conceits. The <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> doth acknowledge that in the old Latine Edition at <hi>Paris,</hi> pag. 497. it is thus translated, <hi>In hoc omnes Quaestiones <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>c Subtilitates Fidei inveniuntur;</hi> therefore hee might have said that all the mysteries of Faith were main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by <hi>Peter,</hi> though by the malice of <hi>Anti-spirituall</hi> men even the Godhead of the Holy Ghost, and such like Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were made Questions, or at best counted <hi>subtilties,</hi> and <hi>Niceties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover when the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> comes to speak of the <hi>proceeding</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> from the Sonne, he perswades the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to moderation, and then lets fall a sweet bit for the <hi>Socinians</hi> to feed upon, <hi>pag.</hi> 25. And <hi>Rome,</hi> saith he, in this particular should be more moderate, if it be but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this Article <hi>Filiog</hi> was added to the Creed by her self; and it is hard to adde and <hi>Anathematize</hi> too. The <hi>Socinians</hi> are apt enough to say that many of the Articles of our faith were framed at <hi>Rome,</hi> and it seemes his <hi>Grace</hi> would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme them in that opinion. This was added also to his new book, as will appeare, if you compare the 25. page of the new book and the 6. of the old. It is the common practice of men addicted to the <hi>Socinian</hi> way to speak very favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably in this point.</p>
            <p>These I call very suspitious passages, you must not expect Demonstrations in this point, for I know the Arch-Bishop was too wise to speak plain, though some of these passages <note place="margin">Arch-Bishops re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiion see pag. 309, 310, 311.</note> are plain enough. And I must professe that I doe not beleeve the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> ever intended to bring in all points of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianisme, Socinianisme,</hi> or <hi>Popery,</hi> but to pick out such points as might stand with the <hi>great Desig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I remember a story of reverend <hi>Amphilochius</hi> who had been an importunate suter to <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, that the <hi>Arians</hi> might not vent their blasphemies so freely against the Son of God, because he was as God, equall to his Father; but he could not obtaine his request; at last the good old man pitched upon this course, he comes to the palace of <hi>Theodosius</hi> the great, and salutes the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour with all due acknowledgements and accustomed reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, but as for <hi>Arcadius</hi> the son of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> who was created <hi>Co-emperour</hi> with his Father, <hi>Amphilochius</hi> passed him by without any respect or reverence at all, &amp; at last very familiarly stroakes the young Emperour upon the head, as if it had been some ordinary boy, and cryed, <hi>God save thee good child;</hi> At which the Emperour was extreamly enraged, and commanded them to turne <hi>Amphilochius</hi> out of doores: but this reverend man replyed, I beseech your Majesty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that if you are so much incensed against them who doe not honour your Son as they honour your self, what wil God the Father think of them who deny equall honour to <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> his Son, who is equall to his Father in nature and power? The Emperour who was wavering before, was much confirmed in his faith, by this seasonable Admonition, and presently forbad the <hi>Arians</hi> to dispute any more against the Godhead of Christ. You may read the story at large in <hi>Sozo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's</hi> Ecclesiasticall History. Now can we imagine that God the Father should take it lesse unkindly at the hands of the <hi>Socinians</hi> and all who admire their acute blasphemies, that they deny Jesus Christ to be God? and what punishment is fitter for such blasphemers, then that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>Professing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves wise, they should become fooles, and denying the Godhead of Christ, and the holy Ghost, they should be given over, not only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the power of godlinesse,</hi> but to deny that there is any God at all, <hi>because they did not like to retaine the knowledge of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Scriptures doe clearly shew that God the Father is no more God then Jesus Christ; But (say the <hi>Socinians)</hi> Jesus Christ is not God. Who sees not what conclusion will follow? <hi>ergo,</hi> if they said true, there would be no God at all.</p>

2. The <hi>Socinians</hi> doe not worship the same God with the <hi>Protestants;</hi> for we worship the Trinity in unity, that is, all the three Persons as one God, they say it is repugnant to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense, to hold that the three Persons are one and the same God, and therefore they may when they please leave it to common sense to determine whether there be any God at all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Socinians</hi> proceed in a destructive way; now destroy all Religion, and Atheisme will be embraced in stead of Religion. Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> hath cleared that point sufficiently, that <hi>Popery</hi> leads men to flat <note place="margin">

If the <hi>Pope</hi> have more Authority then God, then the conclusion will be easie: but according to the <hi>Romanists</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> hath more Authority then <hi>God,</hi> for the Church is above the <hi>Scripture,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> above the <hi>Church,</hi> he is the head of it: Let <hi>Papists</hi> though our enemies, frame the conclusion, They who maintaine the <hi>Popes</hi> infallibility, and yet cannot but see how he takes upon him to correct Gods own Institutions, will conclude that it is possible for God to be deceived, and then I am sure he is no God: and whether the <hi>Pope</hi> be God, let the <hi>Papists</hi> judge.</p>

The <hi>Anabaptists</hi> in the conference at <hi>Franckendale,</hi> maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that Infants were born without originall sinne, nay without the least spot of sinne, and therefore there was no need of their being washed in the Laver of Regeneration. The <hi>Socinians</hi> tell us that <hi>Originall sinne</hi> is a <hi>meere fable, a fancy.</hi> They that can goe no farther then English, may read a book of Free-will, Predestination, the first transgression; subscribed in the <hi>Epistle</hi> or <hi>Preface</hi> after this manner, <hi>Your brethren the Anabaptists falsly so called.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I beleeve the reason why the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> are complained of at this time, is because they are disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Magistrates; for it is commonly said that they have lately taken up Armes in rebellion against the King. I must confesse I have wondred often when I have heard of this dayly complaint, because I know that an <hi>Anabaptist</hi> doth not think it lawfull to be a <hi>Cutler,</hi> he thinks no sword ought to be made, because he conceives it unlawfull to use a sword. It is well known that the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> goe to Sea without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ordnance in their ships, that they travaile without any sword by their side: But if there be any fighting <hi>Anabaptist</hi> in these days, I suppose the <hi>English Socinians</hi> have taught the <hi>English Anabaptists</hi> to deny those principles in practise, which they maintain in dispute. Who are so <hi>active in all Counsells of warre at Oxford,</hi> as men that are shrewdly suspected for <hi>Socinianisme?</hi> If they deny this truth, their letters which are dayly intercepted will testify to their faces that they are not true to their own principles. Yet I commend the <hi>Chaplaines</hi> for <hi>their Designe,</hi> they would fain seise upon mens goods
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48402:31"/>
without force or violence, and therefore they tell the people that they ought not now under the Gospell to fight for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their goods; and if they could perswade the people to be <hi>Anabaptists</hi> in this point, then these <hi>Reverend Troopers</hi> and meek men of warre, might seise upon all the peoples goods, without force of Armes, and so be as true to their <hi>Racovian</hi> principles, as the <hi>Racovians</hi> themselves, they might <hi>robbe</hi> without <hi>weapons,</hi> a whole parish might be plundered by one <hi>Sermon</hi> as well as by <hi>two troopes,</hi> if the people were but throughly instructed in (or as we say, beaten to) this <hi>Conscientious slavery.</hi> All the spoile of a whole towne would lye no heavier upon the conscience of one of these Chaplaines, then a reare egge upon his stomack, for they are not ashamed to affirme that God hath not given his people any earthly goods or possessions under the Gospell, and therefore plundering is not robbing, they doe but take that from men which God never gave them Mr. <hi>Web<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly</hi> in the third chapter of his Treatise, tells us that God hath not given his people any earthly possessions now under the new Testament, they must not regard earth but look after heaven; this is they say the Court-Divinity; but sure the <hi>Rationall Lords</hi> that have such vast possessions should not be much taken with these raptures; if they be, it were good for the <hi>Lords</hi> to turne <hi>Chaplaines</hi> or step into a Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and let their own <hi>Chaplaines</hi> be <hi>Lords</hi> in their roome. How the <hi>Court-Chaplaines</hi> will maintain this Doctrine, and not be as <hi>Anti-Monarchicall</hi> as the very <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> I professe I know not, they might have done well to have excepted the Crown-lands; They were wont to preach at the Court, that the Subjects have nothing of their own, but by this doctrine they will leave the King no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his owne; sure they mean to have all to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. They must say that our King lives under the new Testament, they will grant him to be a Christian, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he must not regard earthly possessions, &amp;c. The King may perceive by this, what good friends he hath at Court. Nor doe they stick to question the Authority as well as the possessions or Revenues of Kings. The <hi>Anabaptists</hi> as

               <hi>Burroughes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bridge,</hi> and therefore it is strange the <hi>Papists</hi> should be counted the better Subjects.

If then any take up armes either without consent of Parliament, or on purpose to dissolve this present Parliament, they doe certainly take up armes against the King himselfe,</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Ferne</hi> says) <hi>because against the deliberate will of the King.</hi> If any <hi>Commissions</hi> then should be issued out in the <hi>Kings name</hi> to any persons to encourage them to take up Armes without the consent of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Parliament,</hi> such Commissions must be interpreted to proceed from the Kings <hi>suddaine will,</hi> which is not to be obeyed, saith Dr. <hi>Ferne,</hi> against the <hi>Kings Deliberate Will.</hi> They are not the Kings friends who advise him to send forth any Illegallcommands.</p>

                  <p>Answer to the Observation pag. 28. and pag. 37. he saith that by the happy temper of our government, Monarchy is so wisely ballanced, that as we are not exposed to the dangers which attend the Rule of the many, so we may avoid the inconveniences which might probably flow from the Atbitrary power of one.

This Respondent saith (as Dr. <hi>Fern</hi> doth) that <hi>Monarchy</hi> is not <hi>Gods ordinance,</hi> but then he tells the people their duty in plaine English, namely, that it is Gods ordinance that men should submit without Resistance, to that kind of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which they have by consent established, and therefore they must submit to this <hi>Coordinate Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,</hi> though it be the <hi>Ordinance of man for the Lords sake, as</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith. pag. 17. Here is Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission out of Conscience for the Lords sake, to all Legall Supremacy; what can be desired more, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they would make the King an Absolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch?

            <p>In the next place there is a complaint of <hi>Brownists,</hi> to which complaint I shall answer briefly, and yet fully.</p>
            <p>First, they are to be blamed who gave the first occasion <note place="margin">Brownists.</note> of this Rent: I know between 40. and 50. yeares agoe, there were some followers of <hi>Browne,</hi> but in the latter end of King <hi>James</hi> his reigne, the number of <hi>Brownists</hi> properly so called was much decreased, and it was a rare thing to meet with a <hi>Brownist;</hi> but when Bishop <hi>Land</hi> began to sit at stern, (and so he did a while even in <hi>Arch-Bishop Abbot</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:48402:36"/>
his time) then the number of <hi>Brownists</hi> began to encrease; the reason was, because ceremonies began to be urged upon the conscience with so much earnestnesse as if they had been necessary to salvation: and about 6. or 7. yeares since when <note place="margin">Where the eause of Schisme is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, there not he that separates but he that is the cause of separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique.</hi> Tract con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Schisme. <hi>pag.</hi> 4.</note> the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> was in his ruffe, and <hi>his Priests</hi> began to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate it, preaching for doctrines the commandements of men, and consequently <hi>worshipping God in vaine, Math.</hi> 15. 9. men of tender consciences (and those no weake ones neither) began to feare, that they should transgresse the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, by observing Traditions, <hi>Math.</hi> 15. 3. and conceived it vain, to joyne with them in worship, who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped God in vain.</p>
            <p>Many were prevailed with by this reason, but there were some of a moderate temper, who if they might have the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of their conscience, and not be forced to the use of any Ceremonies, would, and did, communicate even in Parish-Churches: But the <hi>Archbishop of Canterbury</hi> began to lay on greater burdens; <hi>Crucifixes</hi> must be set up at the East-end, that was too plain; next, the Communion-Table, to colour the Design, or, at least, to add varnish to it, must be advanced into an Altar, &amp; men must by a <hi>Tacit consent,</hi> (as we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at the Visitation of <hi>Merton College)</hi> expressesome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reverence, by bowing towards the East, the Altar, the Crucifixe, choose which you please, all if you will; but in no case must we be commanded to bow, &amp; yet we must be censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as disobedient, if we refuse to bow. This was interpreted by <hi>Rationall men</hi> an asking of our consent to bring in <hi>Popery:</hi> It was now high time to make <hi>Protestations</hi> that we would <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bow to East, nor Hoast, nor Altar,</hi> for if we held our peace we knew not what might come by <hi>Tacite consent.</hi> We were sure that our actions would speak aloud, and how <hi>tacite</hi> soever our consent was, it would be known to God &amp; our conscience. I will not take this faire Hint to tunne into a long story of what censures were passed upon my self or others, for our Protestation against this <hi>superstitious Innovation,</hi> but sure I am that by degrees there were so many <hi>Innovations</hi> both in point of Doctrine, and externall worship, that the Papists themselves thought those of greatest worth, learning and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48402:37"/>

But to proceed, If the guides of the Church would not endure so much as a Nominall Inconformity with Rome, if they and their Adherents looked so like, and preached so like them, that the Papists themselves took them for <hi>Romane Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques;</hi> no marvaile if the poore people cryed out that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was turned <hi>Babylon,</hi> and began to separate; for that is <note place="margin">

               <q>Neither is it alwayes of necessity Schismaticall to separate from the externall Communion of a Church, though wanting nothing necessary.

            <p n="3">3.

               </note> now this Author would have a Liturgie composed to let in Arianisme, or at least to humour the Arians, and sooth them up in their Heresie, as if the Articles of our Creed were but private fancies, and it concerned us more to please Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, then preserve our Creed. But there is a learned man of a more moderate opinion, and sounder judgement then either of the former, though they bee both very learned men, it is D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Featley,</hi> be pleased to heare him speake. <hi>There is nothing</hi> (saith he) <hi>in the Protestant Liturgie or Service which the Romanists do, or by their owne Rules can except at; The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, forme of Absolution, Prayers, Hymnes, Collects,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are either such as the Papists themselves use, or at least such as they dislike not;</hi> in his Annotations on <hi>Vertumnus Romanus,</hi> p. 16, 17. Now this is the very reason the <hi>Papists</hi> bragge so much, and why some that are not <hi>Brownists</hi> take offence at our <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy.</hi> And this <hi>learned Doctor</hi> tels us, that all who love the truth in sincerity, should with bended knees humbly desire that his <hi>Majesty, and the high Court of Parliament, would make some more certaine distinctive signe betweene Papists and Protestants, then monthly comming to Church, and taking the oathes of Allegiance and Supremacy.</hi> Now how this present Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy which the Papists like so well, can make any such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, let the prudent judge. I intend not to run out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the large question, about the necessity or Antiquity of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies; but let men that are so violent in this point consider;</p>
            <p n="1">1. How corrupt those Liturgies are which are voted for ancient. 2. How much Bishop <hi>Hall</hi> is forced to grant, when this question was agitated betweene him and the <hi>Smectym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

that a Set-forme may be imposed, yet those many cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loads of Arguments which are produced against <hi>this</hi> Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme are considerable. 5. It is confessed, that a Minister should be able to pray as well as preach, and should give and even devote himselfe to prayer, he should meditate and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy how to pray. 6.

When K. <hi>Iames</hi> was to advise Prince <hi>Henry</hi> how to pray, hee did not thinke it sufficient to leave him to the Church-Liturgy, or to any prayers composed by man; the onely Rule of Prayer, saith he, is the Lords Prayer: he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised him to study the Psalmes of <hi>David,</hi> because they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing composed by a King, hee might collect prayers out of them most sutable to his wants, and so he should be enabled to pray according to the occasion; he disswaded him from following the common ignorant sort, that <hi>prayes nothing but out of bookes,</hi> for that would breed an uncouth coldnesse in him towards God: hee bids him take heed that hee be not over-homely in his expressions, for that would breed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God: nay he counsels him farther, to pray <hi>as his heart moves him, pro re natâ,</hi> Reade his <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Mr. <hi>Newcomen</hi> in his learned <hi>Sermon</hi> hath shewen at large how punctuall his Grace was in observing the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites instructions for the alteration of our Religion.
