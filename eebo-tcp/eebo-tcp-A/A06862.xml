            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ought to bee the onely obiect of our desires and affections. Here hee hath deuested and stript our passions naked, and curiously delineated and depointed them to vs in their true co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and naturall deformity.

Here he hath brought home to our <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> and <hi>Iudgement,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:12284:6"/>
what power our soules haue ouer our bodies, and <hi>God</hi> ouer our soules, and that our bodies can expect no true tranquillity, or felicity here on Earth, except our soules doe first fetch it from <hi>Heauen,</hi> and deriue it from <hi>God.</hi> And here hee hath crowned <hi>Reason</hi> to be the <hi>Queene</hi> of our soules, and adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Vertue</hi> to bee no lesse then a <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse</hi> and Daughter of <hi>Heauen,</hi> and taught vs how tenderly and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously we ought to loue either, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour both of them, sith thereby, they will then infallibly prooue the two spirituall guides to conduct vs to true happinesse in this life, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bring vs to true felicity and glory in that to come.</p>
            <p>Which considered; As also that such is the vniuersall iniquity of our times, &amp; the generall deprauation and
<pb facs="tcp:12284:7"/>
corruption of our liues and manners, that through the darke cloudes of our humane <hi>Vanitie,</hi> and <hi>Ambition,</hi> we many times cannot see <hi>Reason</hi> for <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> nor permanent <hi>Felicitie,</hi> for tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory <hi>Delights,</hi> and <hi>Pleasures.</hi> And therefore that the World (or rather the Courts of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> which is the pride and glory thereof, very often vseth vs not as a <hi>Lady</hi> of <hi>Honour,</hi> but as a deboshed Strumpet or Courtisan; who many times stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleth vs, when shee makes greatest shew to embrace and kisse vs, and the which in that regard and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration I may pertinently and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly parallell to the <hi>Panther,</hi> whose skinne is faire, but his breath infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.

<pb facs="tcp:12284:7"/>
eternally desiring and wishing, that your Lordships prosperities and Honours may bee as infinite as your <hi>Vertues</hi> and <hi>Merits,</hi> and as immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, as you are mortall; I hope, and implore, that your <hi>Honour</hi> will please to pardon this my presumption, for proffering vp this poore <hi>Epistle</hi> to your rich consideration; and for being so ambitious to make this vnworthy translation of mine soare so high as to your Honourable protection and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage, in affixing, and placing your <hi>Noble</hi> name thereto, as a Stately <hi>Porch,</hi> or <hi>Front,</hi> to this rich and stately <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Vertue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not, but that I perfectly know that your <hi>Honour</hi> is plentifully and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly furnished with great variety of sweet preseruatiues, and sound, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubrious <hi>Antidotes,</hi> both against your
<pb facs="tcp:12284:8"/>
owne humane passions, as also against the frownes, and flatteries of the world: But yet I could giue no satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to my selfe, before I had giuen this Booke the desired (though not deserued) honour to kisse your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships hands; For the Transplantation thereof being mine, my <hi>Duty,</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice</hi> prompted mee that I must needes direct and consecrate it to your <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> as well by the right of a iust pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, as by the equity of a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding obligation, and therefore of a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary consequence.</p>
            <p>Againe, your <hi>Honour</hi> louing <hi>Vertue,</hi> and cherishing <hi>Philosophie,</hi> so tenderly and deerely in your selfe, I thought that others would be the sooner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and drawne thereto by the powerfull influence of your Example, and therefore, that the <hi>Dignity</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:12284:8"/>
               <hi>Lustre</hi> of your name, would serue as a sure pasport to make this Booke passe current, with the different affections, pallates, and censures of his Readers whom now it goes foorth to meete with. In which regard I hold it more presumption in me toward your <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> then neglect towards them, to make this your <hi>Epistle</hi> serue likewise for them, as being equally resolued, neither to court their fauours, nor to feare their reprehensions</p>
            <p>And heere before I shut vp this my <hi>Epistle</hi>; I beseech your <hi>Honour</hi> to bee pleased farther to vnderstand, that in this <hi>Translation</hi> I haue sometimes bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the letter, to giue to the sense, by adding voluptuousnesse to pleasure, shewe to apparance, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to euill, or the like; A liberty which I hold tolerable in a modest
<pb facs="tcp:12284:9"/>
Interpreter; As also I haue sometimes added griefe, to paine, although ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules and grounds of <hi>Logicke,</hi> I know that the last hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the body, and the first to the Soule: But I did it purposely to make it speake the more significant and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler <hi>English</hi>; because your Honour knowes so well, as no man better; that as other Languages, so <hi>English</hi> hath her peculiar Idioms, and proper phrases and Accents, which may but (yet in my poore opinion and Iudgement) ought not to be omitted or neglected.</p>
            <p>I will no farther vsurpe on your <hi>Lordships</hi> patience, but will leaue this Booke, to his fortune, and my selfe to your wonted Honourable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour; So wishing all encrease of Earthly happinesse, and heauenly fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicity

to your Honour, to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and most vertuous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesse, and to those sweet and Noble young Plants your Children. I will liue and dye in the resolution, euer to be found</p>

It were a happinesse if onely to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile the face of Man, were to couer all his <hi>Vanities,</hi> but when wee haue extended this vaile or courtaine ore all his body, I much feare there will yet remaine more to be concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and hidden, then that which wee haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy couered: For this imagination cannot suffer this constraint, and his desire which followes him with out-spred wings, findes no limmits but in her infinity.</p>
               <p>Man is composed of body, spirits, and soule; This animated body participates most of earth, as neerest to the place of his extraction, and to say truely, is a straying and a vagabond plant; The spirits participate most of the ayre,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:12284:14"/>
and serue as the meanes or <hi>medium</hi> to fasten, ioyne, and stay the soule, which falles from heauen into the body of men, as a ray or sparkle of the Diuinitie that comes to reside in an vnknowne place. Those spirits which dwell in the bloud are as little chaines to vnite and fasten the soule to the body, which comming to dissolue, from thence followes the entire dissolution of this compound. They partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate as partakers of these two contrary natures by the extremities; that which is most pure and subtill in them, is vnited to the superiour parts, as that which is grosser is vnited and fastned to the affluence of bloud; and these are they that so dexterously make affections to flye from one to the other subiect, which they embrace so strictly and deerely, and in this marriage is sworne communitie of goods and wealth, or rather of misery, they haue no longer but one and the same interest, and in this mixture, actions as passions distill from these different springs, by one onely and the selfe same pipe. They wedde themselues to contentions and quarrels, which are not easily appeased; but notwithstanding this discord, they maintaine themselues in their perpetuall warre; fearing nothing but peace, which is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:12284:15"/>
separation. Doth it not seeme to thee, O man, that thou much deseruest to bee lamented and pittied, sith in the composition of such diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent pieces, thou findest thy selfe engaged to calme the stormes and tempests which arise in thy breast, by the contrary motion of so many different passions. If thou wilt cast thine eyes vpon thy birth, thou shalt see, that after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing languished nine monthes in prison, fedd and nourished with the waters of rottennesse and corruption it selfe, thou commest into the world with cryes and teares for thy welcome, as if despight of thee, that <hi>Destiny</hi> had placed thee on Earth to sweat vnder the heauy yoke and burthen of a miserable slauery; but grieue not at thy teares, for they cannot be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to weepe at a more miserable condition then thine owne; because among other creatures thou art the most disgraced by nature; aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned naked on earth without couering, or Armes; swathed and bound, and without knowledge of any thing which is fit or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for thy necessities. And reason it selfe which befalls thee afterwards (as the onely aduantage whereof thou mayst vaunt and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) doth most commonly turne to thy shame and confusion, through vices and interiour dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:12284:15"/>
which it ingendreth in thee.</p>
               <p>Vnfortunate that thou art, those weapons which thou imployest to thy ruine, were giuen thee for thy conseruation. Me thinkes those barbarous Indians of <hi>Mexico</hi> doe singular well, who at the birth of their Children exhort them to suffer and endure; as if nature gaue no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prerogatiue to man then miserie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto hee is lincked and chained by the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and dutie of his condition. Let vs consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a little, that his first babling and pratling yeares are watred with nothing but with his teares; His infancy full of astonishment and feare, vnder the rod of his superiour; His riper yeares discouer him by all the parts of his body and soule, &amp; expose him to the inevitable snares of Loue; to the dangerous blowes of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and to the stormes and fury of all sorts of Passions. In his declining age, (as broken with so many cares, calamities, and labours,) hee flyes but with one wing, and goes coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting along the riuer to land more easily, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed and tormented (neuerthelesse) with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vnprofitable and superfluous thoughts. He is afflicted at the time present, grieved at the past, and in extreame care and trouble for that to come, as if he now beganne to liue; Hee
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:12284:16"/>
perceiues not his age but by his gray haires, and wrinkled forehead; and most commonly hath nothing remaining to testifie that he hath liued so great a number of yeeres, but an old withred age, which enclines him to a generall distaste of all fruits that his weake stomach can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not digest, which often imprints more wrinkles and furrowes in his minde then in his face; His body bending and bowing, which is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger supported but by the ayde and assistance of others, like an old building ruinous and vncouered in a thousand places; which by little and little seemes to end and destroy it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selfe. Whiles his fugitiue soule, (which meets nothing else in this fraile Vessell but that which is either sowre or vinowed,) seekes by all meanes to breake her alliance; and in the end retires, being infinitly weary to haue so long conducted and supported so decrepit and heauy a burthen, loden with all miseries, as the sincke and receptacle of all griefes and euils; which the influence of Heauen continually powreth downe vpon the face of Earth. Nothing so weake, and yet so proud; Let vs heare him speake, with what boldnesse doth he not praise his audacious front. His heart is puffe vp and swelld with glory, and many great bumbasted
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:12284:16"/>
Words, as if mounted on some Throne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee formes himselfe an imaginary Scepter, for a marke of his Soueraigne greatnes; Hee hath (saith he) the Dominion and Empire ouer all things created; He commands all beasts, The Sunne, Heauen, and Earth are but the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of his power; But wretched and proud as thou art, dost thou beleeue thou hast power to command where thou hast no right but in thy obedience? Thy inclinations, fortune, and mis-fortune, which droppe and destill on thy head through those celestiall pipes; doe they not constraine thee with blowes, and stripes to stoope and acknowledge their superintendency? Bow downe, bow downe thine eyes, for it is farre more proper and conuenient for thee, If not that after the custome of the <hi>Thracians,</hi> thou wilt shoot arrowes against Heauen, which will after returne and fall on thine owne head; And if for the aduantages and priuiledges of the body, thou wilt preferre thy selfe to all beasts, vouchsafe onely to enter in comparison with a few of them in particular: The courage of the Lyon, the strength of the Elephant, the swiftnesse of the Stagge, and the particular qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which are found in others, will prooue thee farre inferiour to them. Hauing thus wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:12284:17"/>
thine eyes vpon the garden knots of this world, now make a reflexion thereof in thy selfe, and if thy iudgment retaine any ayre of health, I know thou wilt say with me (or rather with wise <hi>Solomon) That man is nothing else but vanity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and within,</hi> in what forme and posture of vice so euer thou contemplate him: Then wee shall haue the assurance to say with the <hi>Philosophers, That laughter is proper to man,</hi> And proper indeed it is, according to the rules of <hi>Democritus,</hi> to laugh and mocke at his folly, as at his <hi>Vanity.</hi> That other Philosopher more pittifull then this, testified by his weeping, that hee had no other weapons then teares to defend the blowes, and wipe the wounds of so miserable a condition as ours; That if we enquire by what right he imposed on his companions, the burthen of so seuere a law, and so ponderous and pressing a yoke, I finde that hee is no way excusable but in this, that hee submitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to the same slauery and seruitude. The equality of our euils herein doth some way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate and cut off the iust subiect of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; For he which sees himselfe fettered to the fortune of an iron chaine, although thou haue inroled him among the number of thy slaues; yet hee may neuerthelesse vaunt to see
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:12284:17"/>
thee fight vnder the displayed Ensigne of the same misfortune; not like himselfe tyed to an iron chaine, but to one a little more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it may be to a chaine of gold; or peraduenture to a bracelet of haire, which cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuates thy heart and liberty vnder the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting lures of a young beauty; or else by the linkes of thy Ambition, which inseperably chaines thee to Fortune; sith all sorts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of liuing is but slauery, &amp; that the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Princes are farre heauier in their hands then the crookes of innocent Shepheards; That if no condition haue power to exempt and dispence thee from this slauery, what shall wee accuse? either the vice of a malicious nature, which at thy birth powred into thy breast so many miseries; or rather the defect of thy knowledge and iudgement, which enwrapped thee in so obscure and thicke a cloude, that this blindnesse makes thee euery moment stumble against the good which presents it selfe to thy eyes, as against euill; And that in this igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance thou art as a Ship abandoned to the fury of the waues, which the horrour of the night hath surprised in the middest of a storme and tempest, wherein in the feare of shipwrack, the surest places where his good fortune throwes
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:12284:18"/>
him, giues him no lesse astonishment, and feare then the most dangerous places. For the fauours of Nature should still put thee out of the suspition of her malignitie. What hath shee not done to preuent and remedy the discontent which may arise in thy heart, through an obiect so full of discontent; shee hath hid from thine eyes and sight, the most secret parts which giue the life and motion, as the weakest and most subiect to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the most vile, because they resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the inward part of the foulest beast of all: And indeede shee hath giuen thee eyes to see a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad onely, and to admire in the world, as in a Temple, the liuely images of the Diuinitie: But as for those things which are without vs, could she doe any thing better, or more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantagious to man, for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>solation of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny afflictions and griefes which incessantly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile him, then the habit or custome thereof, as a sweet potion which administreth sleepe, and easeth that part whereunto it is applied to operate his effect with more facilitie and lesse contradiction: This fauour (in my opinion) is not the least Present which she could giue him, For a habitude of suffering afflictions dulleth the first edge and point thereof, and hardneth
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:12284:18"/>
the body to the performance thereof: And surely if the griefe which wee very often feele and endure, had so much violence in the continuation, as in the first excesse thereof, the courage and strength of man would proue too weake so long to resist it: The Irons which were clapp'd on the hands and feete of the Philosopher, seem'd not so heauie to him the second day as the first, and when they tooke them from him, to make him swallow downe the poyson which was prepared for him, that very day and time hee saw his consolation to spring and arise from his griefe, and in the middest of his tortures and executioners the subiect of pleasure and ioy. Consider then if there remaine any thing to thy pride where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it should swell, and growe so great, but <hi>Vanity,</hi> and what weapons there are left thee to fight against thy misfortune, but onely Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which ought to make thee acknowledge that thou art indebted for thy slauery, but onely to thy selfe, because Nature hath assisted thee with her best power; and that for the rest shee referres it hee to ordaine according to the rules of thy sufficiencie: Or if thou wilt yet know the head spring and originall, from whence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise so many discontents in our life, it is because
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:12284:19"/>
men feare as Mortalls, and desire as Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls: They binde the liuing to the dead, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine with Humane: They will ingraft the head of a God vpon the body of a Hogge: so their desires which are deriued from this superiour part, giues no end to their impatiencie: Their feare in this soule and inferiour part, giues lesse truce to their true torment, and the one and the other draw for our misfortune an affliction and paine of that which is not, because they labour for the future as for the present, vpon the empty as vpon the full, and vpon the inanitie as the substance: Enterprises begun hold our mindes in suspence, those which are desperate, in sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; as if some byas which we haue to manage and turne those things which present them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to vs, could not meete but with cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of affliction and misery; and as if ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of our owne misfortune, wee deuance and runne before to meete it, and that it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for vs to gather a Rose, except by the prickle. Also griefe hath more Art to make vs feele it, then pleasure hath ioy to make vs tast it: A little affliction presseth vs farre more then an extreame contentment, and in reuoking to minde those things which time hath stolne from our eyes, it seemes that our memory is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:12284:19"/>
better edged by the sharpnesse of those things which we haue felt, then by the polishing of those things, which haue but as it were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed our vnderstanding. Our remembrance can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keepe firme, his foote slides, and as soone failes him. Our thoughts flye vpon things past, and stop not but at that which she findes sharpe, angry and difficult to digest: so the time past which afflicts vs, the present which troubleth vs, and the future which denounceth warre to our desires, or feares, doth hinder vs from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing any thing which is pure. <hi>Homer</hi> who put two Tunnes at the entry of <hi>Iupiters</hi> doore, of Good and Euill; ought to haue said, that the Good was reserued for the Gods, and the other remained in partage to men; or that <hi>Iupiter</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a louer of that which was good, as hee is the cause, was too couetous in his expenses, and with one hand was too prodigall in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out Euils vpon mankind. Good and Euill is in all things, and euery where intermixed so confusedly, and are so neere one to the other, that it is not in our weake power to marke the difference thereof, except by that place which doth neerest touch and concerne vs, which is that of griefe and sorrow; Which side so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wee bend or encline, it is still towards
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:12284:20"/>
that of misery. Consider the inconstancy and irresolution of thy desires; It is not in thine owne power to stay firme and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in one condition and qualitie: That if thy sensuall appetite could bee the Iudge and Arbitrator of her owne voluptuousnesse, and that shee were left to doe what shee pleased: I yet doubt that shee would still finde some thing to craue, or desire; For this hungry and insatiable desire, which carrieth her to that which is not; and the displeasing taste which is intermixt in the enioying thereof, makes vs presently weary thereof; Which is the reason, why the <hi>Wiseman</hi> craued nothing of GOD, but the effects of his diuine will, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring that which was truly proper and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for him: But as our desires are wauing and different, so our will is weake towards good or euill, and cannot absolutely beare it selfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the one and the other, without some bruse or hurt, deriued from the croude and confusion of our owne proper desires. We can difficultly agree with our selfe, and none with a firme and an assured heart can suggest any wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked act; but that his conscience repines and murmures within him: Shee cannot consent vnto crime, and thorowe so great a masse of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:12284:20"/>
flesh, she discouereth and accuseth her selfe for want of witnesses: Or if despight her power she cannot disclose it, yet shee then secretly scratcheth, and incessantly excruciateth her selfe: <hi>Constancie</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi> which the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher</hi> would lodge in the heart of the Wise man, as in a sacred Temple, is it so firme that it will neuer shake: No, it is a Vanity to thinke so. But as the world is but a perpetuall dance or brawle; so shee goes from one dance to another a little more languishing. And as in a sicke body the parts lesse offended with paine, and the contagion of the disease, are termed sound: so among this great troope of men the least vitious are termed vertuous; and wee terme that firme and constant, which moues not with so much swiftnesse and leuity as the rest. Qualities haue no title but in the comparison. Those Boates which seeme so great on the Riuer of <hi>Seine,</hi> are very little at Sea, and that resplendant vertue of the antient <hi>Philosophers,</hi> which diffuseth and darts forth so much brightnesse among vs, doth owe this aduantage to mens folly and ignorance: Shee will be found vitious, if shee submit her selfe to be sounded, and to suffer the last touch and triall, because the diuine wisedome hath bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:12284:21"/>
ours with <hi>Vanity, Weakenesse,</hi> and <hi>Folly:</hi> To giue it more Firmity, shee hath neede of a foundation, more solide then the heart of man; For as the fixed starres in their disposition and scituation, ought notwithstanding to obey the course &amp; motion of heauen; so constancie doth alwayes wheele and waue about, and despight her selfe, is obliged to the motion and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie of that whereunto it is tyed and fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The wisest doth nothing else but goe astray in all his actions; and if he strike vpon the point of constancie, it is most commonly by indirect meanes and wayes: Hee neuer aymes where he strikes: Hee resembleth those Muskatieres, who knowing their defect or fault, take their ayme higher or lower: And indeede if hee cannot vanquish his vices, hee transformeth himselfe as <hi>Achelous,</hi> to steale himselfe away out of the hands of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and so endeuoureth by conniuing to escape them. If he cannot choake the seede in his breast, he will enforce himselfe to change the fruites, by the graft of some different passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which hee will ingraft vpon the foote and twigge of this. In this manner hee will finde the meanes to lose the thought of displeasing remembrance, in the throng and crowde of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:12284:21"/>
some other thoughts and diuertisements, where she loseth her trace and steps, and insensibly erreth and strayeth from vs; To shew, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancie resounds aloude the iurisdiction which she hath in our hearts; yea in the most inward and secret motions of our soule, a small matter stayes vs, and a matter of smaller value doth divert vs: The externall shew and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of things deceiues vs; and doth touch vs as much, or more then truth it selfe. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of <hi>Ariadne,</hi> which wee know to be a fabulous inuention and fiction, doth almost draw teares from our eyes: The feigned action of a Tragedian, makes vs shake and tremble: And <hi>Caesars</hi> Roabe engendered more griefe, and sedition in the hearts of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> then his fresh and bloudie death could possibly doe.</p>

But I thinke we neede not apply any other tortures to make his experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and feelings confesse what they deeme thereof. To shut our mouth to our complaints, wee cannot exempt or shutte our breast from griefe, which as a furious fire, if it haue not vent by this sighing place, will growe the more enflam'd by its constraint: Hee will finde it as sharpe and irksome as a poore Country labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer: To be braue and proud in his words, will not any way diminish his sence thereof, for his vertue consisteth onely in his patience, but this salubrious and wholesome remedy neuer

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:12284:25"/>
treasure of his imagination, and hath reason to prise and value them at so high a rate, because all his riches is but a dreame, his felicities but in outward shewe and appearance, his preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues but in discourse, and hee himselfe is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but vanity and lyes. <hi>Chiron</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused the immortality which was offered him by the <hi>Gods,</hi> had learnt in the Schoole of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> the esteeme which he should make of so miserable and wretched a condition; wherein there is nothing immortall but vexation and labour, nor mortall, but contentment.

               <p>IT seemes to me (with some probability and apparance) that the number and multitude of the Senses might bee reduced to that of Feeling; for as the most delicate parts of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:12284:29"/>
body feele cold or heate, good or euill, more sensibly and liuely then the grosser: so Man touched with the same obiect, seemes to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly touched, because his body (in her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derest parts) receiues a feeling so delicate and subtile, that it loseth the name of feeling, and then we giue it another according to our fancy and opinion; although in effect, that proceeds from the disposition or delicatenesse of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible part; the which the more it is small, tender, and subtile, the more the feeling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes delicate and subtile. And indeede the same obiect which toucheth vs, if it be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ouer all the body, that wee terme feeling, or if hee meet with any part more liuely or animated, as in the superiour part of man, where nature hath lodged (as in a heauen) the Intelligences and the liuely formes and images of the Diuinity, the same obiect (I say) which in all the body could meete with none but with grosse parts, could not make, that the feeling should produce the effects of all the other Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, according to the part where he met, the which the more delicate it is, the more this feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth subtilise, &amp; in the end purifies it self so, that it seemes to be absolutely some other thing, and to haue no resemblance with that which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:12284:30"/>
the vulgar and popular voyce termes feeling: For if the obiect touch our tast, the sence and feeling is farre more subtill then when it touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our foote, hand, or any grosser part of the body: And therefore we will terme it no more feeling, but sauour or relish: If it be present it selfe to the nose, it subtilizeth it selfe the more: If to the hearing againe, more: If to the sight, it is with such a subtilty and purity, that it seemes to be an opinion meerely erroneous to call that sense feeling; because the obiect which strikes it, toucheth it not hard enough, or that it doth not hurt or offend so much &amp; so liuely in this part as in others. If neuerthelesse they will behold the <hi>Sunne</hi> with open eyes, this pricking burning paine which they feele in their eye, will bee enough sharpe and sensible to draw this confession from their tongue: For were it so that the obiect touched not our eye: but that this faculty of seeing depended whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of him, he would imagine all things of one and the same colour. If the feeling he receiues by the degrees of the obiect, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayed to him by the meanes and assistance of the ayre, made him not to obserue the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as if he alwayes looke through a greene or red glasse, all that is presented to him, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:12284:30"/>
of the same colour. That if this faculty were absolutely in vs, that the thing touched vs not, that the obiect had no right, but of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and reception, and not of action or emissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We should see all equally, without being more interested of one obiect then of another, because on toucheth vs not more then another. But our weake sight cannot support or suffer the darts and blowes of the Sunne, as of some Torch or simple light: Wee must then acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and confesse, that it is the obiect which toucheth it more or lesse, sith Nature hath ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated most wisely in vs, in giuing vs senses, which by their proper power and suggestion, would beare themselues to our ruine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion: Which would fall out if the effect that wee feele in our sight by the splendour of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> proceeded onely from the visible facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and not from the blowe or the touch of the <hi>Sunne.</hi> But all obiects which come to strike our sight in a reasonable distance, shee will be ioyfull in this meeting and feeling; shee sees and knowes this obiect as much as shee can, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the resemblance and conformity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene her, and that which toucheth her. <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> is nothing else but a feeling of the tune or sound in this part, the which accordingly more
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:12284:31"/>
or lesse, as it strikes our eare, makes the sound graue or harsh, sweet or displeasing: and if it strike vs too rudely and violently, it then not onely toucheth the eare, but all the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as when a great noyse or thunder makes all things tremble and shake vnder vs, and seemes to strike and astonish the foundations of houses by this suddaine and violent feeling. In a word, <hi>feeling</hi> is performed by the meanes of the ayre, which according to the power of the obiect, and as it is bent against vs, or such part of our body, makes either the <hi>visible,</hi> the <hi>sound,</hi> the <hi>smell,</hi> the <hi>tast,</hi> or the <hi>feeling,</hi> which is vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally ouer all the body, and which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people beleeue, doth onely merrit the name of feeling.

Doth she afford lesse cause? Againe, if all that we see, we sawe to be all of one sort; wee might then establish a certaine knowledge of our <hi>ignorance,</hi> and not of the thing, for the true Being and Essence thereof is in it selfe, and cannot discouer it selfe to our <hi>knowledge.

because our senses change and corrupt that which it brings vs from without; and that of things which by them comes into our fancies, is obscured in its passage: And as much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and distance, as there is betweene the thing, and the image and resemblance thereof: so much difference there is betweene the true reality of the thing, and that which wee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine wee know: yea, there is more; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man and his picture, there is some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance: but our senses being too weake to apprehend and comprehend that of <hi>truth,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so much as represent vs the image or figure thereof; because there is no comparison or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance betweene true and false: But our <hi>senses</hi> deceiue themselues, and contradict and contrary one the other: as in painting, the picture which in our eyes seemes a corporall statue, is found smooth and flat when we feele it. In these contrary apparances, the one must needes be true, and the other false, if rather they are not both false. The <hi>senses</hi> therefore do not carie the image of truth to common sense, sith the image ought still to be the resemblance of the thing.

It is true, that if thereon wee are prest, or called in question, wee cannot retire farther backe: we must fight, and it hazardeth the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire losse of <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences.</hi> In such a cause I know it is farre fitter to cast away our wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, then to vse them, and not to support so vniust a quarell, with so weake defences: I know not who shall be iudge hereof, and for my part I name and institute complesancie, to be <hi>Arbitrator</hi> of this difference.

               <p>It is true that in the <hi>Spagerycall Art,</hi> the more things are discharged from the grosse acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and qualities which enuiron them, the more they are made perfect, and essentiall; but it fares not with our <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> as with a <hi>Lymbecke</hi>; because the labour of our minde doth in nothing touch the true being of the thing; and the strongest stroake which hee can giue to apprehend it, is this first commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the Senses to the things which are neerest by their faculties, relation, harmony, measure, and true proportion which is betwixt them and their obiect by the interuention of Nature, so as then when one of the Senses hath carried to Common Sense the figure of his obiect, hee is so farre from being cleansed and purified by this Idea; or that hee commun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates more easily by the vertue of his being, that he is much the further off it. And as the

sides of an Angle the more they are continued the more they are distant one from the other: so the more those figures or Images are borne to the common sense, and are purified to make them capable and worthy of our vnderstanding, the more they estrange themselues from the obiect which they represent, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from his true being. Our thoughts runne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after obiects to embrace them, but in vaine, for they can ouertake nothing but shaddowes, through the ayd and assistance of their weake imaginations. It is a handfull of water, which shee will retaine and hold, and the more shee graspes fast her hand, the swifter it runnes out. But sith thoughts enioy nothing else of the thing then the Id<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If wee say there is so small reason to measure a right line by a crooked one, to know the true measure thereof, and that a square cannot bee measured by an Orbe or circle, although these lines and figures are of the same nature, and differ not but accidentally, is it possible that wee would so proudly mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and know the truth of things, by so false an instrument; and which hath so small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance

This faculty of sense which distills through all our body, is descended from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, and from our soule, as the light of the Sunne, which exposeth to our eyes the beauty, but not the Essence of things that enuiron vs: Sith Nature it selfe (according to <hi>Plato</hi>) is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but abstruse and Enigmaticall Poesie, as an ouer-vailed painting resplending, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite variety of false lights, thereby to giue vnto the apparence of our reasons, and the weakenesse of our coniectures more cause to admire the sacred and powerfull hand of our diuine Painter, God; who in all the corners of the world, and chiefely in man, hath engrauen the Caracters and Images of his Diuinity.</p>

               <p>OVr Knowledge is but a Vanity, his assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance hath no other foundation but doubt. There is nothing more weake or fraile then his principles: His beginnings are tender and childish, we must leade them by the hand: They had neede haue ayde and support from euery one, of a firme and vndoubted beliefe for want of valable reasons. If our faith did not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them, they could not subsist of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. Also none will permit that they be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined or proued, for the triall and quest will be of too dangerous a consequence: But there can be no principles, if the Diuinity haue not reuealed them, and therefore there is no sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or knowledge. All contrary presupposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath no lesse authority one then the other, If reason make not the difference. That which we will establish for reason, it must needes be
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:12284:35"/>
reason it selfe, and not our owne opinion. If it be lawfull for vs to enforme our selues of the Principles of Sciences; yea, of that which is held and maintained for the most certaine, and true by the common consent of all Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; wee shall finde that by their false pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppositions, they establish a knowledge of Truth: For they will measure materiall things by immateriall; although neuerthelesse they will haue the thing which measureth, of the same nature, with the thing measured: As their numbers which are not measured but by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and their lines, by lines: But the point is the principle of their measure; The point is nothing, they haue therefore no point of a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in their measure. There is nothing so op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite and distant, as being from not being: How will they then by the not being of the point, passe to the infallible and sure demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the true Being of the body? Can they giue any other assured foundation to the point, the line and the superficies, then their imagination? Let them not therefore attempt to measure imaginary things, sith they are of the same nature, and that there is nothing more different then reall Being to imaginarie, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the line to the pearch, and from the Angle to the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:12284:36"/>
Compasse. Let the Surueyer of Lands make vse of his pearch, to measure the earth: but let not the <hi>Astrologer</hi> forme in his head or minde any imaginary pearches to measure heauen; the distance of the planets, or the extent of the <hi>Zodiacke:</hi> Let our grosse sense, be the test of true and false, sith we haue none more sure: It will ill become vs to play the wise men aboue our senses and vnderstanding: Our wit can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forme nor frame any thing beyond it, which hath any foundation. This is to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take too much: They make vs confesse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight of our selues, that they are the expert Masters therein, and that we haue no right but in obedience, not in counsaile.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Mathematicians</hi> will not that the point measure the line, the line the superficies, nor the superficies the body: Why will they that this body framed in their imaginations, by the weauing and connexion of the point, the line and the superficies which is but imaginarie; be capable to measure a body physicall and reall, which admits nor knowes any point, line, or superficies: It is to establish Principles with too much tyrannie, not to giue leaue to examine them; Sith the knowledge which results there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is a bird of the same nest: and that he ought
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:12284:36"/>
to enforme himselfe of all, before he giue vs demonstrations for Articles of faith, which haue no other foundation, but doubt and incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty: For we most say with <hi>Epicure,</hi> that all things are compounded of points, sith it is the beginning, middle, and end of a line. But the line is to the Superficies, that which the point is to the line, and the superficies to the body, that which the line is to the superficies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this point being in all, and through all to the line, must likewise be in all, and throw all to to the body; For withdrawing by the power of the imagination (because this is solely the work of imagination) all the points which may meet, or can be imagined in the line; there will then remaine no more line, or that which remaines will haue no more points: But she cannot be diuided but by the points, therefore either the line shall bee nothing more; when the points shall be taken away, or she shall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuisible in her length, because she is not deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, but by the points which shall be no more. May I not then conclude of the absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of their Demonstrations and Principles: For the same that we haue done to the line, by withdrawing of the points, we may doe to the superficies by the substraction of lines, and to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:12284:37"/>
the body by the substraction of the superficies, and there will nothing remaine to vs but the point, which they themselues can neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse nor define, but by negation: But can there be found any thing in the body of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is nothing; and neuerthelesse is euery where, and composeth all, and that from thence we may inferre, that the <hi>Mathematician</hi> is nothing, nor yet his Art and Science: why then will we borrowe of imagination the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of so reall and true a Being, as the body which falls vnder our senses, sith there is no conformity nor resemblance of the measure, to the thing measured.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Astrologers</hi> haue more reason to forme <hi>Epicicles</hi> to the Sunne and Moone: and because they cannot attaine thereto, they are constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to lend a body, and a forme to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions. If they cannot approach the Sunne, they will approach the Sunne neere to them, to forme him materiall springs and lockes, to the end that they may manage him according to their owne pleasures and fashion, and that he may not escape from them, and as well they shall not be beleeued: But what, doth it seeme to them, or doe they thinke that the diuine prouidence, who ruleth and limiteth the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:12284:37"/>
of all things, could doe nothing without them, and that Heauen, if it were not hung fast by her Poles, and the Sunne and Moone linked and nayled fast to their Heauen, that they would fall on our heads: That the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets could not moue, because euery moment without rule &amp; order they met and contended, and troubled themselues in their course and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolution: As if I say, this diuine prouidence had not established so much, but a fairer order aboue, among these celestiall bodies, (where in outward shew &amp; apparence he is more pleased, because hee delights in cleannesse and purity) then hee hath done belowe here among the elements, which take not the hand and place one of the other: but euery one keepes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in his proper place and station ordained to him. Earth mounts not vp to the Region of fire, nor the ayre throwes her selfe not downe into that of water, but according to their vsuall custome &amp; commerce, and the harmony which Nature hath contracted betweene them, as is seene in the mixture of compounds: which of their discordant accords and agreements, yeeld so sweet a Harmony and Diapazon: But sith this wise Mother of the world is so carefull to conserue peace among beasts, who deuoure
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:12284:38"/>
not one the other: yea, likewise among corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible bodies, although age hauing destroyed them, she can easily make &amp; propriate others of the same clay, &amp; of the same matter which shee moulds, and workes continually in her hands, by a farre stronger consideration shee hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to entertaine and maintaine: a perfect peace, rule, order, and measure, among those caelestiall bodies, and that it were not in her power to establish (if they were entermixed and confused) in the order which was prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to them from their beginning, by him who neuer had, nor shall haue end or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. They can, and are well conseru'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, and without their <hi>Epicicles,</hi> and hee among them who can erect his eyes in the contemplation of this great body in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the earth, of that which wee possesse and enioy, will assuredly iudge that Nature vseth vs as children, because it giues vs nothing but trifles of small or no value, yea, which are not worth the losing: in regard of those which we want and enioy no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

&amp; consequently, because one of these two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, is necessarily false; if they are not both false.

But humane iudgment cannot giue more weight and beliefe to one Demonstration, then to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: sith by the chaine, and dependance of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent propositions, you are directly led to prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, the which if you haue not the liberty to contradict; complaine not afterwards, to see so many, and so great absurdities, and such resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of contraries, &amp; likewise of so true appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, if we call that trueth, which restraines, &amp; hinders vs from passing beyond the necessary consequence of a proposition; But for my part, I am not of this opinion, I call that trueth, which is immoueable, and which hath no other rest, or refuge, but in the bosom of God, it is the proper place wher it reposeth, she is not of our placing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or disposing: She doth euery where present, &amp; profer her selfe vnto vs; but a mortall hand is not capable to retaine, or hold her.

If the Sophister, and he which controules all, knew as well how to laugh at himselfe, as at others, I should thinke his side, and party very strong: But to beleeue outward shewes, or apparances, it is indeed too great a simplicitie. The libertie of the minde ought not to ingage it selfe, except in those things wherein wee are not permitted to rest doubtfull; as in our <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> where we ought to hold, and retaine our written lesson, from that Wise, Holy, and Sacred Word of God; and not that so weake an Instrument as our humane reason, should intermeddle to enquire, or iudge; for whosoeuer contesteth, doeth not freely consent. But it is not so with <hi>Sciences,</hi> for if reason it selfe be not their foundation, we are not bound to passe farther in beleeuing them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that which is receiued by the opinion, and common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of many, must not here passe, as the forme of a reuokeable law, and if all men beleeue it, yet I would the more doubt it; their ignorance may haue some reputation with themselues, but not with others. From the cradle, we say,

that one and one are two: but wee must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the greatest reason of this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, is, because it is so held &amp; receiued among vs: for this Tenent holdes more of custome then of reason, and of opinion then truth; as we will more amply declare hereafter. It is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this foundation that <hi>Plato</hi> by the meanes of numbers, eleuates and caries his thoughts euen into the very bosome of <hi>God,</hi> seeming to serue himselfe hereof, as of a ladder to mount and vnite himselfe to this diuine knowledge.

And if we will condemne them according to the mercy of <hi>Sense,</hi> wee shall finde that Beasts suffer the same iurisdiction that wee doe, and that by the priuiledge of their sence wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not refuse them, the liberty to leaue or chuse, to take or refuse, to absolue or condemne, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the quality of <hi>good</hi> or <hi>euill,</hi> which presents its selfe to their imagination; by the particular fauour, and recommendation of their senses. For they haue learnt in their Schoole, that fire is hot, and they know it as well as we, who can yeeld no other reason, and cannot passe beyond the knowledge of this cause, aboue that which our experience, and Sense hath taught vs. The <hi>Ape</hi> will beware, and not approach too neere the fire, except the fagot be small, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, because of the discourse he holds in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, to auoide the like disaster, wherein he was formerly fallen.

When reason failes vs, we then imploy expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and the conference of euents, which most commonly produceth a bad conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, in regard they are still different, and variable: But this knowledge which causeth the <hi>Serpent</hi> without premeditation, to take that which is proper for him; either it is giuen, and infused to him by Nature, or it is done by a simple, and primary apprehension, which at first sight, discouereth him the trueth of the obiect.

If hee who by the iudgement hee makes of man in generall, would yet vse him with more contempt (so as it were equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) we then should haue nothing to gaine-say, prouided I say, That a Stranger which comes not to vs, but by his writings, and by that which is best in him, could not hope for more particular fauour, and applause then another among vs. But because it seemes that the glory which wee giue, and conferre to this last, diminish our owne: we will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore giue it farre cheaper, and for lesse interest

As long as Art aad learning is found in him, it shall still be to him a reproach of incertainty and ignorance. O that the life of man is farre different from his Writings, yea from himselfe! Our Pen rules and gouernes the thoughts which we commit to paper, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancie, those which wee permit to runne vpon the waues of our imagination: but whosoeuer could see them in grosse, and in their ordinary demarch and pace, shall finde little lesse cause to laugh at the vanity and inanity of one then the other, and at the fantasie of a <hi>Philosopher,</hi> then wee doe at the May-games of a childe: For despight of the order and polishing, which we vse in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, and connexion of our discourse, wee cannot for the most part auoide or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, that our reasons doe not contend and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile one the other, as well as their effects. In this small and short discourse, there are contradictions enough, but it matters not: Reason contradicts her selfe; and my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can turne it selfe no way whatsoeuer,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:12284:50"/>
that shee meete not with some of her owne party, and who will maintaine her in the point of her reasons, so much <hi>humane know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> hath of auerse and different faces. Wee incessantly turne round about obiects, and we can neither seize nor apprehend them, but by strange qualities, and outward apparances. But the apparance and the subiect it selfe, are different things. If then our iudgement stop onely to apparances or outward shewes, hee iudgeth of some thing which is not the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect. What certaintie in this incertaintie? What light amidst so much darknesse? What truth (I say) can result or arriue to vs, if the matter or subiect, according to the opinion of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> be in perpetuall changes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolution? If wee haue no participation of a true being: If all <hi>humane nature</hi> be still in the midst betweene <hi>birth</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent betwixt the past and the future; and if it be true, that Reason receiues nothing, but which is brought him from without, by the meanes and interuention of the senses, which cast great mists betweene the true and false, and betweene the obiect and the thought; She can very difficultly come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Truth, a-thwart so many cloudes
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:12284:50"/>
of <hi>lusts, Loues, feares,</hi> and <hi>hopes</hi>; and of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of false formes, which frequently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise from our body, to ouer-vaile and shadow our minde, and to trouble the power of our imagination: That if our <hi>soule</hi> doe not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strange her selfe from the contagion of the body, and from his fantasies and frenzies; it is in vaine that she attempt to reason or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult so certainly, without the assistance of particular grace, or speciall priuiledge which may descend to him from aboue. She ought to know that shee is shut vp, and confined in our body, as in a strange place. True it is, shee beares about her this diuine desire of <hi>knowledge</hi>; but it is a coyne or money, which doth nothing else but vnprofitably load and charge her, because it hath no currant course in that Country where she is. The <hi>senses</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not her language, so that vnder their pleasure and mercy, shee is enforced and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to content her selfe, with what por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it pleaseth them to giue her. Her mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels are cut: if shee thinke to escape this slaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, by the flight of her thoughts, and the labour of a long meditation, shee but drawes her chaine after her, and despight of her shrill resounding, findes her selfe so

weake without their assistance, that for the time which she is retain'd here in prison, she may say, shee is wholly indebted for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of her faculties, and most free actions, to the fauour, good disposition, and sweet vsage of our senses. They are indeede our seruants and our slaues; but yet they haue more power and authority in the house then our selues. Wee are Masters by the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which they voluntarily yeeld vs, and not by the command which we haue ouer them. Our power lasteth but whiles they please, and if any passion throwe them into confusion, our soule then retireth into her selfe, all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and fearefull, vntill the disorder be appeased, and pacified in her Estate, and that euery one of our <hi>senses</hi> bee re-established in his Kingdome.</p>
               <p>And how then, after so exact and perfect a knowledge of the <hi>weakenesse, vanity,</hi> and other imperfections of man; shall wee yet haue the courage to place him in the ranke of the <hi>Gods,</hi> according to the opinion of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> when he spake of <hi>Dion,</hi> whom hee said to be as vertuous as a <hi>God?</hi> yea, and by a higher straine and ladder; If wee will enter into the schoole of <hi>Seneca</hi>; Then saith he, When a wise

man by the degrees of <hi>Reason,</hi> hath attained so high, that hee hath gotten an absolute power, and command ouer his passions: hee hath done that thing which God cannot doe; because it is beyond all passions. Is it not from mans impotencie, to deriue a power more <hi>soueraigne</hi> then that of <hi>God:</hi> For, for man to glory in his actions, he doth a thing which <hi>God</hi> cannot doe: Is not this a faire conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of our reasons! O <hi>vanity</hi> of man, <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of <hi>Science</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> the more wee aduance, the more wee still haue to aduance. Can we then beleeue, that this reason which so puffes vp our heart, and fills and enflames our courage, hath any thing permanent or subsistent in it, but pride and vaine glorious outward apparance? Shee knowes not how to fight, but faignedly. Our reasons impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously follow their point; but meeting with a stronger they conniue, they escape; and commonly those which are Diametrally contrary, and so affirmatiuely maintained, that they seeme to partake and engage in their quarell the authority of the greatest wits, are yet Diametrally false, and as much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the <hi>centre</hi> of the truth, one as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               <p>This abuse teacheth vs, that to know well how to keepe, and maintaine the opinion of others, is the end of our <hi>knowledge.</hi> That <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher</hi> seeking in the secrets of <hi>Nature,</hi> the Being and Essence of things, (notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any liuely conceptions and true appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions, wherewith his soule shall be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed,) hee shall be likewise fed with many false and absurd ones, the which wee confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly embrace and espouse, with an equall passion, through the reputation which they haue purchased and gotten among vs, vpon the pasport of a popular Iudgement. Good money should not authorise the course and passage of false; nor for bad opinions to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne those which deserue to be approued and applauded. It is one and the same fault, absolutely to praise, or to condemne all things in a man; and I hold it cannot bee performed with <hi>Iustice.</hi> Those who haue sought the truth before vs, should bee our guides, but not our Masters, in such manner, that they rather teach vs how to beleeue, then dispute. But this aduantage and profit which we receiue by them, should be but as a sparkle

to enkindle and enflame our courage, with a generous desire of enioying this truth. All the world seeke her; their wayes are open, and free to all those who will approach her. Some one thinke they haue giuen her some assault: Others stay halfe way, and yet there will be place found for our reasons. It is the Butte whereat all ayme, but none can strike; it is too farre distant from vs: And I beleeue that as many powers as wee employ to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thereto, they are so many arrowes dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp against this diuine <hi>Sunne,</hi> which are scattered and lost in the cloudes of our weake and vaine imaginations. Neuerthelesse, to beleeue the onely report of others, and to content our selues of their proofes; I hold it better to essay, and bee assured of our owne weakenesse, then to relie vpon the reputation and authority of other men. Our actions are of so small importance and consequence, that if in their losse they yet enwrappe that of our time, we should lesse grieue to employ them in this curious research, then yet to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume them vnprofitably in the vanitie of things, where wee feele our selues caried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the streame and current of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; I meane by the errour of opinion. Our

Being curious to know, we doe as those who goe to seeke fire in their neighbours houses; and hauing found some, we stay there to heat our selues, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more thinking to bring home any to our owne. Wee stop at the knowledge of others, and forget that which Nature hath infused in vs, of the most sucsseptible of this flame; and it may be, which may produce a more shining fire, then that of whom wee haue borrowed the first sparkes. This vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary tyrannie of the <hi>Pythagoriciens</hi> cannot please me, who for all reasons, and satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their doubts, make answere, that their Master held it so. If <hi>Pythagoras</hi> had beene so Religious in the Rules, and Principles of his Master, so many excellent secrets, had remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned buried in the bosome of Nature, or at least, had neuer beene discouered to him. But because there are found so few well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned soules, that we ought to assure our selues, by their proper comportment, and conduction; and that without the vse of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinions, can follow a firme, and sollid way, it is more fit to commit them to tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not to lose the sight of them, and to stay them against their nature, by feare of the

rod, vnder the priuiledge, and authority of their Superiour. How many are there dayly seene, who relying vpon the onely Mercury of their Wit, flying the common way, doe ouerflow in the licentiousnesse of their owne opinions, and afterwards finde nothing firme, or stable: no more in their manners, then in their imaginations: and so of a <hi>Wit,</hi> too vaine, and subtile to their owne preiudice, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to erraise, and eleuate themselues beyond the vulgar, in the research, and knowledge of the most curious things, they sincke, and drowne themselues in the misprision, and not knowing of themselues: and with the thrid of their owne presumption, doe weaue out their owne ineuitable losse, and ruine: This confusion of true, and false, and the perpetuall disorder, where their thoughts are engaged in a new <hi>Philosophie,</hi> without end, middle, or beginning, may suffice of it selfe to replace them (as by force) in the right way, or at least to rectifie; and make them see, and know their erring, and straying; if they loue not to be absolutely blind, yea, to pull out their owne eyes, not to be obliged, to see the raies of this diuine Sunne of Iustice, no more then they doe the shadowes of their owne grosse
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:12284:55"/>
ignorance: Let vs farther beleeue, that in denying this diuine Iustice, it is a reasonable way, and meanes to decline it. Mad-men that you are; what recusation can you giue to that Iudge, which makes you to flie from his Iurisdiction. If you see that all things of Nature, vnder one same Law, reuerence one, and the same Lord; how can you then escape him? If not, that your Soule being infected with so mortall a poyson, vnites, and fastens her selfe to the corruption of the body, and will follow the course of mortall things, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then aspire to the place of her birth. The liberty they beleeue they haue to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, and sound the trueth of <hi>Religion,</hi> by the point of their weake, and vnprofitable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, is the head spring of so preiudiciall a contagion, imagining with themselues, that it is but a piece of mens inuention, requisite, and proper to linke, and chaine together their societie. But it is not with <hi>Religion,</hi> as with Sciences, for they haue very opposite, and different proofes; for Science, (or Learning) is the subiect, and hand-maid of Reason, and humane reason must be the hand-maid of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, not but that she some times essayeth to set, and place vs aloft on her shoulders, that

               <p>MAns iudgement hath else-where enough to imploy it selfe, without he interest, or ingage himselfe herein; let him looke round about him, and he shall finde nothing but corruption, both within, and without, if hee desire to remarke, or remedy it. Which comes to passe by the meanes of false opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who hauing vsurped the <hi>Empire</hi> of our reason, haue banished the pleasures, which a sweete Nature presents vs, to lodge strange lusts, and desires insteed thereof, which haue nothing in themselues but shadowes, smoake, and vaine apparitions; resembling those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne forces, who hauing violently possessed themselues of a Citie, doe exclude, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the naturall inhabitants thereof.

what was in the bladder which they caried in their Ship; as soone as their rash curiosity had opened, and giuen way to the windes there enclosed, they presently disturb'd the calme Empire of the Sea, with so many stormes and tempests, that <hi>Vlysses</hi> himselfe sawe himselfe within two fingers of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke, and of death. Right so, man retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning enclosed, and pent vp in his <hi>imagination,</hi> the seede of so many vanities, cannot refraine from disclosing them; and giuing way to his errours, hath risen vp so furious a tempest, that the <hi>Wiseman</hi> himselfe, although innocent, can difficultly saue his Ship from the fury of the waues, and from the dangerous Sea Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, which of all sides appeare, and approach to swallow him vp.

It is that which we call paine, which by the inequalitie of her sence, and feeling, sufficiently witnesseth, that wee foment, and cherish it beyond her worth, and naturall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that at the very entrance of our <hi>Euills,</hi> and <hi>Afflictions,</hi> it remaines in vs to giue them what composition we please.</p>
               <p>Some haue beene more afflicted at the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:12284:67"/>
feare of paine, then of paine it selfe, and more tormented at its absence, then presence. All things are proportioned; if the afflictions which assaile vs bee violent, they are not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, nor permanent; and difficultlie can wee feele it, because the suddainenesse takes away the sence thereof: if it bee moderate, it is the easier to bee supported; if <hi>Pouertie, Griefe, Death,</hi> bee such as they are figured, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>painted vs, why then did <hi>Socrates</hi> laugh at <hi>Pouertie,</hi> mocke at <hi>Griefe,</hi> and contemne <hi>Death?</hi> were the senses of his body insensible? No, but he iudged otherwise thereof then we doe, hee lodged them in himselfe, according to their iust esteeme, and valew, and not as we doe, who know them not, but by the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full markes, and countenance of those who haue approoued, and experienced them; and who had prepared such faint courages to withstand them, that it was easie enough for <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Griefe</hi> to make themselues victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously felt, and feared: The feare of some who are carried to their execution, hath it not made them in a manner, to meete with death halfe way; the sight of the preparatiues of death, doe as it were, make death flie into his brest, and depriue him of his sense, and life,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:12284:68"/>
before hee haue felt any of the torments that are prepared for him: Hee who on the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold attended the blow of the Sword to cut off his Head, being but touched with a wet Table-napkin, his very apprehension, and feare made him to deuance Death, and so died immediately. And then let vs take as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance from such spies, to know whence it is; but farre was that <hi>Philosopher,</hi> from this vniust, and base feare, who at the very point, and instant that the Executioner was to giue him the blow of Death, being demanded by one of his friendes whereon hee thought, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that hee imployed all the powers of his minde, to consider how his Soule would separate her selfe from his body. If many like him, had beene sent to know, and affront Death, it may bee they would depaint him to vs not so obscure, as Sleepe, and Slumber. Death did not much preiudice him, he would silently treate, and reason with himselfe till the end, and till the very last-gaspe, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of his life, he would manage the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, which Nature had giuen him: so wee iudge of all things, either by the sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances, or euents of things, which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues haue nothing sure, or certaine. Our

                  <hi>Imaginations,</hi> thoughts, and manners may well bee corrupted; sith this contagion hath not excused, nor spared <hi>Vertue</hi> her selfe, which could not comport her selfe so well, passing through our hands, but that shee felt our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Wee more willingly embrace her for the glory which shee drawes after her, as her shadow, then for her selfe. The <hi>Markes,</hi> and <hi>Armes,</hi> whereby shee makes her selfe seene, knowne, yea desired, doe they not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently declare, and testifie that they are the fruites of our opinion: whosoeuer should see her alone by her selfe, all naked, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Artifice,</hi> although indeede, this bee her riches<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A Soule must be wonderfully powerfull, not to affect, and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish her, but because she is amiable, and makes as little esteeme of contempt, as of glory: for if wee performe any vertuous action, it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the content which wee hope for, to sow, and spread our name in many mouthes, then for our owne satisfaction. So wee are pleasing to the World, we care not what we are within our selues: the World is extreame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged, and bound to vs, to affect, and cherish her more then we do our selues: some

are seene in the front of a <hi>Battaile,</hi> who feele themselues more animated, and egged on by their owne <hi>Vanitie,</hi> then by their courage in the execution of a generous exploite; so as it seemes, that in these our times, there is nothing so cleane, or pure, but this <hi>Vice</hi> hath thereunto added, and applied her rust: Also it is very difficult, how so euer wee resolue so to vnwinde, and free our selues from po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular opinions, that wee still remaine not some where engaged. <hi>Vlisses</hi> had to defend himselfe, but against the charming voyce of the <hi>Syrenes,</hi> but it was not against the voyce of the People. That which wee ought to feare, comes not from one Rocke, but from all the corners of the World; A voyce neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse of so small importance, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that it can neither eleuate, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect the merits of a wise man, no more then shadowes being great, or little, doe diminish the true proportion, and greatnesse of the body: at least, because a wise man cannot wholly disingage, and exempt himselfe from this presse, and croude of people; let him leaue his body, his goods, his legges among them, for it matters not much, prouided that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire his minde wholly to himselfe, and that

as the <hi>Sunne,</hi> (despight his dayly motion,) leaues not to obserue, and follow a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular way, and course, contrary to his first mooueable. So a wise man in the course of worldly affaires, although hee bee tyed to the custome, and dependance of popular o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, vnder the conduct of Reason, yet hee findes, and followes a particular way, whereby to entertaine himselfe, in a perpetuall health, and tranquillitie of minde.</p>

There is no passion which ariseth in man, that leaues not on his face some visible signe of his agitation; but the soule within altogether confused, beares more singular and remarkable markes.

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:12284:71"/>
seeke those things which are conuenient to him: but that enforceth himselfe to vanquish the obstacles wee meete withall, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne or oppose our inclinations; neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it is very likely, that that proceedes from one and the same power. And indeede if the <hi>concupiscible</hi> finde no hinderance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth her way towards the obiect which she seekes. If shee finde any let or obstacle, shee becomes <hi>Irascible,</hi> which is to say, she enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth her selfe to surmount it, as the water of a fountaine, which glides slowly and softly on the grauell; if it be stopped by any thing it meetes, it then swells and growes great, and in the end ouerfloweth and vanquisheth her obstacle. All things naturally oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues against their contraries, not neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse that shee is any other, when shee shields or defends her selfe, then shee is in her vsuall countenance. The reason which they alledge to the contrary, is, that nothing beates it selfe: But these two powers contradict one the other, at one and the same time; it must then needes be, that they are two different things. I say that this combat proceedes not from this party, but from a higher; that is, from <hi>imagination,</hi> who touched with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:12284:71"/>
obiect, contests and fights against this inferiour party. But not that this quarell ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth in the sensitiue appetite betweene these two powers; For not being able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the thing in its simplicity, wee are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to multiply and diuide it, as we doe of the minde, which wee diuide into <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Vnderstanding,</hi> and <hi>Memory,</hi> or of the sensitiue appetite in <hi>Irascible</hi> and <hi>Concupiscible.</hi> It seemes that hereby wee keepe the thing more strictly shut vp; but it is of the Essence of things, as of the definitions: We cannot cut off any member from this, without vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and corrupting it. Wee cannot diuide that, without ruining the Science which we seeke: Shee is one, and all simple, but our grosse sight (which cannot perceiue her so lightly apparelled) runnes to his effects, and stayes there as to the first cause: Like vnto those <hi>Pagans,</hi> who not able to comprehend one onely <hi>God,</hi> diuided his powers, which our <hi>Theologians</hi> terme <hi>attributes,</hi> into so many different <hi>Diuinities,</hi> and stayed to consecrate riuers, and to baptize them according to their different operations. So we farre easier com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend two contrary powers, then one which produceth two different effects. Wee diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:12284:72"/>
beleeue that the <hi>Sunne</hi> hardneth, and softneth at one time, if experience had not taught it vs. I say then, that this power which dwells in the sensitiue appetite, is one; shee desires, she seekes her obiect, thereby to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent her selfe. If she be hindred, shee is bent and incensed against the obstacle to force it: If shee ouercome it, she walkes after her vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all accustomed pace without any violence. The <hi>soule</hi> is the principle of life, one in all, and by all: In one part shee seeth, in another shee imagineth, in another shee vnderstands, and in another she retaines, according to the disposition of the organ where she agitateth. But euen as the <hi>Heauens</hi> are not subiect to the alterations of sublunary things, and doe not moue, but to oblige the body by a perpetuall liberality: So the <hi>soule,</hi> which of her selfe is not subiect to the alteration of mortall things, ought to lend her <hi>motion</hi> as principle of life to all the body, thereby to oblige it, but not to interest and ingage her selfe so, that shee can no longer retaine her selfe, and that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting her selfe, she suffer her selfe to be led and caried away by the violent streame of her passions, which after, by little and little estrangeth her from her selfe. False <hi>opinion</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:12284:72"/>
giues them birth, but wee must not so much consider the place from whence they part and issue, as the soule of him on whom they fall. The winds which raise small cocklings vpon our riuers, and who throwe furrowes on the serenities of their christalline faces, can raise whole mountaines of waues, and waters on the <hi>Sea,</hi> and ingender impetuous stormes and tempests. The <hi>soule</hi> of the <hi>Philosopher</hi> is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quile, and quiet in his course; and <hi>wisedome</hi> who is neere him, dissipateth the waues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they haue the power or leasure to lay hold of him, or to stirre vp others by their violence: And the <hi>soule</hi> of the ignorant man, is a Sea of inconstancie which is shaked,, and tossed with euery winde, and is neuer surely firme, wherein because hee cannot quiet and appease the stormes in their first emotions, they swell and growe infinitely violent and implacable. The <hi>Philosophers</hi> are yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of the nature of the windes, and from whence they are deriued, and proceede: But those who stirre vp in our soule, such furious stormes and tempests, are but too easie to be knowne, we feele them borne within vs. They at first embrace, but in the end strangle vs. Men are not onely polluted, but poysoned by
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:12284:73"/>
their vices. That if <hi>ciuillity</hi> and <hi>ceremonie</hi> (the bastard daughters of naturall wisedome) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent that they doe not commonly resplend, and appeare before people, when they are retired in their family, they delight to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish and cherish their passions. They with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe themselues from the sight of men, to hide their defects and imperfections, as if their houses were purposely giuen them to act and perpetrate sinnes closely, and with more liberty and licentiousnesse then abroad. And it is not by the exteriour face, that you must iudge of him with whom you speake in the streete, or whom you see in the middest of his ceremonies. This is nothing but false painting, and true artificiall dissembling: you shall finde him cleane contrary in his house: It is no more him, his soule and his face haue changed posture, and countenance. But if they will conceale vs the manner of their life, they should at least diminish and cut off their passions. It may be it is for this reason that <hi>Ariston</hi> said: That the windes which are most to be feared, are those which disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs: they expose them to the eyes of the most ignorant, and onely ours will remaine darkned, and much eclipsed in this trouble.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:12284:73"/>
                  <hi>Xerxes</hi> caused the Sea to be whipped, and sent a challenge to Mount <hi>Athos:</hi> and <hi>Caligula</hi> da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Iupiter</hi> to the combat: and while these their impertinencies and fooleries exposed them to the laughter of the vulgar people, those generous spirits remained hoodwink'd, and blinded by their owne passions. But what; as long as we languish in our vices, we know them not. None but hee that is awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, can recount his dreames; for in sleepe we perceiue not their abuse and deceit. The euills of the <hi>soule</hi> are obscured in their thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: Hee that is most sicke, feeles it least. And although (according to <hi>Marsilius Ficinus</hi>) that passions are indifferent to good and euill, to vice and vertue; neuerthelesse, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest of them accuseth vs of imperfection, because they neuer obserue rule or measure. There are other wayes &amp; passages to ariue to <hi>Vertue.</hi> It is too dangerous to walke or vsurpe on vice: for it is then to bee feared lest wee fall into it: The <hi>soule</hi> bred in the shadowe, which hath not as yet tempted hazards, and repulsed the assaults of fortune, must essay all other wayes but that. For one that <hi>Ambition</hi> hath cast into <hi>Vertue,</hi> it hath precipitated a million to <hi>vice.</hi> It is still safer, and better for
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:12284:74"/>
vs, couragiously to quarell with her, then to trust her, except it be in the same manner, that we would trust our Enemie. But because all passions are weake and tender in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, the safest way to secure vs from their corruption, is to strangle them in their cradle, and make that the first point of their birth, doe in the same moment and instant, see their last ruine and destruction, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the end of their Essence or Being.</p>

She nourisheth with her heat, and giues the first motion to all our interiour moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the first principle of humane passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: because all the violent motions, which man can feele, are either for his defence, and conseruation, and this is the loue of himselfe; or for the encrease of his owne Content, and this is the Loue of Vnion, without himselfe; and these are the two greatest wheeles of <hi>Nature,</hi> who haue the charge to mooue the rest of our passions, and who obey at the first command of Loue, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the necessitie of the Law, which they haue thus established among them. But
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:12284:75"/>
we shall know her better, by her effects, then by her selfe. If we thinke to hold her any where, she escapes from vs, and transformes her selfe into so many shapes, and fashions, that we can obserue nothing in her but muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and change.

Iudge what order, and measure she can obserue in her deportments, and carriage; sith, that bound, and constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnder the authoritie of others, she neither mooues nor stirres, but vpon credit, and by the leaue of others: Man in his other passions, is not tormented, but with one at a time; but in this of Loue he conuokes, and assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles all the others, who at their very enterance lose their names, as small Brookes, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grosse the brest, and bosome of greater Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers: moreouer, he yet addes those of others, which he loueth, and weddes with as much, or more affection then his owne: I esteeme, that it is therefore for this reason, that some

of the <hi>Ancients</hi> beleeued that <hi>Iupiter</hi> himselfe could not be enamored, and wise at one time. <hi>Agesilaus</hi> tells vs that Wisedome, and Loue are incompatible, because, that, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of things past, iudgeth of euents to come, and this considereth nothing but the present, and takes no other councell, but from his owne fury, and blindnesse: His obiect which he tearmeth Beautie, consisteth in a concurrence, harmony, and decency of many parts linked, &amp; conioyned in one, &amp; the same subiect. That point which stings, and tickleth our heart, and by his ready, and violent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inflames our senses to seeke it, is tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med desire, the which if it inflame his obiect with the like desire, (as one Torch which lightens another,) this concurrence caused by the resemblance, is called reciprocall <hi>Loue, Sympathie,</hi> or according to <hi>Astrologers,</hi> incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or participation of the same Planets, and Influences, as it hapneth to those, whose very first sight is so fatall, that at that same instant they lose the one, to the other, and both their hearts, and libertie, by the meeting and enterchainging of visuall raies, which vnite, confound, and lose themselues in one, and the same end, and concurrence: The will

of the one doeth diue, and plunge it selfe into that of the other, and no longer reserues any thing of his owne particular, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; wee can no more perceiue the threades, or seames whereby they are conioyned, and sowed so close together. It is not in Loue, as it is in Musique, which is composed of different Ayres, and Tones: Loue is neuer engendered among different humours, which haue no sympathie.

The subtiltie, whereof he serues himselfe to seduce the noblest hearts, is it at first to heate, and inflame them with a vertuous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, thereby the more easily to ingage them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an admirable principle of this naturall Art, and Science, which teacheth vs not to seeke Beautie, but in Vertue, and to borrow no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grace, and splendor, but from her luster, as if there were nothing amiable, but that which were faire, and nothing faire but <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>; because <hi>Loue</hi> is not ingendered, but by her resemblance. This passion inflames vs to <hi>Vertue,</hi> to giue vs some tincture of Beautie, and thereby to make vs like vnto his obiect, and worthie of that which we Loue: But as
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:12284:77"/>
soone as it gets the hand, and aduantage of vs, then she throwes vs into Vice, and makes vs descend by by-pathes, and strange wayes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to all others, but to her selfe: This fearefull <hi>Cyclope</hi> of the <hi>Poets,</hi> who dranke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but humane blood, did hee not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done his slaughtered preyes, as soone as he felt himselfe touched with the first points, and darts of Loue, by the eyes of his cruell <hi>Galatea</hi>; and being carefull to apparell, and embelish himselfe, sought at first, onely to please her. But in the end, the fire of his Loue surmounting his patience, the excesse of his passion suggested him more bloody, and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious desires, then his barbarous nature had formerly taught him. So Loue disposeth our first designes, and conductes them towards <hi>Vertue,</hi> but it falles out, that he still diuertes vs in the middest of our course, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vs vp to the power of Vice, he drawes vs after him by oblique, &amp; vncouth wayes, as the violence of an ouerflowing Torrent, caries vs here, and there against shrubs, and thornes, which teare vs to pieces, without that wee haue any other aide, or assistance, but that of their mercilesse rage, and furie. It is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the young-men of <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> had
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:12284:77"/>
alwayes some melodious Instruments to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them in Warre, and to preuent and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that they threw not themselues on rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and fury. But he who fights vnder the Ensigne of Loue, hath farre more neede of some gracious Layes, and Songs of <hi>Philosophie,</hi> to restraine, and hinder that he doe not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snare, &amp; precipitate him in his owne losse, and the absolute mis-knowledge of himselfe. The wisest counsell herein, is that of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher <hi>Panetius,</hi> not to engage himselfe in so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent a matter: Many haue changed the heate of their diuine Zeale, into vnchast flames; the wisest haue lost themselues; and the <hi>Philosopher</hi> in the darknesse of <hi>Paganisme,</hi> seeming to haue beene inspired, and conducted by some raie of the Diuinitie, hath he not lost him in this passage; when hee wished himselfe to bee Heauen, thereby to haue so many eyes, as that had sparkling Starres, to admire; not Trueth, nor Wisedome, but more lasciuiously, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and see the sweete Lures, and Charmes of the obiect of his Loue. And the Father of the <hi>Philosophicall Academie,</hi> who seemes to haue drawne <hi>Wisdome,</hi> from her head-spring, or fountaine, and to haue made whole Riuers streame thereof, through all the corners of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:12284:78"/>
the World, hath he not likewise made Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke of his vertue in this straite, and hath not his owne Reason seene her selfe constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to yeeld to his blindnesse: not onely in the transports, and extasies of this voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, but after the violent fits of this bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-sweet fury, when he addressed Sacrifices to his Concubine, and offered vpon her Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, his <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> as Victimes to the feete of this triumphant passion. It is a Rocke or shelue, where the iustest had neede appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, and feare, not to make Shipwracke. If we will sound the depth hereof any farther, the course, and current of the water will beare vs downe. If a storme threaten vs, we must cast anchour by time before the ariuall of the Tempest: for all emotions are difficult to calme in their violence, and impetuositie: The waues of the Sea are mercilesse, but those of Loue farre more; those afflict vs with the feare of Death, but these deuoure, and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vs vp euery moment, and yet we can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther submerge, nor drowne. If the many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent accidents which staye our enioyance, sharpned not our amorous desires, then this passion would not prooue so preiudiciall, as it is, nor so much feared of Wisedome. His
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:12284:78"/>
powers, and forces encrease by the length of the way, and time; and its naturall sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse growes sower in seeking many vndecent meanes, and vnbeseeming wayes to obtaine it; the more a weight is distant from his centre, the more ponderous, and heauy it is. A Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers arme, which is not owner of its extent, strikes not so violent a blow: So the fury of Loue encreaseth by its motion, as his desire is rebated, and extenuated, in the enioying of his obiect; neuerthelesse, to condemne it any other way, but by diuine wisedome, will testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie an excesse in our humane, which in this irregularity, is as neere a neighbour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy, as to <hi>Vertue.</hi> To banish it from ciuill society, is to vndertake no lesse, then to take and cut off from the yeere, the fairest, and sweetest season, and dayes. This passion of <hi>Loue,</hi> is the daughter of <hi>Nature,</hi> who cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and flattereth it, when it is entertained in respect, and modesty; but she will easily wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonise, and vitiate her selfe, if we shew it not a seuere countenance. The surest way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for those who haue any distrust, or diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their owne strength and vertue, is, not to tempt Fortune, or to runne the hazard of a temptation. For hee who cannot stop it,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:12284:79"/>
before it part from his hand, must not thinke to curbe, or restraine it in his cariere; I say, hee must choake the seede of this growing euill, and not permit, that it take so deepe roote in our hearts, that wee cannot after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be able to expell them. All soueraigne remedies are slow, when the sickenesse is inueterate; and vnprofitable, when by the length of time, it is become stronger then the Art, and sufficiency of the <hi>Phisitian.</hi> If thou timely call thy reason to thy assistance, at her arriuall, Loue will lose all his credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; his flames will as soone vanish, his fire will be nothing but ashes, the fountaines of thy teares will stop, thy groanes and sighes will bee but small windes, and pleasing <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phirs,</hi> which will calme their troubles, and thy sorrowes, and disturbances.</p>

               <p>To shut vp this dangerous passage to our desires, were to diminish the credit, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Fortune, and in the end to anull and ruine her selfe. Those who terme this desire to <hi>Honour</hi> a spurre to <hi>Vertue,</hi> or who take it for <hi>vertue</hi> her selfe, doe euery way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue themselues. It is to follow the splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of a false light, and of a strange bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which easily receiues the shadowe of all the obiects that appeare before her. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi> hath as small sympathie and alliance, as slauerie and liberty. <hi>Alexander</hi> the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:12284:81"/>
great held the liberty of al nations in his hand, and yet miserably consumed and languished in the slauery of his owne ambitions. The limits of the <hi>Vniuerse</hi> could not bound the extent, and the enioying of all that the earth contained, was not capable to quench this thirst: Hee will force the barres of the world by the point of his <hi>ambition,</hi> and his desire is enraged to finde nothing equall to himselfe. But hee who is peaceable and quiet in his house, and within the extent and limits of his goods; giues bounds to his desires and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; hath he not farre more tranquillity and repose? If we measure this good by content, doth hee not as farre surpasse <hi>Alexander</hi> in his felicity, as <hi>Alexander</hi> surpassed him in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of his domination? Naturall desires haue some measure, but those which are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered, and borne of a false opinion, are onely limited by <hi>Infinitie.</hi> This <hi>Prince</hi> had vanquished the opinion of all men, and yet hee suffered himselfe to bee miserably van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished by his owne. Hee could not attract the eyes of a more infinite number of people, to be witnesses of his valour, and to admire his Trophees. Neuerthelesse, his blinde <hi>ambition</hi> would not permit, or suffer that his
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:12284:81"/>
eyes should participate of the rayes, and light of his greatnesse. Hee burnt himselfe in the <hi>Sunne</hi> of his glory, and so consumed himselfe in the flames, which the wings of his desires and ambition had enkindled. I would not that our condition should tye or wed it selfe to the ambition of an <hi>Alexander:</hi> but it is as easie to drowne himselfe in small Brookes, as in the middest of the waues and tempests of the <hi>Ocean.</hi> The highest Pyne trees and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars</hi> are beaten with the greatest stormes, and the Flowers which repose at the feete of the Mountaines, are dried and withered with the least winde; or by the feruencie of some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue heat: small cordes hold weake beasts, as an iron chaine doth generous <hi>Lyons.</hi> In a word, there is but one degree of slauery, and to liue in that of his <hi>Ambitions,</hi> is to approue, and make triall of the most rigorous and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerest: For if Fortune be at attonement and peace with thy desires, thou mayest in the end, beare and endure the yoke of a forraigne slauery; but thou doest more entangle thy selfe in the linckes and fetters of this foolish passion. Thou resemblest those birdes, who being cousened by the deceit of the Hunter, the more they beat themselues against the net,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:12284:82"/>
the faster they make themselues. Those who loue <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> and triumph in their disdaine of <hi>Ambition,</hi> doe most commonly resemble those who preach much of fasting, yet doe not obserue it: So naturall is this vice to them: For vpon the ruines of <hi>Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> they will <hi>rayse</hi> the Trophees of their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; But this defect sufficiently giues the lye to their knowledge, and reproues them of an imperfect knowledge in things whereof they make profession. They take the shadowe for the body, sith they content themselues with this smoake, and to pay their labours with money as light as the winde. But tell me, the honour which thou seekest, doth it not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend of the esteeme which euery one makes thereof? Doth not <hi>Estimation</hi> follow <hi>opinion?</hi> and is there a greater slauery, then to depend on the opinion of the Vulgar? Thou must begge his fauour, and make thy selfe a slaue to his passions, in regard thou hast an intent and desire to please him: and doest thou not know, that that which pleaseth one, displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth another; and that their vnderstanding is as a sicke eye, which receiues not the colour of things as they are; but doth properly giue and imprint his owne? How can it bee then
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:12284:82"/>
effected, that the vulgar, who cannot agree with himselfe, should yet accord with others, to be of the same minde, to praise and esteeme all one and the same thing? If thou wilt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure estimation by <hi>Vanity,</hi> it serues but onely to make thee beheld and seene: and knowest thou not, that <hi>Enuie,</hi> who alone hath more eyes then a multitude of people, will disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thy imperfections, and vnder a little fault, will hide and deface the rest of the glory?</p>
               <p>Desire and wish for nothing, and thou shalt be the happiest man of the world. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse not the fauours of <hi>Fortune:</hi> but doe not receiue or take them vp to Interest, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige nothing but our ingratitude; and it seemes of good offices which shee hath done vs, giues her cause enough to bereaue vs thereof. Shee calls thy ambitions, but if thou giue them too much liberty, hope not any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to stay or retaine them. They are daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>minde</hi> and <hi>imagination,</hi> who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace more vanity in a moment, then riches or vanity her selfe can containe. The false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of things which thou discouerest in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying them, doth but onely encrease the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and thy hope to arriue to a more assured matter, giues new fewell to this fire: So

thou languishest miserably betweene <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>feare.</hi> Thou complainest of thy griefe, and yet fauourest the cause thereof. Thou art of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten enough incens'd and angry against thy ambitions; but if thou threaten them with one hand, thou doest court and flatter them with the other. Remaine and dwell then with thy selfe: Clip the wings of thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires if thou wilt stoppe their flight. Their course is precipitated; nothing opposeth their swiftnesse and leuity, but the insensible weight of misfortunes which they draw af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them.

The <hi>ambitious</hi> man, prick'd forwards with the spurre of <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> and <hi>vertue,</hi> awakes as from a dreame, and yet halfe languishing in the errour of his slumbers, followes the first spendour of light, which presents it selfe to his eyes, vntill that the false apparition of this light discouer, and bewray him the abuse of his election by his rash enterprise. But the Couetous man, with his head deiected, and his eyes fixed on earth,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:12284:84"/>
admires the shining of his metall, knowes no other light; and his too weake sight cannot endure the splendor, and raies of any other <hi>Sunne.</hi> He diues into the Bowells of the earth, and in the end buries himselfe therein with his treasures. That comforteth his losse with some generous Designe; this perisheth in his owne blindnesse, and yet sees not his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice and damage; briefely, that liues in the Esteeme of the vulgar, and this in the contempt of all the world.</p>
               <p>To burne, and be passionate after wealth, with an irregular, and boundlesse desire; foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly to change himselfe, and to consume himselfe with an inraged thirst, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of waters, is the true effect of this weake, and foolish passion of Couetousnesse, which penetrates into Soule of man by a false opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so corrupts the puritie of his actions, that he doeth nothing which is Iust for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but in finishing, with his life, his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie and almost famishing desire of couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. <hi>Riches</hi> haue nothing in themselues of <hi>Good,</hi> or <hi>Euill.</hi> It is a seede which receiues the qualitie of the place where it is. In well dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and manured Soules, she produceth faire flowers, but in rude, infertile, and vnsound
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:12284:84"/>
mindes, she ingendereth nothing but Thistles, and Thornes, who are sharpe onely to pricke, and offend those who manure, and dresse them: And as there is nothing which shines without the helpe of the light; nor obscure, but by darkenesse which enuirons it; so riches are faire and profitable, when they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned with Wisedome; as they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, and troublesome, being attended on, and conducted by couetousnesse; This giues vs onely <hi>Enuie,</hi> and denies, and defends vs <hi>pleasure</hi>; that tempers our desires, and leaues vs to tast the fruites thereof, in a moderate, and honest freedome. So the acquisition, and purchase of treasures, receiues such a Beautie, as he that possesseth them, is capable to giue them. The Couetous mans Soule is all rustie, by the continuall feeling, and familiaritie of his coine, and thereby eclipseth its lustre, as the Wiseman giues it a faire, and pleasing brightnesse. This is a <hi>Sunne,</hi> who by his raies, giues life to dead things; as that by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious aire, giues death to those ioyes, and pleasures which enuiron him. <hi>Wealth,</hi> and <hi>Riches,</hi> doe but incense, and anger him, by their proude shewes; couetous hunger which presseth him by her voluntary indigence,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:12284:85"/>
makes it insupportable, and fights against his owne satietie. In a word, his misfortune hath so strong wings, that it flies before his wealth which is comming in, and infects it, as those contagious <hi>Harpyes</hi> did the meates of <hi>Phineus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wee must not thinke that our <hi>Pouertie,</hi> or the want of <hi>Wealth,</hi> by acquiring, or enioying it after, be an absolute remedy to this disease. For it proues many times but a light exchange and alteration. The same <hi>Vice</hi> which gaue distast to Pouertie, and made it of hard di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesture, corrupts the pleasures of Wealth, and makes Riches seeme burthen-some. <hi>Vice</hi> is in the <hi>Minde,</hi> and <hi>Soule,</hi> and not in Wealth; it takes what countenance we please to giue it. The opinion of the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> (although most commonly vitious in all things,) seemes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to blame, and condemne this vice: But in particular, euery one dissemblingly, striues to couer it with the name of thrift, and good husbandry, thereby to auoide the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach thereof. The <hi>Wiseman</hi> who retires himselfe from the World, and from Fortune, to liue contentedly, and happily in his Soule, shall finde more Wealth in his Pouertie, then the Couetous man in the regorging of all his
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:12284:85"/>
Treasures, if nature doe but neuer so little agree with his indigence. For can we esteeme him poore, who wants nothing? Which of the two is better, either to haue much, or enough? He that hath much desires more, his greedy couetousnesse testifies his fault, and defect, and that he hath not yet enough; whiles he which contents himselfe, is ariued to the point of his desires; where the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man, despight of his power can neuer attaine: Necessitie easily bounds her selfe; Nature fixeth her limits euery where, and in all places presents wherewith to satisfie her desires: Thirst is as soone quenched with a little water in an earthen pot; as with delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Wine in a cup of Gold. But if we will passe these bounds it is very difficult to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per our motions, and stop their course, since Riches make vs stray from the good way, and if Vertue reached vs not out her hand to reconduct, &amp; support vs, we are in imminent danger; It is a slippery step, and a dangerous precipice, and if there be found any one, who by other meanes, then that of <hi>Wisedome</hi> (in the affluence of goods, and riches) seemes to goe firme, and so to enioy the rest, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie of the minde, we must not admire
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:12284:86"/>
thereat, and so build vpon this foundation.

But it is in vaine to feare that which cannot offend vs despight our selues. <hi>Nature</hi> hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vs to be all borne equally rich, &amp; esteemes so little of the goods she giues vs, which we tearme riches, as of our passions, and the feare to lose them. <hi>Seneca</hi> sayes, that the <hi>Gods</hi> were more propitious, and fauourable, when they were but of earth, then since, when they were made of <hi>Gold,</hi> or <hi>Siluer</hi>; meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that the rest, and tranquillity of the mind, was more frequently found in the life of our fore-fathers, who sought no other riches, then the fruites of their labours, then it hath done since, when men being curious to open the bosome, and rip vp the bowells of the earth, haue therein found Mines of <hi>Gold,</hi> and <hi>Siluer,</hi> which shee hath dispersed, and sowen among vs; as seed of discord and diuision. The meanest estate and condition, and those steps which are neerest the earth, are still the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest and surest, as the highest are the most dangerous. And if Pouertie bee any way harsh, or distastfull, it is onely because she can throw vs into the armes of Hunger, Thirst Heate, Cold, or other discommodities.

But some one will say, who is he that apprehends, and feares not <hi>Death.</hi> There is no pouerty so poore, which findes not wherewith to liue: The body is easily accustomed, and hardned to endure Heate, or Cold; but what remedy is there against Death? who with his sharpe sithe, cuts and reapes away so many pleasures, yea, the very threed of our life, which can neuer be regained; for although old men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach Death in despight of themselues, and that their distast of worldly pleasures (the forerunner thereof) should yet giue them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to aduance boldly; neuerthelesse, they retire backe, they tremble at the ghastly sight, and shadow of Death, yea, they are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide, sincke downe in their beds, and wrap themselues vp in their couerlets; and to vse but one word, they dye euery moment, at the onely feare, and thought of Death. And I who am in the Spring-time of my age che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished of the <hi>Muses,</hi> and beloued of <hi>Fortune</hi> in the very hight of all pleasures, and volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousnesse, shall not I yet feare Death.

               <p>I answere, It is true, that of all things which <hi>Nature</hi> representeth vnto vs most terrible, there is nothing which shee hath depainted in such fearefull colours, as the figure and image of Death.

And contrariwise, if in this seperation, the paine should be either in the body or soule, or both; First, the body feeles it not, because there is nothing but the senses which can perceiue it, who being in disorder and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, by the disturbance of the vitall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which they oppresse and restraine, their disposition is thereby vitiated. The function of the senses being interrupted, they cease to operate; and therefore of feeling the effect of paine, but more especially when the spirits abandon them, and retire and withdrawe themselues from the heart: The which wee perceiue, and see in those who fall in a swoone, whose eyes remaine yet open, without see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and without operation: which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and comes to passe, because the spirits which should make the wheeles of the sight to moue and operate, haue abandoned their

The <hi>Soule</hi> of her selfe cannot remedy it, no more then a <hi>Fountainer</hi> can cause his water-workes to play, when there is no water; the which by reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is then meerely out of his power. And as the eye by the defect hereof, performes not her function; and without perceiuing thereof, ceaseth to operate: so all the other senses by the same rule and reason, doe faile vs. When our <hi>Soule</hi> will take her last farewell of our body, shee flyes to the regions of the <hi>Liuer</hi> and <hi>Heart,</hi> as to her publique places, all the spirits being dispierced, and bending here and there in the body, to take her last fare-well of them, which retire, without that the parts or members farther off, doe feele any paine of this seperation: but because henceforth they can no more feele it, for that they carie away with them the heat and strength of feeling. If therefore there be any paine, it must be in the noble parts, who profer their last farewell, and thankes to the Soule for the care, labour, and paine; which shee hath had to giue them life and motion.

Some will say, that the most remote parts and members shall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible thereof, and endure and suffer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this reluctation and conflict, which is onely because they haue giuen this charge, and conferred this commission to the noble parts to performe it. As in the seperation of one whom we deerely affect and loue, all the whole body which suffereth in this farewell, (to make his griefe and sorrowes the more apparent) commits the charge thereof to the eyes by their teares, and to his breast by her sighes, to expresse his sense and feeling there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: I answere, that there is no paine, because the spirits who withdrawe themselues, by the defects and failing of others in these interiour parts, are either in good and perfect order, and their function is common, and therefore without paine; or else in confusion, and then the function, and organes of the spirits are changed, and consequently their effect, which is the sense and feeling thereof: Which is seene by those who fall into a trance or swoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, They feele nothing lesse then paine in
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:12284:96"/>
those parts, which with farre more reason should betide them; because the force and power of the spirits dispierced throwe all the body, is in one instant assembled, and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together in this place: whereas contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Death hapneth, and comes to vs, by the extinguishing of the spirits, who by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame weakenesse, cannot furnish power enough, to moue the wheeles and organes of our feeling; and as without paine they haue abandoned the remotest parts and members, they faile in them without any perceiuing thereof. The body depriued of Knowledge, and therefore ignorant of his losses, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports it without any paine or griefe: So that if there be any paine or bitternesse in this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration; it should be in the soule, who touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the remembrance of fore-past plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, which she hath enioyed, and tasted in her commerce and traffique with the body, shee cannot depart or estrange her selfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paine, and lamentation.

               <p>Those who haue iudged most sollidly, and pertinently of Death, and who haue most cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously depainted it at Nature, and Life, haue compared it to sleepe.

He who is in the worst estate and condition, beginnes to hope when he hath no more to feare, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is not presently afflicted: Man being then so miserable in his life, hath he not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to aime, and aspire to some better thing. To feare Death, (saith <hi>Socrates,</hi>) is the part of a Wise man, because all the World ignores it; in not knowing whether it be our good, or our euill: But what should we not feare; if we feare that which cowardise her selfe hath sought for her retraite, and shelter, and for the speediest and most soueraigne remedy of all afflictions and miseries: The <hi>Egyptians</hi> had still in their Bankets, the Image of Death; neuerthelesse, it was not feare who had the charge to represent them this picture, but it was <hi>Constancy,</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> who had that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and who would not permit that in the middest of their <hi>Delights</hi> and <hi>Ioyes</hi>; they should be interrupted by any vnexpected ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident: But if Death then befell them, that

There is good, and euill, ease, and paine, and therefore there will bee no particular rule, or law made for vs. Destiny doeth not vnwinde for one man the threed of the aduentures, and fortunes of all the World; and that very paine which wee endure, depends of a part of diuine power, which must finish its course; hath the rising of this Starre beene a maligne aspect vnto vs, why, his setting will giue vs a benigne, and gracious influence: Nothing remaines long fixed, or immooueable; in Tortures, and Torments, there is yet some relaxation, and ease; all <hi>Paines,</hi> and <hi>Griefes</hi> haue their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terims,</hi> which giues other Formes, and Faces to voluptuousnesse, then a dumbe, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure felicity.

               <head>SECTION. VII. Of all Passions, there is no greater Enemie to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, nor lesse capable of councell then Choler.</head>
               <p>IT is reported that <hi>Minerua</hi> (on a time) play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a Flute in the looking-glasse of a fountaine, was so extreamely angry with her selfe, to see the deformity of her Face coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited, by reason of the swelling of her cheekes, that she threw her Flute to the ground and brake it: If Man were so curious to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the deformitie of his manners, and the indecency which Choler imprints on his face, I beleeue, that he would spend all his anger on this passion; and that Reason would againe counsell him once againe to be Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericke, thereby to cut off the roote of so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious a vice; I know not if our <hi>Soule</hi> could be seene of our eyes, in the furious fumes of this passion, who could indure the sight thereof; for iudge what she may be interiourly, sith
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:12284:100"/>
her exteriour Image, is so foule and deformed. The liueliest traces, and the most delicate Lineaments, which make her most commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, are those which <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi> pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray in her. But what can we more see faire in her, as soone as they are defaced by the darke, and obscure colours of this passion; the madnesse thereof, ingendereth such a combustion, and disorder, that Reason is constrained to retire, as wholly confused, and to abandon the conduction of the Soule, to the rage and insolency of this fury. She makes vs beleeue that we are offended, and that there is nothing but reuenge, which can diminish our iniury; as if Vice could be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by her selfe, and neuerthelesse, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to wreake it on others, as soone as she would, she then performes it on her selfe, and teares her selfe in pieces, conditionally, that she may sprinckle some of her owne blood, on the face of her Enemy. Oh <hi>Passion!</hi> what an Enemy art thou to man; knowest thou no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but how to offend him? Thou puttest weapons into our hands, to repulse iniuries; and then thou makest vs Enemies to our selues, to the end that wee may haue occasion to offend our selues, and thereby,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:12284:100"/>
from one &amp; the same wound, to cause to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede the iniury, and the reuenge; But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in she is the more dangerous in that she ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanceth not little, and little by degrees, and solicites not the Soule as other passions doe, but contrary-wise she drawes, and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates her at one blow: After we are fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this frenzie, it matters no more, what hath occasioned it, for we still aduance, and passe on to the bottome of this precipice, which the <hi>Poets</hi> haue well represented to vs, who for o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The same cause which makes a Master of a family to murmur in his house, animates a <hi>Prince</hi> against his Subiects; and an iniury which puts weapons into our hands against a particular person, doeth some times occasion, &amp; enkindle a warre in a whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, at least if Fortune haue giuen vs repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and power enough to effect it; <hi>Choler</hi> is easie enough to be curbed in her begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but very difficult to be restrained, when she is escaped our hands; she takes the snaffle in her teeth, violently carrieth vs away, and takes no other counsell, but from her owne licentious madnesse. In this passion we may obserue three seuerall motions; The first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:12284:101"/>
from the power of Nature, as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnwilling disposition, and changing of affection, which we cannot remedy, but by a prescription of long time, and custome, and yet very difficulty, because Nature hath this power in men, to mooue them despight of themselues; yea, and to make them remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the very strongest of their imperfections: The second is voluntary, to wit, then when this passion consults, and takes councell of Reason, and submits to it, but he who flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his Choler, and doeth not stop it in this point, and behalfe, let him neuer hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine it in the third, and last motion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Reason hauing once stooped vnder the command of this passion, she tramples on her throate; takes the possession of our Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and being shut vp, and fortified in our house, sets fire both without and within it, and then by little and little, consumes her selfe in the flames thereof; I am of opinion, that it was for this cause, and reason, that <hi>Seneca</hi> said, that it were better to exclude <hi>Vertue</hi> from our Soules, then to receiue, or admit <hi>Choler,</hi> because the end thereof, prooues most commonly the beginning of repentance. For Reason eleuating her selfe by degrees,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:12284:101"/>
and disingaging her selfe from the tyranny of this domesticall Enemy, she then comes to know the disorder, occasioned by her owne blindnesse; whereof she is taken as surety, and pledge, because she must answere, for the force and power which she hath committed vnto him. Or if our Reason thinke to iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie her selfe, for that she seemes at his arriuall, to prescribe, and giue him Lawes, let her know, that Choler forgets them, and that she neuer remembers them, except it be then, when they offend her. Those who are intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in their sicknesse, prohibit, and defend to be obeyed when they are sicke: &amp; sith man cannot be temperate in this sicknesse of the Soule, I meane <hi>Choler,</hi> I am of opinion, that by times he defend <hi>Reason</hi> to obay him. Or if we beleeue, that it is some times necessary, because (as a <hi>Philosopher</hi> said,) <hi>it giues weapons to Valour</hi>; I answere, that Vice produceth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is Vertuous, although it seeme to shoote foorth some false buds, or twigges, which beares I know not what deceitfull image, or representation thereof. It is no good fat, when through sicknesse we become puffed vp, and corpulent. It is neither cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, nor vallour, when through Choler we

rush vpon our Enemies: <hi>Vertue</hi> neuer makes vse of so weake a Champion as <hi>Choler</hi>; It is a weapon which commands vs, and which we manage but at his pleasure, and as dangerous towards our selues, as towards those whom it will offend. It is true, <hi>Choler</hi> hath power and predominancy ouer all men; that there are many people who haue not yet approoued the stings of ambition, who know not the name of <hi>Couetousnesse,</hi> and yet there are none who haue not felt the effect of <hi>Choler.</hi> All the World is naturally subiect to <hi>Loue,</hi> yea, none can iustly deny the trueth hereof, and yet we haue not seene a World of people mad wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the highest Region of the ayre, there is no thunder, <hi>Saturne</hi> (the greatest of the <hi>Gods</hi>) walkes so frest, and the more the quality and condition of men are eleuated, the more slow they should bee to follow this passion, because they haue more meanes to offend, and to adde, and giue to the nourishing of this inraged fury, the blood, and ruine of those whom they threaten. If a <hi>Childe,</hi> or a <hi>Foole</hi> offend thee in the Streete with iniurious words, thou wilt auoide him with disdaine; they are too much below thee, to be able to offend thee; So, know that if the Vertue, and greatnesse of thy Courage, could as much lift thee aboue common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as aboue these innocent persons; that thou shouldest finde as little iniury from the one, as from the other; the reuenge which thou seekest, is a confession of griefe for a wrong. If he had not offended thee, thou hadst not needed this remedy, a remedy worse then the wrong it selfe, because it befalls vs; for not being able to endure anothers folly, we very often make it our owne: None can of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend

If it be false, are we not satisfied, because the iniury then returnes, and retortes vpon our Enemy, through the vice of his life? His designe is to offend thee; so, he hath then neede of thee to execute his resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and for what art thou indebted to him, to obey his will; If the iniury offend, and anger thee, it is that which he desireth, and then thou makest no more difference of thine Enemy, then of thy Friend: because thy will is that of either of them. As words are but winde, so know that the lye, or iniury which offends thee in point of <hi>Honour,</hi> is but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, <hi>Courage</hi> is to be esteemed and prised, but it is either <hi>God,</hi> thy <hi>Prince,</hi> or <hi>Countrey,</hi> which must dispose thereof vpon good occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; iniuries receiue no sharper answeres then contempt.

For where the defect is found vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and linked to power, there necessarily is formed desire: But Man is knowne to want many things, chiefely <hi>Vertue,</hi> which is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect habitude.

So not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in the goods of <hi>Fortune,</hi> but in <hi>Vertue,</hi> it followes, that there is another <hi>felicity,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that which is propos'd vs by Fortune. <hi>Imperfection</hi> supposeth the diminution of any perfect thing, because the nature of things hath not deriued its power and vigour from a defectiue and imperfect Nature, but from a most compleat and full one. It followes then that there is a point of <hi>Nobility,</hi> from whence they haue degenerated, and especially in the act of our soueraigne good, from whence through <hi>errour</hi> and <hi>opinion,</hi> man hath beene di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted as from his obiect, to follow a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; the which because hee of himselfe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wholy appease our desire, sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstates and testifies by this imperfect bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, that he is either the part, the shadowe, or the Image of some accomplished thing, which is <hi>felicity:</hi> But the part presupposeth the whole, and the shadowe or image must necessarily haue relation to the body.

Contrariwise, the actiue who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes not her selfe, but to correct those trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles which fall into the <hi>Soule,</hi> by animating some when they withdrawe vs from our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and in stopping others when they make vs passe the bounds of reason, ariues at last to the end of his enterprise, and makes vs enioy in effect that good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which shee proposeth her selfe. Shee may easily leaue and omit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, which is somewhat lesse necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie then the goods of the body. <hi>Sciences</hi> (or learning) haue their vices and defects, as <hi>Pride, Vanity,</hi> and <hi>Presumption,</hi> which cannot be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected but by the ayde of this.

for the regard thereof, was not by the <hi>Oracle</hi> reputed the wisest man of the world, but for the conduction and ordering of his manners. Neuerthelesse, as one good added to another, makes it the greater, so the contemplatiue brings some profit &amp; aduantage to the actiue felicity, although neuerthelesse she seeme ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to offend then serue her: For she beares with her a (I know not what) trouble to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and know; which sells vs many light and triuiall shewes of contentments, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of continuall sweat and labour; and in the end discouereth vs the vanity of her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. For all <hi>Learning,</hi> which wee can pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase, is not perfect, but by reason of his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, which is <hi>God,</hi> or the Essence of things wherein he is, if rather they be not in him, as in their <hi>Soueraigne</hi> Head spring and fountaine. But by those wayes and meanes which wee possesse it, shee cannot bee but extreamely weake and imperfect, being ore-vayled and obscured with an infinite number of sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and cloudes, because it is not things and their Essences which conioyne themselues to our soule, no more then bodies are seene in the Christall of Looking-glasses; but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their formes and representations. So in
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:12284:110"/>
steed of truth she receiues nothing but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblances and shadowes thereof; as wee haue formerly obserued in the <hi>Tract</hi> of the senses: And neuerthelesse, shee wheeles and runnes round about obiects, and proffereth vs her hands, to stop and arrest the shadowes of our visions, in steed of the body, and the thing itselfe. So that wee must not wonder if <hi>Learning</hi> cannot content or satisfie our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and therefore serues but to disturbe vs, because her formes and resemblances giue vs no essentiall nor solid thing, but onely fill vs with I know not what ayrie, emptie, and superficiall, which doth rather anger then appease vs: Which absolutely contradicts our actiue felicity, which is nothing else but a perfect tranquillity of the minde, in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate vse of goods which shee enioyeth. The vulgar and common sort of men, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe this felicity to bee in pleasures and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuousnesse, imagining that the greatest part of those who are constituted in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, liue after that manner, beleeuing that all euill is in griefe and affliction: and they are not farre wide of the truth herein, because all our actions still ayme at <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>pleasure</hi>; which commonly accompanieth felicity as
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:12284:111"/>
her shadow: But this approaching end is not the last, so that this imperfection sufficiently giues the lye to their beliefe and opinion. The errors of others growe according to the proportion of their greatnesse; for it seemes that the more Man is eleuated in fortune, that thereby he either augments his faults, or else makes them appeare the greater. The <hi>Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomicall,</hi> or <hi>Domesticall</hi> Man, proposeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe nothing but wealth and riches: but it is a life too full of trouble and agitation; the Enemie of re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>AS there is but <hi>Fortune</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> who share and diuide our passions, it is they also who communicate vs, all that wee terme <hi>goods</hi> or <hi>riches,</hi> yea our <hi>felicity</hi> it selfe: Let vs iudge of that who hath giuen vs the better part; and let vs equally weigh and ballance the fauours which we receiue. It seemes to me, that Fortune aduanceth, and comes forth first to meete vs; Deck'd, and embellished in her richest attire, and Ornaments to heat and enflame our affections, and to make vs feele the obligations, wherewith shee enchaines and captiuates our wills. It is true, I cannot consent or adhaere with those, who do not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently feele and acknowledge it, and testifie by iniurying her the vice of their owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. I too much esteeme, and prife equity not to confesse ingeniously, as well the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:12284:112"/>
good as the euill, which we finde in our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. Nothing engageth mee but <hi>Iustice</hi>; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing enforceth me but <hi>reason.</hi> But what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is there, that thou who hast opened her, all thy dores, and who hast issued foorth to meete, and salute Fortune, to receiue her into thy house, that thou wilt quarell with her when shee is there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or because she giues thee that too late, which pleaseth thy ambition, or that shee too sparingly bestowes her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours and treasures on thee, to satisfie the taste and palate of thy distempered and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular appetites: Or because shee is weary to reside and dwell so long vnder one roofe, shee retires other wheres. That which shee hath lent thee, shee hath departed with out of her pure liberality; and therefore what reason is there, that thou contest and quarell with her, because shee withdrawes it. It may be thou hast not vnderstoode the clauses and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of her bargaine: For, for a time she giues vs, the vse and profit of her goods; but she ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer dispossesseth her selfe of their propriety. And in retiring hath shee caried away any thing that was not her owne: What shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of thy obligation and debt to her for her presents? Shall their absence haue the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:12284:113"/>
credit wholy to wipe off and deface it. If any one had reached thee out his hand to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw thee out of a mire, were it reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that thou shouldst quarell with him, because hee would not carie thee home to his house on his shoulders? <hi>Liberality</hi> hath his limits in his intents, and not in the will of others, who neuer say, it is enough. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, what <hi>Monarch</hi> by his guifts could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and satiate the will of the meanest <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,</hi> which encreasing by the enioyance of those things which his desire proposeth him, raiseth himselfe by little and little to so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue a degree of pride and arrogancie, that the possession of the whole world, and of all which it containes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will yet be found to be inferiour to his ambitions. He who lends or giues, doth still oblige when hee performes more then hee owes. When one lends thee any thing, hath he no more right to aske and demand it of thee? Whereof doest thou then complaine? Doth it not remaine that thou shouldst thanke him for the time which thou has enioyed it? If shee take leaue of thee, goe and conduct her home to her dore. It is true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shee is so good and pleasing a companion that wee cannot suffer her seperation without
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:12284:113"/>
griefe; but there is no reason that we should enforce her against her will and nature, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine so long time in one place, because shee delights in nothing more then in mutability and change. The law of ciuility permits vs not to quarel with him who comes to oblige vs by visiting vs, if his visite seeme too short to vs. Where then is the wrong which For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hath done thee; what is the griefe whereof thou complainest? Doest thou not know her Artifice, who to make her fauours more pleasing and desirable, withdrawes them for a time. Her absence makes our loue more violent, and thereby makes it doe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, which her presence could neuer draw from our tongue: the estimation which wee make of things being of this nature, that it neuer tyes it selfe, but to those things which we haue not; and contempt contrariwise to that which wee possesse and enioy. But the same inconstancie which dislodg'd her, will it may be cause her returne. There is nothing constant in her, but onely her inconstancie, nor so durable as her mutability. <hi>Polycrates</hi> knowing very well her humour, to content her vicissitude and changeablenesse, without giuing her the paine to come home to him,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:12284:114"/>
beleeued that he had sufficiently satisfied her due and interest, in throwing into the Sea a iewell of an inestimable value. But to shew that shee will not that any one shall act and play her part; but that she will take and chuse at her pleasure, shee caused this Iewell againe to returne to him, found in the belly of a fish, which was serued in to him on his Table. Nothing displeaseth her but our resolution, nothing contents her but our weakenesse and pusillanimity. To contemne that which shee giues vs, is the meanes to enioy it long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she difficultly resolues to withdrawe the good which she hath done vs; if at least shee haue not formerly endomaged our <hi>vertue,</hi> or corrupted vs by her <hi>familiarity:</hi> In the meane time I perceiue not that her weapons fight against her selfe; and that the onely way to excuse her herein, is to accuse her for the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of our <hi>repose</hi> and <hi>tranquillity,</hi> because her inconstant Nature cannot looke or bend to the surest side, and that <hi>feare</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with shee perpetually ballanceth the course and actions of our life, promiseth vs nothing lesse then perfect felicity.</p>

               <p>BVt there is no reason so soone to stoppe her mouth and condemne her; Let vs a little see and obserue the great preparatiues, which with so much noyse shee drawes after her. The Master doth not alway carry the purse.

Let vs cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorily consider, hee who defuseth so much pompe and lustre, that it seemes the eyes and hearts of all the World should follow this splendant brightnesse. It is that which we tearme <hi>Wealth,</hi> or <hi>Riches.</hi> What is your designe, promise nothing which you cannot performe, if it bee not that you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained thereunto by the command of your <hi>Mistris; Obedience</hi> is blinde, and it is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which excuseth you. Doe you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:12284:115"/>
that in curing our Pouerty, you cure vs of the rest of our diseases? Doe you thinke because of your aboundance, that you want nothing to adde to your content? You doe nothing lesse for all that; you onely a little rub your itch, but presently after it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts you farre the more; for then the heate or fire takes it; and the more you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it, the more it encreaseth. But what good doe you <hi>Riches</hi> bring vs; If wee cast vp our accompts together, I beleeue you remaine our debter; What is there in you which is worthy to bee esteem'd by your price and value, but onely your exterior lustre and shew; and if there be but onely that, what is there which wee finde not farre more admirable, in Starres and Flowres, and which is not common to a thousand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther naturall Bodies: You must then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that you are in our debt, by vertue whereof, you must couenant and condition with vs, to satisfie our desires, and so to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt vs of Pouerty. And yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding you neither performe the one, or the other. Is it in your power to quench our thirst when we are extreamely pressed and afflicted therewith; You make vs beleeue
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:12284:115"/>
that we yet want something, and yet the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session thereof doth but encrease its violence. If there be any thing in you that be capable to enrich vs, it must be your presence; and yet notwithstanding you bring vs more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit vpon the Exchange then in your Coffers. It is not therefore your presence which is to be desired, sith your absence enricheth vs farre more: By this wee see, that pouerty is found richer then abundance. Whereof then are we healed and cured? But you will say, that your want doth impouerish vs! O poore <hi>Riches,</hi> sith you still carie with and about you some degree of beggery. Hee who wants many things, is hee not iustly held and reputed poore: But when you are ariued any where, how many seruants and guards doe you want to secure you from your Enuiers. How ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly you want the ayde and assistance of <hi>Iudges,</hi> to punish those who offend and wrong you. And if hee who receiues and enioyes you, haue neede of all these things, and which is more, hath neede of himselfe, because hee is no more himselfe, (the last and most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame point of beggery) is not hee then more to bee contemned, or rather pittied, then hee whom you tearme poore, who

weighes not his goods by the Goldsmithes Ballance, but by the yard of <hi>necessity:</hi> and who wants not all these things! O <hi>Riches,</hi> for what then serue you: but onely to enrich vs in wanting farre more things then wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy. Why then doe you constraine vs to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie on our backes your gold and siluer, which oppresseth and afflicts vs farre more in your company, then it did when you were alone, or absent. A double burthen is not the way to ease a Porter! O Riches, where then is this good which hath deceiued our hopes? It is not for you to purchase it; it hath cost vs too many cares and labours: It is not for you to conserue it; it hath too many feares and apprehensions. Is it in your losse, I doubt so, if wee will beleeue the <hi>Wise man,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced to study <hi>Philosophy</hi> more at his ease, after the Shipwrack and losse of all his goods.

beene taught to praise <hi>Vice</hi> as <hi>Vertue,</hi> and to vse the same Language for the one as for the other.

But we ought not to expose and abandon it to all men, nor permit that it should be so cheape and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among vs as it is.

selfe, which being ingaged in the course, and Vicissitude of mortall things, runnes to the end, and cannot long subsist or remaine in one constant and immutable being. And indeede, in her first yeares and time, this Lady <hi>Glory</hi> followed nothing but <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Merit,</hi> but some stupid man (desirous to content the eyes of his body, as well as those of his minde) would giue her some solid thing, whereunto she might fasten and fixe her selfe, as to him who is the best timbred, the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and the most couragious, the dignity to march first in Warres, and to command and conduct others: As the <hi>Infidels</hi> doe at this day (a thing which sauours not of <hi>Barbarisme</hi>) to him which excells in <hi>Wit, Iudgement,</hi> and <hi>Iustice,</hi> the Office to appease differences, which arise among the people, as <hi>Moyses</hi> likewise did. These Offices giue the first ranke and preheminence to those who were established, and by degrees erected in dignities. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, those who were formerly prouided, were not yet so much honored for the charge and office which they possessed; but onely by merit, which made them worthy and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable aboue all other. But after-times haue not proceeded by election, but haue beleeueth
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:12284:118"/>
that the vertue of predecessours, ought to be infused with the seede, in the person of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors. The which being since maintained, then <hi>Vertue</hi> began to withdrawe, and retire her selfe apart, and hath not since beene found vnited to these dignities; but that by hazard and accident some persons of merit haue beene found of that number. In the meane time, <hi>Honour</hi> which was inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably vnited to those <hi>dignities,</hi> for <hi>Vertues</hi> sake (which was the soule thereof) hath not ceased to follow this body, although shee haue beene diuided and separated; also the glory, and the estimation, and opinion of people, is farre more capable to vnite it selfe to I know not what grosse obiect, thing, or person, then to any thing which is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined and sublime. He cannot perceiue, yea nor conceiue <hi>Vertue</hi> otherwise then painted, blowne vp, and swell'd by Artifice. Those who slide into <hi>Offices</hi> and <hi>Dignities,</hi> by their naturall honesty and simplicity, doe easily escape from so grosse a sight, which hath neede of a greater and stronger body, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they can take no hold-fast thereof.</p>
               <p>Wee are in a time, where the good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and estimation of People is iniurious; why
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:12284:119"/>
then shall we so much esteem it? Hee who hath a hundred thousand crownes to bestow on an Office or Dignitie, he hath verie much shortned the way, which another must make by his vertuous actions, to make himselfe so well esteemed and accepted: It matters not much whether he enter in by some false doore, or that it comes not to him by fayre play: Howsoeuer he hath performed more in an hower, then all the vertue of this other can doe during his whole life. Yea, to speake properly, he hath herein resembled the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian Horse, who effected that in one night, which a great Armie could not doe in ten yeares. If all the <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Wisedome</hi> of the World were assembled in the other, it cannot exempt, or priuiledge him from being push'd and abused in the streets, by euer Porter or Cobler, in the throng and croude of those who retyre to giue way &amp; place to this great new Merchant: And if <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Prayse</hi> be so impertinently and vndeseruedly giuen, what shall hee profit who will buy it at the price of his owne vertue and integritie. <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> should be followed, not desired; it is not purchased but by the greatnes and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our courage, which measureth all

               <p>Wee must doe for <hi>Vertue,</hi> that which wee doe for <hi>Glorie</hi>; But me thinkes there is yet more honour not to be, then to be praised for a thing which d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the vulgar people, who is the distributer of this praise, and who keepes the record and regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster thereof, markes downe the payments and receipts: If he offer it to thee, canst thou safely receiue this present from so corrupted a hand? If hee denie it thee; for what doest thou complaine? If none could worthily praise the <hi>Athenians</hi> but before the <hi>Athenians</hi> themselues; shouldst thou care for any other praise then for that of Wise men? Or if because thou art a good <hi>Musitian,</hi> that some should praise thee for a good <hi>Pylot,</hi> or for an excellent <hi>Physitian,</hi> canst thou endure this false praise without true shame? The <hi>Esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> of the vulgar measures all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the outward shew and lustre, and iudgeth not of a mans sufficiencie, but by the number &amp; liuerie of his footmen. That <hi>Philosopher</hi> who discoursing publiquely in the Streetes, was interrupted by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause of the people; he presently turned to one of his friends, to know if there had any
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:12284:120"/>
thing impertinently escaped his tongue which had thus giuen the people occasion to praise him, as if <hi>hee</hi> were not capable to esteeme any thing, but that which is worthy of contempt. And yet when these defects doe not meete and happen, can a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue honour, but from at least his equall; to wit, or on the like tearmes and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If there were not the like interest, hee should but sleight him, and say, Its a man that spake it: There are reproaches enough in this very word to blemish the lustre of his best actions; they issue from sense as from vertue out of their originall Spring, the which wee must re-obtaine, thereby to make a worthy iudgement thereof. None can obserue or remarke the difference: The approbation of a vertuous man, is better then that of a multitude: but the onely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of a good conscience, is yet farre more to be priz'd and esteem'd. He is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie who liues peaceable and quiet, and who without designe contemplates the course of worldly actions and accidents: As the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, who during the heat of the day, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing himselfe at the foote of a tree, lookes sloathfully and carelesly vpon the streame

aduancest, the more thou doest enchaine and fetter thy selfe: Retire thou vpon thy losse, rather then to lose all; but thou doest yet expect some things in the persons of <hi>Princes</hi> Fauorites. It is true, the name of Fauorite makes vs beleeue, that thou hast honoured it with some singular present, which cannot be found in any other: But whatsoeuer it may be, I doe not hold that it is <hi>felicitie.</hi> Tell me, can thy Fauorite defend himselfe, from all the blowes and assaults of <hi>Enuie.</hi> (Fort.) <hi>Why not? Is there any stronger Rampier, then the fauour of a Royall Maiestie.</hi> At least, hee cannot defend himselfe from suspitions, feares, distrusts, because there is no <hi>Scottish</hi> Guard, how faithfull or vigilant so euer they can be, which can defend him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the blowes of his Enemies. The same qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which are in him, and which haue gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and obtayned the fauour of the Prince, can they not meete and concurre in another, yea in a farre greater number: (Fort.) <hi>Its true:</hi> But this Fauorite will be carefull to preuent, that hee approach not the presence of the <hi>Prince.</hi> For sith the way is so straite to him, that there is no place but for one; hee which possesseth it, will easily hinder
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:12284:123"/>
others for hauing accesse. But Fortune thou knowest, that there is nothing sought after with so much passion. Hee must night and day stand vpon his guard. The fauour hee hath gayned of his <hi>Prince,</hi> giues him the iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie of great men, the enuie of his equalls, and the hatred of the common people. If he be farre absent from his <hi>Prince,</hi> his place will be gotten: If he sleepe, hee will be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized: Hee must watch the enterprizes of one, and the other to oppose them. Thou wilt say, that he may fortunately compasse his desires, because humane reason is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of so many different &amp; contrary formes, that the iustest enterprizes and actions may be interpreted as euill. O <hi>Fortune,</hi> thy Fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite must haue a wonderfull care to conserue himselfe! What rest is there in this life, sith at euery accident hee must be armed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the blowes of <hi>Enuie,</hi> and to preuent that the very report of ill speeches and <hi>calumnie</hi> (which pardoneth not that which is not) come not to his <hi>Princes</hi> hearing, because it may engender and stirre vp some diffidence in him, which distilling and sliding into his affections, may shortly after make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come tart and sower: But if the wisest, and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:12284:123"/>
happiest in this Art, haue beene constrain'd to forsake it, what then is there more to be hoped for? Should not their fall infinitely astonish those who follow their steppes and traces? How many times hath the image, and remembrance of such a spectacle, yet freshly bleeding, leapt into their dreames, and troubled their rest by night. Can there bee found any one who hath better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood it then <hi>Scianus:</hi> In whose fauour resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the whole power of the <hi>Romane Empire:</hi> and for what hath his Greatnesse serued for, but onely to make his fall the more fearefull and greater. The true feare of such an euent, was it not the fury of the <hi>Poet,</hi> and which burnt and consumed his bowells with his blacke and fatall Torch, and hindered him from tasting any pure content, in the enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this his fauour. It was gall and worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood intermix'd in his eating and drinking, which his Cooke could not take off, nor ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish from the delicacie of his Vyands. There are not many found of the like flight, and fortune, who haue not signed and confirmed this passage with their bloud. <hi>Kings</hi> can doe nothing worthy of themselues, which is not as great as themselues: But as their
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:12284:124"/>
fauour proceeding from a Royall power, cannot admit of mediocrity: so their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace issuing from one and the same cause, can be no lesse, and is difficultly quenched but in their blood. They are armed men, who mount and fight at a breach, who haue nothing to conserue their life, but their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and weapons, and yet feare nothing more; for if they are throwne downe, they are kill'd with the weight thereof. <hi>Fauour</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists against all things, but against it selfe. It is a fire which defuseth a shining brightnesse, he which moderately approacheth it, feeles with much content and pleasure, the sweet heat of this flame: But it is a heauenly fire which is extinguished in a moment, and burnes the mortall that will embrace it. True it is, that <hi>Fortune</hi> markes them with some degrees, and lends them her hand to bring them more sure to the point of this fauour: But be it that her inconstancie is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to their losse; or that with a preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated designe, shee particularly prepares their ruine: Shee abandons them as soone as they are eleuated on this stage, and breakes and teares downe the steps thereof, to make them despaire to be able to descend by any

And yet in this point and euent, there must be some more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Genius</hi> then that of <hi>Fortune</hi>; because hee who could triumph ore Fortune, could not triumph ore fauour. For was there euer neer great <hi>Princes,</hi> (and in the heart of abundance) any Fauorite more moderate then wise <hi>Seneca</hi>; Hee, who neuer beheld the fauour of his <hi>Prince,</hi> with an ambitious eye, who induced and led, by the very contempt of riches, sought pouerty, in the bottome of fourescore thousand pounds <hi>(English)</hi> of yearely reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes which he possessed.

So <hi>Vertue</hi> prepareth vs a perfect abundance of all things, and establisheth no <hi>felicity</hi> out of her selfe: And by the <hi>Scepter</hi> of reason, which shee puts into our hands, she frees vs from the tyrannie of our appetites, and in this new <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> and <hi>Empire,</hi> where shee establisheth vs, shee makes vs easily to vanquish the reuolt and rebellion of our senses; and there is the

It is there where <hi>Socrates</hi> hath exhausted this sufficiencie of all things, I meane this tranquillity of life. It is there where <hi>Cato</hi> hath found this inuincible courage.

The which wee cannot doe, but in taking the threed of wise <hi>Ariadne,</hi> I meane of <hi>Reason:</hi> who after the combat, reserues the <hi>Laurells</hi> of Victory for vs in her hands. If thou wilt essay to passe the barres which separates this small number of wise men, from the prophane multitude of the vulgar; doe a little eleuate the eyes of thy thoughts, and consider here as from a high Land, wherein dwells Vertue, all that shee will shewe and point thee with her fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in this plaine and raze field, as the <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> and <hi>Crownes,</hi> broken by the Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts of Warre, which cannot couer the <hi>ambition</hi> of their Masters.

called reason, and which must bee dressed and pruned by a long exercise and custome, which wee tearme Vertue, which watering this plant, makes it to produce <hi>desire</hi> and <hi>felicitie.</hi> As our good issueth from interiour man, so also doth our euill: For that which afflicts thee, is the designe to possesse those things which thou hast not. But those things are within thee, sith they touch thee not, and they doe thee no good nor harme. Thou complainest neuerthelesse to feele so sharpe and burning a griefe, that it troubleth thy rest by night, and almost dries thee vp with languishing. But heerein there is but two things to consider; to wit, desire, and the thing desired: and because this last is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther criminall, nor guilty of thy griefe, as being farre distant from thee; it must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore needes follow, that it is desire, sith it is lodged in the same place, where thou feelest this burning, this affliction in being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with too much violence. Hee hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly scratch'd and fetch'd blood of thee within: he is then the cause of thy griefe and euill; thou must th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>refore cut it off; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it peaceably, within the compasse of those things which are easie and neere. If
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:12284:134"/>
Fortune diminish any thing, it is but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine it the more; and when all that wee haue shall vanish, and be tane away, there will yet remaine enough in our breast and minde to reioyce us. The voyce being restrained and shut vp, makes more noyse; strength be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing collected and assembled, produceth more effects; and the more our desire is restrained, the more it puffes vp, and swells our content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as being neerest to his tranquillity, and next neighbour of our owne felicity. Cease therefore to desire any thing, but that which thou enioyest. All these things which For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune giues thee, is but borrowed apparell from common Brokers, the which because it is common to all men, belongs not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to any one who weares them. I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell thee to clad thy body with them, but not thy affections, and to loade thy backe with them, but not thy minde: Reserue this for Vertue, it is by her which we ought to weigh and ballance all the priuiledges and good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of man. Reason makes him very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from beasts: but reason, or perfect rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, makes him to differ much from other men who are like him in shape, but as then not in quality and vertue. To measure a man
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:12284:134"/>
by his exteriour goods of Fortune, is to comprehend in measuring a Statue, the height of his basis or foundation; but to measure him by his interiour vertues, wee must then doe it by his naturall greatnesse, whereof neither fetters nor fire can dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish or take away the very least part. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune subiecteth vs to all things; but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise, Vertue eleuates vs aboue all: Shee dissolues Ice, shee enforceth and giues a law to griefe and paine: She breakes Irons; yea, she passeth through fire and flames, to put vs in possession of this felicity. We say therefore that felicity is the vse of a perfect reason. It is this Philosophers stone which conuerts to gold all that wee touch. Shee supports all aduerse accidents, and misfortunes that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall her, with a requisite moderation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, and performes the best actions, which can be desired or discouered vpon all causes and accidents which betide her. If wee are assieged by many disasters and afflictions, she then makes vse of Constancie, as of some sharpe and Physicall potion, to cure vs in this extreamity; or at least to flatter and sweeten the sense and feeling of our paine and griefe. If they come not to vs by whole troopes, but
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:12284:135"/>
by one and one at a time; then she teacheth vs how to fight with them, and which is more, how to vanquish them. And because the goods of Fortune, by their arriuall or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, doe still engender some interiour dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease in vs; therefore shee purifieth and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues our minde from this contagion. Or if it seeme to thee, that Vertue giues thee not so many sweet and ticklish pleasures in this felicity, as vnchast and impudent Fortune doth in the hugge of her embraces; The pleasure neuerthelesse is more firme, solid, and permanent. Men dally and kille their Mistresses, otherwise then they doe their children; and yet notwithstanding in these embraces and kisses their affection is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently bewrayed and demonstrated to those who see it. Time in the end cuts off the web of those foolish affections: but what griefes so euer this naturall loue meetes in the breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bringing vp of his children; it is yet more tender and deere, as if their watchings, their care, sweat and labour therein, were as so many materialls, to cyment more firmely and soundly this their affection to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. So any difficulties which oppose the designe of a vertuous man, cannot interrupt
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:12284:135"/>
the course of affection, which hee conceiues and beares to his lawfull children, I meane to those faire and glorious actions, who as to make shewe and demonstration of their beauties, they seeke not an ampler Theater, then that of a good conscience: So they neede no other light or day to accompany their glory, then that which they cast and dispierce in the company of wise men, by the lustre of their owne proper brightnesse.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE haue long enough played the Philosopher, and now in its turne, we must represent and act that of man: That heroicall Vertue, whereof wee precedently discoursed, apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to none, but to those of the first Classe or Schoole, and who with <hi>Socrates</hi> can tame Death so well, that they will seeke for no consolation out of it. Life and death seemed to this wise Philosopher, as naturall one as the other. Hee considered the first point of his birth, as the first graine of sand which
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:12284:136"/>
begins the houre, and the last motion of his life, as the last graine which ended it: and yet both the one and the other with a regard and looke, equally fixed, and constant.</p>
               <p>If we rush out of our selues, and that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times our Vertue drawe and enforce vs to this last point: wee are more indebted for this sally to irregularity, then to the power, constancie, or vigour of our minde, the which likewise cannot long remaine in this high seate, because it as soone feeles it selfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed and beaten downe by the weight of the body, to re-integrate it in this obscure prison, from whence hee was, but as it were escaped; and then comming againe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, hee knowes no more the trace or way, whereby hee hath performed so faire a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere: So that trembling with astonishment, he may say, that there is nothing more diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, or dis-semblable to man, then himselfe.

But againe, after that we re-assume our olde custome and vices, which wee haue forsaken at our first entrance; as he whom wee see in a fooles habit, after hee hath represented the personage of a King in a Comedie. If Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, if the dreames of lyes did not take vp and preoccupate our thoughts insteed of these Philosophicall reasons, there could bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more commendable, noble, or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, then he who consulting, and conuersing with reason, passeth his time in obseruing the familiar conferences which they haue toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: So that if Fortune apparelled in all her brauest and richest ornaments, should arriue at the very instant to offer him all her most
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:12284:138"/>
pretious treasure, to embrace her side and party, I am sure shee should receiue nothing from him, but a short refusall and shame; but if she chance to come to him eight dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I beleeue that if she doe not wholy van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish him, that she will at least make a great breach in his heart &amp; affections. The minde of man cannot be still extended and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. He must continually haue his weapons in his hand, and put himselfe on his guard to defend himselfe from those blowes which Fortune still giues vs: Shee but feignedly fights with vs, for she leuels at our head, but strikes vs at our heart. We defend and auoid our selues from Ambition and Couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but yet wee inconsideratly permit our selues to bee transported and ouerthrowne by choler. So the blowe is not dangerous or violent, because it struck vs with the butt end; and although it neither reuersed nor ouerthrew vs, yet it made vs recule at least a pace backward. What good countenance so euer our Vertue shewes, shee is still subiect to many imperfections. If shee had but our minde to gouerne and conduct, then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing were impossible to her: But when she must take vp, and loade on her shoulders the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:12284:139"/>
body wherein this minde is enchained and imprisoned, shee then stoopes and faints vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this burthen; and all shaking and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling shee hath much a doe to support her selfe by her owne proper strength and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour: For shee is constrained to seeke ayde and helpe to prop her selfe vp, yea and to begge assistance to keepe and stay her from reeling and falling. Where the Lyons skin cannot suffice, wee must sowe on that of the Foxe; and where courage hath not power enough to support and defend it selfe from the iniuries of Fortune, wee must in her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe substitute subtilty to oppose and diuert it. The vertue of <hi>Socrates</hi> fore-sawe his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; he inured, &amp; tamed himselfe to it, yea laughed and played with it; and ours makes vs to looke a thwart and squint-eyed: yea, to turne and diuert our eyes from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motest obiects thereof, to steale away vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene from the very thought of it; which otherwise by little and little growes sharpe and contentious in our minde, and so by its gall, corrupts all which seemes most sweet and pleasing to our pallats. We haue named that heroicall; and this we will tearme mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Vertue, or Temperance, which as <hi>Plato</hi>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:12284:139"/>
said, is a mutuall consent of the parts and faculties of the Soule, which makes reason to follow as a rule, and curbe to all licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and vnbridled desires: the which <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> calls, <hi>the light,</hi> which chaseth from her all the darknesse and obscurity of passions. This Vertue seemes to me to be wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bold and audacious vnder one, or the other of these descriptions, and differs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the precedent: For she caries the Axe to the rootes, whereas ours is conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to loppe and prune off the twigges and smaller branches. That takes away, and cuts off euill humours, and this diuerts and turnes them vpon some part or member lesse dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. The remedies are not so sharpe, and bitter, and so they serue not but to palliat and sweeten the Euill, or Disease: But the other in the meane time without flattering it, doth at first teare it off, and cuts vpon the quicke, the griefe of a sensible losse by the very edge of his reasons. That is to say; That complaint according to his precepts, is not an action, either iust or commendable. That a wise man should foresee the blowe which threatens him at the very point of the birth of his affection. That succeeding
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:12284:140"/>
yeares, and the sweetnesse of the fauours of Fortune, should not so bewitch or make him drunke, as to cast him into a swoone or le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargie, and be able wholly to shut his eyes to these infallible accidents. There is none but an ignorant person, who findes any thing new. In a word, that this accident was still present with him, and that hauing so often re-chewed this bad meat, hee may in the end accustome himselfe to it, and so resolue to swallow it downe, without any distast or bitternesse.

It some times falls out, that the same reasons issuing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from our mouth or pen, as from theirs, but not from our hearts, and from the very bottome of our breasts.

without tasting or digesting it, so wee onely preferre these words without knowing their price or value. Our too rawe and indigested stomack cannot consume this meat, and draw its nutriment thence. Wee discourse in the same manner, language, and tearmes as they doe, but yet wee thinke differently: Our words are but as the rinds and barkes of our conceptions; it is not enough that the report thereof come to our eares, but the sense must also passe to our vnderstanding: wee must cleaue them in sunder to gather the iuyce and Sugar of them, and to discouer that which they haue in them of secret and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. But our <hi>Morall vertue</hi> diminisheth that which is of the honour of her dignity: shee hath sooner done to stoope and descend downe to vs, then to lift our selues vp to her.

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:12284:141"/>
power of the spirits of our blood, which were assembled &amp; conspired together about our heart, to surmount and vanquish all sorts of consolations, and so to permit onely the enterance of griefes, torments, bitter thoughts, sharpe and cruell remembrings, and other Officers of comfortlesse sorrow and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. So this power being diuided, is thereby so weakened, that the first obiect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing capable to enflame, &amp; touch our thoughts to the quicke; hee easily takes possession of the place, and banisheth this importunate <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> from the seate and Empire which he had violently vsurped. This remedy as the most sweet and pleasing, is the most generall and vniuersall physicke which shee employes in the cure of violent'st passions. All diseases of the minde are not cured, but either by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion, or by the equall sharing and diuision of our imagination, in whose power resides all that they participate of, sharpe, or bitter; because shee assembles, and linkes together all the spirits of the soule, which are perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purified and refined, in the admirable nets which lye vnder the ventricle or posteriour part of the braine, to marke him out the greatnesse of his euill or disease, which it
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:12284:141"/>
augments, and encreaseth by this labour and paine; as fire doth by the aboundance and affluence of wood: And if this imagination can be diuided by the force and strength of a contrary obiect, shee thereby makes her selfe weake and feeble in her functions, and contrariwise in the ease or paine, the good or euill which wee may feele. The <hi>minde</hi> is a power which communicates her selfe wholly to the subiect to which shee is fixed &amp; tyed: From whence it comes, that we many times see her equally tormented at obiects of small value, as at those things of farre greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence. The good which enuironeth vs, is not considerable to him, in comparison of a little euill, which at present presseth and afflicteth him. And not being able to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise this sorrowfull matter, before hee haue let gone all the others, hee then vnites and fastens, yea glewes himselfe thereunto, vntill he become drunke with this griefe: And as the <hi>Horseleach</hi> still suckes out all the bad bloud vntill hee burst: So the minde suckes and drawes hence all that is bitter, vntill this poyson hauing engendred a kinde of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postume in our heart, doth in the end burst therewith, and frees her selfe thereof by our
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:12284:142"/>
teares, which distill and descend from our eyes. If the rayes of the Sunne are fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in the bottome of a burning Looking-glasse, they there vnite in their centre, and their power straying and defusing before they are recollected, and assembled in this point, doe so linke and fortifie themselues, that they burne and destroy that which so sweetly they had formerly cherish'd and nourished: Right so, if the minde assemble all her po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, and her intellectuall rayes in the force and strength of imagination, as in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall of a Looking-glasse, it destroyeth the tranquillity, which it reuiued before by her benigne and gratious influences, the which she generally owes to all the members of the body, and whereof she cannot wholly dispose to the seruice of the one without the domage and preiudice of the others. As it visibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls those who newly feele some griefe or anxiety, or to those who dispose and addict themselues to things which require a strong imagination, as <hi>Poesie, Painting,</hi> or <hi>Perspectiue.</hi> Wee must then without giuing time or lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to our minde, to taste the poyson of this passion, dispierce the rayes of this imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the alluring Charmes of a contrary

obiect. Hee who dies in the heat of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat with his weapons in his hands, hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended &amp; feared nothing lesse then death, for glory is the point of honour; choler, and reuenge, do equally preoccupate his thoughts, and surpasse his imaginations, so as there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines in him no place to feare death. And those who haue attempted to plant the Crosse among Infidells, and cyment and water it with their blood, thereby to make Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to encrease and fructifie, they being pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of this holy zeale, hath not the force and power of their loue surmounted in them the feare of death? Shall I say, that the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of so liuely and so ardent an imagination, by his extreame violence can likewise destroy the common function of the senses, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by pull away the weapons out of the hands of griefe and paine, because the senses make not their operations, but by the helpe of the spirits; which are dispierced in the muscles and arteries, and generally throughout all the body, which may be attracted by a suddaine motion, to this superiour part and place of imagination, so that the members remaine without this interiour operation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without griefe or paine: the which <hi>Celsus</hi>

Or if you will tearme intemperancie to bee the daughter of pleasure and voluptuousnes: say then withall that shee is <hi>cruell,</hi> and a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide,</hi> because by her life she giues vs death, and doth hugge and embrace vs so fast, that shee strangles vs: Contrariwise, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

sharpens her desire, and caries vs into the very bosome of true pleasure, yet not to engage our soule there, but to please her, and not to lose her, but to finde her. Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this vertue, mee thinkes it may be said of her, as of <hi>Bacchus, that shee is twice borne.</hi> Her first birth shee deriues from Vice, as he doth his from a simple woman; because to ariue to this point, and this mid way where shee is situated, she must necessarily proceed from the one or other of these vitious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames, which are neighbours to this Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: For hee which is not yet liberall, or bountifull, before he be, he must either be a niggard or a prodigall; But afterwards, shee ripeneth and perfecteth his being in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and vigour of the Wise mans minde and opinion, as the Sonne of <hi>Semele</hi> in the thighes of <hi>Iupiter.</hi> Strange effects of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted nature, which from the infected wombe of Vice snatcheth Vertue, and from that of Vertue likewise drawes Vice.

Wee must haue wonderfull strong reynes to keepe our temperance firme in this passage; for if shee passe or slide neuer so little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond these fixed and appointed limits, shee shall presently finde her selfe to bee in the way and tracke of vice. Two enemies are still at her sides and elbowes, who watch for her ruine and destruction. If shee recoyle or aduance neuer so little, shee is instantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domaged either by the one or the other, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by excesse or defectuosity: But as to strike the white, there is but one way; but many, yea, an infinite number to misse it: So for vs to walke to this perfect felicity, there is but this only way; whereas to misse it, and to fall into the one or the other of these vitious extreames, wee may doe it by infinite wayes and courses.

If the name and vertue of the vanquisher, do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reioyce and comfort the losse of the vanquished; and afford him some degree and thought of glory, by a farre stronger rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the power and courage of the vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed should augment the renowne and glory of the victorious.

But contrariwise, <hi>Temperance</hi> fights with a bold and firme foote, and with a cheerefull and ioyfull countenance in the heat of the Combat; and hauing vanquished her Enemie, takes pleasure to vanquish and surmount her selfe.

If <hi>Montaigne</hi> (that excellent Iudge of humane actions) had approued and tried the nature of either sexe, as <hi>Tiresias</hi> did, hee would decide this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their disaduantage, when hee said, that it is not in the power of a Woman, no, nor of Chastitie her selfe, to preuent and hinder her from desires. But desires not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding may very well violate their chastity without infringing, or making a breach in their continencie, which hardneth and fortifies it selfe the more, at their abord and meeting. It is true, that this vertue of chastitie, besides the delicacie of their dyet, the sweetnesse of their sexe, the charmes of idlenesse, the liberty and freedome wherein they are bred and brought vp; as also their beauty, and the affections, seruices, vowes, and prayers of those Louers who research and solicite them, should make the base in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiablenesse, and courage of men, to blush for shame, who abandon themselues to all sorts of beastly voluptuousnesse and sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and onely attend and expect, that snow-white

Of a <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> I intend not to become a woman, to prescribe him such seuere and rigorous Lawes: For so farre forth as hee forget not himselfe, and fall a sleepe in the breast and lap of voluptuousnesse; hee as a generous <hi>Vlysses,</hi> may gather the palmes of Victory in the same field, where the intemperancie of his companions haue buried their glory and reputation. I haue lesse labour to consider the vertue of <hi>Xenocrates,</hi> in his refuse and flight, from the embraces of that faire Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizan, then in the bosome of the enioyance of this pleasure and voluptuousnesse: and I much doubt, if with an indifferent eye, hee could behold the rich Cabinet of beautie and voluptuousnesse: in no other manner then he did the faire front of his house. We cannot easily stay our selues, when wee are allured or moued. The force of a Horse is best knowne, when hee makes a round and neat stop, or stay. To auoyd passion, there needes but a little constraint: but after wee

are embarqued therein, then euery corde drawes. <hi>Continencie</hi> hath nothing to reuenge her selfe, but of the eyes, and of some weake desires: but <hi>temperance</hi> findes our thoughts, heart, and all the sinewes of the minde, bent to serue <hi>Voluptuousnesse,</hi> and by the shewe of this maiesticall power, separates the two Chiefetaines which were in contestation and difference, sending the one and the other peaceably to their homes, without any other obstinate desire of reuenge or quarell. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie performes nothing but despight her selfe, shee drawes concupiscence after her with griefe and vexation, and aduanceth not, but with blowes and bastinadoes: all her beauty is but in shewe and exteriour appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; for within she is onely a painted and a feigned beauty: Let vs see her interiourly; Shee entertaines and nourisheth a thousand contrarieties: There is in her, hatred, loue, and repentance. Shee teares her selfe in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and morsells, and makes her selfe bloudie with her owne hands. It is a <hi>Saturne,</hi> who eates and deuoures his owne children; for shee nourisheth her selfe of her owne bloud, and feedes onely on her owne proper bowels and entrailes. The continent man is forsaken

But his courage hauing loosed and slacked the reines to his affection, vpon the prostitution of so many delicious and amorous dainties, he then made a short stay and stand; returned to his former minde and resolution, takes his leaue of her without reluctation or sorrow, and by his pleasing, and yet generous cariage constraines the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie of this faire <hi>Princesse,</hi> to accompany him forth to the gate of her owne Pallace.

how much easier is it not to enter, then to come forth, and depart in this manner: The Vice is not to enter, but not to bee able to come forth, said <hi>Aristippus,</hi> going into a Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizan. With a very small force and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, wee may at first stop the motions of these emotions; but when they are once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, wee are but too too naturally subiect to follow them.

correct and chastise Vice, could defend the blowes, if wee turned them against her selfe. For wherein doth she employ her selfe, but to afflict vs in thinking to heale and cure vs. When we are in perfect health, shee doth so often againe assaile and touch vs, that in the end shee changeth our good disposition and welfare. Her false Councels turnes into true afflictions, which shee afterwards fights not against, but onely feignedly. If shee raise vs vp a degree aboue others; wee thereby see euils and afflictions farther off then they do: and at the very instant and moment, that we fore-see them; wee haue neede to remedy them, because th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And when with the same lance she can cure this wound, is the Physitian to bee commended, who wounds and offends the health of his sicke Patient, thereby to make shewe of his skill and sufficiencie? But yet so farre is hee from curing vs, that our minde is easily shaken, and can afterwards very difficultly resolue, with firme footing to support this phantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call enemie, and imaginarie euill and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But if any simple, or earthly man (who hath no other obiect in his thoughts, then

that which hee hath before his eyes) runnes the same fortune which we doe to the disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, which wee haue fore-seene and predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, then this his stupidity hath no neede of remedy, but at the very blowe and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.

                  </gap> vs with her sweetest consolations. Shee tells vs, That it is but a cloud; That the least winde can beate off this storme and tempest, before it fall on our heads: That the inconstancie of Fortune, as often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues our feares as our hopes. But who is hee, who in the expectation of an euill or affliction, can purely rellish and taste the sweetnesse of comfort and ioy which enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron him. This sharpe remembrance, hath it not bitternesse enough in it, to make it seeme sower and distastfull. This affliction holdes vs fast by the coller of our doublets, and hee therewith stoopes the <hi>Philosopher</hi> as well as the Clowne. The Goute, and Stone doe equally afflict and offend them: All our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are left behinde the doore, and there is but onely our sense and feeling, which is of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:12284:152"/>
this scot and company. But yet I will pay the <hi>Philosopher</hi> more soundly and seuerely then the Clowne: For that considereth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but that which he feeles. His ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite is colder, and therewithall more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to griefe and paine. And this, hauing the spirits of his blood more refined, and subtilized, by the labour of his meditation, as also his sense and feeling more tender and delicate, the liuely image of paine workes as much, yea a greater power and effect in him by his imaginary impression, as by his point and reality. So this fore-sight serues for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but to drawe those miseries neere vs, which are farthest from vs; and then very difficultly can she cure, our other present and naturall discommodities, because she cannot well ease and comfort her owne. If shee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to appease the burning fire of the paine which afflicts her, shee then employes, and applies no other Physick, but onely the remembrance of fore-past pleasures. A weak and feeble Remedy, which by this disioynted and lame comparison, insteed of diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; doth exceedingly encrease and augment our paine: As a great fire encreaseth, by throwing a little water in it; so our paine is
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:12284:152"/>
the more incensed and exasperated, by the image and remembrance of pleasure, which presents it selfe to oppose it. This grosse and stupid Ignorance, which giues I know not what manner of patience to present euills and afflictions, and carelesnesse to future sinister accidents, is farre more aduantagious to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature. What neede is there, that vnder the shewe and colour of good, shee should come to discouer vs so tyrannicall a countenance, and wayted and attended on by so many true euills and vexations; and by her vaine and rash enterprise, exposing to our sight the miserable estate of our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Wee can neuer truly knowe our iust weight, but in lifting our selues vp aboue the ground. He who is well, remoues not (sayes the Italian prouerbe.) Nature had placed vs in a very firme and sure degree, where wee ought to haue stayed. Wee could not haue fallen from thence, because it was the lowest step. Man thinking to raise and eleuate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe higher, hath prepared the danger of his owne fall: Shee hath more liuely imprinted in our fancies their weight and greatnesse; then the reasons and meanes to vanquish them. I graunt that this Knowledge is the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:12284:153"/>
sweetest foode of the minde, and that mans chiefest felicity, proceedes from meditation. But was it not farre better to haue exhausted and dried vp the head spring: sith from thence is flowne the torrent of our miseries and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. The wisest and subtillest <hi>Philosophie</hi> is but folly to <hi>God,</hi> and because wee are vpon reprehensions and reproaches, wee may also accuse it to be guilty, for the defect of those who haue separated and withdrawen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from the bosome of the Church: It had beene better to haue failed to doe well, for feare of some small euill which might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue; because wee farre more sensibly feele griefe then pleasure. To man there is nothing more visible then good, nor more sensible then euill. We shal as litle feele a long health, as the sweetnesse of a quiet and profound sleepe, without dreames or interruption. If we are troubled and tormented with an Ague, that day which it ariued to vs, shall of all the yeare be marked, either with capitall or ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick letters. Our thoughts fix and tye them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues thereunto, and they disdainfully steale ouer all the rest without seeing them, and stop at nothing, but at this displeasing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. In his health and possession, he
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:12284:153"/>
is peaceable of all other good things, as those great riuers, who in their beds and course, commonly make small noyse; and of his griefe, it is as of those impetuous torrents and inundations, which commonly by their precipitated motions, astonish with their noyse and violence, all those who dwell neere them. Man knowes not his own good, but by the absence and want thereof. Hee cannot soundly iudge, or esteeme of health, but in his sicknesse: Contrariwise, the point of <hi>griefe</hi> and <hi>paine,</hi> by reason of the feare we haue thereof, which is as the shadow (yea the true shadow, which followes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanceth our body) doth by her presence and his absence still afflict vs. Our senses fall into a swoon and slumber of ioy, and are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer awakened, but by afflictions and sorrow. Also shee is more moueable and inconstant then pleasure. And if any extreame pleasure or voluptuousnesse will awaken vs, and pinch vs with the sense and feeling thereof, it must borrow I know not what point of griefe and paine, which by a pleasing constraint, will drawe from our tongue some tone of weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bewailing. A peaceable life, full of security and assurance, and exempt, and free

The blowes of Fortune make them well remember, that they are dull and stupid men, because our body, and the one halfe of our selues, is a thing which wee possesse not, but at his courtesie and mercie, and whereof she hath farre more right and propriety then we.

But if sicknes and paine, (which is the thunder of Fortune) fall vpon vs; it teares all that it meetes withall, breakes downe our weake baricadoes and defences, and makes vs feele the points and edges of his indignation.

If the body, it is tearmed <hi>good</hi> or <hi>euill</hi>; and there is none but our senses, which haue right to iudge of a Knowledge which is infused to them: and so much, and so long conioyned, that the harmony of the temperaments, is not molested or troubled by any false agreement. If the minde, then it is tearmed true or false, whereof the one caries the figure of good, and the other of euill,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:12284:156"/>
which is that which wee tearme ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which from vniuersall propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, inferres and drawes particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences, and composeth of this collection, reduced in order by iudgement, the Science or Knowledge of things. But the <hi>minde</hi> and the <hi>body</hi> ioyning together in a community, in those things which they had of each other in particular, The minde secures the body, and promiseth to prouide him a Sentinell, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue and watch against the surprises of his Enemie, which is paine, or affliction, by the meane of her care and fore-sight, conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally that shee may participate of the enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of those profits and pleasures, which proceede from her. But this agreement and harmony lasteth not long; for the minde abuseth her selfe; and this abuse is conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into tyrannie: for of a companion that formerly she was, she now becomes Master, and violating the lawes of society, shee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpes vpon the iurisdiction of the senses, beleeuing, that this vsurpation, giues her an absolute right, and full power to iudge of the quality of <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad,</hi> without consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or taking counsell of the senses; and then as shee will iudge that to be either good
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:12284:157"/>
or bad which is not: so will she doe of griefe or pleasure, which was not of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and in the end disposing soueraignly of all, she is ariued to this height and point, to beleeue that those pleasures which were fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len to the lot and share of the senses, were obliged to content and satisfie her insatiable appetite, without informing her selfe, if they had worthily acquited themselues of their charge and functions, which was to appease the hunger and desire of our senses. The which desire, because it is limited within the extent of its obiect, is easily exchanged, and conuerted into tranquillity, and a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enioying thereof. In the meane time, the minde playes the auerse and difficult; still murmures and repines against it, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines man in this perturbation and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which you see. He is become more amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and affectionate to other mens children then to his owne: and this bastard affection of his, serues him as a paire of staires, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by by little and little he descends to the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understanding of himselfe, and then being buried in the darknesse of obliuion, he leaues in prey the inheritance which he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to giue to this community, and renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

his owne which was lawfull, which is the meditation or knowledge of true or false, for as much as in the body of man, the soule may bee capable to foment and cherish the goods or pleasures of her companion. And farther, if their profits or pleasures were of the same quality and nature, when by any misfortune the portion of the one or other were ruined, there would yet in the other lot and portion, remaine enough, to nourish and content them both; As the <hi>Philosopher,</hi> who liuing by the sweat and labour of his owne hands, vaunted that thereby he was yet able to maintaine and nourish another like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. But the foode and nutriment of the one, is not that of the other, for all that which they haue truly in Commons betwixt them, is the harmony which should make this mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke to be composed of spirituall and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things, wherein if either the one, or the other mutinie or rebell, then expect no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther harmony or agreement, for it is nothing else but confusion. But the senses being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by the infused and cleare-sighted light of nature, are better gouerned in their Common-wealth. The one hath enterprised nothing against the other. It neuer happens,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:12284:158"/>
that the eye vndertakes to heare, or the eare to see, if it bee not abusiuely spoken: But since they haue elected this inconstant mind, to gouerne them as their head or Chieftain: they haue reaped and receiued nothing but shame and confusion. The eye findes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be absolutely faire, but that which raritie or opinion, pleaseth to recommend to vs to be so. So the <hi>Rose</hi> and Gilliflower, are nothing in comparison of a flower which growes in the <hi>Indies,</hi> or forraigne Countries. But this <hi>Tyrant</hi> aduanceth yet farther, for he puts them to the racke, and makes them pay deerely for the errour of this their foolish in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion: For the senses dare not embrace that which they prise and affect dearest, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her free consent and permission. If any ticklish desire giue them a contrary motion to that of reason, then the minde lifts vp her hand and staffe, and vseth them so vnkindly and vnworthily, that there is no seruitude or slauery so rigorous. They may well passe without her, and without the fruit of this meditation, which makes it so commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. A pretious Iewell indeed it is, but farre more necessary to this little Common-weale for ornament and decencie, then for absolute
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:12284:158"/>
necessity. For that which is in this manner necessary, is vniuersall and equall, as the heart is necessary to the life of man; Reason is a faculty, which although it haue her roote in the soule: yet she cannot perfect her selfe without the assistance and concurrence of well disposed organes; for the most accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished is but errour: iudge therefore what the most imperfect are, it is but an accident, whose defect changeth nothing the substance of Man. <hi>Plato</hi> was no more a man, then a common Porter was. An inequality which sufficiently testifies, that of absolute necessity it is not necessary to man. But at last, The <hi>Senses</hi> growe rebellious and mutinous, and will proclaime their triumphes, or Holliday in that which concernes their charge or duty of the minde, because the minde so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and soueraignly, vsurpes vpon their iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction; and from this sedition, as from the head spring or fountaine of all euills, flowes the disorder and confusion, which we finde in all things. <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi> are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domaged and damnified by the corruption of the senses, which hauing no more right to iudge of <hi>good</hi> or <hi>euill,</hi> will yet intermeddle to knowe true, or false; as is seene in those
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:12284:159"/>

It is reported, That Mules (who are a third different sort of beasts, which two former haue propagated) are incapable to engender. So those goods or

priuiledges of Nature, which deriue their Being from such different Natures, doe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of themselues engender any good either to the minde, or the body. They are instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereof we indifferently make vse ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to good or euill: and which for the most part serue onely to foment our vices and passions. But as these good things are neuters and indifferent; so the euill which likewise proceedes of his Artifice, ought not to haue greater priuiledges, and therefore the effect which they produce in vs, which we tearme griefe or paine, cannot be tearmed so, but very wrongfully and abusiuely: As imprisonment, banishment, losse of honours: Pouerty offends neither the body, nor the minde, but is the chaine which onely pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth either the one or the other. If the mind complaine, it is too blame, for it belongs to him onely to knowe true or false: If he say that riches are good, and pouerty euill, the senses will giue him the lye thereto, for they complaine not, at least if they doe, they doe it vniustly. If our minde had made this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, to wit; That the oare, or matter of gold, resembles that of earth; or that the difference proceedes not from the mixture
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:12284:161"/>
of qualities and accidents, wee must not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale therein to our senses. Or if the Eye would contradict this proposition, because the colour of earth differs from that of gold, hee should not bee receiued or beleeued as Iudge. If our feeling would adde in his own behalfe, that hee findes the one hard, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther soft; the one smooth, and the other harsh and impollished, yet it were false, and it may be shewed them, that it belongs one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them, to iudge of good or euill, and not of true or false. Wee must not then by the same reason tearme that good or euill, but which onely the Senses will so please to doe, or as true or false, that which it shall please the minde to ordaine: So then there is nothing which will beare the name and quality of paine, but the contrary obiect to the inclination of our feeling thereof, as long as it is present with him, and doth still sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly and extreamely afflict him therewith: So that which is mediocrity, can be suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and endured by the constancie of our vertue, without astonishing or mouing her, and yet neuerthelesse not without offering some outrage and violence to our felicity. But sith she exceedes the powers of patience,

He ingeniously confessed, that
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:12284:162"/>
it was an euill, because all his long study, and time which hee had employed in <hi>Philosophie,</hi> could not secure him from the torment, and lesse againe, from the trouble and impatien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie which griefe and paine brought him. A Sect so rigorous, that as one of them said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It will neither rebate nor diminish any thing of the felicity of a Wise man, although he were in <hi>Phalaris</hi> his Bull: For felicity consists in vertue, and this vertue is the vse of perfect reason, which wee carie to goodnesse. This reason conserues it selfe whole and found in the middes of rackes, torments, and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and consequently this felicity. I contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise say, that so perfect a felicity is imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; and although it were true and reall, that necessarily it is changed by griefe and paine; For the first head heereof, I say, That na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath imprinted in all creatures a desire to compasse their owne ends, whereunto being arriued, they seeme to feele the true perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their being, from which being estran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and separated, they suffer (if wee may say so) some paine in their insensibility. The simple bodies ariue more easily hereunto, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing nothing in them which contradicts this desire. The compounded, as they enclose
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:12284:162"/>
and shut vp many contrary qualities, they cannot attaine to this perfection, because their desires and obiects being different and contrary, one cannot enioy his tranquillity, but with the preiudice of the others: but if it fall out that they are dissolued, and diuided by the fire, then euery one retires to that part, where his desire calls him. But among the compounded, there is none more multiplied then man, because it seemes that nature would assemble in him, as in a small compendium or Epitome: all that which is generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused in all sublunarie bodies; and far<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e the more, because the soule being conioyned with it, she hath brought her desire with her, which tending to an infinite obiect, giues her selfe but small rest, and yet lesse to him of whom she hath the gouernment and conducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Therefore man being composed of so many contrary things, hee nourisheth a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and perpetuall ciuill warre within him: and it is (as it were) impossible for him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease it, because the remedy of the one, is the poyson of the other. Heauen is the center of light things, and Earth of those which are ponderous and heauie; that as the compound of these two still obayes the predominate
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:12284:163"/>
quality, in such sort, that hee cannot ariue to his centre, without offering violence to the least: So besides the contrary inclination of all the compounds, which slide into the structure and fabrique of man; wee must chiefely obserue and remarke these two. Of the party <hi>Inferiour</hi> and <hi>Superiour; Sensitiue,</hi> and <hi>Reasonable,</hi> who incessan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie set fire to all the foure corners of a Citie, and batter it with an intent to ruine and take it: can we beleeue it is in peace, because the Gouernour thereof is in a place of assurance and security: So the minde being farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the assaults and blowes of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, is not a good consequence of tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and perfect felicity; it will remaine then
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:12284:163"/>
imperfect, as man himselfe remaines imper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he should not be man, if he had but one of these parties and priuiledges: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may affirme, that the vse of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect reason, should not be this perfect felicity, if it ioyne not with her the repose and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of her companion the body, which should haue the better part in felicity, because it is he true touchstone of good and euill, as we haue formerly shewed.</p>
               <p>In the second place I say, That put the cause that felicity consists in the vse of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect reason; and that shee cannot long sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize and agree with paine, because all the faculties of the Soule in generall, suffer accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the motions and alterations of the body: So Reason is a materiall and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall effect, which hath her roote in the soule, and which cannot perfect her selfe: but by the benefit of the organes, and the temperate concurrence of the refined spirits of the bloud, which if they are of too great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or quantity, then they subuert, embroyle, yea confound themselues, and become bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish and beastly, as you see they doe by excesse of wine or sleepe. And if there bee any defect, they degenerate into capricious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:12284:164"/>
or weakenesse of braine and ratiocina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But aboue all, she depends of the good disposition of the organes, the minde being more liuely and actiue in health then sicknes. A sweet and cleare ayre, and a faire day doth cleare and consolidate the iudgement, shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens our wit, dispelleth melancholly, makes our reason more masculine and vigorous, and in a word, makes vs ciuiller and honester men. Reason is engendered, and growes with our body, their powers are brought vp together, and wee know that its infancie, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, maturity, age, and decrepitude, doe commonly follow the age and temper of the body: And what then if this body bee affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with griefe or paine, shall shee not feele it? What shall wee say of those whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse and violence of paine, caries them to swooning and convulsions, which proceedes and happens, because the spirits of bloud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing changed by this violence, doe diuert themselues from their ordinary course, and put themselues into disorder and confusion in the organ; so that they hinder their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular function. There is no point of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome so pure, which can hinder this trouble, or secure it selfe from it, because it cannot
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:12284:164"/>
resist the power of sleepe. But perfect reason subsisteth nor but by this well-gouerned function of the spirits, for that ceasing shee also ceaseth. But O yee <hi>Stoickes,</hi> what will be your felicity in torments! If your reason forsake you, and play false company with you; what will then become of this Vertue, which no longer knowes her selfe: is this it which she had promised you? Whiles the Enemie sackes you, and Fortune teares and dragges you by the haire, shee will abandon you at neede, and dares not shewe her selfe, but when your Enemies are retired and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished. And yet then shee returnes so weake and trembling, that it seemes shee hath felt the very same blowes which our body hath. What shall we say of those from whom shee hauing beene but once absent, shee neuer had the assurance to returne againe? <hi>Lucretius</hi> a great <hi>Poet</hi> and <hi>Philosopher,</hi> by a loue potion, too sharpe for the palate of Vertue, gaue him occasion to dislodge, and to abandon the place to folly. Faire Felicity, how your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours are difficult to purchase, and easie to lose. Will you so permit, that leuity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and dispose you to the preiudice of that <hi>fortitude</hi> and <hi>constancie,</hi> whereof you
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:12284:165"/>
make profession: you say that you are a daughter of <hi>Heauen</hi>; and can you therefore suffer the affront and disgrace of this daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Earth,</hi> I meane Fortune, that she dragge you Captiue, and proudly triumph of your spoyles: At least, if this <hi>Stoicall</hi> Vertue could ingender a degree of leaprosie in our sense and feeling: shee hereby might make head, and oppose against Fortune: but shee is so farre from it, as she sharpens it, and makes it more sensible to the Arrowes that she shoots at vs: And to shewe more clearely and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly how this poyson of paine and griefe runnes into the superiour party, which wee tearme reasonable, and so infects it with its contagion: wee must knowe that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary qualities, which concurre and meete in the <hi>compound,</hi> would neuer subsist toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if they were not attoned and agreed by a third party; who participating both of the one and the other, doth thereby entertaine them, and appease their enmity and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And Nature could neuer haue sowed or tyed to man, two such contrary peeces, without the ayde and assistance of a third, which are the purest and most subtillest spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the bloud; which hold fast, and tye
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:12284:165"/>
themselues to the abundance and affluence thereof, by the grossest part which is in them, and to the soule by that which is purest in it, and which holds fast, and stayes in this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the body: So that prouided that this third be not offended; Man still maintaines himselfe. He can liue without reason, as the Sunne can doe towards vs, and in our <hi>Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spheare,</hi> without enlightning vs with his rayes and beames, whiles hee is eclipsed with so blacke, and thicke a cloude, that it cannot pierce forth to our eyes; because reason is as the eye of the soule, which shines not forth openly and brightly to vs, if it meete with any obstacle or interposition. If the legges or armes of a man be wounded, or cut off, he may yet support himselfe, and liue: But when this third is excessiuely endomaged, and that hee hath forsaken the match; then the body being too corpulent and massiue, hauing no more hold-fast of the soule, is constrained to forsake and abandon her. This third therefore serues as an <hi>Interpreter</hi> both to the one and the other. Hee giues the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to vnderstand the will of the <hi>soule,</hi> and to the <hi>Soule,</hi> the appetites and desires of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. All that generally befalls man, is diuided
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:12284:166"/>
by this third, which sends to the one and the other their part and portion. If paine afflict the body, it spreads and runnes through all the spirits to the very soule; as by a sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous match, lighted at both ends; and at the same instant sets fire euery where, as well in the superiour as the inferiour part, where she offends and outrageth both the senses, and reason. Thus paine hauing then past and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into reason, it there troubleth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and changeth the felicity of the <hi>Stoick.</hi> So that the voyce of that <hi>Philosopher,</hi> who cryed out, <hi>O Paine, I will not say that thou art sharpe or euill:</hi> is not a sufficient testimony of his victory ouer it. It is a Souldier which hee hath taken in the middest of the conflict and combat: but yet hee dragges our <hi>Philosopher</hi> as his prisoner after him. A Captiue who spets iniuries in her Masters face, is yet no lesse his Slaue: Hee who willingly obeyes not, is more rigorously handled, and the Wise man who armes himselfe against a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paine or griefe, hath not so cheape a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine as our selues, because it is still ill done of vs to incense an enemie, who hath in his hands the power and meanes to offend vs. To put this <hi>Constancie</hi> as she is depainted by
