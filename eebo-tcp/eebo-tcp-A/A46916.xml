         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Touching the Letters themselves, I wil not at this time say any thing, but leave it to the most wise and holy God to direct the wife in heart to codsider them.</p>

            <p>The good Lord I beleeve; assuredly wil as he hath faithfully promised to my Soul, break every yoak of sinfull Covenant, in me, 'tis no grief of heart but true joy, yea wonderfully more

Oh shame with your blindness herein; is God become as blinde as you, who cannot judge but by carnal appearance, and will you limit him to your selves? that eye never saw: Prophets nor Prophesies, Christ nor Apostles: but this is all you know of God or his Word, his Iudgments and Kingdom, who are blind and deaf, as to the invisible: and so the visible and carnal Iudges, judging God to be like your selves, imagines self to be in the Kingdom; but the blind and deaf, comes not there in that state.

            <p>AS <hi>now</hi> the living God, is visiting, and gathering his seed out of bondage and confusion, so hath he been ever doing from the time of the manifesting his pleasure in that word of Grace, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.

That seed of whom its said, <hi>A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation,</hi> Psal. 22. 30.) <hi>This seed</hi> hath the most high been gathering since the time of their first scattering, and for that cause (among others) is <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> said to be the same yesterday, to day, and for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 8. being the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 8. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle witnessing in the second of the <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13. that he, and others, had received the same spirit of Faith (with those who had been before) reciting for testimony, and proof hereof, a passage of the Psalmes; <hi>I beleeved, therefore have I spoken;</hi> we also beleeve, therefore speak. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not a <hi>new</hi> thing (implyed in the word <hi>Now)</hi> that God is doing, but that which was from the beginning, which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less every day shall be more and more perfected, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally then, when that other Angel shall fly in the midst of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 6</note> preaching the antient (or everlasting) Gospel, to them that dwel on the earth, and to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, whose appearance shall be with great power, the earth being enlightned with his glory; which day the <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Against the appearance of which day, the old Serpent, the Devil, is at work in the form of an Angel of light, that he might seem to be the enlightner of the earth with a glory, like unto the glory spoken of before; if it were possible thereby, to deceive the very elect, under the great and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious shew and pretence of piety and sanctity: And as no other cover or cloathing can become him, pretending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:39770:8"/>
an Angel of light; so no other shape or appearance, can endanger the very elect <hi>(they which are so indeed)</hi> but such an appearance as this. Therefore our blessed Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> speaking of the last times, and forewarning his Scholars and followers touching false Christs, and false Prophets which should arise, saith, <hi>If any man shall say unto you, lo here is Christ, or there, beleeve it not, for there shall arise false Christs, and false Prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders, insomuch that if it were possible, they should deceive the very Elect. Behold I have told you before, go not forth, beleeve it not,</hi> Math. 24. 23, 24, 25, 26. <hi>but take you heed, behold I have foretold you all things,</hi> Mark 13. 21, 22, 23. <hi>Take heed lest any man deceive you,</hi> Mark 13. 5, 6. 2 <hi>Col.</hi> 8. 18. <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 23. <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 8. <hi>Take heed you be not deceived; for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near, goe ye not therefore after them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Great cause have therefore all the followers of the Lamb (the true and only Lord Jesus) to take heed how they heare, and who they hear, and whom they follow, and go after, trying the spirits whether they be of God, forasmuch as many false spirits are gone into the world, and the enemy is at work, knowing he hath but a short time, and his actings, are not so much, amongst us in the form &amp; shape of a Dragon (by outward force and hostility) as in the form of a Serpent, saying now as of old to <hi>Eve, yea, hath God said?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is necessary therefore, that the witnesses and followers of Christ, be jealous over themselves, and over each other, with a godly jealousie, lest by any means, as the Serpent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled <hi>Eve</hi> (through his subtlety) so their minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ, provoking one another, and stirring up one another, that as we have received Christ <hi>Iesus</hi> the Lord, that so we walk in him, rooted and built up in him, and established in the Faith, as we have been taught, not being moved away from the hope of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>And it is the desire of my soul, that both the Reprover, and others of his mind, were at leasure to consider seriously and calmly, whether the Serpent may not be at work in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:39770:9"/>
them, and making use of them as once he did of <hi>Eve</hi> (in her innocency and simplicity) to bring about his end, though they themselves may not be aware thereof.</p>
            <p>Touching the Reprovers Paper, it contains such a bundle of Arrows, and they so sharpened at the Philistins forge, that they are greatly provoking, and can scarce be medled withal without begetting their like; a most undesired and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing return: And were it not for the Truths sake that suffers, and for the Reprovers sake, that he may see what yet he sees not, (if God peradventure may give him repentance for his sinful rashness) I should not trouble my self to write, nor him to read these lines.</p>
            <p>A few things amongst many I shall set free from his false glosses, and the rest shall submit to further tryal, knowing, that he before whom all things are naked, and will try the work by fire, of what sort it is, will manifest a righteous judgement in his day.</p>

As for thy reproachful words cast upon my paper, I leave it to clear it self, in the sight of the wise; and for the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listims forge, I never were at it, so thou may reprove thy self till thou prove that I was.

Let it be seen what a Kingdom it is thou be rest witness to, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thy rest be in the poluted, or where no polution cometh: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing is, because I set down the word wonder for more wonder, and such like words thou art carping at; and because I omitted, one thou knowst not, I say a Lye is better omitted then set down: But if it be such a fault to miss a word, or a sillable, when thou hast the substance; then first judge thy self, who in printing her Letter, hath missed both in words and sense, as I can shew her hand against thee herein, were it worth contending about: Thou tells of searching the Scriptures Berean like; I say the Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans did not search the Scriptures to oppose the light, nor to deny that spirit that reveals things to come, but those who search the Scriptures to that end, must needs be left blind, as they are found blinde; And for thy unbelief in that spirit, that giveth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge without outward appearance, I say, thou might have spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to have written to me of it, for I knew it before of thee, and all that oppose the light, then must, own the light that leads out of the world, and thy own imaginations, before thou know the spirit of Revelation, or believe in it; yet all thou knows with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, is but as thou knows naturally, or bruit beasts, and in that knowledge is unbelief, opposition, and death with which the spirit of Iudgement is rebuked, and shut out from Ierusalem, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth in the flesh, and speaks evil of the spirit of light, that leads to mercy, and is the light of Ierusalem; which hath no other light but it which all the world is at enmity with: Thou says at our last conference I moved thee to write, so thou hast prepared these ensuing Queries: I say, Deceipt speaks, I moved thee to answer what was then in hand, not to Query, which first thou might have done, and then queried; But the latter is of more advantage to the Tempter, and hath been in all ages; yet thy queries I shall answer.</p>

            <p>Touching the word (wonder) instead of more wonder, or thy omission of those words [one thou knewest not] thou hast very weakly or willfully mistaken in making the <hi>Emphasis</hi> to lie there, for those Passages were recited amongst others, to shew how unfairly thou hadst done when thou saiest (it is said) (or she sayes) when it appears it was not so said, but thou very well knowest that the force and <hi>Emphasis</hi> of my words lay between thy <hi>(writing)</hi> to one thou knowest not, and <hi>(laying an heavy charge)</hi> on one thou never knewest, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thee an instance in Gods dealing with <hi>Sodom,</hi> which thou canst not forget: But to mend the matter, thou hast not yet shewed which of the Prophets or Apostles thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest be likened unto for doing the like.</p>
            <p>Hast thou not found a cover for that other omission of thine (to wit the redemption of the body) by which thou variedst both words and sence, cannot that be excused? or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou hope it will be forgotten.</p>
            <p>Though thou concludest me under the like guilt with thy self, yet I assure thee in the words of truth and soberness, I
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:39770:16"/>
know not of one word wherein I have varied from the Copy which was sent me, if thou wilt shew it, I shall acknowledge it.</p>
            <p>Touching the Queries thou hast done friendly in that thou hast answered them, but its not satisfactory to me, forasmuch as they come without proof for confirmation by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, contrary to what was desired.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To the first thou saiest, yea but provest it not, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of saying what it is, thou sayest what it does, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est miss there also; for it is the Spirit, the Comforter that doth convince the world of sin, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 8. <hi>viz.</hi> of unbeleef, but all men have not the spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. nor are they so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced <hi>viz.</hi> of unbeleef.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To the second its said the life and light are one, this should have been proved to be so in the subject (man) for its not denied to be so in God: That life was the light of men, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 4.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To the the third, that light is sufficient to all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and follow it, but to the unbeleeving and dis-obedient a Rock of offence and a stone of stumbling even to the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou hast here departed from the question (which inquires whether the light wherewith every man is inlightned be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient (as it is in man) to lead him to the discovery of Christ, without any other means of discovery, and thou for answer sayest, as above is said. Now it is evident that what is so said by thee touching the sufficiency and efficacy of the light, is spoken of Christ the light, that precious living stone, who is precious to all that beleeve, but is a rock of offence, and a stone of stumbling to the unbeleeving and dis-obedient, as it is witnessed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. this light (the Lord Jesus) is certainly sufficient to lead every one beleeving on him into the light of life, according to <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 12.</p>
            <p>If therefore by the light in every man thou doest intend Christ, the Rock, the chief Corner-stone, the precious living stone, as he is called, <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. let it not be any longer hid under the name and cover of the light of Christ, as if some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing were intended which were not Christ, but off or from
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:39770:17"/>
him which would lead to him, but let it be plainly said, that Christ the light is in every man (for so much is inferred in thy answer to this third Query, or else no answer at all is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to it) and let but the Scripture witness and prove the same, and there shal be an end for ever of all controversie between thee and me, touching the sufficiency of that light (Christ) for I am onely trying how far the Candle in man must vail its lustre, when this glorious Sun, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ the light appears.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To the fourth, Thou speakest words, but makest not any answer to the Query, not shewing whether the seed that's said to be in Prison, and to groan, be a Talent of grace in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that's born into the World, as aforesaid by natural generation, <hi>viz,</hi> (then when they are so born) or whether it be in any one before they be regenerate and born again, and what that seed is? but instead of answering directly thou reflects upon my confusion and ignorance, which is a very easie way of answering but edifies not, but I will leave it with thee, heartily wishing thou hadst been more plain and free herein (sparing thy censure.)</p>
            <p n="5">5. To the fifth, Its said perfection is Christ Jesus, and his life made manifest in mortal flesh, yet thou mayest read where he who witnesseth that Christ lived in him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. and had the life of Jesus Christ manifested in his mortal flesh, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 10. 11. yet counted not himself to have apprehended nor to have attained to perfection, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12, 13. therefore thou art not full nor plain in this answer, besides the omission of the last clause of the Query, or couching it in obscurity in those words, <hi>viz.</hi> (and self-denied, dead, and buried, and there is no sin) but this signifies not to me any thing by way of answer. Its hard for thee to conclude this Query (as the fore-going) without another censure, but I will not write after thy Copy herein.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To the last, Thou shewest (as in the first) what it <hi>(doth)</hi> in fallen man, as also in man renued, when redeemed and join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God, but sayest not at all what, it is, either in the one or in the other, nor how it is distinguished from the spirit of God, called the spirit it self, bearing witness with our spirit, which were the terms in the last Query, to which thou seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:39770:17"/>
to make answer but speakest not to the thing in hand.</p>
            <p>Thus I have considered the several things proposed in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, and as I beleeve, so have I spoken, concluding the answers to be neither plain nor pertinent, and altogether without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation or proof by any Text of Scripture as was desired, and therefore to me no way satisfactory.</p>
            <p>Touching the Queries sent from thee, to which thou desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest answer in plainness, I would say at present a few words.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It seems to me unreasonable to be put upon answering to a new stock of Queries, while the former are depending, and no accompt given how far the answers are allowed, or dis-allowed, which by this thou wilt be informed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the former were more fully answered, which I expect, yet the fruitlesseness of this new undertaking is so apparent that it much discourageth me in the thought of it; forasmuch as the glory of God doth not appear to me to be propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the end of the inquirer, not asking as one unsatisfied, or desiring information, for that hath been dis-avowed by him already both in word and writing, in great measure, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that respect ought rather to have been put as certain positions then propounded as Queries by him.</p>
            <p>Further, The Inquirer hath already past a sentence upon me, concluding my insufficiency toward such an undertaking: im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in those many and repeated censures of blindness and confusion, knowing naturally as a bruit-beast with such like. What issue then can be expected whatever should be said in answer by such an one that is so fore-judged; therefore they appear to me, as they are stated between thee and me, to be fitted for matter of strife, and debate, and contention, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then matter of edifying: And that I am sure is not for the honour of God to be so exercised; therefore if thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est intend true, honest edifying, turn thy Queries into so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny positions, let them be asserted and proved, and leave the issue to him that teacheth to profit.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nevertheless, if thou shalt review thy answers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them with the Queries whereunto they have refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, rectifying that wherein they are defective, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming what thou hast or shalt say by testimony of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:39770:18"/>
I doubt not but my God will make it of use to me, notwithstanding all thy hard words, and give me freedom to entertain these thy 6 or rather 26 Queries, for so they appear to me, every one containing many in it, and to give such an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer thereunto as he shall please to inable me, or if thou shalt refuse to proceed as aforesaid; yet in process of time thou mayest meet with what is equivalent to whats propounded, though not in thy figure nor form, touching which thou mayest have occasion to manifest thy witness.</p>

            <p>FRiend, thou sayes my answer is not satisfactory to thee, I say my answer is so plain as I can speak the truth to the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city yea the least that beleeve in the light shall confesse plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in them; but there is a nature that will never be satisfied with any lesse then an advantage to blaspheme the truth; how often these was resisted by Christ in plainnesse thou mayest read, yet never could rest till they forced their ends from him, and then they said they need no more, though all they had then catcht, was their own ruine, and their posterity, by seeking to insuare him whose love was such as to lay down life for them, and the same love in what measure soever it is, finds the same entertainment with such as abide in that unbeleeving nature, which is for death, and that I am not sent to feed which is for famine, and fire; it sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies me that I faithfully bear testimony to the faithfull and true witnesse; which the father in his eternal love hath sent into the world, which both thou and all that oppose it shall be made to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse of Salvation is in it, even the light, and though he hath sent me with a message, every where spoken against; yet I know I am accepted with him and at that day I and my testimony shall be owned, though now I am as a sign and a wonder to be spoken against; and as one at strife with the whole earth, yet in peace with him alone, and with as many as lay down their Crowns at his feet.</p>

There is not any thing in thy Letters lies upon me, wherein I have not dealt plainly with thee in, before the Lord, not covering but laying open, to the simplicity, onely one thing thou hast twice demanded of me, to shew thee which of the Prophets or Apostles I am like, in sending the Lords Message to on whose faced ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver see in the flesh. I said before what might have satisfied, one who pretends to know Seripture, but seeing its a particular proof thou seekest, I shall (of many) instance of either one which thou mayest see in <hi>Jeremy 27.</hi> and <hi>Col. 2. 1.</hi> with <hi>4. 16</hi> this is what God did; but if thou wilt now undertake to limit him, thou shalt know that his own remains for ever.</p>
            <p>Instead of answering of my Queries, thou sayest it seems un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable to be put upon answering new while the former are depending, I say if the dependency hang in this, till thou say thou be satisfied, then thou hast all in thy own will; then an end till thou will, or not will; but reason sayes thus in me, seeing I have been put upon answering all along both by word and writing, and could never refuse to answer in the plainest way I could, though not accepted; yet that thou should once (amongst many) return an answer in thy way, which if it be more plain then mine, the simple may more profit thereby, but if thine prove as dark, then why should thou condemn me therein, unlesse thou will wholly be judge both for me and thy self, so let them come forth, and let the simple judge.</p>
            <p>Also thy reason speaks not clear to me in this, that thou questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the fruitlessnesse of my Queries, and that the glory of God doth not appear to thee to be the end of them; I say if thy eye<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had been single, thou should first have questioned thy own and by searching that with the Impartial light, thou might have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if thou would, to have suffered me to have shared a little with thee in thy Charity, seeing there is not one reason thou alledgest against me, but they may fit thy self being rightly applied.</p>

            <p>FRiend, if I had (only) said thy answer was not satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and had not shewed thee wherein, I had said (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) that which signifies nothing; or were not my spirit free, that what hath been spoken in secret, might be published up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the house top; I mean, that what hath been transacted privately, and personally between thee and me, in relation thereunto, might be publikely manifested before (not only the least, but) any, or all the children of the light, that they might impartially give evidence to the plainness, or obscurity, which will appear to be in the same: I sa<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, were it not thus with me, I should have as little satisfaction in my self, as I have declared to have had in these Answers of thine; And to give the assurance that it's not in my heart to ensnare thee or force my ends from thee, or seek any advantage to Blaspheme the truth, as they who resisted Christ (all which are hints of great reflection) I am upon this score resolved (in the power of the Lord) not to be easily drawn to this kinde of personal entercourse any further; only for the present let me say I am far from desiring that thou shouldest feed what's appointed for famishing, or that, that which is for fire, or death, should scape it; let it be far from me, let that which is for burning, be burnt, for famishing be famished, for death, let it not live; but all this in the power of the Lord, and by the fire of his kindling, whose fire shall surely try the work of what sort it is, not mans day, but Gods, must silence and satisfie.</p>

               </note> me in either of my letters, neither will the letters themselves shew any such demand of mine; But is there <hi>only one</hi> thing demanded of thee? Is there not another beside that <hi>one</hi> thing, as much and as oft demanded as the former? I spare to repeat it a third time, its visible to every eye that peruseth the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:39770:19"/>
Papers, that there hath been no plainness manifested therein, nor the thing it self so much as taken notice of, though thou hast been twice reminded thereof.</p>
            <p>And as for that one thing touching which thou givest par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Proof, after twice minding thee thereof, though not demanding it of thee, when I consider what thou art to prove, and compare it with the proofs, I find not that, said, which thou produces them to bear witness unto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The words under consideration are these,</hi> viz. <hi>I therefore do the more wonder how thou durst adventure upon one thou knowest not, to lay such an heavy charge as thou hast done on me, whose face thou never sawest; if now thou hast thus written by revelation (to me) or by information from others, consider from whence it cometh; I say consider whether either the Apostles or Prophets thou art like herein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Proof of this thy practice, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>laying an heavy charge on one thou never knewest nor sawest, and that by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> thou producest an example of each, one Prophet, <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> 27. and one Apostle, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 1. compared with 4. 16. upon the perusal of which examples its very apparent, not to me onely, but to any person that is impartial, that these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are not parallel to the case in hand; for <hi>Ieremy</hi> though he by the command of the Lord did deliver a message, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the purpose of God in subjecting the Nations to the yoke of the King of <hi>Babylon;</hi> yet this message is delivered by word of mouth to the Messengers which came from those Kings to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> ver. 4. there is not a word of any wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, much less of laying any charge of sin upon them, and touching that of <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 1. he that reads shall find much of consolation, exhortation, and confirmation; but the thing in question, namely, laying an heavy charge on them he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew nor saw in the flesh, this is not found in the place aforesaid, nay the contrary was his practice, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 18. 22. I hear that there be divisions amongst you, and I partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it, what shall I say to you, shall I praise you in this, I praise you not.</p>
            <p>For we hear there are some which walk among you disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly working not at all but are busie bodies, <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 3. 11. 12.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:39770:20"/>
together with that in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. it is commonly report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 11. for it hath been declared to me of you my brethren, by them of the house of <hi>Cloe,</hi> that there are contentions among you, thus hee reproves and lays his charge upon persons of whom he had certain knowledge, either by sight or information nor may that passage of Gods dealing with <hi>Sodom</hi> be omitted, <hi>Gen</hi> 18. 21. of which there hath been a remembrance before; so that though there may be a writing to persons under a general consideration, yea though they be such whose faces we have not seen in the flesh yet when we lay a charge of sin upon persons, they ought to be known under the Considerations above-mentioned, by personal knowledge, or true informations as in the example before.</p>
            <p>Touching the answering the Queries sent me, I abide in the same mind still, touching the fruitlesseness thereof, in all appearance as to me: For to strike off a persons legs and then bid him go is not fair, to conclude a person blind, and then to try how hee can see, is the same; this is the case between thee and me, as in my last I hinted; this is the whole of what I have to say to this matter, and the last that Pintend to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thee with here about, the dear and tender Lord, bring eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hidden thing to light, that whatsoever is dark and lies co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered under vails, either not being truly or fully understood, may be unvailed, and unmarked, that the simplicity of the truth, may nakedly appear to bee, as it indeed is in Jesus: So prayeth thy friend, and he that tenders thy Soul.</p>

FRiend, is this the end of thy long profession and all thy knowledge of the living God and his unsearchable ways, That it's become a strange thing to thee, and not to be beleeved, that he should send out his message in word or writing, with but personal knowledge, or information of men? Is this the living God who fils heaven and earth with his presence, whom thou would limit is his Sons and Daughters? Or wilt thou instruct him, or teach him a way to send his will to his creatures?
