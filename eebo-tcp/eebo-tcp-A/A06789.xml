            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Here in an obscure manner, he obserueth the exchange from Spayne to be Sixe pence the <hi>Reall,</hi> as value for value, or the <hi>Par</hi> in exchange, whereby it is lesse (as hee saith:) and hee doth account the price of 8. <hi>Reals</hi> at 51. <hi>Stiuers</hi> in Holland, and the <hi>Rate</hi> of exchange at 33. shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings 4. pence Flemish to answer our 20. shillings Starlin as at <hi>Par pro Pari</hi> for those parts, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that 42. shillings 6. pence Flemish payde there for the 5. <hi>Realls</hi> of 8. make 25. shillings 6. pence Starlin according to that Computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; howsoeuer wee see that this is grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the exchange, which is the <hi>efficient Cause</hi> thereof, otherwise the 15. in the hundreth to be gotten in Holland more then in England: is altogether <hi>imaginary</hi> and not <hi>Reall.</hi> For <hi>example</hi> let fiue of these <hi>Realls</hi> of 8. be bought here for <note place="margin">An imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary gayne made Reall of our own meanes.</note> 22. shillings Starlin, and bee transported into Holland, and there buy commodities with the same, according as the price of them, is inhaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced there; no man maketh any doubt, but that the said Commodities are also raised in price, according to the money inhaunced.

Let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of the <hi>Reasons</hi> following.</p>
               <p>First, moneys being vndervalued in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, <note place="margin">Causes of the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballancing of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</note> causeth the price of our home Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities to be abated, and to bee sold better cheape in forraine parts, &amp; is also the cause that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20749:16"/>
our moneys are continually Transported.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the moneys being Transported, taketh away the liuely course of <hi>Traffique</hi> of our said Commodities, and causeth young mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants to Runne by exchanges vpon Bills to maintaine their <hi>Trade,</hi> paying great Interest for money, which they cannot take vp at Vse vpon their single Bond, as they can doe by a Bill of exchange, without Sureties.</p>
               <p>This causeth the said young Merchants and others to make rash Sales of their Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties beyond the Seas, to pay their Bills of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes, whereby they ouerthrow the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets of others, and make them to Sell good cheape.</p>
               <p>So on the contrary, the Coynes being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued in exchange, and also inhaunced beyond the Seas, causeth the price of forraine Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities to be increased more then our home commodities, and our Merchants are compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of course, to make Returne thereby. For they cannot import those ouervalued moneys, but to their exceeding great losse; and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, they finde few Takers, vnlesse it be our young Merchants, which doe consume their Estates by exchanges &amp; Rechanges: <hi>For of the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">English Merchants bereaued of the 2. essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall parts of Trade.</note> 
                  <hi>Three Essentiall Parts of Traffique, we haue but the vse of one, which is the buying of forraine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities to make Returnes homewards, and doth increase the consumption of the said Wares.</hi>

               <p>Moneys remaining hereby plentifull beyond

This money is made daily more plentifull, by our Spanish Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, which doe diuert the <hi>Realls</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> as before hath beene declared: hence it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that our home Commodities, are many times sold better cheape beyond the Seas then here; for although Merchants doe lose thereby, they make account to gaine more, by the low exchange, deliuering their moneys there, or taking of them vp here by exchange, to pay their Bills of exchange at an vndervalue: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that many Merchants hauing no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities there, may take vp money here, and sending ouer the same <hi>in specie,</hi> will pay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <note place="margin">An ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

memory; but in fauour of truth and <hi>Policy,</hi> I am resolued to deliuer my plaine and sincere o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, concerning the said Trade, which began with vs in England immediately after the great Iubile yeare, 1600.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Discourse</hi> made of the <hi>Trade from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land into the East Indies</hi> be truely collected, no <note place="margin">A discourse of the East-India Trade by T. M.</note> doubt the said <hi>Trade</hi> may be found very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table hereafter, albeit it hath beene very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult in the beginning, according to the Prouerb, <hi>Omne principium graue;</hi> especially when the Controuersies betweene vs and the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> shall be determined, and their agreements established.</p>
               <p>For if Pepper doe but cost two pence halfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penny the pound in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and that tenne shillings imployed therein will require but 35. shillings for all charges whatsoeuer to deliuer it in London; where it is vsually sold for aboue 20. pence: It followeth by consequence, that there must be a very great gaine, which will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, when the said parties shall be vnited in <hi>true Loue,</hi> and buy the said Commodities better cheape; and so proportionably for all other <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, drugges, silkes, Indicoes</hi> and <hi>Callicoes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, if one hundreth thousand pounds in money exported, may import the value of 500. thousand pounds Starlin in wares or Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities: albeit England do not spend aboue 120. thousand pounds, and 380. thousand pounds is exported vnto diuers forraine parts, and there
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:20749:19"/>
sold for ready money with great advantage.</p>
               <p>And lastly, if the very Commmodities of the Realme exported into the East Indies, will buy so much as England vseth of their Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the employment is made for forraine Coyne or <hi>Realls</hi> of 8. procured from other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, what man of vnderstanding can iustly finde fault with that <hi>Trade?</hi> If treasure were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported thereby vnto vs, as their finall end, as the <hi>Discourse</hi> saith, but that other Trades do diuert the same? For when the said <hi>Indian</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities are sent from England into <hi>Turkie, Ligorne, Genoway, the Low Countries, Marselleis</hi> and other places, and are sold for ready money: The same is imployed againe vpon <hi>Corints, Wines, Cotton-Wooll</hi> and <hi>Yearne, Galles</hi> and diuers other Commodities, wherewith the Ships bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reladen: yet a great proportion remaineth to be brought ouer in moneys, which are diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from vs, by the course of exchange in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing our moneys, as hath beene declared. The losse whereof is greater to this kingdome, <note place="margin">The losse had by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change yearely, is greater then the East Indie stocke yearely imployed.</note> then all the moneys employed yearely for the East Indies, cometh vnto, which without due consideration, seemeth to bee impossible. So that wee may very well affirme, that by this Trade the Treasure of the Realme can greatly be increased and augmented, reseruing neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse vnto vs the vse of forraine Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at reasonable rates. And therefore is the same by all meanes to be continued, the rather

for that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> haue declared 5. <hi>especiall Reasons</hi> for the continance of their <hi>East Indie Trade,</hi> which are not to be neglected, but are to bee pondered by all <hi>Polititians</hi> and <hi>States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>

               <p>Concerning this fishing Trade: there hath beene a continuall Agitation aboue 30. yeeres to make <hi>Busses</hi> and Fisher-boats, but the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is still interrupted, because other Nations doe finde too great fauour and friends here to diuert all the good intentions and endeuours of such as (with the Author of this Discourse) haue imployed their Time and good meanes therein; for the Merchants Aduenturours, the Companie of Merchants Trading in <hi>Russia,</hi> and the East-land Merchants, did also oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues against it at the Councell Table, and did alleage the reasons following.</p>

                  </item>
                  <item>2. The Interloopers aduantage to interrupt their Trade vnder colour hereof.</item>
                  <item>3. The want of meanes to make Returne, both for Fish and Cloth also.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:20749:26"/>
4. The inhauncing of the price of forreine Commodities.</item>
                  <item>5. The preoccupying of money to the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of Cloth.</item>
                  <item>6. The dissolution of the ioynt stocke of the <hi>Russia</hi> Company.</item>
                  <item>7. The incouragement of Strangers here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to make a Contract with the Russian Emperour.</item>

                  <item>10. The plenty of Fish, which those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries haue from time to time, and some other Reasons.</item>
               </list>
               <p>So that in conclusion, England (by their say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) cannot maintaine the <hi>Sea Trade and the Land Trade</hi> together; neither do they make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to make Returne in money, knowing that they should lose more thereby, then by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of those Countries, or by Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And albeit that all the premisses may bee moderated without hinderance to the said Companies: neuerthelesse such is the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of some Merchants, not vnderstanding the Mysteries of exchange, and ouer-ruling others by their order of <hi>Antiquitie</hi> in their <hi>Society:</hi> that neither Reason or experience can preuaile; insomuch, that whereas other Princes take
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:20749:27"/>
their Duties of other Nations for fishing, and fish themselues also by their Subiects: yet Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land cannot resolue to doe the like, or at least take order for the said Duties.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The King of Denmarke</hi> doth the like, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth great Tribute, both at <hi>Ward-house</hi> and the <hi>Sound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King of Sweden</hi> in like manner, and the said King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> now for the Kingdome of <hi>Norway.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the Bordering <hi>Princes of Italy</hi> doe take Taxes vpon fish within the <hi>Mediterranian</hi> Seas.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The like Taxe</hi> is taken by the <hi>Duke of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Sidonia</hi> for <hi>Tunny</hi> in the Spanish Seas.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The States of the Vnited Prouinces</hi> doe take an imposition vpon fish, which is taken within the Streames, and Dominions of other Princes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Hollanders</hi> doe allow the Tenth fish, both in <hi>Russia, Lappia</hi> and other places, or pay a Composition for the same; as also moreouer a Tribute in the <hi>Sound</hi> for passage, to fetch the said fish. And of mine owne knowledge, I am assured, they would willingly haue paid the same vnto England, or a good composition for it, had not the greedy lucre of some persons hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the same.</p>

For the vnderselling of our Clothes will not make them more vendible, when the <hi>Accidents of great Warres</hi> doth hinder the same: wherein wee are to note two principall points.</p>
               <p>First, that other Nations (buying heretofore <note place="margin">The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants in the sale of Clothes.</note> our Clothes when they were sold deerer, by the one halfe in price then they be now) did neuer complaine that the Clothes were sold too deere, but they did alwaies complaine of the false making of our Cloth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that other Nations are as willing to sell vnto vs their forraine Commodities, as
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:20749:28"/>
we can be to sell our Clothes to them; for those that make Clothes in their Countries, haue no occasion to buy forraine Wares, or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of others, but seeke to sell them for ready money, or to bee payed at some times: whereby England hath a great aduantage, and may enioy the benefit of it, in selling their Cloth with Reputation, which is euer accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Request, and causeth Commodities to be sold at good rates; whereas vilifying the price of Wares, can neuer establish a Trade, and make Commodities more vendible; for this course is violent, and <hi>Nullum violentum per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuum.</hi>

               <p>For all Merchants Strangers, might and did heretofore export white Clothes out of the Kingdome, paying double Custome, which they now may not.</p>

               <p>All other Merchants at large, as well at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, as of all other parts of the Kingdome haue vsually heretofore exported, coloured Clothes, Kersies, Bayes, Sayes, Serges, Perpetuanoes, &amp;c. which now they may not. So that all the <hi>Trade</hi> of the Merchants of the Staple, of the merchant Strangers, and of all other English Merchants, concerning th' exportation of all the Commodities made of Wooll into those
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:20749:30"/>
Countries, where the same are especially to bee vented, is in the Power of the Merchants Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturours only; and it is come to be managed by 40. or 50. persons of of that Company, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of three or foure thousand. Nay one man alone, hath compassed into his hands, the whole Trade of coloured Clothes and Kersies for these parts, by the meanes of exchanges, and moneys taken vp at Interest. It is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the same number with the same ability, can manage the same Trade, to the best profit in Times of warres, as in <hi>Times of Peace:</hi> Then much lesse can a lesser number, with lesser abilitie manage a greater Trade, in most Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome times, especially if they haue borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 50. or 60. thousand pounds at vse, for the seruice of the Company, and thereby engaged the Trade, and set themselues in debt; which causeth many of the best merchant Aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours to giue ouer Trade, and are become pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasers, or lenders of money at Interest. Many others of them haue engaged themselues in the East Indian Company, which did carry away their money, and left the Cloth.</p>
               <p>This small number to manage so great a Trade <note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth cause of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, is the false ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of our Cloth.</note> incourageth the Clothier to aduenture to make false Cloth, because it is impossible, that so few Merchants can search and visit euery Cloth, as it ought to bee done, and the Clothiers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is satisfied. For he saith that the falsest Cloth is answerable to the best price, because
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:20749:31"/>
none may export but they, and therefore they will giue what price they please: for this deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Cloth hath caused great iarres and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences betweene the English Merchants and the forraine Nations for Tare or Rebatements, and the generall Report of the falsenesse of English Manufactures, hath caused a wonderfull decay of the sale thereof.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Trade</hi> thus limited to a small number of a Company, residing for the most part at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, is a generall preiudice to the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which though it haue made London rich, it hath made all the Ports and other parts of the Kingdome poore; for it enforceth needlesse and chargeable carriage and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of diuers Commodities, whereby they are endeared vnto vs, and it hinders all the Ports (being the Walls of the Kingdome) from hauing either forraine or domesticke Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities brought vnto them at the best hand, which causeth them to be almost desolate and forsaken: and it hindereth the Clothiers and new Drapers (which dwell in remote parts:) from selling their Cloth and Stuffes at their next adioyning Ports, for how can they sell, when there are no Merchants?</p>
               <p>It causeth all Chapmen to giue poore and faint prices for Wooll, because when it is indra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, it may not more freely be exported to the best aduantage. So that the Grower is hindred in the price of his Wooll, for euery losse and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:20749:31"/>
preiudice that comes vpon cloth and the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier, <note place="margin">One extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> doth fall vpon the Wooll and the Wooll Grower. And the Clothier saith, hee is preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of his best Chapmen for his Cloth, for that merchants Strangers, or other English mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants cannot worke vpon the aduantage of Markets and the Clothiers necessitie, which beates downe the price of Cloth; the price of Cloth beateth downe the price of Wooll; the price of Wooll beateth downe the price of Lands, which cannot be improued; and forraine Commodities are freely taken in Barter for the Returne of our home Commodities, when mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys nor Bullion can be imported, as hath beene declared: so that the <hi>Hammers</hi> at the Minte, where the pulses of the common-wealth should be felt, are the life and mouing. And it is come to such extremitie with the Eastland merchants, that they cannot vent their Cloth in Barter of other Wares to make Returne, and by money their losse would be incredible.</p>
               <p>Shall this be Proclamed a <hi>Free Trade,</hi> when within our selues, we are in Bondage, and haue lost the benefit of the <hi>Two essentiall Parts of Trafficke,</hi> namely the <hi>Rule</hi> of money and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes? Let euery man iudge.</p>
               <p>To say nothing of the dependances of <hi>Trade,</hi> as the increase of Nauigation and Nauigators, when Merchants heretofore had more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the Ports were furnished and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented, with great store of shipping; which
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:20749:32"/>
although they were but small of burden: yet euery one had their seuerall Pilot and Mariners, which did daily supplie the Land, with plenty of Sea-men.</p>
               <p>The Merchants Staplers haue obserued, that the Merchants Aduenturers, haue an ineuitable opportunity of Combination, to set what price they please vpon cloth to the Clothier, of Wooll to the Grower, and of all Commodities exported and imported; and likewise to lay what priuate impositions they please, vpon any of the said Commodities, so that whether they doe well or ill for the Common-weale, there can be no apparant triall: for hauing power to barre all others from Trade, but themselues, they are like a Commoditie weighed in a Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, that hath but one end, where there can be no Counterpoize, and then it seemes to bee great weight, although it be neuer so light. So that this ingrossing of Trade into few mens <note place="margin">Engrossing of Trade.</note> hands, hath caused our home Trades to decay, our Manufactures to decrease, and our home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Commodities to lie vpon our hands vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sold, or to bee sold at a low price, to the vtter vndoing of all sorts of poore people in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and the great dammage of all his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties louing Subiects: and whilest our merchants hinder one another from Trade, other Nations increase their owne Manufactures, and enlarge their Trade; not only for the said Countries of high and low Germany, but also for <hi>Russia,

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>ITHERTO</hi> (saith the said Authour:) the matter of <hi>Trade</hi> hath beene conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in <hi>Money</hi> and <hi>Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize,</hi> and the <hi>exchange of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes</hi> is past ouer by him, as a matter not worthy the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: <note place="margin">Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and Moneys.</note> indeed it was good for him to saile betweene the two Rocks of <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charyb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> without further aduenture, and not to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Shipwracke vpon the dangerous Rocke of exchanges. But diuers merchants haue much distasted, that a man of their profession should neglect one of the <hi>Essentiall Parts of Traffique,</hi> and the most operatiue in <hi>Trade,</hi> being the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly measure betweene vs and forraine nations, without which, all his discourse is without <hi>Rime

or Reason.</hi> So that he cannot finde any <hi>Parity</hi> nor <hi>Purity</hi> in exchanges; like vnto a sicke body who by reason of the bitternesse of his tongue, can not relish.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monsieur Bodine</hi> saith, that when a man is noted to be of experience, and to vnderstand matters, wherein he is surpassing others: <hi>The Prouerbe is, Il entendle Par,</hi> he doth vnderstand his <hi>Par</hi> or <hi>Equality;</hi> which cannot bee applyed vnto him that doth not vnderstand the matter of <hi>exchange:</hi> for all his arguments are fram'd betweene Commodities and moneys, from whence this <hi>Syllogisme</hi> may bee drawne against him, to maintaine the vnderualuation of our money <hi>in specie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing causeth Merchants to export more money out of the Realme, then they bring in: but onely the bringing in of more Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties into the Realme then they carried out. The vnderualuation of our moneys, causeth no more Commodities to bee brought into the Realme, then is carried out: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualuation of our moneys, causeth not more money to be carried out of the Realme, then is brought in. But left this should breede a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma,</hi> let vs examine his words concerning ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Suppose that some Merchants Strangers doe come ouer into the Realme, to buy a Packe of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:20749:36"/>
Tenne Clothes valued at 80. pound Starlin, which they are to pay in Gold and Siluer, and yet they doe not know, what the <hi>Weight and finenesse</hi> of our Starlin money is, neither doth the English Merchants know the <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>finenesse</hi> of the forraine Coyne, which they haue brought ouer: hereupon to content both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the moneyes on either side must bee tried by the <hi>Subtill Assay</hi> according to their finenesse, calculated vpon the pound weight of 12. oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>Troy,</hi> and then by <hi>Weight</hi> they answer each other accordingly; and so this negotiation is <hi>(in effect)</hi> but a <hi>Permutation</hi> of monyes for Commodities, before exchange was inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>This being not well obserued, might cause men to be deceiued, as the Pewterer (sometime <hi>an Alderman of London.)</hi> was, who beeing vsed to change old Pewter for new, taking a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration for the fashion, would take the like course in the buying of Siluer Plate of a Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith, deliuering his money by weight, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he sustained a losse, because hee did deliuer him a quantity of old groates, which were ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then their value; as also other Starlin mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, which were worne out in continuance of time, and much vnder their true weight. And boasting of his good bargaine, hee was made to calculate what an ounce of siluer did stand him, and he found that by thesemeanes, he had paide 6. shillings the ounce for that, which was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:20749:37"/>
vnto him for 5. shillings, 6. pence. <hi>Faller<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>The lightnesse of this Pewterers money may be compared to the low exchange in the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualuation of our moneys, by exchange; for if a Merchant Stranger did bring ouer money <hi>in specie</hi> at this time, to buy Commodities within the Realme, and deliuer the same here according to the very value in payment by the <hi>Assay;</hi> and thereupon doe looke backe how his mony is ouerualued in regard of the exchange, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might haue made ouer the same by a bill of exchange: he shall finde a farre greater losse then the Pewterer did, not of 6. pence in an ounce, but aboue nine pence in euery ounce of Siluer. Great are the gaines to be made by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes, without euer to deale or meddle with any Commodities at all.</p>
               <p>I know that to the iudicious Merchants; I haue giuen cause of offence, to haue written so much in the defence of exchange; But knowing that many graue and discreete persons haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ouer <hi>this Princely Study,</hi> imagining therein <note place="margin">A Princely Study.</note> more mystery then there is, rather then they would take paines to vnderstand it: I haue bin prolixe, wishing that the saide Authour had the <hi>Purity</hi> of vnderstanding to know the <hi>Parity</hi> of so many exchanges, as haue beene deuised in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly, Germany, France, Spaine, The Low Countries, Eastland, Poland, and other places,</hi> at large decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in my booke, <hi>Lex Mercatoria;</hi> seruing all

Societies and Companies of Merchants to bee mindfull of the Common Wel-fare, wherein Master <hi>Hussey</hi> Gouernour of the Merchants Aduenturers company in the beginning of Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Raigne tooke great paines with others, To finde and establish the <hi>True Par of exchange,</hi> which was examined and altered <note place="margin">Par of ex change.</note> in the yeares, 1564. and 1576. as also in the yeares 1586. and 1600, my selfe being a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner in the later: But the true Remedy to rule the course of exchange, was but lately found out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning</hi> the gouernment of Trade, wee haue noted heretofore, that in all Traffiques, the generall doth gouerne the particular. Some would haue other natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to come to buy the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of vs, within the Realme, for, say they, <note place="margin">Forraine nations fetch our Wares.</note> there is according to the Prouerb, twenty in the hundreth difference betweene. <hi>Will you buy? and will you sell?</hi> These men haue no consideration of the maintenance of nauigation, which is the greatest strength of the Realme, whose defence (next vnder God) consisteth most of Ships and well experienced Marriners. Whereas also the transporting of our Cloth to certaine places, causeth other nations to resort thither to buy them, which may bee more properly called to be, <hi>Will you sell?</hi> Seeing that those nations doe bring their owne Commodities vnto our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants to the places by them appointed, as <hi>Delf</hi> and <hi>Hamborough;</hi> which is <hi>(in effect)</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:20749:38"/>
as <hi>Will you buy?</hi> And would not this be, <hi>Will you buy?</hi> if in a dispersed and stragling manner, our Cloth were carried to all markets beyond the seas in seuerall places; which would take away the desire of buying: for he that buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, doth it in hope of gaine to be had in places where he intendeth to carry the Commodities, which Commodities if hee knoweth to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in most places to bee vented, will quench his desire of buying: and hee that commeth to barter other Commodities for ours, hath the like consideration.</p>
               <p>But let vs admit, that our Cloth would bee aduanced in price, when men (should by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes) run to the markets, or into the countrey in al places to buy it: what would be the euent of it? It would not onely bee solde beyond the seas with a smaller gaine and many times to losse (we being naturally to make speedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne:) but we should also pay dearer for the forraine Commodities, which wee should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine by way of <hi>Permutation,</hi> or for the Billes obligatory of the Merchants to whom wee sell our Cloth: and if our Merchants were cut off, and that other nations should buy the Cloth within the Realme, and so aduance the price thereof: (as it happeneth most commonly in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> at the <hi>Vintage</hi> time with their Wines &amp; Raisons:) Then forraine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities would be sold dearer vnto vs by them againe: for the small gaine had vpon our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:20749:38"/>
causeth vs, and would cause them to seeke a better gaine vpon the forraine Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities to the generall hurt.</p>
               <p>Others would haue all things at large in the <note place="margin">Dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, &amp;c.</note> course of <hi>Traffique,</hi> and that there should be no societies or corporations of Merchants for any places of <hi>Trade,</hi> (terming them to be <hi>Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,)</hi> but that by way of partnership Merchants might associate themselues, according to the manner of some other Countries: These men haue no regard, that innouations are as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, as to remooue the corner stones of a building; neyther doe they obserue a momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary difference betwixt the Gouernment of a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and that especially in an Iland: and the gouernment of a <hi>Democracy</hi> which is popular, or of an <hi>Aristocracy,</hi> which is gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the better sort of the people; these see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by all meanes to make their Countries populous by the inhabiting of all nations for the increase of their meanes collected by impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions and <hi>Aczises,</hi> and that vpon all things consumed and most vpon victuals; the other, namely the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> auoiding asmuch as they can, the multitude of forraine nations to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite within their gouernment, and holding impositions and Taxes to bee done with great aduisement. And that the ouerballancing of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Commodities with the natiue Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities may be preuented; which by the other is not regarded, neither can it bee by them obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:20749:39"/>
                  <hi>The Prouidence of the State</hi> hath also a great consideration in the course of <hi>Trade,</hi> vnder go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment in appointed places, especially in that of the Merchant Aduenturers company, (who haue the managing of the creame of the land, the maine Trade of the kingdome, and doe expose to aduenture the greatest part of the wealth therof with forraine nations in trouble. some times of wars:) because they may by this order be soone remooued or called home vpon occasion, which cannot be done conueniently o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise: where there is no vigilant eye to take care for the generall wealth of the Realme, for no nation of Christendome Traffiques so much in Bulke of Staple Commodities, as the Realme of England; which <hi>Boters</hi> (though altogether Spanish in times past, and no friend to England) confesseth, that two yeares before the taking of <hi>Andwarpe,</hi> all the wares of Christendome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Ann. 1584.</note> valued, and summed by the offices of that City, (which were vented there in one yeare.) The whole being deuided into sixe parts: the English amounted to foure parts thereof.</p>
               <p>But we must not seeme to flatter Companies or Societies, when it is found that they deale vnaduisedly, or that by their meanes, things are out of order in the course of Trade; for then the Kings authority or the <hi>Royall Merchant of great Brittaine,</hi> must be the ture <hi>Palynurus,</hi> and sit at the <hi>Rudder of the Ship of Traffique,</hi> to reforme abuses. For a Society may become to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:20749:39"/>
be <hi>A Monopoly</hi> in effect, when some few Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants <note place="margin">A Society may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Monopoly.</note> haue the whole managing of a <hi>Trade,</hi> to the hurt of a Common-wealth, when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others might also Traffique and negotiate for the Common good, hauing their Stockes employed therein to sell the Commodities of the Realme with reputation at conuenient times, and not vpon a suddaine to pay Billes of exchanges or moneys taken vp at inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,</p>
               <p>To make a <hi>Definition of a Monopoly,</hi> we neede <note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of Monopoly.</note> not vse many words, for the abuse of <hi>Monopoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> hath made the same aswell to be vnderstood as the word of <hi>Vsura,</hi> I meane biting <hi>Vsury.</hi> The parts of it are to be considered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Restraint of the freedome of commerce to some one or few, and the setting of the price, at the pleasure of one or few; to their priuate benefits, and the preiudice of the Common-wealth.</hi> And as this may be done by authority, so may the aboue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said course also be committed vnder the color of authority by the <hi>Princes</hi> grant or letters Pate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.</p>

                  <hi>Commendable</hi> is the custome of the City of <hi>Norenborough</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> where to maintaine the people on worke, they receiue all their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures and pay them weekely, &amp; afterward sell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a reasonable profit, which therby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dispersed in all countreys; whereby they haue made a great Trade for the <hi>West Indies,</hi> &amp; they maintaine therby their Commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-wealth as an <hi>Aristocratick</hi> gouernment: and this is neither

                  <hi>A Monopoly,</hi> nor properly <hi>An engrossing,</hi> bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done by publike authority. Such therefore as sel the Commodities of the Realme vnto for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine nations with aduantage of priuate bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, (albeit within the Compasse of <hi>a Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:)</hi> are more to be tolerated then those that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dersell the Commodities of the kingdome, and procure their Gaines by the Commodities of other nations to bee solde deare within the Realme.</p>
               <p>Here I call to mind our former obseruation of that <hi>Royall Commodity Tinne,</hi> which aboue <note place="margin">Englands View. Pag. 142.</note> one hundred yeares past, was sold for 40. shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings the hundreth, when the best veluets were sold for 10. shillings the yard: how the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants trading <hi>Turky</hi> found fault of his, Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties <hi>Praeemption,</hi> and caused the same to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, to keepe the price at 55. shillings the hundred; and bringing in <hi>Corints, Leuant Wines, Spices,</hi> and <hi>Indicoe</hi> (at deare rates:) vsed all meanes to suppresse the rising thereof: which caused forraine nations to fall into considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, and vsing meanes to incorporate the same, it brought that Commodity in esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation againe. And the saide <hi>Praeemption</hi> was reestablished againe, which hath aduanced the price to double the rate; whereby the stocke or wealth of the kingdome, hath beene since in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased 600. thousand pounds Starlin, and his Maiestie hath receiued for his benefite. 150. <note place="margin">Praeempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Tin.</note> thousand pounds, which was gotten by forraine
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:20749:40"/>
nations, who iustly paid the same according to the value; the price of forraine Commodities considered. On the contrary, another Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity minerall, namely <hi>Copperas,</hi> which was sold for 10. and 12. pound the Tunne, and whereof a great Trade might haue beene made for other Countries: hath beene so ill gouerned by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens vnderselling one another, and for want of good order, that the same is sold for 3. pounds the Tunne, and is become out of request in all countreys. For the best things may be marr'd in handling, which by the wisedome of the State, is to be foreseene by meanes of Merchants of experience, who might haue maintained the same.</p>
               <p>In like manner the sole importation of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish <hi>Tobacco,</hi> doth gaine and saue the kingdome many thousand pounds yearely.

               <p>Concerning Companies or Societies to deale in a ioynt Stocke or apart: it may bee thought <note place="margin">Ioynt Stockes or apart.</note> conuenient to haue ioynt Stockes for Remote places, as the <hi>East Indies</hi> and <hi>Persia.</hi> And albeit
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:20749:41"/>
that some would haue the same to be only out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the employment, but in Returne to bee deuided in kinde or Species of the Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which they Receiue: yet the manner of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> is (by experience) found better to sell also ioyntly, considering we sell vnto other Nations, who pay for it, although some part thereof is sold deerer thereby within the Realme to the Subiects and inhabitants. But for other places neerer, the Merchants to deale apart vnder some Gouernment, may seeme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient.</p>

What shall wee say then of those Grants, which make the Commoditie deerer to the Subiect, and sell the same better cheape to <note place="margin">Allomes.</note> the Transporter or Stranger? Surely they may be thought to be, for to set the people on worke vpon the common Purse, but otherwise there is but little pollicie in it; much like vnto the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Mines</hi> of the <hi>Duke of Brownswicke,</hi> which he maintained to his charges, called the <hi>Wilde man:</hi> which causeth him to coyne <hi>Dollers,</hi> hauing on the one side his Armes, and on the other side a Sauage man, holding a burning Candle in his

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing hitherto obserued the <hi>Methode</hi> of the said Author, in part of his Distribution in the matter and forme of <hi>Trade,</hi> and therein shewed very great deformities: I am now to apply the <hi>True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies</hi> likewise in order, according to the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses alleaged, which are noted by me to be tenne in number.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Efficient cause of the Transportation of our</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Cause of the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualuation of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys.</note> 
                  <hi>Moneys is (Gaine,)</hi> and this Gaine ariseth by the vnderualuation of our moneys, in regard of the inhauncing and ouervaluation of forraine
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:20749:46"/>
Coyne; so that the cause is <hi>Extrinsike</hi> &amp; compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vnder the said exchange of moneys, and not <hi>intinsicke,</hi> in the <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>finenesse</hi> of the Coyne, which are considered in the course of <hi>True exchange</hi> betweene vs, and forraine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and thereupon it followeth, that neither difference of weight, finenesse of Standard, proportion betweene Gold and Siluer, or the proper valuation of moneys, can be any true causes of the exportation of our moneys: so long as a due course is held in exchange, which is founded thereupon.</p>
               <p>Hence ariseth the <hi>facilitie of the Remedie,</hi> by the Reformation of exchange, in causing the value of our money to be giuen in exchange, which cutteth off the said <hi>Gaine,</hi> had by the said exportation, and causeth <hi>(in effect)</hi> that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Coyne beyound the Seas, shall not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued aboue the value, although the inhaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing thereof, or the imbasing by allay were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering continually. For take away the cause <hi>(Gayne)</hi> and the effect will ceasse.</p>
               <p>All men of common vnderstanding, when they doe heare of the raising of moneys be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas, are ready to say, we must doe the like; for they conceiue the saying of <hi>Cato, Tu quoque fac simile, sic Ars deluditur Arte,</hi> to be a proper application hereunto: but they doe not enter into consideration, what Alterations it would bring to the State, and that the matter might runne, <hi>Ad infinitum,</hi> as shall be declared.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:20749:47"/>
But let vs suppose, that this will be a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Remedy, to inhaunce our moneys, as they doe theirs, to imbase our Coyne, as they doe theirs, and to imitate ouerualuation and vnderualuation of Gold and Siluer, as they doe, requiring a continuall laboure, charge, and innouation; is it not an excellent thing that all this can be done by the course of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, with great facilitie? And that without inhauncing of our moneys at home, or med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the <hi>weight and finenesse</hi> of the Starlin Standard?</p>
               <p>This is to be done only by his Maiesties Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation <note place="margin">The way to restore. Englands wealth.</note> according to the Statutes of exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, prohibiting that after three moneths next ensuing the same, no man shall make any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes by Bills or otherwise, for moneys to bee paied in forraine parts, or to be rechanged towards this Realme vnder the true <hi>Par,</hi> or value for value of our moneys, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys of other Countries in <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> but at the said Rate, or aboue the same, as Merchants can agree, but neuer vnder the said Rate: which shall be declared in a paire of Tables publikely to be seene vpon the <hi>Royall Exchange in London,</hi> according to the said Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, and the said Table shall be altered in price, as occasions shall be ministred beyond the Seas, in the generall <hi>Respectiue</hi> places of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes, either by their inhauncing of moneys by valuation, or by imbasing of the same by <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay;</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:20749:47"/>
which by a vigilant eye may be obserued, and will be a cause to make other Nations more constant in the course of their moneys. And this will be executed more of course, then by Authority; because Gaine doth beare sway and command with most men.</p>
               <p>The <hi>facilitie</hi> hereof putteth me in minde of the <hi>Geometricall Axiom or Maxime,</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in commendation of the inuention of round Wheeles, <hi>Cir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Vnto which this <hi>Remedie</hi> may bee aptly compared, which (in a manner) comprehendeth all the other <hi>Remedies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Merchant Stranger, being here the Deliuerer of money generally: will easily bee induced to make the most of his owne, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by exchange more for the same be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas; and the English Merchant being the Taker of the said moneys, will not bee so iniurious to the State, as to giue lesse beyond the Seas, then the value of the money of the Realme in exchange, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the said Proclamation: and if hee would, the Deliuerer will not let him haue it. Besides that the Takers occasions
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:20749:48"/>
are enforced by necessitie, and he can be no lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser; for by this direction, he will sell his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities beyond the Seas accordingly.</p>
               <p>English Merchants being the Deliuerers of money beyond the Seas, and the price of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change altering there accordingly, will haue the like consideration, and the Merchant Stranger will prouoke him thereunto. And if there be no Takers, the English Merchant may bring ouer the money <hi>in specie,</hi> wherein he shall become a Gayner.</p>
               <p>This course is agreeable to Iustice and the <note place="margin">Ius gentium.</note> Law of Nations, and will not hinder th'ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change to rise and fall as formerly; but keepe all in due order, with those considerations, Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and preuentions as shall be set downe to preuent all inconueniences, proceeding by the inhauncing of money; which fall generally vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the inhaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of Moneys.</note> all men, in the indearing of things, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly vpon Land-lords and Creditours in their Rents and Contracts; and especially vpon the Kings Maiesties Lands.</p>
               <p>Now before we come to answer some obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions made against this <hi>Remedie,</hi> let vs examine what <hi>Time</hi> the old obseruer, and experience the best Schoole-master of mans life, haue mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested touching the Raising of moneys in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine parts, and within the Realme; it being one of the 34. <hi>defectiue remedies</hi> before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>recorded</hi> in an auncient booke, that the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:20749:48"/>
inhauncing of the Coynes beyond the Seas, was the cause that King <hi>Henry the sixt of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> did raise the ounce of Starlin Siluer from 20 pence to 30 pence: and King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth from 30 pence to 40 pence. And after him King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, after many sendings to forraine Princes about Minte affaires and exchanges, (perceiuing the price of money continually to rise beyond the Seas:) caused in the 18. yeere of his Raigne, <hi>The Angell Noble</hi> to be valued from 6 shillings 8 pence, vnto se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen shillings and foure pence, and presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to 7 shillings 6 pence; whereby euery ounce of Starlin Siluer was worth 45 pence: and yet there was nothing effected thereby, the money still altering beyond the Seas; whereupon <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Wolsey</hi> had Letters Patents granted him by the King, to alter the <hi>Valuation</hi> of money from time to time, as he should see cause.</p>
               <p>Afterwards the said King in the 22. yeere of <note place="margin">Grastons Chronicle.</note> his Raigne, perceiuing that diuers Nations brought abundance of forraine Commodities into his Realme, and receiued money for it; which money they euer deliuered to other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants by exchange, and neuer employed the same on the Commodities of the Realme, whereby his Maiestie was hindered in his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, and the Commodities of the Realme were not vttered, to the great hinderance of his Subiects: as is there alleaged: <hi>His Maiestie</hi> caused a <hi>Proclamation</hi> to be made, according to

the aforesaide Statute, made in the time of King <hi>Richard</hi> the second, That no person should make any exchange contrary to the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the said <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Statute,</hi> vpon paine to be taken the Kings mortall enemy, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feite all that hee might for feite: which tooke <hi>effect</hi> but for a short time, and no other was to bee expected, it not beeing of that moment, nor the principall meane to doe it.</p>
               <p>After this followed the imbasing of Moneys, and then all the price of forraine Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties did rise immoderately, which made the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Commodities to rise at the Farmors and <note place="margin">One extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth another.</note> Tenants hands, and thereupon Gentlemen did raise the rents of their lands, and tooke farmes to themselues, and made inclosures of grounds; and the price of euery thing beeing deare, was made dearer through plenty of money and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion comming from the <hi>West Indies,</hi> as is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy noted; and by these meanes, was the <hi>Office</hi> of the Kings Royall exchanges neglected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause vpon the Base money no <hi>exchange</hi> was made, and other nations counterfeited the same, and filled the kingdome with it, and so carrien out the good Staple wares of the Realm for it.</p>
               <p>This raising of money was augmented after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> of blessed memory, in the highest degree, by one full third part, from 45. pence the ounce, vnto 60. pence or
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:20749:49"/>
5. shillings Starlin Standard: But the exportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did neuer ceasse, because the course of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for money did runne alwaies vnder the value of the money, still affoording a gaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the said exchange and money, which caused the said exportation. And so will it bee stil, if this be not preuented by <hi>Direction</hi> in a paire of Tables, much like vnto the <hi>Tables</hi> kept <note place="margin">Table of exchange at Douer.</note> at <hi>Douer</hi> in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, to receiue the passengers money, and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change <hi>in specie</hi> for it beyond the Seas; which made them to leaue their moneys within the Realme; and this course of exchange so dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, is the onely meane and way to restore Englands wealth by importation of money and Bullion, aduancing the price of our natiue Commodities, and to preuent the Transporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our moneys: and all other <hi>Remedies.</hi> are <hi>Defectiue,</hi> as experience will prooue and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate, if good things can bee fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>The Statute of employment must also bee obserued, to make the Remedy more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate with a <hi>Register</hi> also, to record the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys which forraine Marriners doe receiue for fraight comming from <hi>Norway</hi> and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are aboue one hundred voyages in one yeare; as also many other Ships, bringing corne into the Northerne and Westerne parts of the Realme, and exporting money for it.</p>

beene more <hi>Politicke</hi> then we, keeping the price <note place="margin">Policy of the Turke, Persian, &amp; Russian.</note> of their exchanges high much aboue the <hi>Ualu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> of their moneys. So that they haue no Trade by exchange, nor moneys, but onely for Commodities; whereby they preuent the ouer; ballancing of forrain Commodities with theirs, as also the exportation of their moneys: albeit the vse of our Commodities in those countreys, is very great.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Obiections</hi> made by some against this <hi>Sole Remedy</hi> may easily be answered, for they are grounded vpon Suppositions against assured experience.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some make doubt, that the price of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change <note place="margin">Obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</note> being risen, there will be no takers of money, and then the deliuerer is more thrust vpon the exportation of moneys.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Others say, that those merchants, which haue sold their Cloth beyond the Seas, shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a losse in the making ouer of their money from thence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Others say, that they shall not be able to vent their Cloth, according to the high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, especially now that the same is out of request; and would haue the matter of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deferred vntill an other time.</p>
               <p>The first obiection is answered before, That the taker is ruled by the deliuerer, who will not <note place="margin">Answers.</note> giue his money by exchange vnder the true va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue according to the Proclamation to be made; and the deliuerer being the Merchant stranger
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:20749:50"/>
here, will sooner be thrust vpon the Statute of employment; for by the exportation of money, he shall haue no gaine, whereas some of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeter sort would not haue that Statute too <note place="margin">Mediocria firma.</note> stricktly pressed vpon the Stranger, because the <hi>Trade</hi> should not bee driuen into their hands.</p>
               <p>To the second, the Proclamation limiting a time for execution, giueth Merchants ability to recouer their moneys, or to sell their billes of debt for money, or to buy Commodities for them, as the manner is.</p>
               <p>To the third, experience maketh a full answer to both, that there did not want takers, when the late inhauncing of money at <hi>Hamborough,</hi> caused the exchange to rise from vnder 28. shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to aboue 35. shillings; which is more then the present alteration will be, and Wooll was at 33. shillings the Todde, which is now fullen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 20. shillings. So that the vent of our Cloth was not hindered when it was solde dearer by one full third part: But there was aboue 80. thousand Clothes sold yearely, where there is not sold now 40. thousand Clothes. The time is also to bee thought more conuenient to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance a Commoditie being vndervalued, then to doe it when the price is high. For this Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risie of the Common-wealth is dangerous, and admitteth no time to bee cured; like the fire in a City, which permitteth not enquiries to examine how the fire beganne, but requireth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:20749:51"/>
mans helpe to quench the same.</p>
               <p>And whereas it is alleadged in defence of the inhauncing of our Coyne, <hi>That which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to all, when hee that buyes deare, shall sell deare, cannot be said to be iniurious to any.</hi> This o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion seemes to be <hi>eiusdem farinae,</hi> as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and hath no consideration what the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Weights</hi> or <hi>Measures</hi> betweene vs and forraine nations, may produce to the losse of the Common-wealth, albeit that betweene man and man, it may prooue alike in some respects.</p>
               <p>To make this euident, suppose two Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, the one dwelling in <hi>London,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dwelling at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> do contract toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that the Londoner sending Clothes to sell at Amsterdam, the merchant of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> sendeth him Veluers and Silkes to bee solde at <hi>London;</hi> and in the account to be kept betweene them they agree to reckon the moneys in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change but at 30. shilings flemish for 20. shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings Starlin, and so make returne each to other from time to time as money shall be receiued, both here and beyond the Seas. Wherupon put the case that there is receiued at <hi>Amsterda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> 1500 <hi>lib.</hi> flemish for Cloth, and at London there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued 1000. <hi>lib.</hi> Starlin for Veluets and Silkes, which by the said rate &amp; calculation is all one <hi>(in effect)</hi> between them, and might by way of <hi>Rescounter</hi> answer each other in account. But the <note place="margin">Rescounter in Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</note> Merchant of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> (knowing that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the moneys inhau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced there) he can make
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:20749:51"/>
a great gaine to haue the said 1000. <hi>lib.</hi> sent vnto him <hi>in specie:)</hi> desireth the Londoner to send him this 1000. <hi>lib.</hi> Starlin in siluer &amp; gold coyns, <hi>Realls</hi> of eight or <hi>Rieckx Dollers,</hi> wherby he shal profite 15. vpon the 100, by the meanes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, which amounteth to 150. <hi>lib.</hi> gaines. The Londoner hauing his 1500. <hi>lib.</hi> flemish, or 1000. <hi>lib.</hi> Starlin at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> cannot doe the like, because the moneys are inhaunced and receiued aboue the value, so that his money must be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by exchange there at a low rate, or at 33 shillings 4. pence, whereby he doth receiue here the said 1000. <hi>lib.</hi> with no gaine at all. Thus the account betweene them is made euen; but by these means, the Kingdome is depriued of the 1000, <hi>lib.</hi> of the Merchants money sent to Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam, which doth not onely procure the want of money in England, whereof euery man hath a feeling to his losse: but also it causeth the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Commodities to be vndersold, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Commodities to be aduanced in price be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas, by plenty of money; and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the importation of money and Bullion, as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>To preuent this, the <hi>Question</hi> is now, whether it be better and more expedient, to raise the price of exchange, or the price or valuation of our moneys; Surely all men of iudgement wil say, that the raising of exchange breedeth not that alteration, which the inhauncing of moneys doth, namely to make euery
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:20749:52"/>
thing deere, and to cause Landlords and Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to lose in their Rents and Contracts. And Merchants of experience doe know, that wee cannot doe as they doe. For the inhauncing of moneys here, will be countermined by other Nations, who still will vndervalue them in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change betweene vs, vnlesse it be preuented by our owne true valuation to be made knowne as aforesaid, which by the Law of Nations, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be contradicted; whereby we shall also bee enabled to meet with them vpon all Alterations and practises, to direct our course accordingly, sooner then a Milner can turne his Winde-mill, to grinde Corne with the variation of all windes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It followeth</hi> (saith the said Author) <hi>that the Raising also of the Coyne, would raise the price of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The want of money causeth the price of Plate to fall</note> 
                  <hi>Plate,</hi> To lessen the superfluitie, or to bee tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Coyne. It is worthy the obseruation, that (by reason of the want of money:) the price of Plate is fallen from 6 shillings 6 peace guilt, to 5 shillings 6 pence; and white Plate from 5 shillings 8 pence to 5 shillings 2 pence. And if the moneys were inhaunced ten in the hundreth, that is to say, an ounce of Starlin Siluer to 5 shillings 6 pence: the Plate and all other things would rise accordingly. Whereby if a man that spendeth two or three hundreth pounds by the yeere, should spare one hundreth pounds worth of his Plate, and bring the same to be Coyned, might thereby get once tenne
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:20749:52"/>
pound, and pay euer after (for all other things) twenty and thirty <hi>lib.</hi> dearer yearely. And the moneys made thereof, would neuerthelesse be transported, vnlesse the exchange did preuent the same.</p>
               <p>In this place, we are to remember, that the Siluer vsed for diuers manufactures and Plate, doth much differ in finenesse, whereby many of his Maiesties Subiects are deceiued: It may therefore be thought conuenient, that no siluer made into manufactures be sold, vnlesse it bee tried by <hi>an Assay master,</hi> and marked accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, especially the siluer Threed comming from beyond the Seas: some beeing but eight ounces fine, which is offered to be solde accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly: or els to make it finer, as shal be thought conuenient to serue the kingdome, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come bound to make Returne in the manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of our Wooll for their manufacture of Siluer and Silke; which may bee thought a very reasonable <hi>Permutation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The want of mony coming by the consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of forraine Commodities, may properly be tearmed <hi>overballancing of Commodities,</hi> which are more worne and vsed, because of the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of them, imported proceeding also of the abuse of exchange, as the <hi>efficient Cause thereof,</hi> as aforesaide.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The excessiue Vse of Tobacco</hi> for so much as concerneth the importation thereof in liew of <hi>Treasure,</hi> will be much diminished by the late li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:20749:53"/>
of a quantity of Spanish <hi>Tobacco</hi> late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly established; to the end that the <hi>Plantation</hi> of <hi>Virginia</hi> and the <hi>Bermodaes</hi> may be aduanced thereby; and it is to be wished that the moneys to bee employed in Spanish <hi>Tobacco</hi> were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise made ouer by exchange, and deliuered to the Merchants aduenturers and others, to be bestowed vpon the Commodities of the Realme to make benefite of our owne; for if such for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Commodities, shal vanish away in smoake or be consumed and brought (as it were) vnto <note place="margin">Vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble lands.</note> doung, and surmount the price of the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, or fruits of the land: Certes, that land<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> vnprofitable in euery mans iudgement. For lands (being the <hi>Naturall</hi> riches so much desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of all men) are much disimprooued by the want of money and the selling of our natiue Commodities too good cheape in regard of the price of forraine Commodities; This beeing an euident token of the pouerty of a Common-wealth, which (like an vnweildy <hi>Elephantike Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy)</hi> hath a slowe motion, and therefore more dangerous and subiect to destruction, which by the want of money, is made visible and sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>The returnes lately had from the East-Indies, wil in part asswage the same, if Merchants in the dispersing of those Commodities, will procure importation of money and Bullion, as (no doubt) they will doe. And this will further bee increased, when the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants

shall be at an end of their present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies, which by his Maiesties high wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, will soone be determined.</p>
               <p>Touching the warres of Christendome, for so much as concerneth the want of moneys: I haue already shewed how the same is also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised in the reformation of the abuse of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, procuring thereby moneys, which are <hi>Nerui Bellorum.</hi> But to take vpon mee to discourse of warres, might make me subiect to <hi>Apelles</hi> his reprehension, <hi>Ne sutor vltra Crepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> Onely I hope that the famous example of <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> the Emperour may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, who perceiuing the forces of the great <hi>Pirate Crocataes</hi> to increase daily by the concourse of many nations, whilest hee was in Spaine, caused a <hi>Proclamation</hi> to be made, that whosoeuer should bring him the head of the said Pirate, he would reward him with 20. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <note place="margin">The Policy of rewards.</note> crownes; whereupon the saide <hi>Pirate</hi> was brought in danger of the humors of the saide nations, whose suspected inconstancy and lucre bred a resolution in him, to offer his owne head to the obedience of iustice, and demanding the said 20. thousand crownes, had the same payed vnto him, whereby all his associates were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and dispersed. In like manner did <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> deale with the <hi>Banditi in Italy,</hi> and made them to cut one anothers throats. This <hi>Policy</hi> of reward draweth as forcibly as the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant

or Loade-stone,</hi> which caused the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard to say, <hi>Dadiuas quebrantan Pennas,</hi> Gifts doe breake stony Rockes.</p>
               <p>From the Precedent causes of the want of <note place="margin">The 1. Cause.</note> money in England, come we to the causes of the decay of <hi>Trade</hi> in order, whereof this is the <hi>efficient Cause,</hi> whereunto the onely Remedy hath beene declared already.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vsury Politike,</hi> is made the next cause of the decay of <hi>Trade,</hi> which must be remedied by the <note place="margin">The 2.

But our law requireth a more precisenesse in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution thereof, then in <hi>Germany</hi> and the Low Countries, it not being <hi>Choses in Action,</hi> as the Lawyers speake. But the necessarines hereof, <note place="margin">Englands View, Pag. 157.</note> so vrgent, that no man is like to contradict the same; for wee doe finde by experience, that things which are indeede, and things which are not indeede, but taken to be indeed (as this is for payment of moneys) may produce all one effect. And for the biting <hi>Usury</hi> before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, there will be stocke found to erect pawne houses, <note place="margin">Pag. 159.</note> by meanes as shall be more amply here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after declared; and here is to be wished, that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:20749:54"/>
the City of London, and euery principall towne of a Shiere or the most part of them, would take vpon them to take money casually at the hand of such as will deliuer the same vpon the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their or other mens liues. <hi>As at Venice,</hi> where a man for the summe of three or foure hundreth pounds once giuen (and in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at Amsterdam) shall be sure to haue one hundreth pounds a yeare, during his life; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a great Stocke might be raised for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall good of all parties, and especially to set the poore people on worke, and to take their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures of them to be sold with a reasonable gaine: for experience hath taught in all places, where the like is vsed, that the City becommeth alwayes a Gayner by the decease of the parties that doe deliuer money in this nature. But it is conuenient to prescribe certaine rules here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in the making of all manufactures, which commonly is best effected by Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>The <hi>litigious Suits in Law</hi> being noted as the <note place="margin">The third Cause.</note> third cause of the decay of Trade, can hardly be remedied for the reasons before declared, but must haue their course; and herein there can be no shorter course deuised by the witte of man, then the Common-wealth doth vse vpon proofe and specialties, if the pleadings and is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues (although Peremptory:) bee ioyned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the first institution, whereby the

already made, and hereafter to bee made, may be thought conuenient to be Surueyed by a Commttie, who (vpon complaints of the parties grieued in all Societies:) may take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by way of approbation or deniall, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute things for the generall good, and not for the particular: as I haue noted in all this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. So that other Merchants vpon reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable considerations, may be admitted (vpon this especiall occasion) to be of the said Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or Companies; for otherwise it may seeme somewhat dissonant from reason, to prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite all Merchants, aswell English as Strangers, to bring in any of the Commodities of <hi>Turkie</hi> or of the <hi>Leuant,</hi> and now lately from Eastland and those Countries; vnlesse they were free of the said Companies: but to prohibite the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of Commodities in Strangers Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes concurreth with the Law.</p>
               <p>The ninth cause of the decay of Trade, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting <note place="margin">The ninth Cause.</note> of the interruption thereof by <hi>Warres, Pirates,</hi> and <hi>Bankerupts,</hi> I haue partly handled in the fifth Cause. And although decayed men are found at all times, yet the want of money hath caused diuers Merchants and Tradesmen to Breake, who might haue maintained then credits, but that being out of their moneys, and the moneys out of the Kingdome, maketh them to goe out of their credits; for <hi>Necessitas Parit Turpia.</hi> The Remedy hereof doth most
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:20749:57"/>
depend vpon plenty of money, or meanes in the liew of money, as the setting ouer of Bills of debt before spoken of. For the Statute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Bankerupts,</hi> cannot produce any great effect, but be a meane to vndoe the party for euer, if it doe depend long vpon him contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the intention thereof; for whereas all such as are Creditors, ought to come in within foure moneths to take their part, of what may appeare of the state of the Bankerupt, to bee examined by all lawfull meanes: the same is protracted for tenne, twenty, and more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths; and all those that come in the said <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim</hi> are admitted with the former, and a great part of the estate is spent in charges. This may bee remedied by the Authority of the Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery to the Commissioners appointed for th' ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the said Statute.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Remedy</hi> to the last and tenth Cause of <note place="margin">The tenth Cause.</note> the decay of <hi>Trade,</hi> (being the immoderate vse of forraine Commodities:) doth (as I haue shewed before) consist, partly by the abundance of those Commodities imported by the abuse of exchange, and partly by the wearing of those Commodities, affected by the vulgar sort or Common people. <hi>Monsieur Bodine</hi> doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue with <hi>Plato,</hi> that as the Prince is, so are the Subiects, who (by imitation) follow his example, which sooner entreth into their eyes, then into their eares: And the greater their
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:20749:58"/>
Authoritie is, the more affectionate is their imitation. <hi>Alexander</hi> cast his head aside, and all the Court held their necks awry; <hi>Denis</hi> was Purblinde, and his Courtiers stumbled at euery step and iustled each other, as if they had beene euill sighted: and so of other Princes in their apparell, precious stones and other things, which is made to bee the fashion. Hence the Prouerbe tooke beginning, <hi>Countries fashion, Countries honour.</hi> And the effect hereof, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times greater then the Lawes can bring to passe, vnlesse it be vpon some Remarkable occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as the late Command may proue for the wearing of Blackes at Funeralls, in Cloth and Stuffes made of English Wooll within the Realme.</p>
               <p>Here I haue omitted, to speake of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, Impositions publike and secret, layed vpon Commodities, especially vpon Cloth, both here and beyond the Seas; because the same requireth great consideration, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolishing thereof (being once laied on) will hardly bee brought about, vnlesse it bee, with the consent of both parties, where the one hath prouoked the other to impose them.</p>
               <p>For a Conclusion therefore let vs note, That all the said causes of the decay of Trade in England, are almost all of them comprised in one, which is the want of money; whereof wee finde the abuse of exchange, to bee the <hi>efficient
<pb facs="tcp:20749:58"/>
Cause,</hi> which maketh vs to finde out so easie <hi>Remedie,</hi> whereby the Kingdome shall enioy all the three <hi>essentiall parts</hi> of Traffique vnder good and <hi>Politike Gouernment,</hi> which will bee <hi>Free Trade</hi> effectually or in deed. And this will also bee admirable in the eyes of other Princes, finding his Maiesties wisdome to bee <hi>Transcendent</hi> in Gouerning of his owne, which (by so many sendings and remissions of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours vnto forraine Princes and States by his Noble Predecessours:) could neuer bee effected, as by diuers Records appeareth; albeit there was nothing required of them, but what did stand with the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Equality</hi> and <hi>Equitie,</hi> which cannot erre: But <hi>velut A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riadnae caeca regens filo vestigia, non modo nos errare non sinit, sed etiam efficit, vt aberrantes in Rectam viam deduca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur.</hi>
