            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>And let your Sighs and Lamentations come,</l>
                  <l>From the remoteſt Parts of Chriſtendom:</l>
               </lg>
               <l>For now Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Eleventh's Dead,</l>
               <l>Whom Thirteen Years y'ave own'd your Churches Head;</l>
               <l>Whom ye ſo long Infallible Believ'd,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Death</hi> prov'd Infallibly, ye were Deceiv'd:</l>
               <l>If in the Church diffuſive it reſided,</l>
               <l>Infallibility is now divided;</l>
               <l>Unleſs you think it to be like the Soul,</l>
               <l>Whole in each Part, and Total in the whole:</l>
               <l>Yet him that Title we may thus far give,</l>
               <l>That Politick <hi>Lewis</hi> ne're could Him deceive,</l>
               <l>Nor make Him with his Curs'd Ambition ſide,</l>
               <l>Or 'gainſt Religion to promote his Pride:</l>
               <l>The haughty Tyrants Threats he did withſtand,</l>
               <l>Boldly inflexible to each demand;</l>
               <l>His Barbarous <hi>Perſecutions</hi> diſapprov'd,</l>
               <l>Which made him ev'n by <hi>Protestants</hi> Belov'd:</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>That Power Uſurp'd by ſome He did diſown,</l>
                  <l>With Bulls to thruſt a Monarch from his Throne,</l>
                  <l>For an Opinion differing from his own.</l>
               </lg>
               <l>But Tyranny in Kings, <hi>Romes</hi> Sons Profeſt,</l>
               <l>Was ne're Approv'd in His more Noble Breaſt;</l>
               <l>Elſe He had ſurely lent a helping Hand</l>
               <l>To a Late Monarch to Re-gain his Land,</l>
               <l>And from His Treaſures, mighty Summs had given</l>
               <l>To Re-inthrone him tho' De-throned by Heaven:</l>
               <l>But He found better ways t'exhauſt His Store,</l>
               <l>And Free the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> World from <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Pow'r;</l>
               <l>And where 'twas needful Nobly He beſtow'd</l>
               <l>His-Church Revenues for the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Good.</l>
               <l>To <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Venetians</hi> a True Friend,</l>
               <l>Pecuniary Aids He oft did ſend,</l>
               <l>And for th'ungrateful Pole, great Summs Advance,</l>
               <l>(Altho' out-done by greater Sums from <hi>France:</hi>)</l>
               <l>Theſe ways He knew His Bounty beſt became,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus <hi>Peters Patrimony</hi> He Employ'd,</l>
               <l>Before laid out in Luxury and Pride;</l>
               <l>His Train and Table both He did Retrench</l>
               <l>Chriſts Enemies to Reſiſt; The <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>French:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Temperate and Humble for Himſelf He ſhew'd,</l>
               <l>But fervent Zeal Tranſported Him for GOD.</l>
               <l>And as His Life His Virtuous Acts declare,</l>
               <l>So even in Death is ſeen His Pious Care;</l>
               <l>For in His Bed as Languiſhing He lay,</l>
               <l>Feeling how ſwiftly Nature did decay,</l>
               <l>And having the laſt Sacrament receiv'd,</l>
               <l>As by their Tenets firmly is believ'd:</l>
               <l>He to the Sacred Congregation ſends,</l>
               <l>And does to their unbyaſs'd Choice commend</l>
               <l>(On His Departure from St. <hi>Peters Chair</hi>)</l>
               <l>A Perſon worthy to Succeed Him there:</l>
               <l>And gave ſtrict Charge they ſhould Employ His Store,</l>
               <l>To Eaſe the People, and Relieve the Poor.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If this be <hi>Chriſtian</hi>-like, we may forgive</l>
               <l>Thoſe falſer Tenets that He might believe;</l>
               <l>Yet while alive, ſmall Love He gain'd from ſome,</l>
               <l>So ill true Virtue is Maintained at <hi>Rome:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Now <hi>Dead,</hi> His Loſs they Juſtly do bemoan,</l>
               <l>Ne're truly Valuing their Good, till gone.</l>
               <l>Whom with Reproaches they purſu'd of late,</l>
               <l>And made the Object of their Cauſeleſs Hate;</l>
               <l>His Princely Robes they do to Relicts ſhread,</l>
               <l>And pay Him Veneration now He's <hi>Dead.</hi>
