            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving added a brief Account
of the Design, Order, and
Method of the ensuing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
in an <hi>Appendix</hi> at
the Close of it; I shall not
here detain the <hi>Reader</hi> with the Proposal of
them. Yet some few things remain, which I
judge it necessary to mind him of. Be he who
he will, I am sure we shall not differ about the
weight of the Argument in hand; for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be the Truth we contend for, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
yet it will not be denied, but that the
Determination of it, and the setling of the
minds of Men about it, are of the highest
concernment unto them. But whereas so much
hath been written of late by others on this
Subject, any further Debate of it
may seem either needless or unseasonable.
<pb facs="tcp:106952:3"/>
Something therefore may be spoken to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that the Reader is not imposed on by
that, which may absolutely fall under either
of those Characters. Had the End in and
by these Discourses been effectually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished,
it had been altogether useless to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
an indeavour unto the same purpose.
But whereas an Opposition unto the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the Grounds whereon we believe it
to be a Divine Revelation, is still openly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
amongst us; a continuation of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the one and the other cannot reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be judged either needless or unseasonable.
Besides, most of the Discourses published of
late on this Subject have had their peculiar
Designs, wherein that here tendred is not
expresly ingaged. For some of them do prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
aim to prove, that we have sufficient
Grounds to believe the Scripture, without
any recourse unto, or reliance upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative
Proposal of the <hi>Church of
Rome;</hi> which they have sufficiently evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
beyond any possibility of rational Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
from their Adversaries. Others have
<pb facs="tcp:106952:3"/>
pleaded &amp; vindicated those rational Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
whereby our Assent unto the Divine
Original of it, is fortified and confirmed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Exceptions and Objections of such
whose Love of Sin, and Resolutions to live
therein, tempts them to seek for shelter in an
Atheistical Contempt of the Authority of
God, evidencing it self therein. But as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these are utterly neglected in the ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Discourse, so the peculiar Design of it
is of another nature. For the Inquiries ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
therein, namely, what is the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon us to believe the Scripture to be the
Word of God? what are the Causes, and what
is the Nature of that Faith whereby we do
so? what it rests on, and is resolved into, so as
to become a Divine and Acceptable Duty?
do respect the Consciences of Men immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
and the Way whereby they may come
to Rest and Assurance in Believing. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
therefore it is evident, that may are often
shaken in their Minds, with-those Atheistical
Objections against the Divine Original and
Authority of the Scripture, which they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb facs="tcp:106952:4"/>
meet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; that many know not
how to extricate themselves from the ensna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Questions that they are often attaqued
withal about them; not for want of a due
Assent unto them, but of a right Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what is the true and formal Reason of
that Assent; what is the firm Basis and
Foundation that it rests upon; what Answer
they may directly and peremptotily give unto
that Enquiry, <hi>Wherefore do you believe
the Scripture to be the Word of God?</hi>
I have endeavoured to give them those Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
herein, that upon a due Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they will find compliant with the Scripture
it self, right Reason, and their own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.
I am not therefore altogether without
hopes that this small Discourse may have its
use, and be given out in its proper season.
Moreover, I think it necessary to acquaint
the Reader, that as I have allowed all the
Arguments pleaded by others to prove the
Divine Authority of the Scripture, their
proper place, and force; so where I differ
in the Explication of any thing belonging
<pb facs="tcp:106952:4"/>
unto this Subject from the Conceptions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Men, I have candidly examined such
Opinions, and the Arguments wherewith they
are confirmed, without straining the Words,
cavilling at the Expressions, or reflections
on the Persons of any of the Authors of them.
And whereas I have my self been otherwise
dealt withal by many, and know not how
soon I may be so again, I do hereby free the
Persons of such Humours and Inclinations
from all fear of any Reply from me, or the
least notice of what they shall be pleased to
write or say. Such kind of Writings are of
the same consideration with me, as those
multiplied false Reports which some have
raised concerning me, the most of them so
ridiculous and foolish, so alien from my
Principles, Practice, and Course of life,
as I can not but wonder how any Persons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to Gravity and Sobriety, are not
sensible how their Credulity and Inclinations
are abused in the hearing and repetition of
them. The Occasion of this Discourse is
that which in the last Place I shall acquaint
<pb facs="tcp:106952:5"/>
the Reader withal. About three years since
I published a Book about the Dispensation and
Operations of the Spirit of God. That Book
was one Part only of what I designed on that
Subject. The Consideration of the Work
of the Holy Spirit, as the Spirit of Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of Supplication, of Consolation, and as
the Immediate Author of all Spiritual Offices,
and Gifts extraordinary and ordinary, is
designed unto the second Part of it. Hereof
this insuing Discourse is concerning one Part
of his Work, as a <hi>Spirit of Illumination,</hi>
which upon the earnest Requests of some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Nature and Substance of
it, I have suffered to come out by it self, that
it might be of the more common use, and
more easily obtained.</p>

is a part, is to declare the
<hi>Work of the Holy Ghost in the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the minds of Men.</hi>
For this Work is particularly and
eminently ascribed unto him; or
the Efficacy of the Grace of God by him dispensed,
<hi>Ephes. 1. 17, 18. Heb. 6. 4. Luke 2. 32. Acts</hi> 13.
47. <hi>Chap. 24. 45. Chap. 26. 18. 2 Cor. 4. 4. 1 Pet.</hi>
2. 9. The objective Cause and outward Means of
it, are the Subjects at present designed unto Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.
And it will issue in these two Enquiries.</p>
            <p>1. On what Grounds, or for what Reason, we do
believe the Scripture to be the Word of God with
Faith Divine and Supernatural, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of us in a way of Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:106952:6"/>
2. How or by what means we may come to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
aright the Mind of God in the Scripture,
or the Revelations that are made unto us of his
Mind and Will therein.</p>
            <p>For by <hi>Illumination</hi> in general, as it denotes an
Effect wrought in the minds of Men, I understand
that <hi>Supernatural Knowledg</hi> that any Man hath, or
may have of the Mind and Will of God, as reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto him by <hi>Supernatural</hi> Means, for the Law
of his Faith, Life, and Obedience. And this so
far as it is comprised in the first of these Inquiries,
is that, whose Declaration we at present design,
reserving the latter unto a distinct Discourse by it
self also. Unto the former some things may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Supernatural Revelation is the only Objective
cause and means of Supernatural Illumination.</hi> These
things are commensurate. There is a <hi>natural</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of <hi>Supernatural</hi> things, and that both <hi>Theoreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi>
and <hi>Practical, Rom. 1. 19. Chap.</hi> 2. 14, 15.
And there may be a <hi>Supernatural</hi> knowledg of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi>
things, 1 <hi>Kings 4. 31, 32, 33, 34. Exod.</hi> 31. 3,
4, 5, 6. But unto this supernatural <hi>Illumination,</hi>
it is required, both that its <hi>Object</hi> be things only
supernaturally revealed, or <hi>as</hi> supernaturally reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9, 10. and that it be wrought in us
by a supernatural Efficiency, or the immediate Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
of the Spirit of God, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 17, 18, 19.
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. This <hi>David</hi> prays for, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 18.

The Light he prayed for <hi>within,</hi> did meerly respect
the Doctrine of the Law <hi>without.</hi> This the Apostle
fully declares; <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1, 2. The various Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Revelations that God hath made of himself,
his Mind and Will from first to last, are the sole and
adequate Object of Supernatural Illumination.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This <hi>Divine external Revelation,</hi> was
originally by various ways, (which we have else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
declared) given unto sundry persons immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
partly for their own Instruction and Guidance
in the Knowledg of God and his Will, and partly by
their Ministry to be communicated unto the Church.
So was it granted unto <hi>Enoch</hi> the seventh from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
who thereon prophesied to the warning and
instruction of others: <hi>Jude</hi> 14, 15. And to <hi>Noah,</hi>
who became thereby a <hi>Preacher of Righteousness,</hi>
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. And to <hi>Abraham,</hi> who thereon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his Children and Houshold to keep the way
of the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 19. And other instances of
the like kind may be given: <hi>Gen. 4. 26. Chap.</hi> 5. 28.
And this course did God continue a long time, even
from the first promise to the giving of the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any Revelations were committed to writing, for
the space of 2460 years. For so long a season did God
enlighten the minds of Men by Supernatural external
immediate occasional Revelations. Sundry things
may be observed of this divine dispensation, As</p>
            <p>1. That it did <hi>sufficiently evidence its self to be from
God,</hi> unto the minds of those unto whom it was
granted, and theirs also unto whom these Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were by them communicated. For during this sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<hi>Satan</hi> used his utmost endeavours to possess the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106952:7"/>
minds of men with his delusions under the pretence
of divine Supernatural Inspirations. For hereunto
belongs the Original of all his <hi>Oracles,</hi> and <hi>Enthusis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmes</hi>
among the Nations of the World. There
was therefore a divine Power and Efficacy attending
all <hi>Divine Revelations</hi> ascertaining and <hi>infallably</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
the minds of men of their being from God.
For if it had not been so, men had never been able to
secure themselves, that they were not <hi>imposed on</hi> by
the crafty deceits of <hi>Satan,</hi> especially in such Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
as seemed to contain things contrary to their
Reason, as in the command given to <hi>Abraham</hi> for the
sacrificing his Son, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 2. Wherefore these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Revelations had not been a sufficient means
to secure the Faith and Obedience of the Church, if
they had not carried along with them their <hi>own evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
that they were from God. Of what nature
that <hi>Evidence was,</hi> we shall afterwards enquire.
For the present I shall only say, that it was an <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
unto Faith and not to <hi>Sense;</hi> as is that also
which we have now by the Scripture. It is not like
that which the <hi>Sun</hi> gives of it self by its Light,
which there needs no exercise of Reason to assure us
of; for Sense is irresistibly affected with it. But it
is like the Evidence which the <hi>Heavens</hi> and the <hi>Earth</hi>
give of their being made and created of God, and
thereby of his Being and Power. This they do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably
and infallibly. <hi>Psal. 19. 1, 2. Rom.</hi> 1. 19,
20, 21. Yet is it required hereunto, that men do
use and exercise the best of their <hi>rational Abilities</hi> in
the consideration and contemplation of them. Where
this is neglected, notwithstanding their open and
visible Evidence unto the contrary, men degenerate
into <hi>Atheism.</hi> God so gave out these Revelations
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106952:7"/>
of himself, as to require the exercise of the <hi>Faith,
Conscience, Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> of them unto
whom they were made, and therein they gave full
Assurance of their proceeding from him. So he tells
us that his Word differeth from all other pretended
Revelations, as the <hi>Wheat doth from the Chaff, Jer.</hi> 23.
28. But yet it is our duty to try and sift the <hi>Wheat</hi>
from the <hi>Chaff,</hi> or we may not evidently discern the
one from the other.</p>
            <p>2. The things so revealed were <hi>sufficient</hi> to guide
and direct all persons in the Knowledg of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to God, in all that was required of them in a way
of Faith or Obedience. God from the beginning
gave out the knowledg of his Will <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>by
sundry parts and degrees;</hi> yet so that every Age and
Season had Light enough to guide them in the
whole Obedience required of them, and unto their
Edification therein. They had knowledg enough
to enable them to offer <hi>Sacrifices</hi> in Faith, as did <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel;</hi>
to <hi>walk with God,</hi> as did <hi>Enoch;</hi> and to teach
their Families the fear of the Lord, as did <hi>Abraham.</hi>
The World perished not for want of sufficient Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the mind of God at any time. Indeed
when we go to consider those divine Instructions
which are upon Record that God granted unto
them, we are scarce able to discern how they were
<hi>sufficiently</hi> enlightned in all that was necessary for
them to believe and do. But they were unto them
as a <hi>Light shining in a dark place.</hi> Set up but a <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle</hi>
in a <hi>dark</hi> room, and it will sufficiently enlighten
it, for men to attend their necessary occasions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
But when the <hi>Sun</hi> is risen and shineth in at all
the Windows, the light of the <hi>Candle</hi> grows so dim
and useless, that it seems strange that any could
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106952:8"/>
have advantage thereby. The <hi>Sun of Righteousness</hi>
is now risen upon us, and Immortality is brought
<hi>to light</hi> by the Gospel. If we look now on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations
granted unto them of old, we may yet see
there was light in them, which yields us little more
advantage than the light of a Candle in the Sun.
But unto them who lived before this <hi>Sun arose,</hi>
they were a sufficient Guide unto all Duties of Faith
and Obedience. For</p>
            <p>3. There was during this season <hi>a sufficient Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,</hi>
for the declaration of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> which
God made of Himself and his Will. There was
the <hi>natural Ministry</hi> of Parents, who were obliged
to instruct their Children and Families in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Truth which they had received. And
whereas this began in <hi>Adam,</hi> who first received the
Promise, and therewithal whatsoever was necessary
unto Faith and Obedience; the knowledg of it
could not be lost without the <hi>wilful neglect</hi> of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
in teaching, or of Children and Families in
learning. And they had the <hi>extraordinary Ministry</hi>
of such as God entrusted new Revelations withal,
for the confirmation and inlargment of those before
received, who were all of them <hi>Preachers of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi>
unto the rest of Mankind. And it may be
manifested, that from the giving of the <hi>first Promise,</hi>
when <hi>divine external Revelations</hi> began to be the
Rule of Faith and Life unto the Church, to the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the Law; there was always alive one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who receiving divine Revelations immediatly,
were a kind of infallible Guides unto others. If it
was otherwise at any time, it was after the death
of the <hi>Patriarks,</hi> before the Call of <hi>Moses,</hi> during
which time, all things went into Darkness and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106952:8"/>
Confusion. For oral <hi>Tradition</hi> alone would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Truth of former Revelations. But by
whom these Instructions were received, they had
a sufficient outward means for their Illumination,
before any divine Revelations were recorded by
Writing. Yet,</p>
            <p>4. This way of Instruction, as it was in it self
<hi>imperfect,</hi> and liable to many disadvantages, so
through the weakness, negligence and wickedness
of men, it proved <hi>insufficient</hi> to retain the knowledg
of God in the World. For under this <hi>Dispensation</hi>
the Generality of Mankind fell into their great <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy</hi>
from God, and betook themselves unto the
conduct and service of the Devil; of the ways,
means, and degrees whereof I
have discoursed* elsewhere.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>De Naturae Theologiae,</hi> lib. 3.</note> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God also regarded them not,
but <hi>suffered all Nations to walk in
their own ways,</hi> Acts 14. 16. giving them up to
their own hearts lusts to <hi>walk in their own Counsels;</hi>
as it is expressed, <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 12. And although
this fell not out without the horrible wickedness and
ingratitude of the World; yet there being then no
<hi>certain Standard</hi> of divine Truth, whereunto they
might repair, they brake off the easier from God
through the imperfection of this Dispensation. If
it shall be said, that since the Revelation of the Will
of God hath been committed unto Writing, men
have Apostatized from the Knowledge of God, as is
evident in many Nations of the World, which
sometimes professed the Gospel, but are now over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
with <hi>Heathenism, Mahometism,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry:</hi>
I say, this hath not come to pass through any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in the way and means of <hi>Illumination,</hi> or the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106952:9"/>
Communication of the Truth unto them; but God
hath given them up to be destroyed for their <hi>wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and <hi>ingratitude,</hi> and unless <hi>we repent, we shall
all likewise perish,</hi> Rom. 1. 18. 2 Thes. 2. 11, 12.
Otherwise where the Standard of the Word is once
fixed, there is a constant means of preserving di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelations. Wherefore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God hath gathered up into the <hi>Scripture</hi>
all divine Revelations given out by himself from the
beginning of the World, and all that ever shall be
so to the end thereof, which are of <hi>general use</hi> unto
the Church, that it may be throughly instructed in
the <hi>whole mind and will of God,</hi> and directed in all
that Worship of Him, and Obedience unto Him,
which is necessary to give us acceptance with Him
here, and to bring us unto the eternal enjoyment of
him hereafter. For (1.) When God first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the Law to writing, with all those things
which accompanied it, he obliged the Church unto
the use of it <hi>alone,</hi> without <hi>Additions</hi> of any kind.
Now this he would not have done, had he not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
therein, that is the <hi>Books of Moses,</hi> all that
was any way needful unto the Faith and Obedience
of the Church. For he did not only command them
to attend with all diligence unto his Word, as it
was then written for their instruction and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Faith and Obedience, annexing all sorts of
Promises unto their so doing, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 6, 7. but also
expresly forbids them, as was said, to <hi>add</hi> any
thing thereunto, or to <hi>conjoyn</hi> any thing therewith,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 2. chap. 12, 32. which he would not have
done, had he omitted other divine Revelations, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
given,</hi> that were any way necessary unto the
use of the Church. As he added many new Ones,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106952:9"/>
so he gathered in all the old from the <hi>unfaithful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pository
of Tradition,</hi> and fixed them in a Writing,
given by divine Inspiration. (2.) For all other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelations, which were given out to the
Church, for its use in general under the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they are all comprised in the <hi>following Books</hi>
thereof; Nor was this (that I know of) ever que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned
by any Person pretending to Sobriety;
though some, who would be glad of any pretence
against the Integrity and Perfection of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
have fruitlesly wrangled about the <hi>loss of some
Books,</hi> which they can never prove concerning any
one, that was certainly of a divine Original.
(3.) The full Revelation of the whole mind of God,
whereunto nothing pretending thereunto is ever
to be added, was committed unto, and perfected by
<hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> Heb. 1. 1, 2. That the Revelations of
God, made by him, whether in his <hi>own Person,</hi>
or by his <hi>Spirit</hi> unto his Apostles, were also by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Inspiration committed to Writing, is expressly
affirmed concerning what he delivered in his own
personal Ministry, <hi>Luk. 1. 4. Acts 1. 1. John</hi> 20. 31.
and may be proved by uncontroulable Arguments
concerning the rest of them. Hence, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the old Testament were shut up with a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Admonition unto the Church, to adhere
unto the <hi>Law and Testimony,</hi> with threatning of a
Curse unto the contrary, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 4, 5, 6. So the
Writings of the New Testament are closed with a
Curse on any that shall presume to add any thing
more thereunto, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 18. Wherefore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Scripture is now become <hi>the only
external means of divine supernatural Illumination,</hi>
because 'tis the only Repository of all divine superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106952:10"/>
Revelation, <hi>Psal. 19. 7, 8. Isa. 8. 20. 2 Tim.</hi> 3.
15, 16, 17. The Pretences of Tradition, as a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral
means of preserving and communicating su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Revelation, have been so often evicted
of falsity, that I shall not further press their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment.
Besides, I intend those in this Discourse
by whom it is acknowledged, that the <hi>Bible</hi> is, as a
sufficient and perfect, so the only Treasury of divine
Revelations: And what hath been offered by any
to weaken or impair its esteem, by taking off from
its credibility, perfection and sufficiency as unto
all its own proper ends, hath brought no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
unto the Church, nor benefit unto the Faith of
Believers. But yet,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In asserting the Scripture to be the <hi>only</hi>
external means of divine Revelation, I do it not
<hi>exclusively</hi> unto those Institutions of God which
are <hi>subordinate</hi> unto it, and appointed as means to
make it effectual unto our souls, As</p>
            <p>1. Our own <hi>personal endeavours</hi> in reading, stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying
and meditating on the Scripture, that we
my come unto a right Apprehension of the things
contained in it, are required unto this purpose. It
is known to all, how frequently <hi>this Duty</hi> is pressed
upon us, and what Promises are annexed to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of it; <hi>see Deut. 6. 6, 7. chap.</hi> 11. 18, 19.
<hi>Josh. 1. 8. Psal. 1. 2. Psal. 119. Col. 3. 16. 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 15.
Without this it is in vain to expect <hi>Illumination</hi> by
the Word. And therefore we may see multitudes
living and walking in extreme darkness, when yet
the Word is every-where <hi>nigh</hi> unto them; Bread,
which is the Staff of life, will yet nourish no man
who doth not provide it, and feed upon it; no
more would <hi>Manna,</hi> unless it was gathered and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106952:10"/>
Our own Natures, and the Nature of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelations considered, and what is necessary
for the application of the one to the other, makes
this evident. For God will instruct us in his mind
and will, as we are men, in and by the rational fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of our souls. Nor is an <hi>external Revelation</hi>
capable of making any other impression on us, but
what is so received. Wherefore, when I say, that
the Scripture is the <hi>only</hi> external means of our <hi>Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,</hi>
I include therein all our own <hi>personal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours</hi>
to come to the knowledge of the mind of
God therein, which shall be afterwards spoken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
And those, who under any pretences do keep,
drive, or perswade men from reading and meditating
on the Scripture, do take an effectual course to
keep them in and under the power of Darkness.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>mutual Instruction</hi> of one another in the
mind of God out of the Scripture, is also required
hereunto. For we are obliged by the <hi>Law of Nature</hi>
to endeavour the good of others in various degrees,
as our Children, our Families, our Neighbours,
and all with whom we have Conversation. And
this is the principal Good absolutely considered,
that we can communicate unto others, namely, to
instruct them in the knowledge of the mind of God.
This whole Duty in all the Degrees of it is represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in that Command, <hi>Thou shalt teach my Words di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
unto thy Children, and shalt talk of them when
thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the
way, and when thou lyest down, and when thou risest up.</hi>
Deut. 6. 7. Thus when our Saviour found his
Disciples <hi>talking of the things of God by the way side,</hi>
he bearing unto them the person of a private man,
instructed them in the sense of the Scripture,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106952:11"/>
               <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 26, 27, 32. And the neglect of this Duty
in the World, which is so great that the very men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, or the least attempt to perform it, is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>scorn and reproach,</hi> is one cause of the great
ignorance &amp; darkness, which yet abounds among us.
But the nakedness of this folly, whereby men would
be esteemed Christians in the open contempt of all
Duties of Christianity, will in due time be laid open.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Ministry of the Word</hi> in the Church is
that which is principally included in this Assertion.
The Scripture is the <hi>only</hi> means of Illumination,
but it becometh so <hi>principally</hi> by the application of
it unto the minds of men in the Ministry of the
Word, see <hi>Mat. 5. 14, 15. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 18, 19, 20.
<hi>Eph. 4. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. 1 Tim.</hi> 3. 15. The
<hi>Church,</hi> and the Ministry of it, are the Ordinances of
God unto this end, that his Mind and Will as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in the Word, may be made known to the
Children of Men, whereby they are enlightned.
And that Church and Ministry, whereof this is not
the <hi>first principal design and work,</hi> is neither ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
of God, nor approved by him. Men will
one day find themselves deceived in trusting to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty
Names, it is Duty <hi>alone,</hi> that will be Comfort
and Reward, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That the <hi>Scripture,</hi> which thus contains
the whole of divine Revelation, may be a sufficient
external cause of Illumination unto us, two things
are required.</p>
            <p>1. That we <hi>believe it to be a divine Revelation,</hi>
that is the Word of God, or a Declaration of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
his Mind and Will, immediatly proceeding
from Him; or that it is of a pure divine <hi>Original,</hi>
proceeding neither from the folly or deceit, nor
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106952:11"/>
from the skill or honesty of men; so is it stated,
2 <hi>Pet. 1. 19, 20, 21. Heb. 1. 1. 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 16.
<hi>Isa.</hi> 8. 20. It tenders no light or instruction under
any other notion, but as it comes immediatly from
God; not as the Word of Man, but as <hi>it is indeed
the Word of the Living God, 1 Thes.</hi> 2. 13. And
what ever any one may learn from or by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
under any other consideration, it belongeth
not unto the Illumination we enquire after. <hi>Nehem.</hi>
8. 8. <hi>Isa. 28. 9. Hos. 14. 9. Prov. 1. 6. Psal.</hi> 119. 34:
<hi>Mat. 15. 16. 2 Tim. 2. 7. 1 John</hi> 5. 20.</p>
            <p>2. That we <hi>understand the things declared in it,</hi> or
the Mind of God as revealed and expressed therein.
For if it be given unto us a <hi>sealed Book,</hi> which we
cannot read, either because it is <hi>sealed,</hi> or because
we are <hi>ignorant</hi> and cannot read, whatever Visions
or means of Light it hath in it, we shall have no
advantage thereby, <hi>Isa.</hi> 29. 11, 12. It is not the
Words themselves of the Scripture only, but our
understanding them that gives us light, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 130.
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,—the opening the Door, the
<hi>entrance of thy Word giveth light.</hi> It must be <hi>opened,</hi>
or it will not enlighten. So the Disciples understood
not the <hi>Testimonies</hi> of the Scripture concerning the
Lord Christ, they were not enlightned by them,
until he expounded them unto them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 27, 45.
As we have the same instance in the <hi>Eunuch</hi> and
<hi>Philip, Acts</hi> 8. 31, 35, 36. To this very day the
Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> have the Scriptures of the old
Testament, and the outward Letter of them in
such esteem and veneration, that they even adore
and worship them, yet are they not <hi>enlightned</hi> by it.
And the same is fallen out among many that are
called Christians, or they could never embrace such
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106952:12"/>
foolish opinions, and practise such <hi>Idolatries</hi> in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
as some of them do, who yet enjoy the Letter
of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>And this brings me to my design, which we have
been thus far making way unto; and it is to shew
that both these are from the Holy Ghost; namely
that we <hi>truly believe</hi> the Scripture to be the Word
of God; and that we <hi>understand savingly</hi> the mind
of God therein, both which belong unto our Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
            <p>That which I shall first enquire into, is, the <hi>way
how, and the ground whereon we come to believe the
Scripture to be the Word of God in a due manner.</hi> For
that this is required of us in a <hi>way of duty,</hi> namely,
that we should believe the Scripture to be the Word
of God with <hi>Faith Divine and Supernatural,</hi> I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
will not be denyed, and it shall be afterwards
proved. And what is the work of the Spirit of
God herein, will be our first enquiry.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Whereas we see by experience, that all
who have or enjoy the Scripture, do not yet <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it,</hi> or come to an useful saving Knowledg of
the Mind and Will of God therein revealed; our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
enquiry shall be, how we may come to <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Word</hi> of God aright, and what is the work
of the Spirit of God in the assistance which he afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us unto that purpose.</p>
            <p>With respect unto the first of these Enquiries,
whereunto the present discourse is singly designed,
I affirm that it <hi>is the work of the Holy Spirit to enable
us to believe the Scripture to be the Word of God,</hi> or
the supernatural immediate Revelation of his mind
unto us, and infallibly to evidence it unto our minds,
so as that we may spiritually and savingly acquiesce
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106952:12"/>
therein. Some upon a mistake of this Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
do seem to suppose that we resolve all Faith into
private suggestions of the Spirit, or deluding
pretences thereof; and some (it may be) will be ready
to apprehend that we confound the <hi>efficient</hi> Cause,
and <hi>formal</hi> Reason of Faith or believing, rendring
all rational Arguments and external Testimonies
useless. But indeed there neither is nor shall be any
occasion administred unto these fears or imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
For we shall plead nothing in this matter but
what is consonant to the <hi>Faith</hi> and Judgment of
the Ancient and present Church of God, as shall be
fully evidenced in our progress. I know some have
found out other ways whereby the minds of men as
they suppose may be sufficiently satisfied in the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority</hi> of the Scripture. But I have tasted
of <hi>their new Wine</hi> and desire it not, because I know
the <hi>Old</hi> to be better, though what they plead is of
use in its proper place.</p>
            <p>My Design requires that I should confine my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
unto as narrow bounds as possible, and I shall
so do; shewing,</p>
            <p>1. What it is in general, <hi>infallibly to believe the
Scripture to be the Word of God,</hi> and what is the
Ground and Reason of our so doing? Or, what it
is <hi>to believe the Scripture to be the Word of God,</hi> as we
are required to believe it so to be in a way of Duty.</p>
            <p>2. That there are <hi>external Arguments</hi> of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Original of the Scripture, which are effectual
Motives to perswade us to give an unfeigned assent
thereunto.</p>
            <p>3. That yet moreover God requires of us, that
we believe them to be his Word with <hi>Faith divine,
supernatural,</hi> and <hi>infallible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:106952:13"/>
4. <hi>Evidence</hi> the Grounds and Reasons whereon
we do so believe, and ought so to do.</p>
            <p>Unto these Heads most of what ensues in the first
part of this Discourse may be reduced.</p>
            <p>It is meet that we should clear the Foundation
whereon we build, and the Principles whereon we
do proceed; that what we design to prove may
be the better understood by all sorts of Persons,
whose edification we intend. For these things are
the equal concernment of the learned and unlearned.
Wherefore some things must be insisted on, which
are generally known and granted. And our first
Enquiry is, <hi>What it is to believe the Scripture to be
the Word of God with Faith divine and supernatural,</hi>
according as it is our duty so to do.</p>
            <p>And in our <hi>Believing</hi> or our <hi>Faith,</hi> two things
are to be considered. (1.) <hi>What</hi> it is that we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.
And (2.) <hi>Wherefore</hi> we do so believe it? The
first is the material Object of our Faith, namely,
the things which we do believe; the latter the
<hi>formal</hi> Object of it, or the Cause and Reason why
we do believe them; and these things are distinct.
The <hi>Material</hi> Object of our Faith, is the things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in the Scripture, declared unto us in propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
of Truth. For things must be so proposed
unto us, or we cannot believe them. That God is
one in three Persons, that Jesus Christ is the Son of
God, and the like <hi>propositions of Truth,</hi> are the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial</hi>
Object of our Faith, or the things that we do
believe; And the <hi>Reason</hi> why we do believe them,
is, because they are proposed in the Scripture. Thus
the Apostle expresseth the whole of what we intend,
1 <hi>Cor. 15. 3, 4. I delivered unto you first of all that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106952:13"/>
which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins
according to the Scriptures, and that he was buried,
and that he rose again the third day according to the
Scriptures.</hi> Christs Death and Burial and Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
are the things proposed unto us to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and so the <hi>Object</hi> of our Faith. But the Reason
why we believe them is, because they are <hi>declared
in the Scriptures,</hi> see <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 28, 29, 30. Sometimes
indeed this Expression of <hi>believing the Scriptures</hi>
by a <hi>Metonymy,</hi> denotes both the <hi>formal</hi> and <hi>material</hi>
Objects of our Faith, the Scriptures themselves as
such, and the things contained in them, so <hi>John</hi> 2. 22.
<hi>They believed the Scripture and the Word that Jesus
said,</hi> or the things delivered in the Scripture, and
further declared by Christ, which before they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
not. And they did so believe what was
declared in the Scriptures, <hi>because it was so declared</hi>
in them; both are intended in the same Expression,
<hi>they believed the Scripture,</hi> under various considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
so <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 27. The <hi>material Object</hi> of our
Faith therefore are the Articles of our <hi>Creed,</hi> by
whose Enumeration we answer unto that question,
<hi>what we believe?</hi> giving an account of the hope
that is in us, as the Apostle doth, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 22, 23.
But if moreover we are asked a <hi>Reason</hi> of our Faith
or Hope, or <hi>why</hi> we believe the things we do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
as God to be One in three Persons, Jesus
Christ to be the Son of God? we do not answer, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
so it is,</hi> for this is that which we believe,
which were senseless. But we must give some other
Answer unto that Enquiry, whether it be made
by others or our selves. The proper Answer unto
this Question contains the <hi>formal Reason and Object</hi>
of our Faith, that which it rests upon and is resolved
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106952:14"/>
into. And this is that which we look after.</p>
            <p>2. We do not in this Enquiry intend any kind
of Perswasion or Faith but that which is <hi>divine</hi> and
<hi>infallible,</hi> both which it is from its formal Reason
or objective Cause. Men may be able to give some
<hi>kind of Reasons,</hi> why they believe what they profess
so to do, that will not suffice or abide the trial in
this case, although they themselves may rest in them.
Some it may be can give no other Account hereof,
but that they have been so instructed by them
whom they have <hi>sufficient reason</hi> to give credit unto;
or that they have so received them by Tradition
from their Fathers. Now whatever Perswasion
these Reasons may beget in the minds of men, that
the things which they profess to believe are true,
yet if they are alone, it is not <hi>divine Faith</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they do believe, but that which is meerly <hi>humane,</hi>
as being resolved into humane Testimony only, or
an Opinion on probable Arguments; for no Faith
can be of any other kind, than is the <hi>Evidence</hi> it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects
on, or ariseth from. I say, it is so where they
are alone: for I doubt not but that some who have
never further considered the reason of their believing
than the teaching of their Instructors, have yet that
Evidence in their own souls of the Truth and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of God in what they believe, that with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
thereunto their Faith is <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</hi>
The Faith of most hath a beginning and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
not unlike that of the <hi>Samaritans, John</hi> 4. 40,
41, 42. as shall be afterwards declared.</p>
            <p>3. When we enquire after Faith that is <hi>infallible,</hi>
or believing <hi>infallibly,</hi> which, as we shall shew here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
is necessary in this case, we do not intend an
<hi>inherent quality</hi> in the Subject, as though he that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106952:14"/>
believes with Faith <hi>infallible</hi> must himself also be
infallible; much less do we speak of <hi>Infallibility</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely,
which is a property of God, who alone
from the perfection of his Nature can neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
nor be deceived. But it is that Property or
Adjunct of the Assent of our Minds unto divine
Truths or supernatural Revelations, whereby it is
differenced from all other kinds of Assent whatever.
And this it hath from its formal Object, or the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
whereon we give this Assent. For the nature
of every Assent is given unto it by the nature of
the Evidence which it proceedeth from, or relyeth
on. This in divine Faith is divine Revelation,
which being infallible, renders the Faith that rests
on it, and is resolved into it, infallible also. No
man can believe that which is false, or which may
be false, with <hi>divine Faith,</hi> for that which renders
it divine, is the <hi>divine Truth</hi> and Infallibility of the
Ground and Evidence which it is built upon.
But a man may believe that which is true, <hi>infallibly</hi>
so, and yet his Faith not be infallible; That the
Scripture is the Word of God is infallibly true, yet
the Faith whereby a man believes it so to be, may
be <hi>fallible,</hi> for it is such as his Evidence is, and no
other; He may believe it to be so on Tradition, or
the Testimony of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> only, or on
outward Arguments, all which being fallible, his
Faith is so also, although the things he assents unto
be infallibly true. Wherefore unto this Faith di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and infallible, it is not required that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in whom it is, be infallible; nor is it enough that
the thing it self believed be infallibly true, but
moreover that the <hi>Evidence</hi> whereon he doth believe
it be <hi>infallible</hi> also. So it was with them who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106952:15"/>
divine Revelations immediately from God:
It was not enough that the things revealed unto
them were <hi>infallibly true,</hi> but they were to have
infallible Evidence of the Revelation it self; then
was their Faith infallible, though their persons were
fallible. With this Faith then a man can believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what is divinely true, and therefore it is
infallible; and the reason is, because Gods <hi>Veracity,</hi>
who is the God of Truth, is the only Object of it;
Hence saith the Prophet,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>—2 <hi>Chron. 20. 20. Believe in the Lord
your God, and you shall be established;</hi> or that Faith
which is in God and his Word is <hi>fixed on Truth,</hi> or
is infallible. Hence the Enquiry in this case is, what
is the Reason why we believe any thing with this
faith divine or supernatural? or what it is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
whereof makes our Faith divine, infallible
and supernatural? Wherefore,</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Veracity</hi> of God reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>material</hi> Objects of our Faith, or what it is
our Duty to believe, is the <hi>formal</hi> Object and
Reason of our Faith, from whence it ariseth and
whereinto it is ultimately resolved. That is, the
only Reason why we do believe that Jesus Christ is
the Son of God, that God is one single Essence
subsisting in three Persons, is because that God <hi>who
is Truth,</hi> the <hi>God of Truth,</hi> Deut. 32. 4. who <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
lye,</hi> Tit. 1. 2. and whose <hi>Word is Truth.</hi> John 17. 17.
and the Spirit which gave it out is <hi>Truth, 1 John</hi> 5 6.
hath revealed these things to be so; and our belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
these things on that ground renders our Faith
<hi>divine and supernatural.</hi> Supposing also a Respect
unto the subjective Efficiency of the Holy Ghost,
inspiring it into our minds, whereof afterwards.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106952:15"/>
For to speak distinctly, our Faith is <hi>supernatural,</hi>
with respect unto the production of it in our
minds by the Holy Ghost; and <hi>infallible,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
unto the formal Reason of it, which is divine
Revelation; and is <hi>divine,</hi> in opposition unto
what is meerly humane on both accounts.</p>
            <p>As things are proposed unto us to be believed as
true, Faith in its Assent respects only the Truth or
Veracity of God; but whereas this Faith is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of us in a way of Obedience, and is considered
not only <hi>physically</hi> in its nature, but <hi>morally</hi> also as
our Duty, it respects also the Authority of God,
which I therefore joyn with the Truth of God, as
the formal Reason of our Faith, see 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 28.
And these things the Scripture pleads and and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues,
when Faith is required of us in the way of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.
<hi>Thus saith the Lord,</hi> is that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
unto us as the Reason why we should believe
what is spoken, whereunto often times other divine
Names and Titles are added, signifying his <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
who requires us to believe; <hi>Thus saith the
Lord God, the Holy One of Israel,</hi> Isa. 30. 15. <hi>Thus
saith the High and Lofty One, who inhabiteth Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
whose Name is Holy,</hi> Isa. 57. 15. <hi>Believe the
Lord your God,</hi> 2 Chron. 20. 20. The <hi>Word of the
Lord</hi> precedeth most Revelations in the Prophets,
and other Reason why we should believe, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
proposeth none, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1, 2. yea the Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of any other Authority between the things to
be believed and our Souls and Consciences, besides
the <hi>Authority of God,</hi> overthrows the nature of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Faith; I do not say, the Interposition of any
other means <hi>whereby</hi> we should believe, of which
sort God hath appointed many, but the interposition
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106952:16"/>
of anyother <hi>Authority,</hi> upon which we should
believe, as that pretended in and by the Church
of <hi>Rome.</hi> No men can be <hi>Lords of our Faith,</hi>
though they may be <hi>helpers of our Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. The <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Truth of God,</hi> considered
in themselves absolutely, are not the immediate
<hi>formal Object</hi> of our Faith, though they are the <hi>ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate</hi>
whereinto it is resolved. For we can believe
nothing on their Account unless it be <hi>evidenced</hi> unto
us; and this Evidence of them is in that Revelation
which God is pleased to make of himself; for that
is the only means whereby our Consciences and
Minds are affected with his Truth and Authority.
We do therefore no otherwise rest on the Truth and
Veracity of God in any thing than we rest on the
<hi>Revelation</hi> which he makes unto us, for that is the
only way whereby we are affected with them;
Not <hi>the Lord is true</hi> absolutely, but, <hi>Thus saith the
Lord,</hi> and <hi>the Lord hath spoken,</hi> is that which we
have immediate regard unto. Hereby alone are our
minds affected with the Authority and Veracity of
God, and by what way soever it is made unto us,
it is sufficient and able so to affect us. At first, as
hath been shewed, it was given immediately to some
Persons, and preserved for the use of others, in an
<hi>oral</hi> Ministry; but now all Revelation, as hath also
been declared, is contained in the Scriptures
only.</p>
            <p>6. It follows that our Faith whereby we believe
any divine supernatural Truth, is resolved into the
Scripture, as the only means of divine Revelation,
affecting our Minds and Consciences with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Truth of God; or the Scripture, as
the only immediate, divine, infallible Revelation of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106952:16"/>
the Mind and Will of God, is the first immediate
<hi>formal Object</hi> of our Faith, the sole Reason why, and
ground whereon we do believe the things that are
revealed, with Faith Divine, Supernatural and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.
We do believe Jesus Christ to be the Son
of God. Why do we so do, on what ground or
reason? It is because of the Authority of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
us so to do, and the Truth of God testify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereunto. But how or by what means are our
Minds and Consciences affected with the Authority
and Truth of God, so as to believe with respect unto
them, which makes our Faith Divine and Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural?
It is alone the Divine, Supernatural, Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Revelation that he hath made of this sacred
Truth, and of his Will, that we should believe it. But
what is this <hi>Revelation,</hi> or where is it to be found?
It is the Scripture alone which contains the entire
Revelation that God hath made of himself in
all things which he will have us to believe or do.
Hence,</p>
            <p>7. The last Enquiry ariseth, <hi>how,</hi> or <hi>on what
ground,</hi> for <hi>what Reasons</hi> do we believe the Scripture
to be a divine Revelation proceeding immediately
from God; or to be that Word of God which is
Truth divine and infallible? Whereunto we answer,
it is <hi>solely</hi> on the Evidence that the Spirit of God <hi>in
and by the Scripture it self,</hi> gives unto us that it
was given by immediate Inspiration from God. Or
the Ground and Reason whereon we believe the
Scripture to be the Word of God, are the Authority
and Truth of God evidencing themselves in and
by it unto the Minds and Consciences of Men. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as whatever we assent unto as proposed in the
Scripture, our Faith rests on and is resolved into the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106952:17"/>
Veracity and Faithfulness of God, so is it also in this
of believing the Scripture it self to be the infallible
Word of God, seeing we do it on <hi>no other</hi> Grounds
but its <hi>own Evidence</hi> that so it is.</p>
            <p>This is that which is principally to be proved, and
therefore to prepare for it, and to remove prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
something is to be spoken to prepare the way
thereunto.</p>
            <p>1. There are sundry cogent Arguments which
are taken from <hi>External considerations</hi> of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that evince it on rational Grounds to be from
God. All these are <hi>motives of credibility,</hi> or effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
perswasives to account and esteem it to be the
Word of God. And although they neither are, nor
is it possible they ever should be, the Ground and
Reason whereon we believe it so to be with <hi>Faith
Divine and Supernatural;</hi> yet are they necessary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the confirmation of our Faith herein against
Temptations, Oppositions, and Objections. These
Arguments have been pleaded by many and that use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and therefore it is not needful for me to insist
upon them. And they are the same for the substance
of them in <hi>antient</hi> and <hi>modern Writers,</hi> however ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
by some with more Learning, Dexterity, and
force of Reasoning than by others. It may not be
expected therefore that in this short discourse, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
unto another purpose, I should give them
much improvement. However I shall a little touch
on those which seem to be most cogent, and that in
them wherein in my Apprehention their strength
doth lye. And I shall do this to manifest <hi>that</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we plead that no Man can believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to be the Word of God with Faith <hi>Divine,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106952:17"/>
Supernatural and Infallible,</hi> but upon its <hi>own inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Divine Evidence</hi> and <hi>Efficacy,</hi> yet we allow and
make use of all those external Arguments of its sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Truth and divine Original which are pleaded
by others, ascribing unto them as much weight and
cogency as they can do, acknowledging the perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
which they beget and effect to be as firm as they
can pretend it to be. Only we do not judg them
to contain the <hi>whole</hi> of the Evidence which we have
for Faith to rest in, or to be resolved into; yea not
that at all, which renders it <hi>Divine, Supernatural,
and Infallible.</hi> The Rational Arguments we say
which are, or may be used in this matter, with the
humane Testimonies whereby they are corroborated,
may and ought to be made use of and insisted on;
And it is but vainly pretended that their use is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perseded
by our other Assertions; as though where
Faith is required, all the subservient use of Reason
were absolutely discarded, and our Faith thereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<hi>irrational;</hi> And the assent unto the divine Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and Authority of the Scriptures, which the
mind ought to give upon them, we grant to be of as
high a nature as is pretended to be, namely, a <hi>moral
certainty.</hi> Moreover, the Conclusion which unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced
Reason will make upon these Arguments, is
more firm, better grounded, and more pleadable,
than that which is built meerly on the <hi>sole Authority</hi>
of any Church whatever. But this we assert, that
there is an assent of another kind, unto the divine
Original and Authority of the Scriptures required
of us; namely, that of Faith divine and superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.
Of this none will say that it can be effected
by, or resolved into the best and most cogent of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Arguments and external Testimonies, which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106952:18"/>
are absolutely humane and fallible. For it doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
a contradiction to believe infallibly upon fallible
evidence. Wherefore I shall prove, that beyond all
these Arguments and their effect upon our minds,
there is an Assent unto the Scripture as the Word of
God required of us with Faith divine, Supernatural
and Infallible; and therefore there must be a <hi>divine
Evidence</hi> which is the <hi>Formal Object</hi> and Reason of
it, which alone it rests on, and is resolved into,
which shall also be declared and proved. But yet,
as was said in the first place, because their property is
to <hi>level the ground,</hi> and to remove the rubbish of
Objections out of the way, that we may build the
safer on the sure Foundation, I shall mention some
of those which I esteem justly pleadable in this cause.
And,</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Antiquity</hi> of these Writings, and of the
divine Revelation contained in them, is pleaded in
Evidence of their divine Original. And it may be
so deservedly. For where it is <hi>absolute,</hi> it is unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable:
that which is most antient in any kind is
most true; God himself makes use of this plea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Idols,</hi> Isa. 43. 10, 11, 12. <hi>Ye are my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
saith the Lord, I even I, am the Lord, and besides
me there is no Saviour; I have declared and have saved,
and I have shewed when there was no strange God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the
Lord, that I am God.</hi> That which he asserts is, that
he alone is God, and no other. This he calls the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to testify by this Argument, that he was among
them as God, that is, in the Church, before any
<hi>strange God</hi> was known or named. And so it is
justly pleaded in the behalf of this Revelation of the
Mind of God in the Scripture; it was in the World
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106952:18"/>
long before any other thing or writing pretended to
be given unto the same end. Whatever therefore
ensued with the like design, must either be set up
in competition with it, or opposition unto it, above
which it hath its advantage meerly from its Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
Whereas therefore this Writing in the first
books of it, is acknowledged to be antienter than any
other that is extant in the World, or indeed that
ever was so, and may be proved so to be: it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all reasonable apprehension that it should be of
humane Original. For we know how low, weak,
and imperfect all humane Inventions were at the
first, how rude and unpolished in every kind, until
Time, Observation, following Additions and Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutions
had shaped, formed, and improved them.
But this Writing coming forth in the World, abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
the first in its kind, directing us in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of God and our selves, was at first and at once
so absolutely compleat and perfect, that no Art, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
or Wisdom of Man, could ever yet find any
just defect in it, or was able to add any thing unto it
whereby it might be bettered or improved. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the beginning would it ever admit of any
Additions unto it, but what came from the same
Fountain of divine Revelation and Inspirarion,
clearing it self in all Ages from all addition and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfetation
of Men whatever. This at least puts
a singular character upon this <hi>Book,</hi> and represents
it with that reverend Awe and Majesty, that it is the
highest petulancy not to pay it a sacred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.</p>
            <p>This Argument is pursued by many at large, as
that which affordeth great variety of Historical and
Chronological Observations. And it hath been so
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106952:19"/>
scanned and improved, that nothing but the giving
of it a new dress remains for present or future Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
But the real force of it lies in the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the People, by and amongst whom this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
first commenced in the World, and the
time wherein it did so. When some Nations had
so improved and cultivated the light of Nature as
greatly to excel others in Wisdom and Knowledg,
they generally looked upon the people of the Jews
as ignorant and barbarous. And the more wise any
of them conceived themselves, the more they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
them. And indeed they were utter Strangers
unto all those Arts and Sciences, whereby the faculti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of mens Minds are naturally enlightned and enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
Nor did they pretend unto any Wisdom where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to stand iu competition with other Nations, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what they receiv'd by divine Revelations. This alone
God himself had taught them to look upon &amp; esteem
as their only Wisdom before all the World, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 6,
7, 8. Now we shall not need to consider what were the
first Attempts of other Nations, in expressing their
conceptions concerning things Divine, the Duty,
and Happiness of Man. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
were those who vied for Reputation in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of this Wisdom. But it is known and
confessed that the utmost production of their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
were things foolish, irrational and absurd,
contrary to the Being and Providence of God, to
the light of Nature, leading mankind into a maze of
folly and wickedness. But we may consider what
they attained unto in the fulness of time by their
utmost improvement of Science, Wisdom, mutual
Intelligence, Experience, Communication, labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Study and Observation. When they had added
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106952:19"/>
and subducted to and from the Inventions of all
former Ages from Time immemorial, when they
had used and improved the Reason, Wisdom, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
and Conjectures of all that went before
them in the study of this Wisdom, and had discarded
whatever they had found by experience unsuited to
natural Light and the common Reason of mankind,
yet it must be acknowledged that the Apostle passeth
a just censure on the utmost of their Attainments,
namely, that they waxed vain in their Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the World in Wisdom knew not God.
Whence then was it that in one Nation, esteemed
barbarous, and really so with respect unto that Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
those Arts and Sciences which enobled other
Nations, from that Antiquity wherein it is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
that Reason and Wisdom had received any
considerable improvement; without Converse,
Communication, Learning or Experience, there should
at once proceed such a Law, Doctrine and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
concerning God and Man, so stable, certain,
uniform, as should not only incomparably excel all
products of humane Wisdom unto that purpose,
however advantaged by Time and Experience, but
also abide invariable throughout all Generations, so
as that whatever hath been advanced in opposition
unto it, or but differing from it, hath quickly sunk
under the weight of its own unreasonableness and
folly? This one consideration, unless Men have
a Mind to be contentious, gives sufficient satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that this Book could have no other Original,
but what it pleads for it self, namely, an immediate
Emanation from God.</p>
            <p>2. It is apparent that God in all Ages hath had a
great Regard unto it, and acted his Power and Care
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106952:20"/>
in its preservation. Were not the <hi>Bible</hi> what it
pretends to be, there had been nothing more suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Nature of God, and more becoming di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence, then long since to have blotted it
out of the World. For to suffer a <hi>Book</hi> to be in the
World, from the <hi>beginning of times,</hi> falsly pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Name and Authority, seducing so great a
portion of Mankind into a pernitious and ruinous
Apostacy from him, as it must do, and doth, if it
be not of a divine Original, and exposing uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
multitudes of the best, wisest, and soberest
amongst them, unto all sorts of <hi>bloody miseries</hi> which
they have undergone in the behalf of it, seems not
consonant unto that infinite Goodness, Wisdom,
and care wherewith this World is govern'd from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.
But on the contrary, whereas the maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
craft of Satan, and the prevalent power and rage
of Mankind, hath combined and been set at work
to the ruine and utter Suppression of this Book,
proceeding sometimes so far as that there was no
appearing way for its escape; yet through the
watchful care and Providence of God, sometimes
putting it self forth in <hi>miraculous Instances,</hi> it hath
been preserved unto this day, and shall be so to the
consummation of all things. The event of that which
was spoken by our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 18. doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibly
prove the divine Approbation of this Book,
as that doth its divine Original; <hi>Till Heaven and
Earth pass away, one Jot or one Tittle shall in no wise
pass from the Law.</hi> Gods <hi>perpetual care</hi> over the
Scriptures for so many Ages, that not a letter of it
should be utterly lost, nothing that hath the least
tendency towards its end should perish, is evidence
sufficient of his regard unto it. Especially would
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106952:20"/>
it be so, if we should consider with what remarkable
Judgments and severe Reflections of Vengeance on
its opposers, this care hath been managed, instances
whereof might be easily multiplyed. And if any will
not ascribe this preservation of the Books of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
not only in their Being, but in their purity and
Integrity free from the least just suspition of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or the intermixture of any thing humane or
<hi>heterogeneous,</hi> unto the care of God; it is incumbent
on him to assign some other cause proportionate to
such an effect, whilst it was the interest of Heaven,
and the Endeavour of the Earth and Hell to have it
corrupted and destroyed. For my part I cannot but
judg that he that seeth not an hand of divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
stretched out in the preservation of this Book,
and all that is in it, its Words and Syllables for
thousands of years, through all the overthrows and
deluges of Calamities that have befallen the World,
with the <hi>weakness of the means</hi> whereby it hath been
preserved, and the interest in some Ages of all those in
whose power it was to have it corrupted, as it was
of the Apostate Churches of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi>
with the open opposition that hath been made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, doth not believe there is any such thing as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence at all. It was first written in the
very infancy of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Empire, with which
it afterwards contemporized about 900 years. By
this <hi>Monarchy</hi> that people which alone had these <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of God committed unto them,</hi> were oppressed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
and carried into captivity. But this Book
was then preserved amongst them whilst they were
absolutely under the power of their Enemies, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it condemned them and all their Gods and
Religious Worship, wherewith we know how hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106952:21"/>
mankind is inraged. Satan had <hi>enthroned
himself</hi> as the Object of their Worship, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of all ways of divine veneration amongst them.
These they adhered unto as their principal interest,
as all People do unto that they esteem their Religion.
In the whole World there was nothing that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
condemned, opposed him or them, but this Book
only, which was now absolutely in their power. If
that by any means could have been destroyed, then
when it was in the hands but of a few, and those for
the most part flagitious in their lives, hating the
things contained in it, and wholly under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of their Adversaries, the Interest of Satan, and
the whole World in Idolatry, had been secured.
But through the meer provision of divine care it out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived
that <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and saw the ruine of its greatest
Adversaries. So it did also during the continuance
of the <hi>Persian Monarchy</hi> which succeeded, whilst the
people was still under the power of Idolaters, against
whom this was the only Testimony in the World.
By some branches of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy a most
fierce and diligent attempt was made to have utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
destroyed it; but still it was snatched by divine
Power out of the Furnace, not one hair of it being
singed, or the least detriment brought unto its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
The <hi>Romans</hi> destroyed both the people
and place designed until then for its preservation,
carrying the antient coppy of the Law in triumph to
<hi>Rome</hi> on the conquest of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> And whilst all
absolute power and dominion in the whole World,
where this Book was known or heard of, was in
their hands, they exercised a rage against it for sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
Ages, with the same success that former enemies
had. From the very first; all the Endeavours of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106952:21"/>
that professed an open enmity against it have
been utterly frustrate. And whereas also those
unto whom it was outwardly committed, as the
<hi>Jews</hi> first, and the <hi>Antichristian</hi> Church of Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
Christians afterwards, not only fell into Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
and Practices absolutely inconsistent with it,
but also built all their present and future Interests
on those Opinions and Practices; yet none of them
durst ever attempt the corrupting of one Line in it,
but were forced to attempt their own Security, by
a pretence of <hi>Additional Traditions,</hi> and keeping the
Book it self, as much as they durst, out of the
hands and knowledge of all not engaged in the same
Interest with themselves. Whence could all this
proceed but from the watchful Care and Power of
divine Providence? And it is bruitish folly not to
believe, that what God doth so protect did origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
proceed from Himself, seeing it pleads and
pretends so to do: For every wise Man will
take more Care of a Stranger, than a Bastard
falsly imposed on him unto his Dishonour.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Design of the whole</hi> and all the parts of it
hath an impress on it of divine <hi>Wisdom</hi> and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
And hereof there are two parts, First, <hi>to reveal
God unto men,</hi> and Secondly, <hi>to direct men to come
unto the enjoyment of God.</hi> That these are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
two great Concerns of our nature, of any ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Being, were easy to prove, but that it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by all those with whom I treat. Now
never did any Book or Writing in the World, any
single or joynt endeavours of mankind, or invisible
Spirits, in the way of <hi>Authority,</hi> give out a Law,
Rule, Guide, and Light for all mankind universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in both these, namely, the Knowledge of God,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106952:22"/>
and our selves, but this Book only; and if any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it may be, like the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> did pretend in the
least thereunto, it quickly discovered its own folly,
and exposed it self to the contempt of all wise and
considerate men. The only Question is, how it
hath discharged it self in this <hi>Design?</hi> for if it hath
<hi>compleatly</hi> and <hi>perfectly</hi> accomplished it, it is not
only evident that it must be from God, but also
that it is the <hi>greatest Benefit</hi> and <hi>Kindness,</hi> that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Benignity and Goodness ever granted unto
Mankind; for without it all men universally must
necessarily wander in an <hi>endless Maze</hi> of uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
without ever attaining Light, Rest, or Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness,
here or hereafter. Wherefore,</p>
            <p>1. As it takes on it self to speak in the <hi>Name and
Authority of God,</hi> and delivers nothing, commands
nothing, but what becomes his infinite Holiness,
Wisdom, and Goodness; so it makes that Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of him in his Nature, Being, and Subsistence,
with the necessary Properties and Acts thereof, his
Will, with all his voluntary Actings or Works,
wherein we may be or are concerned, so as that we
may know him aright, and entertain true Notions
and Apprehensions of him, according to the utmost
capacity of our finite, limited Understanding.
Neither do we urge his <hi>Authority</hi> in this case, but
here and elsewhere resort unto the Evidence of his
Reasonings compared with the Event or Matter of
Fact. What horrible Darkness, Ignorance and
Blindness was upon the whole World with respect
unto the Knowledge of God? what confusion and
debasement of our Nature ensued thereon,
whilst God <hi>suffered all Nations to walk in their own
ways, and winked at the times of their Ignorance,</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:106952:22"/>
the Apostle declares at large, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. from the <hi>19th</hi>
verse to the end of the Chapter. The Sum is,
That the only true God being become unknown to
them, as the wisest of them acknowledged, <hi>Acts</hi>
17. 21. and as our Apostle proved against them;
the <hi>Devil</hi> that <hi>Murderer from the Beginning,</hi> and
Enemy of Mankind, had under various pretences
substituted himself in his Room, and was become
the <hi>God of this World,</hi> as he is called, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4.
and had appropriated all the religious Devotion and
Worship of the Generality of Mankind unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
For the <hi>things which the Gentiles sacrificed,
they sacrificed unto Devils, and not unto God,</hi> as our
Apostle affirms, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 20. and as
may easily be evinced; and I have
abundantly manifested it<note n="‖" place="margin">De Naturae Theologiae <hi>lib. cap.</hi>
               </note> elsewhere.
It is acknowledged that some few
<hi>speculative Men</hi> among the Heathens did seek after
God in that <hi>horrid Darkness</hi> wherewith they were
encompassed, and laboured to reduce their Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Notions of his Being, unto what Reason
could apprehend of infinite Perfections, and what
the Works of <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> could suggest
unto them; but as they could never come unto any
certainty or consistency of Notions in their own
minds, proceeding but a little beyond Conjecture,
as is the manner of them who seek after any thing
in the dark, much less with one another, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
any thing unto the World for the use of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in these things by common consent; so they
could none of them either ever free themselves
from the grossest practical <hi>Idolatry</hi> in worshipping
the Devil, the Head of their Apostacy from God;
nor in the least influence the minds of the Generality
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106952:23"/>
of Mankind with any due Apprehensions of the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature:</hi> This is the Subject and Substance of the
Apostles <hi>Disputation</hi> against them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. In this
state of things, what misery and confusion the World
lived in for many Ages, what an endless Labyrinth of
foolish slavish <hi>Superstitions</hi> and
<hi>Idolatries</hi> it had cast it self into,
I have in another<note n="*" place="margin">Vbi supra de Origine &amp; Progressu Idololatriae.</note> Discourse
particularly declared. With
respect hereunto the Scripture
is well called by the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> a <hi>Light shining
in a dark place, 2 Pet.</hi> 11. 9. It gives unto all men
at once a perfect, clear, steady, uniform Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God, his Being, Subsistence, Properties Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
Rule and Actings, which evidenceth it
self unto the Minds and Consciences of all whom
the <hi>God of this World</hi> hath not absolutely blinded
by the power of prejudices and lusts, confirming
them in an Enmity unto, and hatred of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
There is indeed no more required to free Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
from this horrible darkness, and enormous
conceptions about the Nature of God, and the
Worship of Idols, but a sedate unprejudiced Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the <hi>Revelation of these things</hi> in the <hi>Book of
the Scripture.</hi> We may say therefore to all the World
with our Prophet, <hi>When they say unto you, Seek unto
them who have familiar Spirits, and unto Wizards that
peep and mutter; Should not a people seek unto their
God? for the living, to the dead? To the Law, and to the
Testimony; if they speak not according to this Word,
it is because there is no light in them,</hi> Isa. 8. 19, 20.
And this also plainly manifests the Scripture to be of
a <hi>divine Original.</hi> For if this Declaration of God,
this Revelation of Himself and his Will, is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106952:23"/>
the greatest and most excellent Benefit that
our Nature is capable of in this World, more
<hi>needful</hi> for, and <hi>useful</hi> unto Mankind than the Sun
in the Firmament, as to the proper end of their
Lives and Beings; and if none of the wisest men
in the World neither severally nor joyntly could <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
unto themselves, or <hi>make known</hi> unto others
this Knowledge of God, so that we may say with
our Apostle, that <hi>in the Wisdom of God, the World
by Wisdom knew not God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 21. And whereas
those who attempted any such things, yet <hi>waxed
vain in their Imaginations</hi> and Conjectures, so that
no one person in the World dares own the Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Mind and Understanding by their Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Conceptions absolutely, although they had
all advantages of Wisdom, and the Exercise of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
above those, at the least the most of them, who
<hi>wrote</hi> and <hi>published</hi> the Books of the Scripture;
it cannot with any pretence of Reason be questioned
whether they were not given by <hi>Inspiration from
God</hi> as they pretend and plead. There is that done
in them which all the World could not do, and
without the doing whereof all the World must have
been eternally miserable, and who could do this but
God? If any one shall judge, that that <hi>Ignorance
of God,</hi> which was among the <hi>Heathens</hi> of old, or
is among the <hi>Indians</hi> at this day, is not so miserable
a matter as we make it; or that there is any way
to free them from it but by an <hi>Emanation of Light</hi>
from the Scripture, he dwells out of my present
way upon the Confines of <hi>Atheism;</hi> so that I shall
not divert unto any Converse with him: I shall
only add, That whatever Notions of Truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rning
God and his Essence there may be found in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106952:24"/>
those <hi>Philosophers</hi> who lived after the Preaching of
the Gospel in the World, or are at this day to be
found among the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> or other false Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers
in the World, above those of the more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Pagans,</hi> they all derive from the Fountain of
the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and were thence by various means
traduced.</p>
            <p>2. The second End of this Doctrine is to <hi>direct
Mankind in their proper Course of living unto God,</hi>
and attaining that Rest and Blessedness whereof they
are capable, and which they cannot but desire.
These things are necessary to our Nature, so that
without them it were better <hi>not to be;</hi> for it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to have no Being in the World, than whiles we
have it always to wander, and never to act towards
its proper end, seeing all that is really <hi>good</hi> unto us
consists in our Tendency thereunto, and our At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of it. Now as these things were never
stated in the minds of the Community of Mankind,
but that they lived in perpetual confusion; so the
Enquiries of the <hi>Philosophers</hi> about the <hi>chief end</hi> of
<hi>Man,</hi> the Nature of Felicity or Blessedness, the ways <hi>of</hi>
attaining it, are nothing but so many <hi>uncertain and
fierce Digladiations,</hi> wherein not any one Truth is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted,
nor any one Duty prescribed, that is not spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and vitiated by its Circumstances and Ends; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
they never rose up so much as to a <hi>Surmise</hi> of or
about the most <hi>important matters of Religion,</hi> without
which it is demonstrable by reason, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
we should ever attain the End for which we
are made, nor the Blessedness whereof we are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
No account could they ever give of our <hi>Apostacy</hi>
from God, of the <hi>Depravation</hi> of our Nature, of the
Cause, or necessary Cure of it. In this lost and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106952:24"/>
wandring Condition of Mankind the Scripture pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth
it self as a <hi>Light, Rule</hi> and <hi>Guide</hi> unto all,
to direct them in their whole Course unto their end,
and to bring them unto the enjoyment of God; and
this it doth with that clearness and evidence as to
dispel all the Darkness, and put an end unto all the
Confusions of the minds of Men, as the Sun with
rising doth the shades of the Night, unless they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
shut their eyes against it, <hi>loving Darkness ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than Light, because their deeds are evil.</hi> For all
the Confusion of the minds of men to extricate
themselves from, whence they found out and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed
themselves in <hi>endless Questions</hi> to no purpose,
arose from their Ignorance of what we were origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
of what we now are, and how we came so
to be, by what way or means we may be delivered
or relieved, what are the Duties of Life, or what
is required of us in order to our living to God as
our chiefest end, and wherein the Blessedness of our
Nature doth consist: All the World was never able
to give an Answer tolerably satisfactory unto any
one of these Enquiries, &amp; yet unless they are all <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly</hi>
determined, we are not capable of the least Rest
or Happiness above the Beasts that perish. But now
all these things are so clearly declared and stated in
the Scripture, that it comes with an Evidence like
a <hi>Light from Heaven</hi> on the Minds and Consciences
of unprejudiced Persons. What was the Condition
of our Nature in its <hi>first Creation</hi> and Constitution,
with the Blessedness and Advantage of that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
how we fell from it; and what was the
Cause, what is the Nature, and what the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
and Effects of our present Depravation and
<hi>Apostacy from God;</hi> how <hi>Help</hi> and <hi>Relief</hi> is provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106952:25"/>
for us herein by infinite Wisdom, Grace and
Bounty; what that Help is; how we may be inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested
in it, and made partakers of it; what is
that <hi>System</hi> of Duties, or Course of Obedience unto
God which is required of us; and wherein our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Felicity doth consist: are all of them so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and clearly revealed in the Scripture, as in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to leave Mankind no ground for Doubt, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
or Conjecture; set aside <hi>inveterate Prejudices</hi>
from Tradition, Education, false Notions into the
Mould whereof the mind is cast, the Love of Sin,
and the Conduct of Lust, which things have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable
power over the Minds, Souls, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of Men; and the Light of the Scripture in
these things is like that of the <hi>Sun at Noon-day,</hi>
which shuts up the way unto all further Enquiry,
and efficaciously necessitates unto an Acquiescency in
it. And in particular in that Direction which it
gives unto the Lives of Men, in order unto that <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi>
which they ow to God, and that <hi>Reward</hi>
which they expect from him, there is no instance
conceivable of any thing conducing thereunto,
which is not prescribed therein, nor of any thing
which is contrary unto it that falls not under its
Prohibition. Those therefore whose Desire or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
it is, that the <hi>Bounds</hi> and <hi>Differences</hi> of Good
and Evil should be unfixed and confounded, who
are afraid to know what they were, what they are,
or what they shall come unto; who care to know
neither God nor themselves, their Duty nor their
Reward, may despise this Book, and deny its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Original: others will retain a sacred Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, as of the Off-spring of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:106952:25"/>
4. The <hi>Testimony of the Church</hi> may in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
be pleaded unto the same purpose: and I shall
also insist upon it, partly to manifest wherein its
true Nature and Efficacy doth consist, and partly
to evince the vanity of the old Pretence, that
even <hi>we also</hi> who are departed from the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> do receive the Scripture upon the Authority
thereof; whence it is further pretended, that on
the same Ground and Reason we ought to receive
whatever else it proposeth unto us.</p>
            <p>1. The Church is said to be the <hi>Ground and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
of Truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 15. Which is the only Text
pleaded with any Sobriety, to give countenance
unto the Assertion of the Authority of the Scripture
with respect unto us, to depend on the Authority
of the Church. But the <hi>Weakness of a Plea</hi> to that
purpose from hence hath been so fully manifested
by many already, that it needs no more to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on. In short, it cannot be so the <hi>Ground and
Pillar of Truth,</hi> that the Truth should be as it were
built and rest upon it as its Foundation; for this is
directly contrary to the same Apostle, who teacheth
us, that the Church it self is built upon the <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Prophets and Apostles, Jesus Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
being the chief corner Stone,</hi> Eph. 2. 20. The
Church cannot be the Ground of Truth, and Truth
the Ground of the Church in the same sense or kind.
Wherefore the Church is the <hi>Ground and Pillar of
Truth,</hi> in that it holds up and declares the
Scriptures, and the things contained therein, so to
be.</p>
            <p>2. In receiving any thing from a Church, we
may consider the <hi>Authority</hi> of it, or its <hi>Ministry.</hi>
By the Authority of the Church in this matter we
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106952:26"/>
intend no more but the weight and importance that
is in its Testimony, as Testimonies do vary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Worth, Gravity, Honesty, Honour,
and Reputation of them by whom they are given.
For to suppose an <hi>Authority,</hi> properly so called, in
any <hi>Church,</hi> or all the <hi>Churches</hi> of the World,
whereon our Reception of the Scripture should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,
as that which gives its <hi>Authority towards us,</hi>
and a sufficient Warranty to our Faith, is a nice Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination:
For the <hi>Authority</hi> and Truth of God
stand not in need, nor are capable of any such At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
from Men; all they will admit of from
the children of Men is, that they do humbly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
unto them, and testify their so doing with the
Reasons of it. The <hi>Ministry</hi> of the Church in this
matter is that Duty of the Church, whereby it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
and declareth the Scripture to be the Word
of God, and that as it hath occasion to all the
World. And this <hi>Ministry</hi> also may be considered
either <hi>formally,</hi> as 'tis appointed of God unto
this End, and blessed by him; or <hi>materially,</hi> only
as the thing is done, though the Grounds whereon
it is done, and the manner of doing it be not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely
approved.</p>
            <p>We wholly deny that we receive the Scripture,
or ever did, on the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
in any sense whatever, for the Reasons that shall be
mentioned immediately. But it may be granted,
that together with the <hi>Ministry of other Churches</hi>
in the World, and many other Providential Means
of their Preservation, and successive Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we did <hi>de Facto</hi> receive the Scriptures by the
Ministry of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> also, seeing they
also were in the possession of them: But this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106952:26"/>
we allow only in the latter sense, as an actual
means in subserviency unto God's Providence,
without respect unto any especial Institution.</p>
            <p>And for the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Church in this case, in
that sense wherein it is allowed, namely, as denoting
the Weight and Importance of a Testimony, which
being strengthened by all sorts of Circumstances,
may be said to have great <hi>Authority</hi> in it, we must
be careful unto whom or what Church we grant or
allow it. For let men assume what <hi>Names</hi> or <hi>Titles</hi>
to themselves they please, yet if the Generality of
them be corrupt or flagitious in their lives, and
have great <hi>secular Advantages,</hi> which they highly
prize and studiously improve, from what they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and profess the Scripture to supply them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
be they called <hi>Church,</hi> or what you please,
their Testimony therein is of very little value; for
all men may see that they have an earthly worldly
Interest of their own therein. And it will be said,
that if such Persons did know the whole <hi>Bible</hi> to be
a Fable (as one <hi>Pope</hi> expressed himself to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
they would not forego the Profession of it,
unless they could more advantage themselves in the
World another way. Wherefore, whereas it is
manifest unto all, that those who have the Conduct
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church have made and do make to
themselves great <hi>earthly temporal Advantages,</hi> in
Honour, Power, Wealth, and Reputation in the
World, by their Profession of the Scripture,
their Testimony may rationally be supposed to be so
far influenced by <hi>self interest,</hi> as to be of little Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</p>
            <p>The Testimony therefore which I intend, is that
of multitudes of persons of <hi>unspotted Reput<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ion</hi> on
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106952:27"/>
all other accounts in the World, free from all
possibility of impeachment as unto any designed evil
or <hi>conspiracy</hi> among themselves, with respect unto
any corrupt end, and who having not the least se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Advantage by what they testified unto, were
absolutely secured against all Exceptions, which
either <hi>common Reason</hi> or <hi>common Vsage</hi> among Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
can put in unto any Witness whatever. And
to evidence the force that is in this Consideration,
I shall briefly represent, (1.) <hi>Who</hi> they were that
gave and do give this <hi>Testimony</hi> in some especial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.
(2.) <hi>What</hi> they gave this <hi>Testimony</hi> unto.
(3.) <hi>How</hi> or by what means they did so.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in the first place, The Testimony of those
by whom the several Books of the Scripture were
written, is to be considered: They all of them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally
and joyntly witnessed, that</hi> what <hi>they wrote
was received by</hi> Inspiration from God. <hi>This is
pleaded by the Apostle</hi> Peter <hi>in the Name of them
all,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. For we have
not followed cunningly devised Fables, when we made
known unto you the Power and Coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ, but were eye witnesses of his Majesty.
For he received from God the Father, honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
when there came such a voice to him from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am
well pleased. And this voice which came from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
we heard, when we were with him in the holy
Mount. We have also a more sure word of Prophecy,
whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light
that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and
the day star arise in your hearts. Knowing this first,
that no Prophecy of the Scripture is of any private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.
For the Prophecy came not in old time
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106952:27"/>
by the Will of Man: but holy men of God spake as they
were moved by the Holy Ghost. <hi>This is the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Testimony of the Writers both of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
and the New; Namely, that as they have
certain knowledg of the things they wrote, so
their writing was by Inspiration from God. So
in particular</hi> John <hi>beareth witness unto his</hi> Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Chap. 19. 9. Chap. 22. 6. These are the true
and faithful sayings of God. <hi>And what weight is to
be laid hereon, is declared;</hi> Joh. 21. 24. This is
that Disciple which testifyeth of these things, and wrote
these things, and we know that his testimony is true.
<hi>He testifyed the Truth of what he wrote; but how
was it known to the Church there intended,</hi> (we
know that his Testimony is true) that so it was indeed?
<hi>He was not absolutely <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or one that was
to be believed in meerly on his own account; yet
here it is spoken in the name of the Church with the
highest Assurance; and</hi> we know that his Testimony
is true. <hi>I answer: this assurance of theirs did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
meerly from his moral or natural endowments
or holy Counsels, but from the Evidence they had of
his divine Inspiration, Whereof we shall treat af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The things pleaded to give force unto this Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
in particular, are all that such a Testimony
is capable of, and so many as would require a large
discourse by it self to propose, discuss, and confirm
them. But supposing the Testimony they gave, I
shall in compliance whith my own design reduce the
Evidences of its Truth unto these two considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
(1.) of their <hi>Persons,</hi> and (2.) of the
<hi>Manner</hi> of their Writing.</p>
            <p>1. As to their <hi>Persons</hi> they were absolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106952:28"/>
from all possible suspition of deceiving or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deceived. The Wit of all the <hi>Atheistical</hi> Spirits
in the World is not able to fix on any one thing,
that would be a tolerable ground of any such <hi>suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
concerning the integrity of witnesses, could
such a Testimony be given in any other case. And
<hi>surmises</hi> in things of this nature which had no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
ground for them, are to be looked on as <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
suggestions,</hi> or Atheistical Dreams, or at best
the false Imaginations of weak and distempered
Minds. The nature and design of their work, their
unconcernment with all secular interests, their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquaintance
with one another, the Times and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
wherein the things reported by them were done
and acted, the facility of convincing them of fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
if what they wrote in matter of fact, which
is the Fountain of what else they taught, in case it
were not true, the evident certainty that this would
have been done arising from the known Desire, Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
Will and Interest of their Adversaries so to do,
had it been possible to be effected, seeing this would
have secured them the Victory in the conflicts
wherein they were violently ingaged, and have put
an immediate issue unto all that difference and uproar
that was in the World about their Doctrine; their
<hi>Harmony</hi> among themselves without conspiracy or
antecedent Agreement, the <hi>miseries</hi> which they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent,
most of them without hope of releif or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
in this World, upon the Sole Account of
the Doctrine taught by themselves, with all other
circumstances innumerable that are pleadable to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the sincerity and integrity of any witnesses
whatever, do all concur to prove that they did not
follow <hi>cunningly devised Fables</hi> in what they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106952:28"/>
concerning the Mind and Will of God as imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
from himself. To confront this evidence
with bare Surmizes, incapable of any rational Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
or Confirmation, is only to manifest what
bruitish impudence Infidelity and Atheism are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to retreat unto for shelter.</p>
            <p>2. Their <hi>Stile</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of Writing deserves a
peculiar consideration. For there are impressed on
it all those <hi>Characters</hi> of a divine Original, that can
be communicated unto such an outward <hi>Adjunct</hi> of
<hi>divine Revelation.</hi> Notwithstanding the distance of
the Ages and Seasons wherein they lived, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the <hi>Languages</hi> wherein they wrote, with the
great variety of their Parts, Abilities, Education and
other circumstances, yet there is upon the whole and
all the parts of their writing, that <hi>Gravity, Majesty,</hi>
and <hi>Authority,</hi> mixed with plainness of speech and
absolute freedom from all appearance of affectation
of esteem or applause, or any things else that derive
from humane frailty, as must excite
an Admiration in all that seriously
consider them. But I have at large
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Exercitat.</hi> on the <hi>Epist.</hi> to the <hi>Heb. Exer.</hi> 1.</note> elsewhere insisted on this conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
And have also in the same place shewed that
there is no other writing extant in the world that
ever pretended unto a divine Original, as the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criphal</hi>
Books under the Old Testament, and some
fragments of spurious pieces pretended to be written
in the days of the Apostles, but they are, not only
from their matter, but from the manner of their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and the plain footsteps of humane Artifice and
Weakness therein sufficient for their own convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and do openly discover their own vain preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
So must every thing necessarily do, which
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106952:29"/>
being meerly <hi>humane,</hi> pretends unto an <hi>immediate
derivation</hi> from God. When men have done all
they can, these things will have as evident a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between them, as there is between <hi>Wheat</hi>
and <hi>Chaff,</hi> between real and painted Fire, <hi>Jer.</hi>
23. 28, 29.</p>
            <p>2. Unto the Testimony of the Divine Writers
themselves, we must add that of those who in all Ages
have <hi>believed in Christ through their Word,</hi> which is
the description which the Lord Jesus Christ giveth
of his Church. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 20. This is the Church,
that is, those who wrote the Scripture; and those
who believe in Christ through their word through
all Ages, which beareth witness to the divine Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
of the Scripture, and it may be added, that
we know this witness is true. With these I had
rather venture my Faith and eternal condition, then
with any Society, any real or pretended Church
whatever. And among these there is an especial
consideration to be had of those <hi>innumerable multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes</hi>
who in the primitive times witnessed this
confession all the World over. For they had many
advantages above us, to know the certainty of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
matters of fact which the verity of our Religion
depends upon. And we are directed unto an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
regard of their Testimony, which is signalized
by Christ himself. In the great Judgment that is
to be passed on the World, the first Appearance is of
the Souls of them that were beheaded for <hi>the witness
of Jesus Christ, and for the Word of God. Rev.</hi> 20. 4.
And there is at present an especial regard unto them
in Heaven upon the account of their Witness and
Testimony. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 9, 10, 11. These were they
who with the loss of their lives by the Sword, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106952:29"/>
other ways of violence gave testimony unto the
Truth of the Word of God. And to reduce these
things unto a rational consideration, who can have
the least occasion to suspect all those persons of folly,
weakness, credulity, wickedness, or conspiracy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves, which such a <hi>diffused multitude</hi>
was absolutely uncapable of? Neither can any man
undervalue their Testimony, but he must comply
with their <hi>Adversaries</hi> against them, who were
known generally to be of the worst of Men. And
who is there that believes there is a God, and an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
future State, that had not rather have his
Soul with <hi>Paul</hi> than <hi>Nero,</hi> with the Holy <hi>Martyrs</hi>
than their bestial Persecutors? Wherefore this Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage
and Testimony, begun from the first writing
of the Scripture, and carried on by the <hi>best of Men</hi> in
all Ages, and made conspicuously glorious in the
primitive times of Christianity, must needs be with
all wise men unavoidably cogent, at least unto a
due and sedate consideration of what they bare
witness unto, and sufficient to scatter all such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
as <hi>Atheism</hi> or prophaneness may raise or
suggest.</p>
            <p>Secondly; What it was they gave Testimony unto
is duly to be considered. And this was not that the
<hi>Book of the Scripture</hi> was Good, Holy, and True in
all the contents of it only, but that the whole and
every part of it was given by <hi>divine Inspiration,</hi> as
their Faith in this matter is expressed, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20,
21. On this account and no other did they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
receive the <hi>Scripture,</hi> as also believe and yeild
Obedience unto the things contained in it. Neither
would they admit that their Testimony was receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if the whole World would be content to allow of,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106952:30"/>
or obey the Scripture on any other, or lower terms.
Nor will God himself allow of an Assent unto the
Scripture under any other conception, but as the
Word which is immediately spoken by himself.
Hence they who refuse to give credit thereunto, are
said to <hi>bely the Lord, and say it is not he, Jer.</hi> 5. 2.
Yea to make <hi>God a liar;</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 10. If all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
should agree together to receive and make use
of this <hi>Book,</hi> as that which taught nothing but what
is <hi>Good,</hi> useful, and profitable to humane Society;
as that which is a compleat <hi>Directory</hi> unto men in
all that they need to believe or do towards God, the
<hi>best means</hi> under Heaven to bring them to setlement,
satisfaction, and assurance in the Knowledg of God
and themselves, <hi>as the safest Guide</hi> to eternal blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and therefore must needs be written and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by persons, <hi>Wise, Holy,</hi> and <hi>Honest</hi> above all
comparison, and such as had that Knowledg of God
and his Will as is necessary unto such an underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
yet all this answers not the Testimony given
by the <hi>Church of Believers</hi> in all ages unto the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
It was not lawful for them, it is not for us,
so to compound this matter with the World. That
the whole Scripture was given by <hi>Inspiration from
God,</hi> that it was his Word, his <hi>true and faithful
sayings,</hi> was that which in the first place they gave
Testimony unto, and we also are obliged so to do.
They never pretended unto any other <hi>Assurance</hi> of
the things they professed, nor any other <hi>Reason</hi> of
their Faith and Obedience, but that the Scripture
wherein all these things are contained <hi>was given im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from God,</hi> or was his Word. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were always esteemed no less <hi>Traytors</hi> to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:106952:30"/>
Christianity who gave up their <hi>Bibles</hi> to Persecutors
than those who denyed Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>manner wherein</hi> this Testimony was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
adds to the importance of it. For (1.) Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them, especially in some seasons, gave it in, and
with sundry <hi>miraculous operations.</hi> This our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
pleadeth as a <hi>corroboration</hi> of the witness given by
the first preachers of the Gospel unto the Truths of
it; <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 4. as the same was done by all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
together; <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 32. It must be granted
that these <hi>Miracles</hi> were not wrought immediately to
confirm this single Truth, that the Scripture was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by inspiration of God. But the end of miracles
is to be an immediate witness from Heaven, or Gods
attestation to their <hi>Persons</hi> and <hi>Ministry</hi> by whom
they were wrought. His Presence with them, and
Approbation of their Doctrine, were publickly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by them. But the miracles wrought by the
Lord Christ and his Apostles, whereby God gave im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Testimony unto the <hi>divine Mission</hi> of their
Persons, and infallible truth of their Doctrine, might
either not have been written as most of them were
not, or they might have been written and their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
recorded in <hi>Books</hi> not given by inspiration
from God. Besides, as to the <hi>miracles</hi> wrought by
Christ himself, and most of those of the Apostles, they
were wrought among them by whom the Books of
the <hi>Old Testament</hi> were acknowledged as the oracles
of God, and before the writing of those of the New;
So that they could not be wrought in the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
confirmation of the one or the other. Neither
have we <hi>any infallible Testimony</hi> concerning these
<hi>Miracles,</hi> but the Scripture it self, wherein they
are recorded: whence it is necessary that we should
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106952:31"/>
believe the Scripture to be infallibly true before we
can believe on <hi>grounds infallible</hi> the miracles therein
recorded to be so. Wherefore I grant that the
whole force of this consideration lyeth in this alone,
that those who gave Testimony to the Scripture to
be the Word of God, had an <hi>Attestation</hi> given
unto their <hi>Ministry</hi> by these miraculous opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
concerning which we have good collateral
security also.</p>
            <p>2. Many of them confirmed their Testimony
with their <hi>Sufferings,</hi> being not only witnesses but
<hi>Martyrs</hi> in the peculiar <hi>Church notion</hi> of that word,
grounded on the Scripture, <hi>Act. 22. 20. Rev.</hi> 2.
13. <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. 7. So far were they from any <hi>World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
advantage</hi> by the Profession they made, and the
Testimony they gave, as that in the confirmation of
them they willingly and cheerfully underwent what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is evil, dreadful, or destructive to humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in all its temporary concerns. It is therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable
that they had the <hi>highest Assurance</hi>
of the Truth in these things which the Mind of
Man is capable of. The management of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is the principal design of the Apostle in the
whole <hi>11th</hi> Chapter of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
For having declared the nature of faith in general,
namely, that it is the <hi>subsistence of things hoped for,
and the evidence of things not seen,</hi> ver. 1. That is
such an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssent unto and confidence of invisible
things, things capable of no demonstration from
Sense or Reason, as respects divine Revelation only,
whereinto alone it is resolved: for our encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereunto and establishment therein, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
a long Catalogue of those who did, suffered,
and obtained great things thereby. That which he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106952:31"/>
principally insists upon is the Hardships, Miseries,
Cruelties, Tortures, and several sorts of Deaths
which they underwent; especially from <hi>ver.</hi> 35. to
the end. These he calleth a <hi>Cloud of Witnesses</hi>
wherewith we are compassed about, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 1.
giving Testimony unto what we do believe, that is,
divine Revelation; and in an especial manner the
promises therein contained, unto our encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the same duty, as he there declares. And
certainly what was thus testified unto by so many
Great, Wise, and Holy Persons, and that in such a
way and manner, hath as great an outward evidence
of its Truth, as any thing of that nature is capable
of in this World.</p>
            <p>3. They gave not their Testimony <hi>casually,</hi> or
on some <hi>extraordinary Occasion</hi> only, or by some <hi>one
solemn act,</hi> or in some <hi>one certain way,</hi> as other Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
are given nor can be given otherwise; but
they gave their Testimony in this cause, in their
whole course, in all that they <hi>thought, spake,</hi> or <hi>did</hi>
in the World, and in the whole disposal of their
ways, lives and actions, as every true Believer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth
to do at this day. For a man when he is
occasionally called out to give a <hi>verbal Testimony</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the divine original of the Scripture, ordering in
the mean time the whole course of his conversation,
his hopes, designs, ayms and ends without any
eminent respect or regard unto it, his Testimony is
of no value, nor can have any influence on the minds
of sober and considerate men. But when men do
manifest and evince that the Declaration of the
mind of God in the Scripture hath a <hi>Sovereign di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority</hi> over their Souls and Consciences ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
and in all things, then is their Witness
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106952:32"/>
cogent and efficacious. There is to me a thousand
times more force and weight in the Testimony to
this purpose of some holy persons, who universally
and in all things with respect unto this World, and
their future eternal condition, in all their thoughts,
words, actions and ways do really experiment in
themselves and express to others, the power and
Authority of this Word of God in their Souls and
Consciences, living, doing, suffering, and dying
in peace, assurance of mind and consolation thereon,
then in the verbal declaration of the most
splendid <hi>numerous Church</hi> in the World, who evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
not such an inward sense of its power and
Efficacy. There is therefore that force in the <hi>real
Testimony</hi> which hath been given in all Ages, by all
this sort of persons, not one excepted, unto the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority of the Scripture, that it is highly
arrogant for any one to question the Truth of it,
without evident convictions of its <hi>imposture,</hi> which
no person of any tolerable Sobriety did ever yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
unto.</p>
            <p>I shall add in the last place the consideration of
that <hi>Success</hi> which the <hi>doctrine</hi> derived solely from
the Scripture, and resolved thereinto, hath had in the
World upon the Minds and Lives of Men, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
upon the <hi>first preaching</hi> of the Gospel. And
two things offer themselves hereon immediately un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our consideration; First the <hi>Persons</hi> by whom
this doctrine was successfully carried on in the
World, and Secondly the <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of the
propagation of it. Both which the Scripture takes
notice of in particular, as evidences of that <hi>divine
power</hi> which the Word was really accompanied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.
For the persons unto whom this work was
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106952:32"/>
committed, I mean the <hi>Apostles</hi> and first <hi>Evangelists,</hi>
were, as to their outward condition in the World,
Poor, Low, and every way despised; and as unto
the endowments of their minds, destitute of all those
Abilities and Advantages which might give them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Reputation or Probability of Success in such an
undertaking. This the <hi>Jews</hi> marked in them
with contempt; <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 13. And the <hi>Gentiles</hi> also
generally despised them on the same account. As
they afforded our Apostle no better title than that
of a <hi>Babler, Act.</hi> 17. 18. So for a long time they
kept up the Publick Vogue in the World, that <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi>
was the Religion of <hi>Ideots</hi> and Men Illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.
But God had another design in this order of
things, which our Apostle declares upon an admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the inconsiderable meanness of them unto
whom the dispensation of the Gospel was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
2 <hi>Cor. 4. 7. We have this treasure in Earthen
Vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God,
and not of us.</hi> The Reason why God would make
use of such Instruments only in so great a work was,
that through their <hi>meanness</hi> his own <hi>glorious power</hi>
might be more conspicuous. There is nothing
more common among men, nor more natural unto
them, than to admire the excellencies of those of
their own <hi>Race and Kind,</hi> and a willingness to have
all evidences of a divine Supernatural power cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and hidden from them. If therefore there had
been such persons employed as Instruments in this
work, whose Powers, Abilities, Qualifications,
and Endowments might have been probably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
as <hi>sufficient,</hi> and the <hi>immediate</hi> causes of such
an effect, there would have been no observation
of the <hi>divine power</hi> or glory of God. But he who is
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106952:33"/>
not able to discern them in the bringing about of so
mighty a work by means so disproportionate
thereunto, is under the power of the unrelievable
prejudices intimated by our Apostle in this case,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4, 5, 7.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Means</hi> which were to be used un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this end, namely, the <hi>subduing of the World</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Faith and Obedience of the Gospel, so erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Spiritual Kingdom of Christ in the minds of
men, who before were under the Power and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of his Adversary, must either be <hi>Force</hi> and
<hi>Armes;</hi> or <hi>Eloquence,</hi> in plausible perswasive reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
And mighty works have been wrought by
the one and the other of them. By the former have
Empires been set up and established in the World;
and the superstition of <hi>Mahomet</hi> imposed on many
Nations. And the latter also hath had great effects
on the minds of many. Wherefore it might have
been expected that those who had engaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in so great a design and work as that mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
should betake themselves unto the one or other
of these means and ways; For the Wit of Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
contrive any way unto such an end, but what
may be <hi>reduced</hi> unto one of these two; seeing neither
upon the principles of nature, nor on the Rules of
humane Wisdom or Policy can any other be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
But even <hi>both these ways</hi> were abandoned by
them, and they declared against the use of either of
them. For as outward Force, Power, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
they had none, the use of all <hi>carnal weapons</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
utterly inconsistent with this Work and Design,
so the other way of <hi>perswasive Orations,</hi> of enticing
words, of Alluring Arts and Eloquence, with the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:106952:33"/>
like effects of humane Wisdom and Skill, were all
of them studiously declined by them in this work,
as things extremely prejudicial to the success there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4, 5. But this alone, they betook
themselves unto; they went up and down preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles, that Jesus Christ died for
our sins, and rose again according to the Scriptures,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 3, 4. And this they did by Vertue of
those Spiritual Gifts, which were the hidden Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the <hi>World to come,</hi> whose Nature, Virtue and
Power others were utterly unacquainted withal.
This Preaching of theirs, this Preaching of the
Cross, both for the Subject, Matter, and Manner
of it, without Art, Eloquence or Oratory, was
looked on as a marvellous foolish thing, a <hi>sweaty
kind of babling,</hi> by all those who had got any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of Learning or Cunning amongst men.
This our Apostle at large discourseth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. In
this State of things, every thing was under as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
improbabilities of Success unto all rational Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures
as can be conceived. Besides, together
with the Doctrine of the Gospel that they preached,
which was <hi>new</hi> and <hi>uncouth</hi> unto the <hi>World,</hi> they
taught Observances of Religious <hi>Worship</hi> in Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
Assemblies, or Conventicles to that end,
which all the Laws in the World did prohibit,
<hi>Acts 18. 13. c.</hi> 16. 21. Hereupon no sooner did the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
and Governours of the World begin to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of them, and what they did, but they judged
that it all tended to Sedition, and that Commotions
would ensue thereon. These things enraged the
Generality of Mankind against them and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,
who therefore made havock of them with
incredible fury. And yet notwithstanding all these
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106952:34"/>
Disadvantages, and against all these Oppositions,
their Doctrine prevailed to subdue the <hi>World</hi> to the
Obedience thereof. And there may be added unto
all these things one or two Considerations from the
State of Things at that time in the <hi>World,</hi> which
signalize the quality of this Work, and manifest it
to have been of God.</p>
            <p>As (1.) That in the New Testament the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of it do constantly distribute all those with
whom they had to do in this World, into <hi>Jews</hi> and
<hi>Greeks,</hi> which we render <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the World coming under that Denomination
because of their Preeminence on various Accounts.
Now the <hi>Jews</hi> at that time were <hi>in solidum,</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
of all the true Religion that was in the World;
and this they boasted of as their Priviledge, bearing
up themselves with the Thoughts and Reputation
of it every where and on all occasions; it being at
that time their great Business to gain <hi>Proselytes</hi> unto
it, whereon also their Honour and Advantage did
depend. The <hi>Greeks</hi> on the other side were in as
full a possession of Arts, Sciences, Literature, and
all that which the World calls <hi>Wisdom,</hi> as the
<hi>Jews</hi> were of <hi>Religion;</hi> and they had also a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
received by a long Tradition of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
from time immemorial, which they had vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
cultivated and dressed with Mysteries and
Ceremonies unto their own compleat satisfaction.
Besides the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were the ruling Part of
the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> did ascribe all their Prosperity, and
the whole Raising of their <hi>stupendous Empire</hi>
to their Gods, and the religious Worship they gave
unto them; so that it was a fundamental <hi>Maxim</hi>
in their Policy and Rule, that they should prosper
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106952:34"/>
or decay, according as they observed or were negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in the Religion they had received. As indeed
not only those who owned the true God and his
Providence, but before <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superstition</hi> had
given place unto <hi>Atheism,</hi> all people did solemnly
impute all their Atchievements and Successes unto
their Gods, as the Prophet speaks of the <hi>Caldeans,
Mal.</hi> 1. 11. And he who first undertook to record
the <hi>Exploits of the Nations of the World,</hi> doth
constantly assign all their Good and Evil unto their
Gods, as they were pleased or provoked. The
<hi>Romans</hi> in especial boasted that their Religion was
the cause of their Prosperity; <hi>Pietate &amp; Religione

a great and wise Historian, giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Religion of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of their Worship, affirms, that he doth it
unto this end, <hi>That those who have been ignorant of
the</hi> Roman <hi>Piety, should cease to wonder at their
Prosperity and Successes in all their Wars, seeing by
reason of their Religion they had the Gods always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious
and succourable unto them.</hi> Antiq. Rom. lib. 2.
The Consideration hereof made them so obstinate
in their Adherence unto their present Religion,
that when after many Ages and hundreds of Years,
some Books of <hi>Numa</hi> their second King, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Establisher of their Common-Wealth, were
occasionally found, instead of paying them any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
they ordered them <hi>to be burnt,</hi> because one
who had perused them, took his Oath that they
were contrary to their present Worship and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:106952:35"/>
And this was that, which upon the Declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of their <hi>Empire</hi> after the Prevalency of the
<hi>Christian Religion,</hi> those who were obstinate in
their <hi>Paganism</hi> reflected severely upon the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
the Relinquishment of their old Religion they
fiercely avowed to be the Cause of all their Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.
In answer unto which Calumny principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Austin</hi> wrote his excellent Discourse, <hi>De Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
Dei.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this state of things the Preachers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
come among them, and not only bring a
new Doctrine, under all the Disadvantages before
mentioned, and moreover that he who was the Head
of it was newly crucified by the present powers of
the Earth for a Malefactor; but also such a Doctrine
as was expresly to take away the Religion from
the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Wisdom from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and
the principal <hi>Maxim</hi> of Polity from the <hi>Romans,</hi>
whereon they thought they had raised their Empire.
It were easy to declare how all those Sects were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in worldly Interest, Honour, Reputation,
Principles of Safety, to oppose, decry, condemn,
and reject this new Doctrine. And if a Company
of sorry Craftsmen were able to fill a whole City
with Tumult and Uprore against the Gospel,
as they did when they apprehended it would bring
in a decay of their Trade, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. what can we
think was done in all the World, by all those who
were ingaged and enraged by higher Provocations?
It was as death to the <hi>Jews</hi> to part with their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
both on the account of the <hi>Conviction</hi> they had
of its Truth, and the Honour they esteem'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crew
to themselves thereby. And for the <hi>Greeks</hi>
to have all that <hi>Wisdom,</hi> which they and their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:106952:35"/>
had been labouring in for so many Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
now to be all rejected as an impertinent
Foolery by the sorry Preachments of a few illiterate
Persons; it raised them unto the highest Indignation.
And the <hi>Romans</hi> were wise enough to secure the
<hi>Fundamental Maxim</hi> of their State. Wherefore
the World seemed very sufficiently fortified against
the Admission of this <hi>new</hi> and <hi>strange Doctrine,</hi> on
the Terms whereon it was proposed. There can be
no Danger sure that ever it should obtain any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Progress: But we know that things fell
out quite otherwise; Religion, Wisdom and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
with Honour, Profit, Interest, Reputation, were
forced all to give way to its Power and Efficacy.</p>
            <p>2. The World was at that time in the highest
Enjoyment of <hi>Peace, Prosperity</hi> and <hi>Plenty,</hi> that
ever it attained from the entrance of sin; and it is
known how from all these things are usually made
<hi>Provision for the Flesh, to fulfil the Lusts thereof.</hi>
Whatever the Pride, Ambition, Covetousness,
Sensuality of any Persons could carry them forth to
lust after, the World was full of satisfactions for.
And most men lived as in the eager pursuit of their
Lusts, so in a full supply of what they did require.
In this Condition the Gospel is preached unto them,
requiring at once, and that indispensibly, a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation
of all those worldly Lusts,</hi> which before
had been the Salt of their Lives. If men designed
any Compliance with it, or Interest in it, all their
Pride, Ambition, Luxury, Covetousness, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality,
Malice, Revenge, must all be mortified
and rooted up. Had it only been a new Doctrine
and Religion, declaring that Knowledge and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God which they never heard of before, they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106952:36"/>
could not but be very wary in giving it enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment;
but when withal it required at the first
Instant, that for its sake they should <hi>pull out their
right eyes,</hi> and <hi>cut off their right hands,</hi> to part
with all that was dear and useful unto them, and
which had such a prevalent Interest in their Minds
and Affections, as corrupt Lusts are known to have;
this could not but invincibly fortify them against its
Admittance. But yet this also was forced to give
place, and all the Fortifications of <hi>Satan</hi> therein
was by the Power of the Word cast to the Ground,
as our Apostle expresseth it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5. Where
he gives an Account of that <hi>Warfare,</hi> whereby the
World was subdued to Christ by the Gospel. Now
a man, that hath a mind to make himself an Instance
of conceited Folly and Pride, may talk as though
there was in all this no Evidence of <hi>divine Power</hi>
giving Testimony to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>Doctrine</hi>
contained in it, but the Characters of it are so
legible unto every modest and sedate Prospect, that
they leave no room for Doubt or Haesitation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the force of the whole Argument is liable unto
one Exception of no small Moment, which must
therefore necessarily be taken notice of and removed.
For whereas we plead the Power, Efficacy and</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency
of the Gospel in former days, <hi>as a Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of its divine Original, it will be enquired,</hi> Whence
it is, that it is not still accompanied with the same
Power, nor doth produce the same Effects. For we
see the Profession of it is now confined to narrow Limits,
in comparison of what it formerly extended it self unto;
neither do we find that it gets Ground any where in the
World, but is rather more and more straitned every
day. Wherefore either the first Prevalency that is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106952:36"/>
unto it, and argued as an Evidence of its Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
did indeed proceed from some other accidental
Causes in an efficacious though unseen Concurrence,
and was not by an Emanation of Power from it self;
or the Gospel is not at present what it was formerly, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it hath not the same Effect upon, or Power over the
Minds of Men, as that had of old. We may therefore
suspend the pleading of this Argument from what
was done by the Gospel formerly, lest it reflect disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
upon what we profess at present.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Whatever <hi>different Events</hi> may fall
out in <hi>different Seasons,</hi> yet the Gospel is the same
as ever it was from the Beginning. There is not <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Book,</hi> containing <hi>another Doctrine,</hi> crept into
the World instead of that once delivered unto the
Saints. And whatever various Apprehensions
men may have through their Weakness or Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
concerning the things taught therein, yet are
they in themselves <hi>absolutely the same</hi> that ever they
were, and that without the loss or change of a
<hi>material Word or Syllable</hi> in the manner of their
Delivery. This I have proved elsewhere, and it is
a thing capable of the most evident Demonstration.
Wherefore whatever Entertainment this Gospel
meets withal at present in the World, its former
<hi>Prevalency</hi> may be pleaded in Justification of its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Original.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Cause of this Event lyeth principally in the
Soveraign Will and Pleasure of God.</hi> For although
the Scripture be his Word, and he hath testified it
so to be by his Power, put forth and exerted in
Dispensations of it unto men, yet is not that divine
Power included or shut up in the <hi>Letter</hi> of it, so
that it must have the <hi>same Effect</hi> where ever it comes.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106952:37"/>
We plead not that there is absolutely in its self, its
Doctrine, the Preaching or Preachers thereof, such
a Power, as it were <hi>naturally</hi> and <hi>physically</hi> to
produce the Effects mentioned. But it is an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Hand of God unto that work which is
his own, and he puts forth his Power <hi>in it, and
by it,</hi> as it seems good unto him. And if he doth
at any time so put forth his <hi>divine Power</hi> in the
Administration of it, or in the use of this <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
as that the great Worth and Excellency of
it shall manifest it self to be from him, he giveth a
sufficient Attestation of it. Wherefore the Times
and Seasons of the <hi>Prevalency of the Gospel</hi> in the
World are in the Hand and at the <hi>Sovereign</hi> Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
of God. And as he is not obliged (<hi>for who
hath known the Mind of the Lord, or who hath been
his Counsellor?</hi>) to accompany it with the <hi>same
Power</hi> at <hi>all times</hi> and <hi>seasons;</hi> so the Evidence of
his own Power going along with it at <hi>any time</hi>
whiles under an open Claim of a divine Original,
is an uncontroulable Approbation of it. Thus at
the first Preaching of the Word, to fullfil the
<hi>Promises made unto the Fathers</hi> from the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>World,</hi> to glorify his Son Jesus Christ,
and the Gospel it self which he had revealed, he put
forth that effectual divine Power in its Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whereby the <hi>World was subdued</hi> unto the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
of it. And the Time will come when he
will revive the same <hi>Work</hi> of Power and Grace to
retrieve the <hi>World</hi> into a subjection to Jesus Christ.
And although he doth not in these latter Ages
cause it to <hi>run and prosper</hi> among the Nations of the
world, who have not as yet received it as he did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
yet considering the state of things at present
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106952:37"/>
among the Generality of Mankind, the Preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it in that small Remnant by whom it is obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in sincerity, is a no less glorious Evidence of his
Presence with it, and Care over it, than was its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
Propagation in days of old.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Righteousness of God</hi> is in like manner to
be considered in these things. For whereas he had
granted the inestimable Priviledge of his Word un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
many Nations, they through their horrible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
and wickedness <hi>detained the Truth in Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness;</hi>
so that the continuance of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
among them was no way to the Glory of God,
no nor yet unto their own Advantage. For neither
Nations nor Persons will ever be advantaged by an
<hi>outward Profession</hi> of the Gospel, whilst they live in
a Contradiction and Disobedience to its Precepts;
yea nothing can be more pernicious to the Souls of
Men. This Impiety God is at this day revenging
on the Nations of the World, having utterly cast
off many of them from the Knowledg of the Truth,
and given up others unto <hi>strong Delusions, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
Lies,</hi> though they retain the Scriptures
and outward Profession of Christianity. How far
he may proceed in the same way of Righteous Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
towards other Nations also, we know not,
but ought to tremble in the Consideration of it.
When God first granted the Gospel unto the
World, although the Generality of Mankind had
greatly sinned <hi>against the Light of Nature,</hi> and had
rejected all those <hi>supernatural Revelations</hi> that at
any time had been made unto them; yet had they
not sinned against the Gospel it self, nor the Grace
thereof. It pleased God therefore to <hi>wink at,</hi> and
pass over that <hi>Time of their Ignorance,</hi> so as that his
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106952:38"/>
Justice should not be provoked by any of their
former sins, to with-hold the Efficacy of his divine
Power in the Administration of the Gospel from
them, whereby he <hi>called them to Repentance.</hi> But
now after that the Gospel hath been sufficiently
tendred unto all Nations, and hath, either as unto
its Profession, or as unto its Power with the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
that it requires, been rejected by the
most of them; things are quite otherwise stated.
It is from the <hi>Righteous Judgment of God,</hi> reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the sins of the World against the Gospel it self,
that so many Nations are deprived of it, and so many
left obstinate in its Refusal. Wherefore the present
state of things doth no way weaken or prejudice
the <hi>Evidence given unto the Scripture</hi> by that mighty
Power of God, which accompanied the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of it in the World. For what hath since
fallen out, there are secret Reasons of <hi>Sovereign
Wisdom,</hi> and open Causes in <hi>Divine Justice,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
it is to be assigned.</p>
            <p>These things I have briefly called over, and not
as though they were all of this kind that may be
pleaded, but only to give some <hi>Instance</hi> of those
<hi>external Arguments,</hi> whereby the divine Authority
of the Scripture may be confirmed.</p>
            <p>Now these Arguments are such as are able of
themselves to beget in the Minds of Men, sober,
humble, intelligent, and unprejudiced, a firm
Opinion, Judgment and Perswasion, that the
Scripture doth proceed from God. Where Persons
are prepossessed with invincible Prejudices contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a Course of Education, wherein they have
imbibed Principles opposite and contrary thereunto,
and have increased and fortified them by some fixed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:106952:38"/>
and <hi>hereditary Enmity</hi> against all those whom
they know to own the Divinity of the Scripture,
as it is with <hi>Mahometans,</hi> aud some of the <hi>Indians;</hi>
these Arguments it may be will not prevail immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to work nor effect their Assent. It is so with
respect unto them also, who out of Love unto, and
Delight in those ways of <hi>Vice, Sin,</hi> and <hi>Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
which are absolutely and severely condemned
in the Scripture, without the least hope of a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
unto them that continue under the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of them, who will not take these Arguments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
due Consideration. Such Persons may talk and
discourse of them, but they never weigh them seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
according as the Importance of the Cause
doth require. For if men will examine them as they
ought, it must be with a sedate Judgment, that
their <hi>eternal Condition</hi> depends upon a right Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of this Enquiry. But for those who can
scarce get Liberty from the <hi>Service</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of
their Lusts, seriously to consider what is their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
or what it is like to be; it is no wonder if
they talk of these things after the manner of <hi>these
days,</hi> without any Impression on their Minds and
Affections, or Influence on the practical Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
But our Enquiry is after what is a
sufficient Evidence for the Conviction of <hi>rational</hi>
and <hi>unprejudiced</hi> Persons, and the Defeating of
Objections to the contrary, which these and the
like Arguments do every way answer.</p>
            <p>Some think fit here to stay, that is, in these or
the like external Arguments, or rational <hi>Motives of
Faith,</hi> such as render the Scriptures so credible, as
that it is an unreasonable thing not to assent unto
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:106952:39"/>
them. That <hi>Certainty</hi> which may be attained on
these Arguments and Motives, is (as they say) the
highest which our Minds are capable of with respect
unto this Object, and therefore includes all the
<hi>Assent</hi> which is required of us unto this Proposition,
that the Scriptures are the Word of God; or all the
Faith whereby we believe them so to be. When I speak
of these Arguments, I intend not them <hi>alone</hi> which I
have insisted on, but all others also of the same kind,
some whereof have been <hi>urged</hi> and <hi>improved</hi> by others
with great Diligence; for in the <hi>Variety</hi> of such Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as offer themselves in this Cause, every one
chooseth out what seems to him most cogent, &amp; some
<hi>amass</hi> all that they can think on. Now these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with the Evidence tendred in them are such,
as nothing but <hi>perverse Prejudice</hi> can detain men
from giving a <hi>firm Assent</hi> unto. And no more is
required of us, but that according to the <hi>Motives</hi>
that are proposed unto us, and the <hi>Arguments</hi> used
to that purpose, we come unto a Judgment and
Perswasion, called a <hi>moral Assurance</hi> of the Truth
of the Scripture, and endeavour to yield Obedience
unto God accordingly.</p>
            <p>And it were to be wished that there were more
than it is feared there are, who were really so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with these Arguments and Motives. For
the Truth is, <hi>Tradition</hi> and <hi>Education</hi> practically
bear the whole sway in this matter. But yet when
all this is done, it will be said, that all this is but a
<hi>meer natural Work,</hi> whereunto no more is required,
but the <hi>natural exercise</hi> and acting of our <hi>own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
and understanding; that the Arguments and
Motives used, though strong, are <hi>humane</hi> and <hi>falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
and therefore the Conclusion we make from
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:106952:39"/>
them is so also, and wherein we may be deceived;
that an Assent grounded and resolved into such <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Arguments</hi> only, is not <hi>Faith</hi> in the sense of
the Scripture; in brief, that it is required that we
<hi>believe the Scriptures to be the Word of God with
Faith divine and supernatural,</hi> which cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
Two things are replyed hereunto.</p>
            <p>1. That <hi>where the Things believed are divine and
supernatural, so is the Faith whereby we believe them,
or give our Assent unto them.</hi> Let the Motives and
Arguments whereon we give our Assent be of what
kind they will, so that the <hi>Assent</hi> be true and real,
and the Things believed be <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>supernatural,</hi>
the Faith whereby we believe them is so also. But
this is all one, as if in things <hi>natural</hi> a man should
say, our <hi>Sight is green</hi> when we see that which is so,
and <hi>blew</hi> when we see that which is <hi>blew.</hi> And this
would be so in things moral, if the <hi>Specification of
Acts</hi> were from their <hi>material Objects;</hi> but it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that they are not of the same Nature always
with the Things they are conversant about, nor
are they changed thereby from what their Nature is
in themselves, be it natural or supernatural, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
or divine. Now things <hi>divine</hi> are only the
<hi>material Object</hi> of our Faith, as hath been shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and by an <hi>Enumeration</hi> of them do we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
unto the Question, <hi>What is it that you do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve?</hi>
But it is the formal <hi>Object</hi> or <hi>Reason</hi> of all
our Acts from whence they are denominated, or by
which they are specified. And the formal Reason
of our Faith, Assent or Believing, is that which
prevails with us to believe, and on whose Account
we do so, wherewith we answer unto that Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Why do you believe?</hi> If this be humane <hi>Authority,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:106952:40"/>
Arguments</hi> highly probable, but absolutely fallible,
Motives cogent, but only to beget a moral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,
whatever we do believe thereon, our Faith
is <hi>humane, fallible,</hi> and a <hi>moral Assurance</hi> only.
Wherefore it is said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>2. That this <hi>Assent</hi> is sufficient, all that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of us, and contains in it all the <hi>Assurance</hi>
which our minds are capable of in this matter.
For no further Evidence nor Assurance is in any
case to be enquired after than the <hi>subject matter</hi> will
bear. And so is it in this Case, where the Truth
is not exposed to <hi>Sense,</hi> nor capable of a <hi>scientifical
Demonstration,</hi> but must be received upon such <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
and Arguments, as carry it above the <hi>highest
Probability,</hi> though they leave it beneath <hi>Science</hi> or
Knowledge, or <hi>infallible Assurance;</hi> if such a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
of Mind there be.</p>
            <p>But yet I must needs say, that although those <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Arguments,</hi> whereby learned and rational
Men have proved or may yet further prove the
Scripture to be a <hi>divine Revelation</hi> given of God,
and the Doctrine contained in it to be a <hi>heavenly
Truth,</hi> are of singular Use for the strengthening
of the Faith of them that do believe, by relieving
the mind against Temptations and Objections that
will arise to the contrary, as also for the <hi>Conviction of
Gainsayers;</hi> yet to say that they contain the formal
Reason of that <hi>Assent,</hi> which is required of us unto
the Scripture as the Word of God, that our Faith is
the Effect and Product of them, which it rests upon
and is resolved into, is both contrary to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
destructive of the Nature of <hi>divine Faith,</hi> and
exclusive of the Work of the Holy Ghost in this
whole matter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:106952:40"/>
VVherefore I shall do these two things before I
proceed to our principal Argument designed. (1.) I
shall give some few Reasons, proving that the Faith
whereby we believe the Scripture to be the <hi>Word</hi> of
God is not a meer firm moral Perswasion, built
upon external Arguments and Motives of Credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
but is divine and supernatural, because the
<hi>formal Reason</hi> of it is so also. (2.) I shall shew
what is the <hi>Nature of that Faith,</hi> whereby we do
or ought to believe the Scripture to be the <hi>Word</hi> of
God; what is the work of the holy Spirit about it,
and what is the proper Object of it. In the first I
shall be very brief, for my design is to strengthen
the Faith of all, and not to weaken the Opinions of
any.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> is the proper Object of <hi>divine
Faith.</hi> With such Faith we can believe nothing but
what is so, and what is so can be received no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
by us. If we believe it not with <hi>divine Faith,</hi>
we believe it not at all. Such is the Scripture as the
<hi>Word</hi> of God every where proposed unto us; and
we are required to <hi>believe,</hi> that is, first to believe it
so to be, and then to believe the things contained in
it. For this Proposition, that the Scripture is the
<hi>Word of God,</hi> is a <hi>divine Revelation,</hi> and so to be
believed. But God no where requires nor ever did,
that we should believe any divine <hi>Revelation</hi> upon
<hi>such Grounds,</hi> much less on such Grounds and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
<hi>only.</hi> They are left unto us as <hi>consequential</hi>
unto our Believing, to plead with others in behalf
of what we profess, and for the Justification of it
unto the <hi>World.</hi> But that which requires our
Faith and Obedience unto in the receiving of <hi>divine
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106952:41"/>
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi> whether immediately given and declared,
or as recorded in the Scripture, is his own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Veracity, <hi>I am the Lord, the High and
Lofty One. Thus saith the Lord. To the Law and
to the Testimony. This is my Son, hear him. All
Scripture is given by Inspiration from God. Believe
the Lord and his Prophets.</hi> This alone is that
which he requires us to resolve our Faith into. So
when he gave unto us the Law of our Lives,
the eternal and unchangeable Rule of our Obedience
unto him in the <hi>ten Commandments,</hi> he gives no
other Reason to oblige us thereunto, but this only,
<hi>I am the Lord thy God.</hi> The sole formal Reason of
all our Obedience is taken from his own Nature and
our Relation unto him. Nor doth he propose any
other Reason why we should believe him, or the
Revelation which he makes of his Mind and Will.
And our Faith is part of our Obedience, the Root,
and principal Part of it; therefore the Reason of
both is the same. Neither did our Lord Jesus Christ
nor his Apostles ever make use of such Arguments
or Motives for the ingenerating of Faith in the
minds of men; nor have they given Directions for
the use of any such Arguments to this End and
Purpose. But when they were accused to have
followed <hi>cunningly devised Fables,</hi> they appealed
unto <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> to the <hi>Revelations</hi> they
had themselves received, and those that were before
recorded. It is true they wrought Miracles in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of their own divine Mission, and of
the Doctrine which they taught. But the Miracles
of our Saviour were all of them wrought amongst
those who believed the whole Scripture then given
to be the Word of God; and those of the Apostles
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:106952:41"/>
were before the Writings of the Books of the New
Testament. Their Doctrine therefore <hi>materially</hi>
considered, and their <hi>Warranty</hi> to teach it, was
sufficiently yea abundantly confirmed by them. But
<hi>Divine Revelation</hi> formally considered, and as writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
was left upon the old Foundation of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of God who gave it. No such <hi>Method</hi> is
prescribed, no such Example is proposed unto us in
the Scripture, to make use of these Arguments and
Motives for the Conversion of the Souls of men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, and the ingenerating of Faith in them.
Yea in some Cases the use of such means is decryed
as unprofitable, and the <hi>Sole Authority</hi> of God,
putting forth his Power in and by his Word, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
unto, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 4, 5, 13. chap.</hi> 14. 26, 27.
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. But yet in a way of <hi>Preparation</hi> subservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
unto the receiving the Scripture as the Word
of God, and for the Defence of it against Gainsayers
and their Objections, their use hath been granted
and proved. But from first to last in the Old and
New Testament the Authority and Truth of God
are constantly and uniformly proposed as the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Ground and Reason of Believing his Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
nor can it be proved that he doth accept or
approve of any kind of Faith or <hi>Assent,</hi> but what is
built thereon and resolved thereinto. The Sum is,
<hi>We are obliged in a way of Duty,</hi> to believe the
Scriptures to be a Divine <hi>Revelation,</hi> when they
are ministerially or providentially proposed unto us,
whereof afterwards. The Ground whereon we are
to receive them is the <hi>Authority and Veracity of God</hi>
speaking in them; we believe them because they are
the Word of God. Now this Faith whereby we
so believe is <hi>Divine and Supernatural,</hi> because the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:106952:42"/>
mal Reason of it is so, namely Gods Truth and
Authority. Wherefore we do not, nor ought to
believe the Scripture as <hi>highly probable,</hi> or with a
moral Perswasion and Assurance built upon Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
absolutely fallible, and humane only. For
if this be the formal Reason of Faith, namely, the
Veracity and Authority of God, if we believe not
with Faith divine and supernatural, we believe not
at all.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>moral Certainty</hi> treated of, is a meer
Effect of Reason. There is no more required unto
it, but that the Reasons proposed for the <hi>Assent</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
be such as the mind judgeth to be convincing
and prevalent; whence an inferiour Kind of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
or a firm Opinion, or some kind of Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
which hath not yet gotten an <hi>intelligible Name,</hi>
doth necessarily ensue. There is therefore on this
Supposition no need of <hi>any Work of the Holy Ghost,</hi>
to enable us to believe, or to work Faith in us; for
no more is required herein but what necessarily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth
from a naked Exercise of Reason. If it be
said, that the Enquiry is not about what is the
<hi>Work of the Spirit of God in us;</hi> but concerning the
Reasons and Motives to Believing that are proposed
unto us. I answer, it is granted; but that we
urge herein is, that the <hi>Act</hi> which is exerted on
such Motives, or the Perswasion which is begotten
in our minds by them is purely <hi>natural,</hi> and such as
requires no especial Work of the Holy Ghost in us
for the effecting of it. Now this is not Faith, nor
can we be said in the Scripture sense to believe
thereby, and so in particular not the Scriptures to
be the Word of God. For Faith <hi>is the Gift of God,</hi>
and <hi>is not of our selves,</hi> Ephes 2. 8. It is given unto
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:106952:42"/>
some on the behalf of Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 29. and not
unto others, <hi>Mat. 11. 29. chap.</hi> 13. 11. But this
Assent on external Arguments and Motives is of our
selves, equally common and exposed unto all. <hi>No
man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy
Ghost, 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 3. But he who believeth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
truly, aright, and according to his Duty, doth
say so. No man cometh to Christ, but he that
hath <hi>heard and learned of the Father, John</hi> 6. 45.
And as this is contrary to the Scripture, so it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
condemned by the ancient Church; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
by the second <hi>Arausican Council,</hi> Can. 5. 7.

            </p>
            <p>It is still granted that the Arguments intended (that
is all of them which ar true indeed, and will endure
a strict Examination, for some are frequently made
use of in this Cause which will not endure a Trial)
are of good use in their place and unto their proper
end; that is to beget such an Assent unto the Truth as
they are capable of effecting. For although this
be not that which is required of us in a way of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but inferior to it, yet the mind is prepared and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:106952:43"/>
disposed by them unto the receiving of the Truth
in its proper Evidence.</p>
            <p>3. Our Assent can be of no other Nature than
the Arguments and Motives whereon it is built, or
by which it is wrought in us, as in <hi>Degree</hi> it cannot
exceed their <hi>Evidence.</hi> Now these Arguments are
all humane and fallible; exalt them unto the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
esteem possible, yet because they are not Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,
nor do necessarily beget a certain Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
in us (which indeed if they did, there were no
room left for Faith or our Obedience therein) they
produce an Opinion only, though in the highest kind
of Probability, and firm against Objections. For
we will allow the utmost Assurance that can be
claimed upon them. But this is exclusive of all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Faith as to any <hi>Article, Thing, Matter</hi> or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to be believed. For Instance; a man profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
that he believes Jesus Christ <hi>to be the Son of God.</hi>
Demand the Reason why he doth so, and he will
say; because <hi>God who cannot lie,</hi> hath revealed and
declared him so to be, proceed yet further and ask
him, where or how God hath revealed and declared
this so to be? and he will answer, in the Scripture,
which is his Word; enquire now further of him,
which is necessary, wherefore he believes this
Scripture to be the Word of God, or an immediate
Revelation given out from him; for hereunto we
must come and have somewhat that we may ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately
rest in, excluding in its own Nature all
further Enquiries, or we can have neither certainty,
nor stability in our Faith. On this Supposition his
answer must be, that he hath many cogent Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that render it highly propable so to be, such
as have prevailed with him to judg it so to be, and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:106952:43"/>
whereon he is <hi>fully perswaded,</hi> as having the highest
Assurance hereof that the matter will bear, and so
doth firmly believe them to be the Word of God.
Yea but it will be replied, all these Arguments are
in their kind or Nature <hi>humane,</hi> and therefore falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
such as it is possible they may be false; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing may be so that is not immediately from
the first essential Verity. This Assent therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Scriptures as the Word of God is <hi>humane,
fallible,</hi> and such as wherein we may be deceived.
And our Assent unto the <hi>things revealed,</hi> can be of
no other kind than that we give unto the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it self. For thereinto it is resolved, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
it must be reduced; these waters will rise no
higher than their Fountain. And thus at length
we come to believe <hi>Jesus Christ to be the Son of God</hi>
with a Faith humane and fallible, and which at last
may deceive us; which is to <hi>receive the Word of
God as the Word of Men, and not as it is in truth the
Word of God,</hi> contrary to the Apostle, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 13.
Wherefore,</p>
            <p>4. If I believe the Scripture to be the <hi>Word</hi> of
God with an humane Faith only, I do no otherwise
believe whatever is contained in it, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws
all Faith properly so called. And if I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
what is contained in the Scripture with Faith
<hi>divine and supernatural,</hi> I cannot but by the same
Faith believe the Scripture it self, which removes
the moral Certainty treated of out of our way.
And the Reason of this is, that we must believe the
Revelation, and the things revealed <hi>with the same
kind of Faith,</hi> or we bring confusion on the whole
work of believing. No man living can distinguish
in his Experience between that Faith, <hi>wherewith he
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:106952:44"/>
lieves the Scripture,</hi> and that <hi>wherewith he believes
the Doctrine of it,</hi> or the things contained in it;
nor is there any such Distinction or Difference inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
in the Scripture it self; but all our believing
is absolutely resolved into the Authority of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing.
Nor can it be rationally apprehended that
our <hi>Assent</hi> unto the things revealed, should be of a
kind and nature <hi>superior</hi> unto that which we yield
unto the Revelation it self. For let the Arguments
which it is resolved into be never so evident and
cogent, let the <hi>Assent</hi> it self be as firm and certain
as can be imagined, yet is it <hi>humane</hi> still, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and therein is <hi>inferior</hi> unto that which is <hi>divine
and supernatural.</hi> And yet on this Supposition
that which is of a <hi>superior kind</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
resolved into that which is of an inferior, and
must be take it self on all occasions thereunto for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
and confirmation. For the Faith whereby we
<hi>believe Jesus Christ to be the Son of God,</hi> is on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
absolutely melted down into that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we believe the <hi>Scriptures to be the Word of
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But none of these things are my present especial
Design, and therefore I have insisted long enough
upon them. I am not enquiring what Grounds
men may have to build an Opinion, or any kind of
<hi>humane Perswasion</hi> upon, that the Scriptures are the
the Word of God, no nor yet how we may prove
or maintain them so to be unto Gainsayers; but
what is required hereunto that we may believe
them to be so with Faith <hi>divine and supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
and what is the Work of the Spirit of God
therein.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:106952:44"/>
But it may be further said, that these <hi>external
Arguments and Motives</hi> are not of themselves, and
considered separately from the <hi>Doctrine</hi> which they
testify unto, the <hi>sole Ground</hi> and Reason of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.
For if it were possible that a <hi>thousand Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi>
of a like cogency with them were offered to
confirm any Truth or Doctrine, if it had not <hi>a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worth and Excellency in it self,</hi> they could give
the mind no Assurance of it. Wherefore it is the
<hi>Truth it self,</hi> or Doctrine contained in the Scripture
which they testify unto, that <hi>animates</hi> them and
gives them their Efficacy. For there is such a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
Holiness, and Excellency</hi> in the Doctrine of
the Gospel, and moreover such a <hi>Suitableness</hi> in
them unto unprejudiced Reason, and such an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerableness</hi>
unto all the rational Desires and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
of the Soul, as evidence their Procedure
from the Fountain of infinite Wisdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
It cannot but be conceived impossible that
such <hi>excellent, heavenly Mysteries,</hi> of such use and
benefit unto all Mankind, should be the Product of
any created Industry. Let but a man know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
his State and Condition in any measure, with
a desire of that <hi>Blessedness</hi> which his nature is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of, and which he cannot but design; when the
Scripture is proposed unto him in the <hi>Ministry of the
Church,</hi> attested by the Arguments insisted on,
there will appear unto him in the <hi>Truths and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi>
of it, or in the things contained in it, such
an Evidence of the Majesty and Authority of God,
as will prevail with him to believe it to be a divine
Revelation. And this Perswasion is such, that the
mind is established in its Assent unto the Truth, so
as to yield <hi>Obedience</hi> unto all that is required of us.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:106952:45"/>
And whereas our Belief of the Scripture is in order
only to the right Performance of our Duty, or all
that Obedience which God expecteth from us, our
minds being guided by the Precepts and Directions,
and duly influenced by the Promises and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of it thereunto, there is no other Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of us but what is sufficient to oblige us unto
that Obedience.</p>
            <p>This being, so far as I can apprehend, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of what is by some learned men proposed and
adhered unto, it shall be briefly examined. And I
say here as on other occasions, that I should rejoyce
to see more of such a Faith in the World, as would
effectually oblige men unto Obedience out of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of the Excellency of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> &amp; the <hi>Truth</hi>
of the Promises and Threatnings of the <hi>Word,</hi> though
learned men should never agree about the <hi>formal
Reason</hi> of Faith. Such Notions of Truth, when
most diligently inquired into, are but as sacrifice
compared with Obedience. But the Truth it self
is also to be enquired after diligently.</p>
            <p>This Opinion therefore either supposeth what
we shall immediatly declare, namely, the <hi>necessity</hi>
of an internal effectual Work of the Holy Spirit in
the <hi>Illumination of our minds,</hi> so enabling us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
with Faith <hi>divine and supernatural,</hi> or it doth
not. If it doth, it will be found, as I suppose, for
the Substance of it to be co-incident with what we
shall afterwards assert and prove to be the <hi>formal
Reason</hi> of Believing. However as it is usually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
I cannot absolutely comply with it, for these
two Reasons among others.</p>
            <p>1. It belongs unto the Nature of Faith, of what
sort soever it be, that it be built on and resolved
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:106952:45"/>
into <hi>Testimony.</hi> This is that which distinguisheth
it from any other Conception, Knowledge, or As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of our minds, on other Reasons and Causes.
And if this Testimony be divine, so is that Faith
whereby we give assent unto it, on the part of the
Object. But the Doctrines contained in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or the subject Matter of the Truth to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
have not in them the Nature of a <hi>Testimony,</hi>
but are the <hi>material</hi> not formal Objects of Faith,
which must always differ. If it be said that these
Truths or Doctrines do so <hi>evidence themselves</hi> to be
from God, as that in and by them we have the
Witness and Authority of God himself proposed
unto us, to resolve our Faith into, I will not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
contend about it; but only say that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of God, and so his Veracity, do manifest
themselves <hi>primarily</hi> in the Revelation it self, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they do so in the things revealed, which is that
we plead for.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Excellency of the Doctrine</hi> or things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in the Scriptures respects not so much the
Truth of them in speculation, as their Goodness
and Suitableness unto the Souls of Men, as to their
present Condition and eternal End. Now things
under that Consideration respect not so much <hi>Faith,</hi>
as <hi>spiritual Sense and Experience.</hi> Neither can any
man have a due Apprehension of such a <hi>goodness</hi> suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
unto our Constitution and Condition, with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
usefulness in the Truth of the Scripture, but
on a Supposition of that <hi>antecedent Assent</hi> of the
mind unto them, which is Believing; which
therefore cannot be the Reason why we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:106952:46"/>
But if this Opinion proceed not upon the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Supposition (immediately to be proved) but
requires no more unto our satisfaction in the Truth
of the Scripture and Assent thereon, but the due
<hi>Exercise of Reason,</hi> or the natural Faculties of our
Minds about them when proposed unto us, then I
suppose it to be most remote from the Truth, and
that amongst many other Reasons, for these that
ensue.</p>
            <p>1. On this Supposition the whole <hi>Work of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
would be a Work of <hi>Reason.</hi> Be it so, say
some, nor is it meet it should be otherwise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
But if so, then the Object of it must be
things so evident in themselves and their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as that the Mind is as it were compelled by
that Evidence unto an <hi>Assent,</hi> and cannot do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
If there be such a <hi>Light and Evidence</hi> in the
things themselves with respect unto our Reason in
the right use and exercise of it, then is the Mind
thereby necessitated unto its Assent; which both over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws
the Nature of Faith, substituting an Assent
upon natural Evidence in the room thereof, and is
absolutely exclusive of the necessity or use of any
Work of the Holy Ghost in our Believing, which
sober Christians will scarce comply withal.</p>
            <p>2. There are <hi>some Doctrines</hi> revealed in the
Scripture, and those of the most Importance that
are so revealed, which concern and contain things
so <hi>above our Reason,</hi> that without some previous
supernatural Dispositions of Mind, they carry in
them no Evidence of Truth unto meer Reason, nor
of Suitableness unto our Constitution and End.
There is required unto such an Apprehension both
the spiritual Elevation of the Mind by supernatural
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:106952:46"/>
Illumination, and a divine Assent unto the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Revelation thereon, before Reason can be
so much as satisfied in the Truth and Excellency
of such Doctrines. Such are those concerning the
<hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> or the Subsistence of one singular Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
in three distinct Persons; the <hi>Incarnation of
the Son of God;</hi> the <hi>Resurrection of the dead</hi> and
sundry other that are the most proper Subjects of
divine Revelation. There is an heavenly Glory in
some of these things, which as Reason can never
throughly apprehend because it is finite and limited,
so as 'tis in us by Nature, it can neither receive them,
nor delight in them as doctrinally proposed unto us,
with all the Aids and Assistance before mentioned.
<hi>Flesh and Blood reveals not these thisgs unto our
minds, but our Father which is in Heaven.</hi> Nor
doth any man know these Mysteries of the Kingdom
of God, but he unto <hi>whom it is given;</hi> nor do any
learn these things aright, but those that <hi>are taught
of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Take our Reason singly without the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of divine <hi>Grace and Illumination,</hi> and it is
not only weak and limited, but depraved and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.
And the <hi>carnal mind</hi> cannot subject it self
unto the Authority of God in any supernatural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
whatever. Wherefore the Truth is, that
the Doctrines of the Gospel, which are purely and
absolutely so, are so far from having a convincing
Evidence in themselves of their divine Truth, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
and Goodness, unto the Reason of men as
unrenewed by the Holy Ghost, as that they are
foolishness and most undesirable unto it, as I have
elsewhere proved at large<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We shall therefore
proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:106952:47"/>
There are two Things considerable with respect
unto our Believing the Scriptures to be the Word of
God in a due manner, or according to our Duty.
The first respects the <hi>Subject,</hi> or the <hi>mind of man,</hi>
how it is enabled thereunto; the other the <hi>Object</hi>
to be believed, with the true Reason why we do
believe the Scripture with Faith divine and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural.</p>
            <p>The first of these must of necessity fall under our
Consideration herein, as that without which, what
ever Reasons, Evidences or Motives are proposed
unto us, we shall never believe in a due manner.
For whereas the mind of man, or the minds of all
men are by <hi>nature depraved, corrupt, carnal,</hi> and
<hi>enmity against God;</hi> they cannot of themselves, or
by virtue of any innate Ability of their own, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
or assent unto spiritual things in a spiritual
manner, which we have sufficiently proved and
confirmed before. Wherefore that <hi>Assent</hi> which is
wrought in us by meer external Arguments, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
in the rational Conclusion and Judgment
which we make upon their Truth and Evidence, is
not that Faith wherewith we ought to believe the
Word of God.</p>
            <p>Wherefore that we may believe the Scriptures to
be the Word of God according to our Duty, as
God requireth it of us, in an useful, profitable, and
saving manner, above and beyond that <hi>natural hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Faith</hi> and Assent which is the Effect of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
and Motives of Credibility, before insisted
on, with all others of the like kind, <hi>there is and must
be wrought in us by the power of the Holy Ghost Faith
supernatural and divine, whereby we are enabled so to
do, or rather whereby we do so.</hi> This Work of the Spirit
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:106952:47"/>
of God, as it is distinct from, so in order of Nature
it is antecedent unto all <hi>divine objective Evidence</hi> of
the Scriptures being the Word of God, or the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Reason moving us to believe it; wherefore
without it whatever Arguments or Motives are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
unto us, we cannot believe the Scriptures to
be the Word of God in a due manner, and as it is in
duty required of us.</p>
            <p>Some, it may be, will suppose these things
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and impertinent unto our present
purpose. For while we are enquiring on what
<hi>Grounds</hi> we believe the Scripture to be the Word of
God, we seem to <hi>fly to the Work of the Holy Ghost</hi> in
our own minds, which is irrational. But we must
not be ashamed of the Gospel, nor of the Truth of
it, because some do not understand, or will not du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consider what is proposed. It is necessary, that
we should return unto the Work of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
not with peculiar respect unto the Scriptures
that are to be believed, but unto our own Minds
and that Faith wherewith they are to be believed.
For it is not the <hi>Reason,</hi> why we believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
but the <hi>Power</hi> whereby we are enabled so to
do, which at present we enquire after.</p>
            <p>1. That the <hi>Faith</hi> whereby we believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be the Word of God, is <hi>wrought in us by
the Holy Ghost,</hi> can be denied only on two Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
or Suppositions. (1.) That it is not <hi>Faith di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and supernatural</hi> whereby we believe them so
to be, but only we have other moral Assurance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
(2.) That this <hi>Faith divine and supernatural</hi> is of
our selves, and is not wrought in us by the Holy
Ghost. The first of these hath been already dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and shall be further evicted afterwards; and it
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:106952:48"/>
may be they are very few who are of that Judgment.
For generally whatever men suppose the prime
Object, principal Motive, and <hi>formal Reason</hi> of
that Faith to be, yet that it is Divine and Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
they all acknowledg. And as to the second
what is so, 'tis of the Operation of the Spirit of
God. For to say it is <hi>divine and supernatural,</hi> is to
say that it is <hi>not of our selves,</hi> but that it is the Grace
and Gift of the Spirit of God, wrought in us by his
divine and supernatural Power. And those of the
<hi>Church of Rome,</hi> who would resolve our Faith in
this matter <hi>objectively</hi> into the Authority of their
Church, yet <hi>subjectively</hi> acknowledge the Work of
the Holy Spirit ingenerating Faith in us, and that
Work to be necessary to our Believing the Scripture
in a due manner. <hi>Externae omnes &amp; humanae persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siones
non sunt satis ad credendum, quantumcun<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> ab
hominibus competenter ea quae sunt fidei proponantur.
Sed necessaria est insuper causa interior, hoc est divinum
quoddam lumen incitans ad credendum, &amp; oculi qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
interni Dei beneficio ad videndum dati,</hi> saith
<hi>Canus,</hi> Loc. Theol. lib. 2. cap. 8. Nor is there any of
the Divines of that Church which dissent herein. We
do not therefore assert any such <hi>divine formal Reoson</hi>
of Believing as that the mind should not stand in
need of <hi>supernatural</hi> Assistance enabling it to assent
thereunto. Nay we affirm that without this there
is in no man any true Faith at all, let the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Motives whereon he believes be as forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and pregnant with Evidence as can be imagined.
It is in this Case as in things natural; neither the
the Light of the Sun, nor any perswasive Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
unto men to look up unto it, will enable
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106952:48"/>
them to discern it, unless they are endued with a
due visive Faculty.</p>
            <p>And this the Scripture is express in beyond all
possibility of Contradiction. Neither is it that I
know of, by any as yet in express terms denied.
For indeed that all which is <hi>properly called Faith</hi>
with respect unto divine Revelation, and is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with God as such, is the Work of the Spirit of
God in us, or is bestowed on us by him, cannot be
questioned by any who own the Gospel. I have also
proved it elsewhere so fully and largly as that I shall
give it at present no other Confirmation, but what
will necessarily fall in with the Description of the
Nature of that Faith whereby we do believe, and
the Way or Manner of its being wrought in
us.</p>
            <p>The Work of the Holy Ghost unto this purpose
consists in the saving <hi>Illumination</hi> of the Mind, and
the Effect of it is a <hi>supernatural Light,</hi> whereby
the Mind is renewed, see <hi>Rom. 12. 1. Ephes.</hi> 1. 18, 19.
<hi>chap.</hi> 3. 16, 17, 18, 19. It is called an <hi>Heart to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
Eyes to see, Ears to hear,</hi> Deut. 29. 4.
The <hi>opening of the Eyes of our Vunderstanding,</hi>
Ephes. 1. 18. The <hi>giving of an Vnderstanding,</hi>
1 John 5. 20. Hereby we are enabled to <hi>discern</hi>
the Evidences of the divine Original and Authority
of the Scripture that are in it self, as well as <hi>assent</hi>
unto the Truth contained in it; and without it we
cannot do so. For the <hi>natural man receives not the
things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, neither can be know them because they are spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
discerned,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14. And unto this
end it is written in the Prophets, <hi>that we shall be
all taught of God,</hi> John 6. 45. That there is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:106952:49"/>
and heavenly Excellency in the Scripture,
cannot be denied by any, who on any Grounds or
Motives whatever do own its divine Original.
For all the Works of God do set forth his Praise,
and it is impossible that any thing should proceed
immediately from Him, but that there will be <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Characters</hi> of divine Excellencies upon it; and
as to the Communication of these Characters of
Himself, he hath <hi>magnified his Word above all his
Name.</hi> But these we cannot discern be they in
themselves never so illustrious, without the effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Communication of the Light mentioned unto
our Minds; that is without divine supernatural
<hi>Illumination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Herein he who commanded <hi>Light to shine out of
Darkness, shineth into our Hearts the Knowledg of
the Glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ,</hi> 2 Cor.
4. 6. He irradiates the Mind with a spiritual Light,
whereby it is enabled to discern the Glory of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Things: This they cannot do in whom the
<hi>God of this World hath blinded the eyes of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
not, lest the Light of the glorious Gospel of Christ,
who is the Image of God should shine into them,</hi> v. 6.
Those who are under the Power of their <hi>natural
Darkness</hi> and Blindness, especially where there are in
them also <hi>superadded Prejudices</hi> begotten and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the craft of Satan, as there are in the
whole World of Unbelievers, cannot see nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern
that divine Excellency in the Scripture, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an Apprehension whereof no man can believe it
a right to be the Word of God. Such Persons may
assent unto the Truth of the Scripture and its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Original, upon external Arguments and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Motives, but believe it with Faith <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:106952:49"/>
and Supernatural</hi> on those Arguments and
Motives only, they cannot.</p>
            <p>There are two things which hinder or disenable
men from believing with Faith divine and superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
when any Divine Revelation is objectively
proposed unto them. First, The <hi>natural Blindness
and Darkness of their Minds,</hi> which are come upon
all by the Fall, and the Depravation of our Nature
that ensued thereon. Secondly, The <hi>Prejudices</hi>
that through the Crafts of Satan the God of this
World, their minds are possessed with, by <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Educations,</hi> and <hi>Converse</hi> in the World. This
last Obstruction or Hinderance may be so far
removed by external Arguments and Motives of
Credibility, as that men may upon them attain
unto a <hi>moral Perswasion</hi> concerning the Divine Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
of the Scripture. But these Arguments can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
remove or take away the <hi>native Blindness of
the mind,</hi> which is removed by their Renovation
and Divine Illumination alone. Wherefore none
(I think) will positively affirm that we can believe
the Scripture to be the Word of God, in the way
and manner which God requireth, without a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Work of the Holy Spirit upon our minds
in the Illumination of them; So <hi>David</hi> prays that
<hi>God would open his eyes, that he might behold wonderous
things out of the Law,</hi> Psal. 119. 10. That <hi>he would
make him understand the way of his Precepts,</hi> v. 27.
That <hi>he would give him understanding and he should
keep the Law,</hi> v. 34. So the Lord Christ also <hi>open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the understandings of his Disciples,</hi> that they
might <hi>understand</hi> the Scriptures, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 45. As
he had affirmed before that it was <hi>given unto some</hi>
to know the Mysteries of the Kingdom of God, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:106952:50"/>
not unto others, <hi>Mat. 11. 25. chap.</hi> 13. 11. And
neither are these things spoken in vain, nor is the
Grace intended in them needless.</p>
            <p>The Communication of this Light unto us the
Scripture calleth <hi>Revealing</hi> and <hi>Revelation, Mat.</hi> 11.
25. <hi>Thou hast hid these things from the Wise and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and hast revealed them unto Babes;</hi> that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them to understand the Mysteries of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven when they were preached unto
them. <hi>And no man knoweth the Father but he to
whom the Son revealeth him,</hi> v. 27. So the Apostle
prayeth for the <hi>Ephesians, that God would give them
the Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation in the Knowledg
of Christ, that the eyes of their understandings being
enlightned, they might know</hi> &amp;c. <hi>chap. 1. v.</hi> 17, 18, 19.
It is true, these <hi>Ephesians</hi> were already <hi>Believers,</hi> or
considered by the Apostle as such; but if he judged
it necessary to pray for them, that they might have
<hi>the Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation to enlighten the
eyes of their Vnderstanding,</hi> with respect unto fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Degrees of Faith and Knowledge; or as he
speaks in another place, <hi>that they might come unto
the full Assurance of Vnderstanding, to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of the Mystery of God,</hi> Col. 2. 2. Then
it is much more necessary to make them Believers,
who before were not so, but utter strangers unto
the Faith.</p>
            <p>But as a Pretence hereof hath been abused, as we
shall see afterwards, so the pleading of it is liable
to be mistaken. For some are ready to apprehend,
that this Retreat unto a <hi>Spirit of Revelation,</hi> is but
a pretence to discard all rational Arguments, and
to introduce <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> into their room. Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Charge be grievous, yet because it is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:106952:50"/>
groundless, we must not forego what the Scripture
plainly affirms and instructs us in, thereby to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
it. Scripture Testimonies may be expounded
according to the <hi>Analogy of Faith,</hi> but denied or
despised, seem they never so contrary unto our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of things, they must not be. Some (I
confess) seem to disregard both the <hi>objective Work</hi> of
the Holy Spirit in this matter, whereof we shall
treat afterwards, and his <hi>subjective Work</hi> also in
our minds, that all things may be reduced unto
Sense and Reason. But we must grant that a <hi>Spirit
of Wisdom and Revelation</hi> to open the eyes of our
Understanding, is needful to enable us to believe
the Scripture to be the Word of God in a due man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
or forgo the Gospel. And our Duty it is to
pray continually for that Spirit, if we intend to
be established in the Faith thereof.</p>
            <p>But yet we plead not for <hi>external immediate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi>
such as were granted unto the Prophets,
Apostles, and other Penmen of the Scripture. The
Revelation we intend differs from them both in its
<hi>especial Subject and formal Reason,</hi> or Nature, that
is in the whole kind. For, (1.) The subject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of divine <hi>Prophetical Revelation,</hi> by a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
or <hi>immediate divine Inspiration,</hi> are things not made
known before. Things they were, <hi>hid in God,</hi> or
the Counsels of his Will, <hi>and revealed unto the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
and Prophets by the Spirit,</hi> Ephes. 2. 5, 9, 10.
Whether they were Doctrines or Things, they were
at least as unto their present Circumstances made
known from the Counsels of God by their Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But the Matter and Subject of the Revelation we
treat of, is nothing but what is already revealed.
It is an internal <hi>Revelation</hi> of that which is outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:106952:51"/>
and antecedent unto it; beyond the Bounds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it is not to be extended. And if any pretend
unto <hi>immediate Revelations</hi> of things not before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
we have no concernment in their Pretences.
(2.) They differ likewise in their Nature or Kind.
For <hi>immediate, divine, prophetical Revelation</hi> consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in an immediate Inspiration, or <hi>Afflatus,</hi> or in
Visions and Voices from Heaven, with a Power of the
Holy Ghost <hi>transiently</hi> affecting their Minds, gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their Tongues and Hands to whom they were
granted, whereby they received and represented
divine Impressions, as an Instrument of Musick
doth the Skill of the Hand whereby it is moved;
the Nature of which Revelation I have more fully
discoursed elsewhere. But this <hi>Revelation of the
Spirit</hi> consists in his effectual Operation, freeing
our Minds from Darkness, Ignorance, and Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
enabling them to discern spiritual Things in a
due manner. And such a <hi>Spirit of Revelation</hi> is
necessary unto them who would believe aright the
Scripture, or any thing else that is divine and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
contained therein. And if men who
through the Power of Temptations and Prejudices
are in the dark, or at a loss as to the great and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Principle of all Religion, namely, the
Divine Original and Authority of the Scripture,
will absolutely lean unto their own understandings,
and have the whole Difference determined by the
natural Power and Faculties of their own Souls,
without seeking after <hi>divine Aid and Assistance,</hi> or
earnest Prayer for the Spirit of Wisdom and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to open the eyes of their understandings, they
must be content to abide in their Uncertainties, or
to come off from them without any Advantage to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:106952:51"/>
their Souls. Not that I would deny unto men, or
take them off from the Use of their Reason in this
matter; for what is their Reason given unto them
for, unless it be to use it in those things which are of
the greatest importance unto them? Only I must
crave leave to say, that it is not sufficient of it self
to enable us to the performance of this Duty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the immediate Aid and Assistance of the Holy
Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>If any one upon these Principles shall now ask
us, <hi>Wherefore we believe the Scripture to be the Word
of God?</hi> We do not answer, It is, <hi>because the
Holy Ghost hath enlightned our minds, wrought Faith
in us, and enabled us to believe it.</hi> Without this
we say indeed, did not the Spirit of God so work
in us, and upon us, we neither should nor could
believe with Faith divine and supernatural. If God
had not <hi>opened the Heart of Lydia,</hi> she would not
have <hi>attended</hi> unto the things preached by <hi>Paul</hi> so
as to have received them; and without it the Light
oftentimes shines into Darkness, but the Darkness
comprehends it not. But this neither is nor
can be the <hi>formal Object of our Faith,</hi> or the
Reason why we believe the Scripture to be of God,
or any thing else; neither do we, nor can we ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
answer by it unto this Question, <hi>why we do
believe.</hi> This Reason must be something external
and evidently proposed unto us. For whatever <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
of spiritual Assent there be in the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which is thus wrought in it by the Holy Ghost,
yet the Understanding cannot assent unto any thing
with any Kind of Assent natural or supernatural, but
what is outwardly proposed unto it as true, and
that with sufficient Evidence that it is so. That
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:106952:52"/>
therefore which proposeth any thing unto us as <hi>true,</hi>
with Evidence of that Truth, is the formal Object
of our Faith, or the Reason why we do believe.
And what is so proposed must be true, and must be
evidenced to be true, or we cannot believe it; and
according to the Nature of that Evidence such is
our Faith; Humane if that be Humane; and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
if that be so. Now nothing of this is done
by that saving Light which is infused into our
minds, and is therefore not the Reason why we
believe what we do so.</p>
            <p>Whereas therefore some who seem to conceive that
the only <hi>general Ground</hi> of <hi>believing the Scripture</hi>
to be the <hi>Word</hi> of God, doth consist in <hi>rational Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
and <hi>Motives of Credibility,</hi> do grant that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Persons may have their Assurance hereof from
the Illumination of the Holy Ghost, though it be
not pleadable to others; they grant what is not,
that I know of, desired by any, and which in it
self is not true. For this Work consisting solely
in enabling the mind unto that Kind of Assent which
is Faith divine and supernatural, on supposition of
an external formal Reason of it duely proposed, is
not the Reason why any do believe, nor the <hi>Ground</hi>
whereunto their Faith is resolved.</p>
            <p>It remains only that we enquire whether our
Faith in this matter be not resolved into an <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
internal Testimony of the Holy Ghost,</hi> assuring
us of the divine Original and Authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
distinct from the Work of <hi>spiritual Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
before described. For it is the common Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Protestant Divines, that the <hi>Testimony of
the Holy Ghost</hi> is the Ground whereon we believe
the Scriptures to be the Word of God, and in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:106952:52"/>
what sense it is so shall be immediately declared.
But hereon are they generally charged by those of
the <hi>Church of Rome and others,</hi> that they resolve all
the Ground and Assurance of Faith into their own
particular Spirits, or the Spirit of every one that
will pretend thereunto. And this is looked upon
as a sufficient Warranty to reproach them with gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
countenance unto <hi>Enthusiasms,</hi> and exposing
the minds of men to endless delusions. Wherefore
this matter must be a little further enquired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
And,</p>
            <p>By an <hi>internal Testimony of the Spirit,</hi> an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<hi>Afflatus,</hi> or new immediate Revelation
may be intended. Men may suppose they have, or
ought to have an internal particular Testimony that
the Scripture is the Word of God, whereby, and
whereby alone they may be infallibly assured that so
it is. And this is supposed to be of the same nature
with the Revelation made unto the Prophets and
Penmen of the Scripture; for it is neither an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Proposition</hi> of Truth, nor an <hi>internal Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to assent</hi> unto such a Proposition. And besides
these there is no divine Operation in this kind, but
an immediate <hi>Prophetical Inspiration</hi> or Revelation.
Wherefore as such a Revelation or immediate Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Spirit is the only Reason why we do
believe, so it is that alone which our Faith rests on
and is resolved into.</p>
            <p>This is that which is commonly imputed unto
those who deny either the <hi>Authority of the Church,</hi>
or any other <hi>external Arguments or Motives of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility,</hi>
to be the <hi>formal Reason</hi> of our Faith.
Howbeit there is no one of them that I know of,
who ever asserted any such thing. And I do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:106952:53"/>
deny that our Faith is resolved into any such
<hi>private Testimony,</hi> immediate Revelation or Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Holy Ghost. And that for the ensuing
Reasons.</p>
            <p>1. Since the finishing of the Canon of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the Church is not under that <hi>Conduct,</hi> as to
stand in need of such new extraordinary Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
It doth indeed live upon the internal graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Operations</hi> of the Spirit, enabling us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
believe, and obey the perfect compleat Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
of the Will of God already made, but new
<hi>Revelations</hi> it hath neither need nor use of. And
to suppose them, or a necessity of them, not only
overthrows the Perfection of the Scripture, but also
leaveth us uncertain whether we know all that is to
be believed in order unto Salvation, or our whole
Duty, or when we may do so. For it would be
our Duty to live all our days in expectation of new
<hi>Revelations,</hi> wherewith neither Peace, Assurance,
nor Consolation are consistent.</p>
            <p>2. Those who are to <hi>believe,</hi> will not be able on
this Supposition to secure themselves from <hi>Delusion,</hi>
and from being imposed on by the Deceits of Satan.
For this <hi>new Revelation</hi> is to be tryed by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or it is not. If it be to be tried and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Scripture, then doth it acknowledge a
superiour Rule, Judgment and Testimony, and so
cannot be that which our Faith is ultimately resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into. If it be exempted from that Rule of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Spirits, then (1.) It must produce the
<hi>Grant of this Exemption,</hi> seeing the Rule is extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
generally unto all Things and Doctrines that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
unto <hi>Faith</hi> or Obedience. (2.) It must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
what are the Grounds and Evidences of its
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:106952:53"/>
own <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or self-credibility, and how it
may be infallibly or assuredly distinguished from all
Delusions, which can never be done. And if any
tolerable Countenance could be given unto these
things, yet we shall shew immediatly that no such
<hi>private Testimony</hi> though real, can be the formal
Object of Faith, or Reason of Believing.</p>
            <p>3. It hath so fallen out in the <hi>Providence of God,</hi>
that generally all who have given up themselves in
any things concerning Faith or Obedience unto the
<hi>pretended Conduct of immediate Revelations,</hi> although
they have pleaded a respect unto the Scripture also,
have been seduced into Opinions and Practices di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
repugnant unto it. And this with all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Sobriety is sufficient to discard this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>internal Testimony of the Spirit</hi> is by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
explained quite in another way. For they
say, that besides the Work of the Holy Ghost before
insisted on, whereby he takes away our <hi>natural
blindness,</hi> and enlightning our minds enables us to
discern the divine Excellencies that are in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
there is another internal Efficiency of his,
whereby we are moved, perswaded and enabled to
believe: Hereby we are taught of God, so as that
finding the Glory and Majesty of God in the
Word, our Hearts do by an ineffable Power assent
unto the Truth without any Hesitation. And this
Work of the Spirit carrieth its own Evidence in it
self, producing an Assurance above all humane
Judgment, and such as stands in need of no further
Arguments or Testimonies; this Faith rests on and
is resolved into. And this some learned men seem
to embrace, because they suppose that the <hi>objective
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:106952:54"/>
Evidence</hi> which is given in the Scripture it self, is
only moral, or such as can give only a moral Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
Whereas therefore Faith ought to be divine
and supernatural, so must that be whereinto it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
yea it is so alone from the <hi>formal Reason</hi> of
it. And they can apprehend nothing in this Work
that is immediately divine, but only this <hi>internal
Testimony of the Spirit,</hi> wherein God himself speaks
unto our Hearts.</p>
            <p>But yet neither, as it is so explained, can we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it to be the formal Object of Faith, nor that
wherein it doth acquiesce. For,</p>
            <p>1. It hath not the proper <hi>Nature of a divine Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony.</hi>
A <hi>divine Work</hi> it may be, but a <hi>divine
Testimony</hi> it is not; but it is of the nature of Faith
to be built on an external Testimony. However
therefore our minds may be established and enabled
to believe firmly and stedfastly by an ineffable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Work of the Holy Ghost, whereof also we
may have a certain experience; yet neither that
Work nor the Effect of it can be the Reason why
we do believe, nor whereby we are moved to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
but only that whereby we do believe.</p>
            <p>2. That which is the <hi>formal Object of Faith,</hi> or
Reason whereon we believe, is the same, <hi>and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
unto all that do believe.</hi> For our Enquiry is not
how or by what means this or that man came <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi>
but why any one or every one <hi>ought so to do,</hi>
unto whom the Scripture is proposed. The Object
proposed unto all to be believed is the same; and
the Faith required of all in a way of Duty is the
same, or of the same kind and nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Reason why we believe must be the
same also. But on this Supposition there must
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:106952:54"/>
be as many distinct Reasons of believing as there are
Believers.</p>
            <p>3. On this Supposition, it cannot be the Duty
of any one to believe the Scripture to be the Word
of God, who hath not received this <hi>internal Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Spirit.</hi> For where the true formal
Reason of believing is not proposed unto us, there
it is not our duty to believe. Wherefore although
the Scripture be proposed as the Word of God, yet
is it not our duty to believe it so to be, until we
have this Work of the Spirit in our hearts, in case
that be the formal Reason of believing. But not
to press any further, how it is possible men may be
deceived and deluded in their Apprehensions of such
an internal Testimony of the Spirit, especially if it
be not to be tried by the Scripture; which if it be,
it loseth its <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or self-credibility, or if it
be it casteth us into a Circle which the <hi>Papists</hi> charge
us withal; it cannot be admitted as the formal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our Faith, because it would divert us from
that which is publick, proper, every way certain
and infallible.</p>
            <p>However that Work of the Spirit which may be
called an <hi>internal real Testimony</hi> is to be granted, as
that which belongs unto the Stability and Assurance
of Faith. For if he did no otherwise work in us,
or upon us, but by the Communication of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Light unto our minds, enabling us to discern
the Evidences that are in the Scripture of its own
Divine Original, we should often be shaken in our
Assent, and moved from our Stability. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
our spiritual darkness is removed but in part, and
at best whilst we are here we see things but darkly,
<hi>as in a Glass,</hi> all things believed having some sort
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:106952:55"/>
of Inevidence or Obscurity attending them; and
whereas Temptations will frequently shake and
disturb the due respect of the Faculty unto the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
or interpose Mists and Clouds between them,
we can have no Assurance in Believing unless our
minds are further established by the Holy Ghost.
He doth therefore three ways assist us in believing,
and ascertain our minds of the things believed, so
as that we may hold fast the beginning of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
firm and stedfast unto the end. For,</p>
            <p>1. He gives unto Believers a <hi>spiritual Sense</hi> of
the <hi>Power and Reality of the things believed,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
their Faith is greatly established. And although
the <hi>divine Witness,</hi> whereunto our Faith is ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately
resolved, doth not consist herein, yet it is
the greatest corroborating Testimony whereof we
are capable. This is that which brings us unto the
<hi>Riches of the full Assurance of Vnderstanding,</hi> Col. 2. 2.
as also, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 5. And on the Account of this
<hi>Spiritual Experience</hi> is our perception of Spiritual
Things, so often expressed by Acts of Sense, as
<hi>tasting, seeing, feeling,</hi> and the like means of Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in things natural. And when Believers have
attained hereunto, they do find the divine Wisdom,
Goodness, and Authority of God so present unto
them, as that they need neither Argument, nor
Motive, nor any thing else to perswade them unto,
or confirm them in believing. And whereas this
<hi>spiritual Experience</hi> which Believers obtain through
the Holy Ghost, is such as cannot rationally be
contended about, seeing those who have received it,
cannot fully express it, and those who have not,
cannot understand it, nor the Efficacy which it
hath to secure and establish the mind; it is left to be
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:106952:55"/>
determined on by them alone, who have their <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
exercised to discern Good aad Evil.</hi> And this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
unto the internal subjective Testimony of the
Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>2. He assists, helps, and relieves us against <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
to the contrary,</hi> so as that they shall not be
prevalent. Our first <hi>prime Assent</hi> unto the divine
Authority of the Scripture upon its proper Grounds
and Reasons, will not secure us against future Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
and Temptations unto the contrary, from
all manner of Causes and Occasions. <hi>David</hi>'s Faith
was so assaulted by them, as that he said in his hast,
<hi>that all men were liars.</hi> And <hi>Abraham</hi> himself, after
he had received the Promise, that in his Seed all
Nations should be blessed, was reduced unto that
anxious Enquiry, <hi>Lord God what wilt thou give me,
seeing I go childless?</hi> Gen 15. 2. And <hi>Peter</hi> was so
winnowed by Satan, that although his <hi>Faith failed
not,</hi> yet he <hi>greatly failed</hi> and fainted in its Exercise.
And we all know what fears from within, what
fightings from without we are exposed unto in this
matter. And of this sort are all those <hi>Atheistical
Objections</hi> against the Scripture, which these Days
abound withal; which the Devil useth as <hi>fiery Darts</hi>
to enflame the Souls of men, and to destroy their
Faith; and indeed this is that Work which the
<hi>Powers of Hell</hi> are principally ingaged in at this day.
Having lopt off <hi>many Branches,</hi> they now lay their
Ax to the <hi>Root of Faith,</hi> and thence in the midst
of the Profession of Christian Religion, there
is no greater Controversy than whether the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are the Word of God or not. Against all these
Temptations doth the Holy Ghost give in such a
continual supply of <hi>spiritual Strength</hi> and Assistance
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:106952:56"/>
unto Believers, as that they shall at no time prevail,
nor their Faith totally fail. In such cases the Lord
Christ <hi>intercedes</hi> for us, that our Faith fail not, and
Gods Grace is sufficient against the <hi>buffetings</hi> of these
Temptations. And herein the Truth of Christs
Intercession, with the Grace of God, and its Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy,
are communicated unto us by the Holy Ghost.
What are those internal Aids whereby he esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisheth
and assureth our Minds against the Force and
Prevalency of Objections and Temptations against
the Divine Authority of the Scripture, how they
are communicated unto us, and received by us, this
is no place to declare in particular. It is in vain for
any to pretend unto the name of Christians, by
whom they are denied. And these also have the
nature of an internal real Testimony, whereby
Faith is established.</p>
            <p>And because it is somewhat strange, that after
a long quiet Possession of the professed Faith, and
Assent of the Generality of the Minds of Men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
there should now arise among us such an open
Opposition unto the <hi>divine Authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
as we find there is by Experience; it may
not be amiss in our passage to name the principal
Causes or Occasions thereof: For if we should
bring them all into one Reckoning, as justly we
may, who either openly oppose it and reject it, or
who use it or neglect it at their pleasure, or who
set up <hi>other Guides</hi> in Competition with it or above
it, or otherwise declare that they have no sense of
the immediate Authority of God therein; we
shall find them to be like the <hi>Moors</hi> or <hi>Slaves</hi> in
some Countries or Plantations, they are so great
in <hi>number</hi> and <hi>force</hi> above their Rulers and other
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:106952:56"/>
Inhabitants, that it is only want of Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with Confidence, and some distinct Interests,
that keep them from casting off their Yoak and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint.
I shall name <hi>three Causes only</hi> of this sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
and perillous Event.</p>
            <p>1. A long continued <hi>outward Profession</hi> of the
Truth of the Scripture, without an <hi>inward Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of its Power,</hi> betrays men at length to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
the Truth it self, at least not to regard it as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.
The Owning of the Scriptures to be the
Word of God bespeaks a divine Majesty, Authority,
and Power to be present in it and with it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
after men, who have for a long time so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
do find that they never had any <hi>real Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
of such a <hi>divine Presence</hi> in it by any Effects up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their own Minds, they grow insensibly regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
of it, or to allow it a very <hi>common place</hi> in their
thoughts. When they have worn off the Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that were on their mind from <hi>Tradition, Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
and <hi>Custom,</hi> they do for the future rather
not oppose it than in any way believe it. And
when once a Reverence unto the Word of God on
the Account of its <hi>Authority</hi> is lost, an Assent unto
it on the Account of <hi>Truth</hi> will not long abide.
And all such Persons, under a Concurrence of
Temptations and outward Occasions, will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reject it, or prefer other Gnides before
it.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Power of Lust</hi> rising up unto a Resolution
of living in those Sins, whereunto the Scripture
doth unavoidably annex eternal Ruine, hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with many to cast off its Authority. For
whilst they are resolved to live in an Outrage of Sin,
to allow a divine Truth and Power in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:106952:57"/>
is to cast themselves under a <hi>present Torment,</hi> as
well as to ascertain their future Misery: for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can be his Condition who is perpetually sensible
that God always condemns him in all that he doth,
and will assuredly take vengeance of him, which
is the constant language of the Scripture concerning
such Persons. Wherefore although they will not
immediately fall into an open <hi>Atheistical Opposition</hi>
unto it, as that which it may be is not consistent
with their Interest and Reputation in the World,
yet looking upon it as the Devils did on Jesus Christ,
as that which <hi>comes to torment them before their time,</hi>
they keep it at the greatest distance from their
thoughts and minds, until they have habituated
themselves unto a Contempt of it. There being
therefore an utter impossibility of giving any pretence
of Reconciliation between the Owning of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to be the Word of God, and a Resolution to live
in an excess of known Sin; Multitudes suffer their
Minds to be bribed by their corrupt Affections to a
Relinquishment of any Regard unto it.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>scandalous Quarrels,</hi> and Disputations of
those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> against the Scripture and
its Authority, have contributed much unto the ruine
of the Faith of many. Their great Design is by all
means to secure the Power, Authority, and Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of their Church. Of these they say continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
as the Apostle in another case of the Mariners,
<hi>unless these stay in the Ship we cannot be saved;</hi>
Without an Acknowledgment of these things they
would have it, that men can neither at present
believe, nor be saved hereafter. To secure this
Interest, the Authority of the Scripture must be by
all means questioned and impaired. A divine
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:106952:57"/>
Authority in it self they will allow it, but with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
unto us it hath none but what it obtains by
the Suffrage and Testimony of their Church. But
whereas <hi>Authority</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and consists
essentially in the Relation and Respect which it hath
unto others, or those that are to be subject unto it;
to say that it hath an <hi>Authority in it self,</hi> but <hi>none
towards us,</hi> is not only to deny that it hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Authority at all, but also to reproach it with an
empty name. They deal with it as the Souldiers
did with Christ, <hi>they put a Crown on his Head, and
cloathed him with a purple Robe, and bowing the Knee
before him mocked him, saying, Hail King of the
Jews.</hi> The ascribe unto it the Crown and Robe
of Divine Authority in it self, but not towards any
one Person in the World. So, <hi>if they please,</hi> God
shall be God, and his Word be of some Credit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men. Herein they seek continually to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
those of the weaker Sort, by urging them
vehemently with this Question, <hi>How do you know
the Scripture to be the Word of God?</hi> and have in
continual readyness a number of <hi>sophistical Artifices</hi>
to weaken all Evidences that shall be pleaded in its
behalf. Nor is that all; but on all Occasions they
insinuate such <hi>Objections against it</hi> from its <hi>Obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Imperfection, want of Order, Difficulties,</hi> and <hi>seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Contradictions</hi> in it, as are suited to take off the
minds of men from a firm Assent unto it, or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
on it. As if a Company of men should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
by crafty multiplied Insinuations, divulged
on all advantages, to weaken the Reputation of a
chast and sober Matron; although they cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
her of her Vertue; yet unless the World were
wiser than for the most part it appears to be, they
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:106952:58"/>
will insensibly take off from her due esteem. And
this is as bold an Attempt as can well be made in
any Case. For the first Tendency of these Courses
is to make men <hi>Atheists,</hi> after which success it is
left at uncertain hazard whether they will be <hi>Papists</hi>
or no. Wherefore as there can be no greater nor
more dishonourable Reflection made on <hi>Christian
Religion,</hi> than that it hath no other Evidence or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of its Truth, but the Authority and Witness
of those by whom it is at present professed, and
who have <hi>notable worldly advantages</hi> thereby; so
the minds of multitudes are secretly influenced by
the Poison of these Disputes, to think it no way ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to believe the Scripture to be the Word of
God; or at least are shaken off from the Grounds
whereon they have professed it so to be. And
the like Dis-service is done unto Faith and the Souls
of Men, by such as advance a <hi>Light within,</hi> or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Inspiration into Competition with it, or
the Room of it. For as such Imaginations take
place and prevail in the minds of men, so their
Respect unto the Scripture, and all Sense of its <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority</hi> doth decay, as Experience doth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
manifest.</p>
            <p>It is, I say, from an unusual Concurrence of
these and the like Causes and Occasions, that there
is at present among us such a Decay in, Relinquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of, and Opposition unto the <hi>Belief of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
as it may be former Ages could not parallel.</p>
            <p>But against all these Objections and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the Minds of true Believers are secured by
Supplies of spiritual Light, Wisdom, and Grace
from the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:106952:58"/>
There are several other especial gracious Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Holy Spirit on the minds of Believers,
which belong also unto this <hi>internal real Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
whereby their Faith is established. Such are his
<hi>anointing</hi> and <hi>sealing</hi> of them, his <hi>witnessing</hi> with
them, and his being an <hi>Earnest</hi> in them, all which
must be elsewhere spoken unto. Hereby is our
Faith every day more and more increased and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished.
Wherefore although no <hi>internal Work</hi> of
the Spirit can be the <hi>formal Reason</hi> of our Faith, or
that which it is resolved into; yet is it such, as
without it we can never sincerely believe as we
ought, nor be established in believing against Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
and Objections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And with respect unto this Work of the Holy
Ghost it is, that Divines at the first</hi> Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>did generally resolve our Faith of the divine
Authority of the Scripture into the Testimony of
the Holy Spirit. But this they did not do</hi> exclusive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>unto the proper use of external Arguments and
Motives of Credibility, whose Store indeed is great,
and whose Fountain is inexhaustible. For they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
from all the indubitable Notions that we have
of God or our selves, in reference unto our present
Duty or future Happiness. Much less did they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that Evidence thereof which the Holy Ghost
gives unto it in and by it self. Their Judgment
is well expressed in the excellent Words of one of
them.</hi> Maneat ergo <hi>(saith he)</hi> hoc fixum, quos

            <p>And we may here briefly call over what we have
attained or passed through. For, (1.) We have
shewed in general both what is the Nature of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelation,</hi> and <hi>divine Illumination,</hi> with
their mutual Respect unto one another. (2.) What
are the principal external Arguments or Motives of
<hi>Credibility,</hi> whereby the Scripture may be proved
to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of a divine Original. (3.) What kind of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
is the Effect of them, or what is the Assent
which we give unto the Truth of the Scriptures on
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106952:59"/>
their Account. (4.) What <hi>objective Evidence</hi> there
is unto Reason in the Doctrine of the Scriptures to
induce the mind to assent unto them. (5.) What
is the <hi>Nature of that Faith</hi> whereby we believe the
Scripture to be the Word of God, and how it is
wrought in us by the Holy Ghost. (6.) What
is that <hi>Internal Testimony</hi> which is given unto the
divine Authority of the Scriptures by the holy
Spirit, what is the Force and Use thereof.
The Principal Part of our Work doth yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.</p>
            <p>That which we have thus far made way for, and
which is now our only remaining Enquiry, is,
<hi>What is the Work of the Holy Ghost with respect unto
the objective Evidence which we have concerning the
Scripture, that it is the Word of God,</hi> which is the
formal Reason of our Faith, and whereinto it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
that is, we come to enquire and to give a
direct Answer unto that Question, <hi>Why we believe
the Scripture to be the Word of God?</hi> what it is that
our Faith rests upon herein? and what it is that
makes it the Duty of every man to believe it so to
be, unto whom it is proposed. And the Reason
why I shall be the briefer herein is, because I have
long since in another Discourse cleared this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and I shall not here again call over any
thing that was delivered therein, because what
hath been unto this day gainsaid unto it, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
against it, hath been of little Weight or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.
Unto this great Enquiry therefore
I say,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We believe the Scripture to be the Word of God
with divine Faith for its own sake only;</hi> or our
Faith is resolved into the Authority and Truth of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:106952:60"/>
God only, as revealing himself unto us therein and
thereby. And this Authority and Veracity of God
do infallibly manifest or evince themselves unto our
Faith, or our Minds in the exercise of it, by the
Revelation it self in the Scripture, and no otherwise
Or, <hi>Thus saith the Lord,</hi> is the Reason <hi>why we
ought to believe,</hi> and why we do so; why we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
at all in general, and why we believe any thing
in particular. And this we call the <hi>formal Object</hi>
or <hi>Reason</hi> of Faith.</p>
            <p>And it is evident that this is not God himself ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
considered; for so he is only the <hi>material
Object</hi> of our Faith; <hi>He that cometh unto God must
believe that he is,</hi> Heb. 11. 6. Nor is it the Truth
of God absolutely, for that we believe as we do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>essential Properties</hi> of his Nature: But it is
the Truth of God <hi>revealing himself, his mind and
will unto us in the Scripture.</hi> This is the sole
Reason why we believe any thing with Divine
Faith.</p>
            <p>It is, or may be enquired, wherefore we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<hi>Jesus Christ to be the Son of God,</hi> or that God
is one in Nature, subsisting in three Persons, the
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit? I answer, it is,
because God himself, the first Truth, who <hi>cannot
lie,</hi> hath revealed and declared these things so to
be, and he who is <hi>our All,</hi> requireth us so to believe.
If it be asked how, wherein, or whereby God
hath revealed and declared these things so to be, or
what is that Revelation which God hath made
hereof? I answer, <hi>It is the Scripture, and that only.</hi>
And if it be asked, how I know this Scripture to be
a Divine Revelation, to be the Word of God?
I answer, (1.) I do not know it <hi>demonstratively,</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:106952:60"/>
upon rational scientifical Principles, because such a
Divine Revelation is not capable of such a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. (2.) I do not assent unto it,
or think it to be so upon Arguments and <hi>Motives
highly probable,</hi> or morally uncontroulable only,
as I am assuredly perswaded of many other things
whereof I can have no certain Demonstration,
1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 15. But I believe it so to be <hi>with Faith
divine and supernatural,</hi> resting on, and resolved
into the Authority and Veracity of God himself,
evidencing themselves unto my Mind, my Soul
and Conscience by this <hi>Revelation it self,</hi> and not
otherwise.</p>
            <p>Here we rest, and deny that we believe the
Scripture to be the Word of God <hi>formally</hi> for any
other Reason but it self, which assureth us of its
Divine Authority. And if we rest not here, we
must run on the Rock of a <hi>moral Certainty</hi> only;
which shakes the Foundation of all Divine Faith,
or fall into the Gulf and Labyrinth of an <hi>endless
Circle</hi> in proving two things <hi>mutually</hi> by one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as the Church by the Scripture, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
by the Church in an everlasting Rotation.
Unless we intend so to wander we must come to
something wherein we may rest for its own sake,
and that not with a strong and firm Opinion, but
with Divine Faith. And nothing can rationally
pretend unto this Priviledge, but the Truth of God
manifesting it self in the Scripture. And therefore
those, who will not allow it hereunto, do some of
them wisely deny that the Scriptures being the Word
of <hi>God</hi> is the Object of Divine Faith directly, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of a moral Perswasion from eternal Arguments
and Considerations. And I do believe that they
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:106952:61"/>
will grant, that if the Scripture be so to be believed,
it must be for its own sake. For those who would
have us to believe the Scripture to be the Word of
God upon the Authority of the Church, proposing
it unto us, and witnessing so to be, though they
make a fair appearance of a ready and easy way for
the exercise of Faith, yet when things come to be
sifted and tried, they do so confound all sorts of
things, that they know not where to stand or abide.
But it is not now my Business to examine their
Pretences, I have done it elsewhere. I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
prove and establish the Assertion laid down,
after I have made way to it by one or two previous
Observations.</p>
            <p>1. We suppose herein all the <hi>Motives of Credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
before mentioned, that is, all the Arguments
<hi>ab extra,</hi> which vehemently perswade the Scripture
to be the Word of God, and wherewith it may
be protected against Objections and Temptations
to the contrary. They have all of them their Use,
and may in their proper place be insisted on. Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
ought they to be pleaded when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is attacked by an <hi>Atheism,</hi> arising from the
Love and Practice of those <hi>Lusts and Sins</hi> which
are severely condemned therein, and threatned with
the utmost Vengeance. With others they may be
considered as <hi>previous inducements</hi> unto believing,
or <hi>concomitant means</hi> of strengthning Faith in
them that do believe. In the first way, I confess,
to the best of my Observation of things past and
present, their Use is not great, nor ever hath been
in the Church of God. For assuredly the most
that do sincerely believe the divine Original and
Authority of the Scripture, do it without any great
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:106952:61"/>
Consideration of them, or being much influenced
by them. And there are many who, as <hi>Austin</hi>
speaks, are saved <hi>simplicitate credendi,</hi> and not
<hi>subtilitate disputandi,</hi> that are not able to enquire
much into them, nor yet to apprehend much of
their Force and Efficacy, when they are proposed
unto them. Most Persons therefore are effectually
converted to God and have saving Faith whereby
they believe the Scripture, and virtually all that is
contained in it, before they have ever once conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them. And God forbid we should think
that none believe the Scripture aright, but those
who are able to apprehend and manage the subtil
Arguments of learned men produced in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.
Yea we affirm on the contrary, that
those who believe them on no other Grounds have
indeed no true Divine Faith at all. Hence they
were not of old insisted on for the ingenerating of
Faith in them to whom the Word was preached,
nor <hi>ordinarily</hi> are so to this day by any who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what is their Work and Duty. But in the
second way, wherever there is occasion from Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
Oppositions, or Temptations, they may
be pleaded to good use and purpose. And they
may do well to be furnished with them, who are
unavoidably exposed unto trials of that Nature.
For as for that Course which some take in all places
and at all times to be <hi>disputing about the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
and their Authority; it is a Practice
giving countenance unto Atheism, and is to
be abhorred of all that fear God, and the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
of it are sufficiently manifest.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Ministry of the Church,</hi> as it is the <hi>Ground
and Pillar of Truth,</hi> holding it up and declaring it,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:106952:62"/>
is in an ordinary way previously necessary unto Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.
For <hi>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing
by the Word of God.</hi> We believe the Scripture to be
the Word of God <hi>for</hi> it self alone, but not <hi>by</hi> it self
alone. The Ministry of the Word is the means
which God hath appointed for the Declaration and
making known the Testimony which the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
gives in the Scripture unto its Divine Original.
And this is the ordinary way whereby men are
brought to believe the Scripture to be the Word of
God. The Church in its Ministry, owning, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing,
and avowing it so to be, instructing all
sorts of Persons out of it, there is together with a
sense and apprehension of the Truth and Power of
the things taught and revealed in it, Faith in it
self as the Word of God, ingenerated in them.</p>
            <p>3. We do also here suppose the <hi>internal effectual
Work of the Spirit</hi> begetting Faith in us as was before
declared; without which we can believe neither
the Scripture nor any Thing else with Faith divine,
not for want of Evidence in them but of Faith in
our selves.</p>
            <p>These things being supposed we do affirm, that
<hi>it is the Authority and Truth of God, as manifesting
themselves in the supernatural Revelation made in
the Scripture, that our Faith ariseth from and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
into.</hi> And herein consists that Testimony
which the Spirit gives unto the Word of God that
it is so; <hi>for it is the Spirit that beareth witness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Spirit is Truth.</hi> The Holy Ghost being the
immediate Author of the whole Scripture doth
therein and thereby give <hi>Testimony</hi> unto the Divine
Truth and Original of it, by the Characters of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority and Veracity impressed on it, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:106952:62"/>
evidencing themselves in its Power and Efficacy.
And let it be observed, that what we assert respects
the <hi>Revelation it self,</hi> the <hi>Scripture,</hi> the Writing,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and not meerly the things written or
contained in it. The Arguments produced by some
to prove the <hi>Truth of the Doctrines of the Scripture,</hi>
reach not the Cause in hand. For our Enquiry is
not about believing the <hi>Truths revealed,</hi> but about
believing the <hi>Revelation</hi> it self, the Scripture it self
to be Divine. And this we do only because of the
Authority and Veracity of the Revealer, that is of
God himself, manifesting themselves therein.</p>
            <p>To manifest this fully, I shall do these things.</p>
            <p>1. Prove that our <hi>Faith is so resolved into the
Scripture</hi> as a Divine Revelation, and not into any
thing else, that is, we believe the Scripture to be
the Word of God for its own sake, and not for the
sake of any thing else, either external Arguments,
or authoritative Testimony of men whatever.</p>
            <p>2. Shew how or by what means the Scripture doth
<hi>evidence its own divine Original,</hi> or the Authority
of God is so evidenced in it and by it, as that we
need no other <hi>formal Cause</hi> or <hi>Reason of our Faith,</hi>
whatever Motives or Means of Believing we
may make use of. And as to the first of these.</p>
            <p>1. That is the <hi>formal Reason</hi> whereon we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
which the Scripture proposeth as the only
<hi>Reason why we should so do,</hi> why it is our Duty to
do so, and whereunto it requireth our <hi>Assent.</hi>
Now this is to it self as it is the Word of God, and
because it is so. Or it proposeth the Authority of
God in it self, and that alone, which we are to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce
in, and the <hi>Truth of God</hi> and that alone
which our Faith is to rest on, and is resolved into.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:106952:63"/>
It doth not require us to believe it upon the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of any Church, or on any other Arguments
that it gives us to prove that it is from God; but
speaks unto us immediately in his name, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
requires Faith and Obedience.</p>
            <p>Some it may be, will ask, <hi>Whether this prove the
Scripture to be the Word of God, because it says so
of it self, when any other Writing may say the same?</hi>
But we are not now giving Arguments to prove
unto others the Scripture to be the Word of God,
but only proving and shewing what our own Faith
resteth on, and is resolved into, or at least ought
so to be. How it evidenceth it self unto our Faith
to be the Word of God we shall afterwards declare.
It is sufficient unto our present purpose, that God
<hi>requires us to believe the Scripture for no other Reason
but because it is his Word,</hi> or a Divine Revelation
from him; and if so, his Authority and Truth are
the <hi>formal Reason</hi> why we believe the Scripture or
any thing contained in it. To this purpose do Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
abound in particular, besides that general
Attestation which is given unto it in that sole
Preface of divine Revelations, <hi>Thus saith the Lord;</hi>
and therefore they are to be believed. Some of
them we must mention.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 11, 12, 13. When all Israel is come
to appear before the Lord thy God in the place which
he shall chuse, thou shalt read this Law before all
Israel in their hearing; Gather the people together,
Men, Women, and Children, and the Stranger that
is within thy Gates, that they may hear, and that
they may learn, and fear the Lord your God, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to do all the Works of this Law, and that their
Children which have not known any thing may hear
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:106952:63"/>
and learn to fear the Lord your God. <hi>It is plain that
God here requireth Faith and Obedience of the
whole people, Men, Women and Children. The
Enquiry is what he requireth it unto? It is to this
Law, to this Law written in the</hi> Books of Moses,
<hi>which was to be read unto them out of the Book,
at the hearing of which they were obliged to believe
and obey. To evidence that Law to be his, he
proposeth nothing but it self. But it will be said,
that</hi> Generation was sufficiently convinced that the Law
was from God, by the Miracles which they beheld in
the giving of it. <hi>But moreover it is ordered to be
proposed unto Children of future Generations, who</hi>
knew nothing, <hi>that they may hear and learn to fear
the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which by the Appointment of God is to be
<hi>proposed unto them that know nothing</hi> that they may
believe, that is unto them the <hi>formal Reason</hi> of
their Believing. But this is the written Word,
<hi>Thou shalt read this Law unto them who have known
nothing, that they may hear and learn,</hi> &amp;c. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
use therefore there may be of other Motives
or Testimonies to commend the Law unto us, of
the Ministry of the Church especially, which is here
required unto the Proposal of the Word unto men,
it is the <hi>Law it self,</hi> or the written Word which
is the Object of our Faith, and which we believe
for its own sake; see also <hi>chap.</hi> 29. 29. where <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
things are said to belong unto us and our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
that we might do them,</hi> that is receive them
on the Account of their Divine Revelation.</p>
            <p>Isa. 8. 19, 20. <hi>And when they shall say unto you,
Seek unto them that have familiar Spirits, and unto
Wizards, that peep and mutter; should not a people
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:106952:64"/>
seek unto their God? for the living to the dead? To
the Law, and to the Testimony; if they speak not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this Word, it is because there is no Light in
them.</hi> The Enquiry is by what means men may
come to satisfaction in their Minds and Consciences,
or what their Faith and Trust is in. Two Things
are proposed unto this end. (1.) Immediate <hi>dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
Revelations,</hi> real or pretended. (2.) The
<hi>written Word of God,</hi> the Law and the Testimony.
Hereunto are we sent, and that upon the Account of
its own Authority alone, in opposition unto all other
pretences of Assurance or Security. And the sole
Reason why any one doth not acquiesce by Faith in
the written Word, is because he hath no <hi>Mornings,
or Light of Truth</hi> shining on him. But how shall
we know the Law and Testimony, this written
Word, to be the Word of God, and believe it so to
be, and distinguish it from every other pretended
Divine Revelation, that is not so? This is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared;</p>
            <p>Jerem. 23. 28, 29. <hi>The Prophet that hath a
Dream, let him tell a Dream; and he that hath my
Word, let him speak my Word faithfully. What is
the Chaff to the Wheat, saith the Lord? Is not my
Word like as fire, saith the Lord? and like an Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
that breaketh the Rock in pieces?</hi> It is supposed
that there are two Persons in Reputation for Divine
Revelations esteemed Prophets; one of them only
<hi>pretends</hi> so to be, and declares the <hi>Dreams of his own
Fancy,</hi> or the Divinations of his own Mind, as the
Word of God. The other <hi>hath the Word of God</hi>
and declares it faithfully from him. Yea but how
shall we know the one from the other? Even as men
know Wheat from Chaff, by their different Natures
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:106952:64"/>
and Effects. For as false pretended Revelations
are but as <hi>Chaff</hi> which every Wind will scatter; so
the true Word of God is like a Fire, <hi>and like an
Hammer,</hi> is accompanied with that Light, Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and Power, that it manifests it self unto the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of men so to be. Hereon doth God call us
to rest our Faith on it in opposition unto all other
Pretences whatever.</p>
            <p>But is it of this Authority and Efficacy in it self?
See Luk. 16. 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. <hi>Then said he,</hi>
[the rich Man in Hell,] <hi>I pray thee therefore Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that thou wouldest send him</hi> [Lazarus who
was dead,] <hi>unto my Fathers house, for I have five
Brethren, that he may testify unto them lest they also
come into this place of torment. Abraham saith unto
him, they have Moses and the Prophets, let them hear
them. And he said, Nay Father Abraham, but if
one went unto them from the dead they would repent;
and he said unto him, if they hear not Moses and the
Prophets, neither will they be perswaded though one rose
from the dead.</hi> The Question here between <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
and the rich Man in this Parable, indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Wisdom of God and the superstitious
Contrivances of Men, is about the way and means
of bringing those who are Unbelievers and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
unto Faith and Repentance. He <hi>who was in
Hell</hi> apprehended that nothing would make them
believe but a <hi>Miracle,</hi> one rising from the dead and
speaking unto them; which or the like marvellous
Operations many at this day think would have
mighty power and influence upon them to settle
their minds and change their lives; should they
see one <hi>rise from the dead,</hi> and come and converse
with them, this would convince them of the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:106952:65"/>
               <hi>Immortality of the Soul,</hi> of <hi>future Rewards and
Punishments,</hi> as giving them sufficient Evidence
thereof, so that they would assuredly repent and
change their Lives; but as things are stated they
have no sufficient evidence of these things, so that
they doubt so far about them as that they are not
really influenced by them; give them but one real
Miracle and you shall have them for ever. This
I say, was the Opinion and Judgment of him who
was represented in Hell, as it is of many who are
posting thither apace. He who was in Heaven
thought otherwise, wherein we have the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Judgment of Jesus Christ given in this matter,
determining this Controversy. The Question is
about sufficient Evidence and Efficacy to cause us
to believe Things divine and supernatural; and
this he determines to be in the written Word, <hi>Moses
and the Prophets.</hi> If he that will not believe on the
single Evidence of the written Word to be from
God, or a Divine Revelation of his Will, will never
believe upon the Evidence of Miracles nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Motives, then that written Word contains in
it self the entire <hi>formal Reason of Faith,</hi> or all that
Evidence of the Authority and Truth of God in it,
which Faith divine and supernatural rests upon;
that is, it is to be believed for its own sake. But
saith our Lord Jesus Christ himself, if <hi>men will
not hear,</hi> that is, believe <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,
neither will they be perswaded though one rose from
the dead,</hi> and come and preach unto them, a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Miracle than which they could not desire. Now
this could not be spoken, if the Scripture did not
contain in it self the whole entire <hi>formal Reason</hi> of
Believing; for if it have not this, something necessary
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:106952:65"/>
unto believing would be wanting, though that
were enjoyed. And this is directly affirmed,</p>
            <p>John 20. 30, 31. <hi>And many other Signs truly did
Jesus in the presence of his Disciples, which are not
written in this Book. But these are written, that you
might believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God,
and that believing you might have life through his
Name.</hi> The <hi>Signs</hi> which Christ wrought did evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
him to be the Son of God. But how come
we to know and believe these Signs? what is the
way and means thereof? Saith the blessed Apostle,
<hi>these things are written that you may believe;</hi> this
writing of them by Divine Inspiration is so far suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to beget and assure Faith in you, as that
thereby you may have eternal life through Jesus
Christ. For if the <hi>writing of Divine Things and
Revelations</hi> be the means appointed of God to cause
men to believe unto eternal life, then it must as
such carry along with it sufficient Reason why we
should believe, and Grounds whereon we should do
so. And in like manner is this matter determined
by the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 Pet. 1. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. <hi>For we have
not followed cunningly devised Fables, when we made
known unto you the power and coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ, but were eye-witnesses of his Majesty.
For he received from God the Father honour and
glory, when there came such a Voice to him from the
excellent Glory; This is my beloved Son, in whom I am
well pleased. And this Voice which came from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
we heard, when we were with him in the holy
Mount. We have also a more sure Word of Prophecy,
whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a Light
shining in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:106952:66"/>
day-star arise in your hearts. Knowing this first,
that no Prophecy of the Scripture is of any private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.
For the Prophecy came not in old time
by the will of man; but holy men of God spake as they
were moved by the Holy Ghost.</hi> The Question is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Gospel, or the Declaration of the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Coming of Jesus Christ, whether it were to be
believed or no? and if it were, upon what
Grounds? Some said it was a <hi>cunningly devised
Fable;</hi> others, that it was a fanatical Story of mad
men, as <hi>Festus</hi> thought of it when preached by <hi>Paul,</hi>
Acts 26. 24. and very many are of the same mind
still. The Apostles on the contrary averred that
what was spoken concerning him were <hi>Words of
truth and soberness,</hi> yea <hi>faithful Sayings, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of all acceptation,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 15. that is, to be
believed for its Worth and Truth. The Grounds
and Reasons hereof are two. (1.) The Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Apostles, who not only conversed with
Jesus Christ, and were <hi>eye Witnesses</hi> of his Majesty,
beholding his Glory, <hi>the Glory as of the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of the Father, full of Grace and Truth,</hi> John 1. 14.
which they gave in Evidence of the Truth of the
Gospel, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 1. But also heard a <hi>miraculous
Testimony</hi> given unto him immediately from God
in Heaven, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. 18. This gave <hi>them</hi> indeed
sufficient <hi>Assurance;</hi> but whereinto shall they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
their Faith who heard not this Testimony?
Why they have a <hi>more sure,</hi> that is, <hi>a most sure
Word of Prophecy,</hi> that is, the written Word of
God, that is sufficient of it self to secure their Faith
in this matter, especially as confirmed by the
Testimony of the Apostles, whereby the Church
comes to be built in its Faith on the <hi>Foundation of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:106952:66"/>
the Prophets and Apostles,</hi> Ephes. 2. 20. But why
should we believe this <hi>Word of Prophecy?</hi> may not
that also be a <hi>cunningly devised Fable,</hi> and the
whole Scripture be but the Suggestions of mens
private Spirits, as is objected? <hi>Ver.</hi> 20. All is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
resolved into this, that the Writers of it were
<hi>immediately moved and acted by the Holy Ghost,</hi> from
which Divine Original it carrieth along its own E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
with it. Plainly that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
teacheth us is, that we believe all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Divine Truths for the <hi>Scriptures sake,</hi>
or because they are declared therein; but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
we believe for its own sake, or because holy
men of God wrote it as they were moved by the
Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>So is the whole Object of Faith proposed by the
same Apostle, 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 2. The Words that were spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
before by the holy Prophets, and the Commandments
of the Apostles of the Lord and Saviour.</hi> And because
our Faith is resolved into them, we are said to be
built upon the Foundation of the Prophets and
Apostles, as was said <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20. that is, our Faith
rests solely, as on its proper Foundation which bears
the weight of it, on the Authority and Truth of
God in their Writings. Hereunto we may add
that of <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 16. 25, 26. <hi>According to the Revelation of
the Mystery which was kept secret since the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
but now is made manifest, and by the Scriptures
of the Prophets, according to the Commandment of the
everlasting God, made known unto all Nations for
the Obedience of Faith.</hi> The matter to be beleived
is the Mystery of the Gospel, which was kept secret
since the World began, or from the giving of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:106952:67"/>
first Promise, not absolutely, but with respect unto
that <hi>full manifestation</hi> which it hath now received.
This God commands to be believed, the <hi>everlasting
God,</hi> he who hath sovereign Authority over all,
requires Faith in a way of Obedience hereunto.
But what Ground or Reason have we to believe it?
This alone is proposed, namely, the Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made in the Preaching of the Apostles, and
Writings of the Prophets; for <hi>Faith cometh by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and hearing by the Word of God,</hi> Rom. 10. 17.
This Course and no other did our Saviour, even
after his Resurrection, take to beget and confirm
Faith in the Disciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 25, 26, 27. That
great Testimony to this purpose; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 14, 15,
16, 17. I do not plead in particular, because
I have so fully insisted on it in another Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
            <p>From these and many other Testimonies to the
same purpose, which might be produced, it is
evident,</p>
            <p>1. That it is the Scripture it self, the <hi>Word</hi> or
Will of God as <hi>revealed</hi> or <hi>written,</hi> which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
unto us as the Object of our Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
which we are to receive and believe with
Faith divine and supernatural.</p>
            <p>2. That <hi>no other Reason</hi> is proposed unto us either
as a <hi>Motive</hi> to encourage us, or as an <hi>Argument to</hi>
assure us that we shall not be mistaken, but only its
own <hi>Divine Original and Authority,</hi> making our
Duty necessary, and securing our Faith infallibly.
And those Testimonies are with me of more weight
a thousand times than the plausible Reasonings of
any to the contrary. With some indeed it is grown
a matter of contempt to quote or cite the Scripture
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:106952:67"/>
in our Writings, such Reverence have they for the
<hi>Ancient Fathers,</hi> some of whose Writings are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but a perpetual Contexture of Scripture.
But for such who pretend to despise those Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
in this Case, it is because either they do not
understand what they are produced to confirm, or
cannot answer the Proof that is in them. For it is
not unlikely but that some Persons well conceited
of their own Understanding in things wherein they
are most ignorant, will pride and please themselves
in the <hi>Ridiculousness</hi> of proving the Scripture to be
the <hi>Word of God</hi> by Testimonies taken out of it.
But as was said, we must not forgo the Truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
either they will not or cannot understand
what we discourse about.</p>
            <p>2. Our Assertion is confirmed by the <hi>uniform
Practice</hi> of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> and all the
Penmen of the Scripture, in proposing these Divine
Revelations which they received by immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration
from God. For that which was the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of <hi>their</hi> Faith unto whom they first declared
those Divine Revelations, is the Reason of our Faith
now they are recorded in the Scripture. For the
writing of it being by God's Appointment, it
comes into the room and supplies the place of their
<hi>Oral</hi> Ministry. On what Ground soever men were
obliged to receive and believe <hi>Divine Revelations,</hi>
when made unto them by the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
on the same are we obliged to receive and
believe them now they are made unto us in the
Scripture, the VVriting being by divine Inspiration,
and appointed as the Means and Cause of our Faith.
It is true, God was pleased sometimes to bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
unto their personal Ministry by <hi>Miracles,</hi> or
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:106952:68"/>
               <hi>Signs and Wonders,</hi> as <hi>Heb. 2. 4. God bearing them
witness.</hi> But this was only at some seasons, and
with some of them. That which they universally
insisted on, whether they wrought any <hi>Miracles</hi> or
no, was, that the Word which they preached, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
wrote, was not the <hi>Word of man,</hi> came not
by any <hi>private Suggestion,</hi> or from any Invention
of their own, but was indeed the <hi>Word of God,</hi>
1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 13. and declared by them as they were
<hi>acted</hi> by the Holy Ghost. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21.</p>
            <p>Under the Old Testament, although the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
sometimes referred Persons unto the <hi>Word
already written,</hi> as that which their Faith was to
acquiesce in, <hi>Isa. 8. 20, Mal.</hi> 4. 4. setting out its
Power and Excellency for all the ends of Faith and
Obedience, <hi>Psal. 19. 7, 8, 9. Psal.</hi> 119. and not
to any thing else, nor to any other Motives or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to beget and require Faith, but its own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
only; yet as to their own especial <hi>Messages</hi>
and Revelations, they laid the Foundation of all
the Faith and Obedience which they required, in this
alone, <hi>Thus saith the Lord, the God of Truth.</hi> And
under the New Testament, the infallible Preachers
and Writers thereof do in the first place propose
the Writings of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> to be received for
their own sake, or on the Account of their Divine
Original; see <hi>John 45. 46, 47. Luk.</hi> 16. 29, 31.
<hi>Mat. 21. 42. Acts 18. 24, 25, 28. Acts</hi> 24. 14.
<hi>chap. 26. 22. 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 21. Hence are they called
the <hi>Oracles of God,</hi> Rom. 3. 2. And <hi>Oracles</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
required an Assent for their own sakes, and
other Evidence they pleaded none. And for the
Revelations which they superadded, they pleaded
that they had them <hi>immediately from God by Jesus
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:106952:68"/>
Christ,</hi> Gal. 1. 1. And this was accompanied with
such an infallible Assurance in them that received it
as to be preferred above a Supposition of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Miracle to confirm any thing to the contrary;
<hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8. For if an <hi>Angel from Heaven</hi> should have
preached any other Doctrine than what they reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and proposed in the Name and Authority of
God, they were to esteem him accursed. For
this Cause they still insisted on their <hi>Apostolical
Authority</hi> and Mission, which included infallible
Inspiration and Directions as the Reason of the
Faith of them unto whom they preached and wrote.
And as for those who were not themselves <hi>divinely
inspired,</hi> or wherein those that were so did not act
by immediate Inspiration, they proved the Truth
of what they delivered by its consonancy unto the
Scriptures already written, referring the Minds and
Consciences of Men unto them for their ultimate
Satisfaction; <hi>Acts 18. 28. chap.</hi> 28. 33.</p>
            <p>3. It was before granted, that there is required
as subservient unto believing, as a <hi>means</hi> of it, or
the Resolution of our Faith into the Authority of
God in the Scriptures, the <hi>ministerial Proposal</hi> of
the Scriptures and the Truths contained in them,
with the Command of God for Obedience unto
them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 25. 26. This Ministry of the
Church, either extraordinary or ordinary, God
hath appointed unto this End, and ordinarily it is
indispensible thereunto, <hi>Rom. 10. 14, 15. How
shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?
and how shall they hear without a Preacher, and how
shall they preach unless they are sent?</hi> Without
this ordinarily we cannot believe the Scripture to
be the Word of God, nor the things contained in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:106952:69"/>
it to be from him, though we do not believe either
the one or the other for it. I do grant that in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
cases outward Providences may supply
the room of this Ministerial Proposal; for it is all
one as unto our Duty by what means the Scripture
is brought unto us. But upon a Supposition of
this <hi>Ministerial Proposal of the Word,</hi> which ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
includes the whole Duty of the Church in its
Testimony and Declaration of the Truth, I desire
to know whether those unto whom it is proposed
are obliged without further external Evidence to
receive it as the Word of God, to rest their Faith
in it, and submit their Consciences unto it? The
Rule seems plain, that they are obliged so to do,
<hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. We may consider this under the
distinct ways of its Proposal extraordinary, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.</p>
            <p>Upon the Preaching of any of the Prophets by
immediate Inspiration of the Holy Ghost, or on
their Declaration of any <hi>new Revelation</hi> they had
from God, by preaching or writing, suppose <hi>Isaiah</hi>
or <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> I desire to know whether or no all
Persons were bound to receive their Doctrine as
from God, to <hi>believe</hi> and submit unto the <hi>Authority</hi>
of God in the Revelation made by him, without
any <hi>external</hi> Motives or Arguments, or the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
or Authority of the Church witnessing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto?
If they were not, then were they all excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
as guiltless, who refused to believe the Message
they declared in the Name of God, and in despising
the <hi>Warnings</hi> and <hi>Instructions</hi> which they gave them.
For external Motives they used not, and the <hi>present
Church</hi> mostly condemned them and their <hi>Ministry;</hi>
as is plain, and the Case of <hi>Jeremiah.</hi> Now it
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:106952:69"/>
is impious to imagine that those to whom they
spake in the Name of God were not obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them, and it tends to the overthrow of all
Religion. If we shall say that they were obliged
to believe them, and that under the Penalty of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Displeasure, and so to receive the Revelation
made by them, or their Declaration of it, as the
<hi>Word of God;</hi> then it must contain in it the <hi>formal
Reason</hi> of believing, or the full and entire Cause.
Reason and Ground why they ought to believe
with Faith divine and supernatural. Or let
another Ground of Faith in this Case be assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Suppose the Proposal be made in the <hi>ordinary</hi>
Ministry of the Church. Hereby the Scripture is
declared unto Men to be the <hi>Word of God;</hi> they
are acquainted with it, and what God requires of
them therein, and they are charged in the Name of
God to receive and believe it. Doth any Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unto believing hence arise? It may be some
will say that immediately there is not; only they
will grant that men are bound hereon to <hi>enquire</hi> into
such <hi>Reasons</hi> and <hi>Motives,</hi> as are proposed unto them
for its Reception and Admission. I say, there is no
doubt but that Men are obliged to consider all things
of that Nature which are proposed unto them,
and not to receive it with <hi>brutish implicit Belief.</hi>
For the receiving of it is to be an Act of Mens own
Minds or Understandings, on the best Grounds and
Evidences which the Nature of the thing proposed
is capable of. But supposing Men to do their Duty
in their diligent Enquiries into the whole Matter,
I desire to know, whether by the Proposal men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
there come upon Men an Obligation to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve?

If there do not, then are all Men perfectly
innocent, who refuse to receive the Gospel in the
preaching of it, as to any respect unto <hi>that preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
which to say, is to overthrow the whole Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
of the Ministry. If they are obliged to
<hi>believe</hi> upon the preaching of it, then hath the
Word in it self those <hi>Evidences</hi> of its Divine Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
and Authority, which are a sufficient Ground
of Faith, or Reason of Believing; For what
God requires us to believe upon, hath so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways.</p>
            <p>As the Issue of this whole Discourse, it is affirmed,
that our Faith is built on and resolved into the
<hi>Scripture it self,</hi> which carries with it its own Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of being a Divine Revelation. And therefore
doth that Faith ultimately rest in the <hi>Truth and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of God alone,</hi> and not in any Human Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
such as is that of the Churh, nor in any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Arguments or Motives that are absolutely
fallible.</p>
            <p>It may be said that if the Scripture thus <hi>evidence</hi>
it self to be the Word of God, as the Sun manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it self by Light, and Fire by Heat, or as the
first Principles of Reason are evident in themselves
without further Proof or Testimony; then every
one, and all men, upon the Proposal of the Scripture
unto them, and its own bare Assertion, that it is
the Word of God, would necessarily on that Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
alone assent thereunto, and believe it so to
be. But this is not so, all Experience lyeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it; nor is there any pleadable Ground
of Reason that so it is, or that so it ought
to be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:106952:73"/>
In Answer unto this <hi>Objection</hi> I shall do these
two things.</p>
            <p>1. I shall shew what it is, what Power,
what Faculty in the Minds of Men, whereunto
this Revelation is proposed, and whereby we assent
unto the Truth of it, wherein the Mistakes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Objection proceedeth will be discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>2. I shall mention some of those things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Holy Ghost testifieth and giveth Evidence
unto the Scripture in and by it self, so as that our
Faith may be immediately resolved into the Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of God alone.</p>
            <p>1. And in the first place we may consider, that
there are <hi>three Ways</hi> whereby we <hi>assent</hi> unto any
thing that is proposed unto us as true, and receive
it as such.</p>
            <p>1. By inbred Principles of <hi>natural Light,</hi> and
the first rational Actings of our Minds. This
in <hi>Reason</hi> answers <hi>Instinct</hi> in irrational Creatures.
Hence God complains that his People did neglect
and sin against their own natural Light, and first
Dictates of Reason, whereas brute Creatures would
not forsake the Conduct of the Instinct of their
Natures, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 3. In general, the Mind is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
determined to an Assent unto the proper
Objects of these Principles; it cannot do otherwise.
It cannot but assent unto the prime Dictates of the
Light of Nature, yea those Dictates are nothing
but its Assent. Its first <hi>Apprehension</hi> of the things
which the Light of Nature embraceth, without
either express Reasonings or further Consideration,
are this Assent. Thus doth the Mind embrace in
it self the general Notions of moral Good and Evil,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:106952:74"/>
with the Difference between them, however it
practically complies notwith what they guide unto;
<hi>Jude v.</hi> 10. And so doth it assent unto many Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Reason, as that the whole is greater than
the part, without admitting any debate about
them.</p>
            <p>2. By <hi>rational Considerations</hi> of things external<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proposed unto us. Herein the Mind exerciseth
its discursive Faculty, gathering one thing out of
another, and concluding one thing from another.
And hereon is it able to assent unto what is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
unto it in <hi>various Degrees of Certainty,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto the nature and degree of the Evidence it
proceeds upon. Hence it hath a <hi>certain Knowledg</hi>
of some things; of others an <hi>Opinion</hi> or Perswasion
prevalent against the Objections to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
which it knows, and whose Force it
understands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which may be true or false.</p>
            <p>3. By <hi>Faith.</hi> This respects that Power of our
Minds, whereby we are able to assent unto any thing
as <hi>true,</hi> which we have no first Principles concerning,
no inbred Notions of, nor can from more known
Principles make unto our selves any certain ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Conclusions concerning them. This is
our Assent <hi>upon Testimony,</hi> whereon we believe
many Things, which no Sense, inbred Principles,
nor Reasonings of our own, could either give us
an Acquaintance with, or an Assurance of. And
this <hi>Assent</hi> also hath not only <hi>various Degrees,</hi>
but is also of <hi>divers Kinds,</hi> according as the
<hi>Testimony</hi> is which it ariseth from, and resteth on;
as being <hi>Humane</hi> if that be <hi>Humane,</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> if
that be so also.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:106952:74"/>
According to these distinct Faculties and Powers
of our Souls, God is pleased to reveal or make
known himself, his Mind or Will <hi>three ways</hi> unto
us. For he hath implanted no Power on our
Minds, but the principal Use and Exercise of it
are to be with respect unto himself, and our living
unto him, which is the end of them all. And a
neglect of the improvement of them unto this end,
is the highest Aggravation of Sin. It is an Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Sin, when men abuse the Creatures of
God otherwise than he hath appointed, or in not
using them to his Glory; when they take his <hi>Corn,</hi>
and <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Oil,</hi> and spend them on their Lusts,
<hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 8. It is an higher Aggravation when
men in sinning abuse and dishonour their own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
for these are the principal external Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship
of God, being made for Eternity, and
whose Preservation unto his Glory is committed
unto us in an especial manner. This the Apostle
declareth to be the peculiar Aggravation of the Sin
of Fornication and Uncleanness in any kind, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
6. 18, 19. But the Height of Impiety consists in
the Abuse of the Faculties aud Powers of the Soul,
wherewith we are endowed purposely and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
for the glorifying of God. Hence proceed
Unbelief, Prophaness, Blasphemy, Atheism, and
the like Pollutions of the Spirit of Mind. And
these are Sins of the highest Provocation. For the
Powers and Faculties of our Minds being given us
only to enable us to live unto God, the divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their principal Exercise unto other Ends,
is an Act of Enmity against him, and Affront

            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:106952:75"/>
1. He makes himself known unto us by the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Principles of our Nature,</hi> unto which he hath
communicated as a Power of apprehending, so an
indelible Sense of his Being, his Authority and his
Will, so far as our natural Dependance on him,
and moral Subjection unto him do require. For
whereas there are two things in this natural Light
and first Dictates of Reason; first, a <hi>Power of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,</hi>
Discerning, and Assenting; and secondly,
a <hi>Power of Judging</hi> and Determining upon the
things so discerned and assented unto: by the one
God makes known his Being, and Essential Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties;
by the other his Sovereign Authority over
all.</p>
            <p>As to the first, the Apostle affirms, that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19.
<hi>That which may be known of God,</hi> (his Essence, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Subsistence, his natural, necessary, essential
Properties) <hi>is manifest in them;</hi> that is, it hath a
self evidencing Power, acting it self in the Minds
of all Men indued with natural Light and
Reason.</p>
            <p>And as unto his <hi>Sovereign Authority,</hi> he doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
it in and by the <hi>Consciences of men,</hi> which
are the Judgment that they make, and cannot but
make, of themselves and their Actions, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
unto the Authority and Judgment of God,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15. And thus the Mind doth assent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Principles of God's Being and Authority,
antecedently unto any actual Exercise of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursive
Faculty of Reason, or other Testimony
whatever.</p>
            <p>2. He doth it unto our <hi>Reason in its Exercise,</hi>
by proposing such things unto its Consideration,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:106952:75"/>
as from whence it may and cannot but conclude in
an Assent unto the Truth of what God intends to
reveal unto us that way. This he doth by the
<hi>Works of Creation</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> which present
themselves unavoidably unto Reason in its Exercise,
to instruct us in the Nature, Being, and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of God.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Heavens declare the Glory of God, and
the Firmament sheweth his handy-Work. Day unto
Day uttereth Speech, and Night unto Night sheweth
Knowledge. There is no Speech nor Language where
their Voice is not heard,</hi> Psal. 19. 1, 2, 3. But yet
they do not thus declare, evidence and reveal the
Glory of God unto the first Principles and Notions
of natural Light, without the actual Exercise of
Reason. Only they do so <hi>when we consider his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
the Work of his Fingers, the Moon and the Stars
which he hath ordained,</hi> as the same Psalmist speaks
<hi>Psal.</hi> 8. 3. A rational Consideration of them, their
Greatness, Order, Beauty, and Use, is required
unto that Testimony and Evidence which God gives
in them and by them unto Himself, his glorious
Being, Power. To this purpose the Apostle dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courseth
at large concerning the <hi>Works of Creation,
Rom.</hi> 1. 20, 21, 22. as also of those of <hi>Providence,
Acts 14. 15, 16, 17. chap.</hi> 17. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.
and the rational Use we are to make of them,
<hi>verse</hi> 29. So God calls unto Men for the
Exercise of their Reason about these Things,
reproaching them with Stupidity and Brutishness
where they are wanting therein; <hi>Isa,</hi> 46. 7, 8, 9.
<hi>chap.</hi> 44. 18, 19. 20.</p>
            <p>3. God reveals himself unto our Faith, or that
Power of our Souls whereby we are able to ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:106952:76"/>
unto the Truth of what is proposed unto us upon
Testimony. And this he doth by his Word, or
the Scriptures proposed unto us in the manner and
way before expressed.</p>
            <p>He doth not reveal himself by his Word unto the
Principles of natural Light, nor unto <hi>Reason</hi> in its
Exercise. But yet these Principles, and Reason it
self, with all the Faculties of our Minds, are conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially
affected with that Revelation, and are
drawn forth into their proper Exercise by it. But
in the Gospel the Righteousness of God <hi>is revealed
from Faith to Faith,</hi> Rom. 1. 17. not to natural
Light, Sense or Reason in the first place. And it
is Faith that is the Evidence of things not seen, as
revealed in the Word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. Unto this kind
of Revelation, <hi>Thus saith the Lord,</hi> is the only
Ground and Reason of our Assent; and that Assent
is the Assent of Faith, because it is resolved into
Testimony alone.</p>
            <p>And concerning these several ways of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
or Revelation of the Knowledge of
God, it must be always observed, that there is a
<hi>perfect consonancy in the things revealed by them
all.</hi> If any thing pretends from the one what
is absolutely contradictory unto the other, or our
Senses as the means of them, it is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p>The Foundation of the whole, as of all the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of our Souls, is in the inbred Principles of
natural Light, or first necessary Dictates of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
rational Nature. This, so far as it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends,
is a <hi>Rule unto our Apprehension</hi> in all that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.
Wherefore if any pretend in the Exercise of
Reason, to conclude unto any thing concerning the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:106952:76"/>
Nature, Being, or Will of God, that is directly
<hi>contradictory</hi> unto those Principles and Dictates,
it is no Divine Revelation unto our Reason, but a
<hi>Paralogism</hi> from the defect of Reason in its Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise.
This is that which the Apostle chargeth on,
and vehemently urgeth against the <hi>Heathen Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.</hi>
Inbred Notions they had in themselves of
the Being and Eternal Power of God; and these
were so manifest in them thereby, that they could
not but own them. Hereon they set their rational
<hi>discursive Faculty</hi> at work in the Consideration of
God and his Being. But herein were they so vain
and foolish, as to draw Conclusions <hi>directly contrary</hi>
unto the first Principles of natural Light, and the
unavoidable Notions which they had of the Eternal
Being of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21, 22, 23, 24. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
upon their pretended rational Consideration
of the <hi>promiscuous Event of things</hi> in the World,
have foolishly concluded that all things had a <hi>fortui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
Beginning,</hi> and have <hi>fortuitous Events,</hi> or such
as from a Concatenation of antecedent Causes are
<hi>fatally necessarily,</hi> and are not disposed by an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
Wise, Unerring, Holy Providence. And
this also is directly <hi>contradictory</hi> unto the first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and Notions of natural Light, whereby it
openly proclaims it self not to be an Effect
of Reason in its due Exercise, but a meer De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion.</p>
            <p>So if any pretend unto <hi>Revelations by Faith,</hi>
which are contradictory unto the first Principles of
natural Light, or Reason in its proper Exercise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
its proper Objects, it is a Delusion. On
this Ground the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrine of Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
is justly rejected; for it proposeth that as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:106952:77"/>
by Faith, which is expresly contradictory
unto our Sense and Reason in their proper Exercise
about their proper Objects. And a supposition of
the possibility of any such thing, would make the
ways whereby God reveals and makes known
himself, to cross and enterfere one with another;
which would leave us no certainty in any thing
Divine or Humane.</p>
            <p>But yet as these means of Divine Revelation do
<hi>harmonize</hi> and perfectly agree one with the other;
so they are not <hi>objectively equal,</hi> or equally exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
nor are they coordinate, but subordinate unto
one another. Wherefore there are many things
discernable by Reason in its Exercise, which do not
appear unto the first Principles of natural Light.
So the Sober <hi>Philosophers</hi> of old attained unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
true and great Conceptions of God, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
of his Nature, above what they arrived
unto, who either did not or could not cultivate and
improve the Principles of natural Light in the same
manner as they did. It is therefore Folly to pretend
that things so made known of God are not infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
true and certain, because they are not obvious
unto the first Conceptions of natural Light, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the due Exercise of Reason, provided they are
not contradictory thereunto. And there are many
Things revealed unto Faith that are above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Comprehension of Reason, in the best and
utmost of its most proper Exercise. Such are all the
principal <hi>Mysteries</hi> of <hi>Christian Religion.</hi> And it is the
height of Folly to reject them, as some do, because
they are not discernable and comprehensible by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
seeing they are not contradictory thereunto.
Wherefore these Ways of Gods Revelation of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:106952:77"/>
are not equally extensive, or commensurate,
but are so subordinate one unto another, that what
is wanting unto the one is supplied by the other,
unto the Accomplishment of the whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
end of Divine Revelation; and the Truth of
God is the same in them all.</p>
            <p>The Revelation which God makes of Himself
in the <hi>first way,</hi> by the inbred Principles of natural
Light, doth sufficiently and infallibly evidence it
self to be from Him; it doth it in, unto, and by
those Principles themselves. This Revelation of
God is infallible, the Assent unto it is infallible,
which the infallible Evidence it gives of it self
makes to be so. We dispute not now what a few
<hi>Atheistical Scepticks</hi> pretend unto, whose Folly hath
been sufficiently detected by others. All the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
that is in the World consents in this, that
the <hi>Light of the Knowledge of God,</hi> in and by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
Principles of our Minds and Consciences,
doth sufficiently, uncontroulably, and infallibly
manifest it self to be from him, and that the Mind
neither is, nor can be possibly imposed on in its
Apprehensions of that Nature. And if the first
Dictates of Reason concerning God do not <hi>evidence
themselves</hi> to be from God, they are neither of any
Use nor Force; for they are not capable of being
confirmed by external Arguments; and what is
written about them is to shew their Force and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
not to give them any. Wherefore this
first Way of Gods Revelation of himself unto us is
infallible, and infallibly evidenceth it self in
our Minds according to the Capacity of our
Natures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:106952:78"/>
2. The Revelation that God maketh of Himself
by the <hi>Works of Creation and Providence, unto our
Reason in Exercise,</hi> or the Faculties of our Souls
as <hi>discursive,</hi> concluding rationally one thing from
another, doth sufficiently, yea infallibly evidence
and demonstrate it self to be from him, so that it
is impossible we should be deceived therein. It doth
not do so unto the <hi>inbred Principles</hi> of natural Light,
unless they are engaged in a <hi>rational exercise</hi> about
the means of the Revelation made; that is, we must
rationally consider the Works of God, both of
Creation and Providence, or we cannot learn by
them what God intends to reveal of himself; and
in our doing so we cannot be deceived. <hi>For the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
things of God from the Creation of the World
are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are
made, even his eternal Power and Godhead,</hi> Rom. 1. 20.
They are <hi>clearly seen,</hi> and therefore may be <hi>perfectly
understood</hi> as to what they teach of God without
any possibility of Mistake. And wherever men do
not receive the Revelation intended in the Way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
that is, do not certainly conclude that
what God teaches by his Works of Creation and
Providence, namely, his <hi>Eternal Power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi>
with the essential Properties thereof, Infinite
Wisdom, Goodness, Righteousness, and the like,
is certainly and infallibly so, believing it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly;
it is not from any defect in the Revelation,
or its <hi>self-evidencing</hi> Efficacy, but only from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved,
vitious Habits of their Minds, their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
against God, and Dislike of him. And so the
Apostle saith, that they who rejected or improved
not the Revelation of God, did it, <hi>because they did
not like to retain God in their Knowledg,</hi> Rom. 1. 28.

For which Cause God did so severely revenge their
natural Unbelief, as is there expressed. See <hi>Isa.</hi>
46. 8. <hi>chap</hi> 44. 15, 19, 20. That which I princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
insist on from hence is, that the Revelation
which God makes of himself by the Works of
Creation and Providence, doth not evidence it self
unto the first Principles of natural Light, so as
that an Assent should be given thereunto without
the Actual Exercise of Reason, or the discursive
Faculty of our Minds about them; but thereunto
it doth infallibly evidence it self. So may the
Scripture have and hath a <hi>self evidencing Efficacy,</hi>
though this appear not unto the Light of first natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Principles, no nor to bare Reason in its Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise.
For,</p>
            <p>3. Unto our <hi>Faith</hi> God reveals himself by the
<hi>Scripture,</hi> or his Word which he hath <hi>magnified
above all his Name, Psal.</hi> 138. 2. that is, implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on it more Characters of Himself, and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
than on any other Way whereby he reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
or maketh himself known unto us. And this
Revelation of God by his Word, we confess, is
not sufficient nor suited to <hi>evidence it self</hi> unto the
<hi>Light of Nature,</hi> or the first Principles of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
so that by bare Proposal of it to be
from God, we should by virtue of them immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
assent unto it, as men assent unto self-evident
natural Principles, as that the <hi>part is lesser than the
whole,</hi> or the like. Nor doth it evidence it self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our <hi>Reason</hi> in its meer natural Exercise, as
that by virtue thereof we can demonstratively
conclude that it is from God, and that what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
therein is certainly and infallibly true. It
hath indeed such external Evidences accompanying
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:106952:82"/>
it, as makes a great Impression on Reason it self.
But the Power of our Souls whereunto it is proposed
is that whereby we can give an Assent unto the
Truth upon the Testimony of the Proposer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we have no other Evidence. And this is the
principal and most noble Faculty and Power of our
Natures. There is an Instinct in brute Creatures,
that hath some Resemblance unto our inbred natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Principles; and they will act that Instinct, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by Experience, into a great likeness of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in its Exercise, although it be not so. But as
unto the <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Faculty</hi> of giving an Assent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Things on Witness or Testimony, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the Nature of irrational Creatures that
hath the least Shadow of it or Likeness unto it.
And if our Souls did want but this one Faculty
of <hi>assenting unto Truth upon Testimony,</hi> all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
would not be sufficient to conduct us through
the affairs of this natural Life. This therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>most noble Faculty</hi> of our Minds, is that
whereunto the highest Way of Divine Revelation is
proposed.</p>
            <p>4. That our Minds in this especial Case to make
our Assent to be according unto the Mind of God,
and such as is required of us in a way of Duty, are
to be <hi>prepared and assisted</hi> by the Holy Ghost, we
have declared and proved before. On this Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Revelation which God makes of himself
by his Word, doth no less evidence it self unto our
Minds <hi>in the Exercise of Faith</hi> to be from him, or
gives no less infallible Evidence as a Ground and
Reason why we should believe it to be from him,
than his Revelation of himself by the Works
of Creation and Providence doth manifest it self
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:106952:82"/>
unto our Minds in the Exercise of Reason to be
from him, nor with less Assurance that what we
assent unto in and by the <hi>Dictates of natural Light.</hi>
And when God revealeth himself, that is, his <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Power and Godhead,</hi> by the things that are
made, the Works of Creation, <hi>the Heavens decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Glory, and the Firmament shewing his handy-work;</hi>
the Reason of Men stirred up and brought
into Exercise thereby, doth infallibly conclude up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Evidence that is in that Revelation, that
there is a God, and he eternally Powerful and Wise,
without any <hi>further Arguments</hi> to prove the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
to be true. So when God by his Word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals
himself unto the Minds of Men, thereby exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and bringing forth Faith into Exercise, or the
Power of the Soul to assent unto Truth upon Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
that <hi>Revelation</hi> doth no less <hi>infallibly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
it self to be Divine or from God, without
any external Arguments to prove it so to be. If
I shall say unto a man that the Sun is risen and shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
on the Earth; if he question or deny it, and
ask how I will prove it; it is a sufficient Answer to
say, that it <hi>manifesteth it self</hi> in and by its own
Light: and if he add, that this is no proof to
him for he doth not discern it; suppose that to be
so, it is a satisfactory Answer to tell him that he
is blind; and if he be not so, that it is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to argue with him who <hi>contradicts his own
Sense,</hi> for he leaves no <hi>Rule</hi> whereby what is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
may be tried or judged on. And if I tell a
Man that the Heavens declare the Glory of God,
and the Firmament sheweth his Handy-Work,
or that the Invisible Things of God from the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the World are clearly seen, being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:106952:83"/>
by the Things that are made; and he shall
demand how I prove it; it is a sufficient Answer to
say, that these things in and by themselves do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
unto the <hi>Reason of every man in its due and
proper Exercise,</hi> that there is an Eternal, infinitely
Wise and Powerful Being, by whom they were
caused, produced and made; so as that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
knoweth how to use and exercise his reasonable
Faculty in the Consideration of them, their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
Order, Nature and Use, must necessarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that so it is. If he shall say, that it doth not
so appear unto him that the Being of God is so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
by them; It is a sufficient Reply, in case he
be so indeed, to say he is <hi>Phrenetick,</hi> and hath not
the Use of his <hi>Reason;</hi> and if he be not so, that he
argues in express Contradiction unto his own <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
as may be demonstrated. This the Heathen

lib. 2. And if I declare unto any one, that the
<hi>Scripture is the Word of God,</hi> a Divine Revelation,
and that it doth evidence and manifest it self so to be.
If he shall say, that he hath the Use and Exercise of
his Sense and Reason as well as others, and yet it
doth not appear unto him so to be; it is as unto
the present Enquiry, a sufficient Reply for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of the Authority of the Scriptures (though
other means may be used for his Conviction) to
say, that <hi>all men have not Faith;</hi> by which alone
the Evidence of the Divine Authority of the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:106952:83"/>
Scriptures is discoverable; in the Light whereof
alone we can read those Characters of its Divine
<hi>Extract,</hi> which are impressed on it, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
unto it.</p>
            <p>If it be not so, seeing it is a <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi>
and it is our Duty to believe it so to be, it must
be either because our Faith is not fitted, suited, nor
able to receive such an Evidence, suppose God
would give it unto the <hi>Revelation</hi> of himself by his
Word, as he hath done unto those by the Light of
Nature and Works of Providence; or because God
would not or could not give such an Evidence unto
his Word as might manifest it self so to be. And
neither of these can be affirmed without an
high Reflection on the Wisdom and Goodness of
God.</p>
            <p>That our Faith is capable of giving such an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
is evident from hence, because God works it
in us, and bestows it upon us for this very End.
And God requireth of us that we should infallibly
believe what he proposeth unto us, at least when
we have infallible evidence that it is from him.
And as he appointeth Faith unto this end, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth
of its Exercise, so he doth both judg and
condemn them who fail therein, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 20.
<hi>Isa. 7. 9. Mark</hi> 16. 16. Yea our Faith is capable
of giving an Assent, though of another kind,
more firm and accompanied with more Assurance,
than any is given by Reason in the best of its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions.
And the Reason is, because the Power
of the Mind to give Assent upon Testimony, which
is its most noble Faculty, is elevated and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Divine Supernatural Work of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:106952:84"/>
To say that God either could not or would not
give such a Power unto the Revelation of himself by
his Word, as to evidence it self to be so, is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
prejudicial unto his Honour and Glory, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the everlasting Welfare of the Souls of Men is
incomparably more concerned therein than in the
other ways mentioned. And what Reason could
be assigned why he should implant a less Evidence
of his Divine Authority on this than on them, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he designed far greater and more glorious Ends
in this than in them. If any one shall say the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, because <hi>this kind</hi> of Divine Revelation is not
<hi>capable</hi> of receiving such <hi>Evidences;</hi> it must be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
because there cannot be <hi>evident Characters</hi>
of Divine Authority, Goodness, Wisdom, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
implanted on it or mixed with it; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
an <hi>Efficacy</hi> to manifest them cannot be
communicated unto it. That both these are
otherwise, shall be demonstrated in the last
Part of this Discourse, which I shall now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It hath been already declared, that it is the</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Veracity of God, revealing themselves in
the Scripture and by it, that is the formal Reason of
our Faith, or Supernatural Assent unto it as it is the
Word of God.</p>
            <p>It remains only that we enquire in the Second
Place into the Way and Means whereby they evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
themselves unto us, and the Scripture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to be the Word of God, so as that we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
and infallibly believe it so to be. Now
because Faith, as we have shewed, is an <hi>Assent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Testimony,</hi> and consequently Divine Faith is an
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:106952:84"/>
Assent upon Divine Testimony. There must be
some Testimony or Witness in this case whereon
Faith doth rest. And this we say is the Testimony
of the Holy Ghost, the Author of the Scriptures,
given unto them in them and by them. And this
Work or Testimony of the Spirit may be reduced
unto two Heads, which may be distinctly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Impressions</hi> or <hi>Characters</hi> which are <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively</hi>
left in the Scripture and upon it, by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit its Author, of all the Divine Excellencies
or Properties of the Divine Nature, are the first Means
evidencing that Testimony of the Spirit which our
Faith rests upon; or they do give the <hi>first Evidence</hi>
of its Divine Original and Authority, whereon we
do believe it. The Way whereby we learn the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Power and Deity of God from the Works of
Creation, is no otherwise but by those Marks, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
and Impressions of his Divine Power, Wisdom
and Goodness that are upon them. For from
the Consideration of their Subsistence, Greatness,
Order, and Use, Reason doth necessarily conclude
an Infinite Subsisting Being, of whose Power and
Wisdom these things are the manifest Effects. These
are clearly seen and understood by the Things that
are made; we need no other Arguments to prove
that <hi>God made the World,</hi> but it self. It carrieth
in it and upon it the infallible Tokens of its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.
See to this purpose the blessed Meditation of
the Psalmist, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. throughout. Now there
are greater and more evident Impressions of Divine
Excellencies left on the written Word from the
Infinite Wisdom of the Author of it, than any that
are communicated unto the Works of God, of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:106952:85"/>
what sort soever. Hence <hi>David</hi> comparing the
<hi>Works</hi> and the <hi>Word</hi> of God, as to their instructive
Efficacy in declaring God and his Glory, although
he ascribe much unto the <hi>Works of Creation,</hi> yet
doth he prefer the Word incomparably before them,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9. and <hi>Psal. 146. ver.</hi> 8, 9. &amp;c.
and 19. 20. And these do manifest the Word un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Faith to be his more clearly, than the other
do the Works to be his, unto our Reason. As
yet I do not know that it is denied by any, or the
contrary asserted, namely, that God, as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Author of the Scripture, hath left in the very
Word it self Evident Tokens and Impressions of his
Wisdom, Prescience, Omniscience, Power, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Holiness, Truth, and other Divine, Infinite
Excellencies, sufficiently evidenced unto the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
Minds of Believers. Some I confess speak
suspitiously herein; but until they will directly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
it, I shall not need further to confirm it, than I
have done long since in another Treatise. And I
leave it to be considered, whether (morally speaking)
it be possible that God should immediately by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from the eternal Counsels of his Will reveal
Himself, his Mind, the Thoughts and Purposes of
his Heart, which had been hidden in Himself from
Eternity, on purpose that we should believe them,
and yeild Obedience unto him according to the
Declaration of Himself so made, and yet not give
with it, or leave upon it any <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Token, evidencing him to be the Author of
that Revelation. Men who are not ashamed of
their Christianity, will not be so to profess and
seal that Profession with their Blood, and to rest
their eternal Concernments on that Security herein
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:106952:85"/>
which they have attained, namely, that there is
that Manifestation made of the glorious Properties
of God in and by the <hi>Scripture,</hi> as it is a Divine
Revelation which incomparably excells in Evidence
all that their Reason receives concerning his Power
from the Works of Creation.</p>
            <p>This is that whereon we believe the Scripture to
be the Word of God with <hi>Faith Divine and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural,</hi>
if we believe it so at all. There is in it
self that Evidence of its <hi>Divine Original</hi> from the
Characters of Divine Excellencies left upon it by
its Author the Holy Ghost, as Faith quietly rests in,
and is resolved into. And this Evidence is manifest
unto the meanest and most unlearned no less than
unto the wisest <hi>Philosophers.</hi> And the Truth is,
if <hi>Rational Arguments</hi> and <hi>External Motives</hi> were
the sole Ground of receiving the Scripture to be
the Word of God, it could not be, but that learned
Men and <hi>Philosophers</hi> would have always been the
forwardest and most ready to admit it, and most
firmly to adhere unto it, and its Profession. For
whereas all such Arguments do prevail on the Minds
of Men according as they are able aright to discern
their Force and judge of them, learned <hi>Philosophers</hi>
would have had the Advantage incomparably above
others. And so some have of late affirmed, that it
was the <hi>wise, rational, and learned Men,</hi> who at
first most readily received the Gospel; an Assertion
which nothing but gross Ignorance of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it self, and all the Writings concerning the
<hi>Original of Christianity,</hi> whether of Christians or
Heathens, could give the least Countenance unto;
see 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 23, 26. From hence is the Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ure
so often compared unto Light, called <hi>Light, a Light
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:106952:86"/>
shining in a dark place,</hi> which will evidence it self
unto all who are not blind, or do wilfully shut their
Eyes, or have their Eyes blinded by the God of this
World, lest the Light of the glorious Gospel of
Christ, who is the Image of God, should shine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them; which Consideration I have handled at
large elsewhere.</p>
            <p>2. The Spirit of God evidenceth the <hi>Divine Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
and Authority</hi> of the Scripture, by the Power
and Authority which he puts forth in it and by it
over the Minds and Consciences of Men, with its
Operation of Divine Effects thereon. This the
Apostle expresly affirms to be the Reason and Cause
of Faith, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 24, 25. If all prophesy, and
there comes in one that believeth not, or one unlearned,
he is convinced of all, he is judged of all. And thus
are the Secrets of his Heart made manifest, and so
falling down on his Face, he will worship God, and
report that God is in you of a Truth.</hi> The Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
and <hi>Confession of God to be in them or among
them,</hi> is a Profession of Faith in the Word admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
by them. Such Persons assent unto its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority, or believe it to be the Word of God.
And on what Evidence or Ground of Credibility
they did so, is expresly declared. It was not upon
the Force of any external Arguments produced and
pleaded unto that Purpose. It was not upon the
<hi>Testimony of this or that, or any Church</hi> whatever;
nor was it upon a <hi>Conviction of any Miracles</hi> which
they saw wrought in its Confirmation. Yea the
Ground of the Faith and Confession declared, is
opposed unto the Efficacy and Use of the <hi>Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Gift of Tongues,</hi> v. 23, 24. Wherefore the
only Evidence whereon they received the Word,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:106952:86"/>
and acknowledged it to be of God, was that <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Power and Efficacy,</hi> whereof they found and
felt the Experience in themselves. <hi>He is convinced
of all, judged of all, and thus are the Secrets of
his Heart made manifest,</hi> whereon he falls down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it with an Acknowledgment of its Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
finding the VVord to come upon his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
with an irresistible Power of Conviction
and Judgment thereon [<hi>He is convinced of all,
judged of all,</hi>] He cannot but grant that there is
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a Divine Efficacy in it, or accompanying of
it. Especially his Mind is influenced by this, that
the <hi>Secrets of his Heart are made manifest by it.</hi> For
all Men must acknowledge this to be an Effect of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Power; seeing God alone is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>he who searcheth, knoweth, and judgeth the Heart.</hi>
And if the VVoman of <hi>Samaria</hi> believed that Jesus
was the Christ, because he <hi>told her all things that
ever she did,</hi> John 4. 29. there is Reason to believe
that VVord to be from God, which makes manifest
even the Secrets of our Hearts. And although I
do conceive that by the <hi>Word of God,</hi> Heb. 4. 12.
the <hi>Living and Eternal Word</hi> is principally intended,
yet the Power and Efficacy there ascribed to him
is that which he puts forth by the VVord of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.
And so that VVord also, in its Place and
use, <hi>pierceth to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit,
of the Joynts and Marrew, and is a Discerner, or passeth
a critical Judgment on the Thoughts and Intents of the
Heart, or makes manifest the Secrets of mens Hearts,</hi>
as it is here expressed. Hereby then doth the Holy
Ghost so evidence the Divine Authority of the
<hi>Word,</hi> namely, by that Divine Power which it
hath upon our Souls and Consciences, that we do
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:106952:87"/>
assuredly acquiesce in it to be from God. So the
<hi>Thessalonians</hi> are commended that they <hi>received
the Word not as the Word of Men, but as it is in truth
the Word of God, which effectually works in them
that believe,</hi> 1 Thess. 2. 15. It distinguisheth it
self from the <hi>Word of Men,</hi> and evidences it self
to be indeed the <hi>Word of God</hi> by its effectual Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in them that believe. And he who hath this
Testimony in himself hath a higher and more firm
Assurance of the Truth than what can be attained
by the Force of external Arguments, or the Credit of
Humane Testimony. VVherefore I say in general,
that the Holy Spirit giveth Testimony unto, and
evinceth the Divine Authority of the <hi>Word,</hi> by its
Powerful Operations and Divine Effects on the
Souls of them that do believe. So that although it
be <hi>weakness</hi> and <hi>foolishness unto others,</hi> yet as
is Christ himself unto them that are called,
it is the Power of God, and the VVisdom of
God.</p>
            <p>And I must say, that although a Man be furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>external Arguments</hi> of all Sorts concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Divine Original and Authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
although he esteem his <hi>Motives of Credibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
to be effectually perswasive, and have the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of any or all the Churches in the VVorld to
confirm his Perswasion, yet if he have no Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in himself of its Divine Power, Authority and
Efficacy, he neither doth nor can believe it to be
the Word of God in a due manner, with
Faith Divine and Supernatural. But he that
hath this Experience hath that Testimony
in himself which will never fail.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:106952:87"/>
This will be the more manifest, if we consider
some few of those many Instances, wherein it exerts
its Power, or the Effects which are produced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
            <p>The Principal Divine Effect of the Word of God
is in the <hi>Conversion of the Souls of Sinners unto God.</hi>
The Greatness and Glory of this Work we have
elsewhere declared at large. And all those who are
acquainted with it as it is declared in the Scripture,
and have any Experience of it in their own Hearts,
do constantly give it as an Instance of the exceeding
<hi>Greatness of the Power of God.</hi> It may be they speak
not improperly, who prefer the Work of the New
Creation before the Work of the Old, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Evidences of Almighty Power contained in it,
as some of the Ancients do. Now of this Great
and Glorious Effect the Word is the only Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Cause, whereby the <hi>Divine Power</hi> operates
and is expressive of it self. For we are <hi>born again,
born of God,</hi> not of Corruptible Seed, but of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible</hi>
by the Word of God, which <hi>abideth for
ever,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 21. For of <hi>his own Will</hi> doth God
<hi>beget us with the Word of Truth,</hi> Jam. 1. 18. The
Word is the Seed of the New Creature in us, that
whereby our whole Natures, our Souls and all
their Faculties are changed and renewed into the
Image and Likeness of God. And by the same
Word is this new Nature kept and preserved, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. 2. and the whole Soul carried on unto the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of God. It is unto Believers an <hi>Ingrafted
Word,</hi> which is able to save their Souls; <hi>James</hi> 1.
21. <hi>The Word of God's Grace, which is able to build
us up, and give us an Inheritance among them that are
sanctified, Acts</hi> 20. 32. And that because it is the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:106952:88"/>
               <hi>Power of God unto Salvation unto them that do believe,</hi>
Rom. 1. 16. All the Power which God puts forth
and exerts in the Communication of that Grace
and Mercy unto Believers, whereby they are gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
carried on and prepared unto Salvation, he
doth it by the Word. Therein, in an especial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
is the Divine Authority of the Word eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the Divine Power and Efficacy given unto
it by the Holy Ghost. The VVork which is effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by it in the <hi>Regeneration, Conversion,</hi> and <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi>
of the Souls of Believers, doth evidence it
infallibly unto their Consciences, that it is not the
VVord of Man, but of God. It will be said, this
Testimony is private in the Minds only of them on
whom this VVork is wrought. And therefore do
I press it no further; but he that <hi>believeth hath the
Witness in himself,</hi> 1 John 5. 10. Let it be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that all who are really converted unto God by
the Power of the VVord, have that infallible Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Testimony of its Divine Original, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and Power in their own Souls and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
that they thereon believe it with Faith Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and Supernatural, in Conjunction with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Evidences before mentioned, as Parts of the
same Divine Testimony, and it is all I aim at
herein.</p>
            <p>But yet although this Testimony be privately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
(for in it self it is not so, but common unto
all Believers) yet is it <hi>ministerially</hi> pleadable in the
Church, as a Principal Motive unto Believing.
A Declaration of the Divine Power which some
have found by Experience in the VVord, is an
Ordinance of God to convince others, and to bring
them unto the Faith. Yea of all the external Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:106952:88"/>
that are or may be pleaded to justify the Divine
Authority of the Scripture, there is none more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
nor cogent, than this of its mighty Efficacy in
all Ages on the Souls of Men, to change, convert,
and renew them into the Image and Likeness
of God, which hath been Visible and Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest.</p>
            <p>Moreover there are yet other particular Effects of
the Divine Power of the Word on the Minds and
Consciences of Men, belonging unto this general
Work, either preceding or following of it,
which are clearly sensible and enlarge the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
As,</p>
            <p>1. The Work of <hi>Conviction of Sin</hi> on those
who expected it not, who desired it not, and who
would avoid it if by any means possible they could.
The VVorld is filled with Instances of this Nature;
whilst Men have been full of love to their Sins, at
Peace in them, enjoying Benefit and Advantage by
them, the VVord coming upon them in its Power,
hath awed, disquieted, and terrified them, taken
away their Peace, destroyed their Hopes, and
made them, as it were whether they would or no,
that is, contrary to their Desires, Inclinations and
carnal Affections, to conclude that if they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
not with what is proposed unto them in that
Word, which before they took no notice of, nor
had any regard unto, they must be presently or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
miserable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conscience</hi> is the Territory or Dominion of God
in Man, which he hath so reserved unto himself,
that no Human Power can possibly enter into it, or
dispose of it in any wise. But in this VVork of
<hi>Conviction of Sin,</hi> the VVord of God, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:106952:89"/>
entreth into the Conscience of the Sinner,
takes possession of it, disposeth it unto Peace or
Trouble by its Laws or Rules, and no otherwise.
VVhere it gives Disquietments, all the VVorld
cannot give it Peace; and where it speaks Peace
there is none can give it Trouble. VVere not this
the <hi>Word of God,</hi> how should it come thus to speak
in his Name, and to act his Authority in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of Men as it doth? when once it begins
this VVork, Conscience immediately owns a <hi>new
Rule,</hi> a <hi>new<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Law,</hi> a <hi>new Government,</hi> in order to
the Judgment of God upon it and all its Actions.
And it is contrary to the Nature of Conscience to
take this upon it self, nor would it do so, but that it
sensibly finds God speaking and acting in it, and by
it; see 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 25, 26. An Invasion may be made
on the <hi>outward Duties</hi> that Conscience disposeth
unto; but none can be so upon its <hi>internal Actings.</hi>
No Power under Heaven can cause Conscience to
think, act, or judge otherwise than it doth by its
immediate Respect unto God. For it is the Minds
<hi>self-judging</hi> with respect unto God; and what is
not so, is no Act of Conscience. VVherefore
to force an Act of Conscience implies a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
However it may be defiled, bribed, sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and at length utterly debauched; admit of a
Superiour Power, a Power above or over it self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
God it cannot.</p>
            <p>I know Conscience may be prepossessed with
<hi>Prejudices;</hi> and by Education, with the Insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Traditions, take on it self the Power of False,
Corrupt, Superstitious <hi>Principles</hi> and Errors, as
Means of Conveying unto it a Sense of Divine
Authority; So is it with the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>humetans,</hi> and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:106952:89"/>
other false Worshippers in the World. But the
Power of those <hi>Divine Convictions,</hi> whereof we
treat, is manifestly different from such prejudicate
Opinions. For where these are not imposed on
Men by <hi>Artifices</hi> and <hi>Delusions</hi> easily discoverable,
they prepossess their Minds and Inclinations by
Traditions, antecedently unto any right Judgment
they can make of themselves or other things; and
they are generally wrapt up and condited in their
secular Interests. The <hi>Convictions</hi> we treat of come
from without, upon the Minds of Men, and that
with a sensible Power, prevailing over all their
previous Thoughts and Inclinations. Those first
affect, deceive and delude the <hi>notional Part</hi> of the
Soul, whereby Conscience is insensibly influenced
and diverted into improper Respects, and is decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
as to its judging of the Voice of God; these
immediately principle the Practical Understanding
and self-judging Power of the Soul. Wherefore
such Opinions and Perswasions are gradually insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated
into the Mind, and are admitted insensibly
without Opposition or Reluctancy, being never
accompanied at their first Admission with any
secular Disadvantage. But these Divine Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by the Word befall Men, some when they think
of nothing less, and desire nothing less; some
when they design other Things, as the Pleasing
of their Ears, or the Entertainment of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
and some that go on purpose to deride and
scoff at what should be spoken unto them from it.
It might also be added unto the same purpose, how
confirmed some have been in their carnal Peace and
Security, by Love of Sin, with innumerable inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
Prejudices; what Losses and Ruine to their
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:106952:90"/>
outward Concernments many have fallen into by
admitting of their Convictions; what Force, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
and Artifices have been used to defeat them,
what Contribution of Aid and Assistance hath there
been from Satan unto this purpose; and yet against
all hath the Divine Power of the Word absolutely
prevailed, and accomplished its whole designed
Effect. See 2 <hi>Cor. 10. 4, 5. Jerem.</hi> 23. 29.
<hi>Zach.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
            <p>2. It doth it by the Light that is in it, and that
Spiritual Illuminating Efficacy wherewith it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied.
Hence it is called a <hi>Light shining in a
dark Place, 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 19. That Light whereby God
<hi>shines into the Hearts</hi> and Minds of Men, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.
4, 6. Without the Scripture all the World is in
Darkness. <hi>Darkness covers the Earth, and thick
Darkness the People,</hi> Isa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 60. 2. It is the Kingdom of
Satan filled with Darkness and Confusion. Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Idolatry, lying Vanities, wherein Men know not at
all what they do, nor whither they go, fill the whole
World; even as it is at this Day. And the Minds
of Men are naturally in Darkness; there is a Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
upon them that they cannot see nor discern
Spiritual Things, no not when they are externally
proposed unto them, as I have at large evinced
elsewhere. And no Man can give a greater Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that it is so, than he who denies it so to be.
With Respect unto both these Kinds of Darkness
the Scripture is a <hi>Light,</hi> and accompanied with a
Spiritual Illuminating Efficacy, thereby evidencing
it self to be a Divine Revelation. For what but
<hi>Divine Truth</hi> could recall the Minds of Men from
all their wandrings in Error, Superstition, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Effects of Darkness, which of themselves they
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:106952:90"/>
love more than Truth? All Things being filled
with Vanity, Error, Confusion, Misapprehensions
about God and our selves, our Duty and End, our
Misery and Blessedness; the Scripture, where it is
communicated by the Providence of God, comes
in as a <hi>Light into a Dark Place,</hi> discovering all
Things clearly and steadily, that concern either God
or our selves, our present or future Condition;
causing all the Ghosts, and false Images of Things
which Men had framed and fancied unto themselves
in the Dark, to vanish and disappear. <hi>Digitus Dei!</hi>
this is none other but the Power of God. But
principally it evidenceth this its Divine Efficacy, by
that <hi>Spiritual Saving Light,</hi> which it conveighs
into and implants on the Minds of Believers. Hence
there is none of them who have gained any Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
by the Observation of God's Dealings with
them, but shall, although they know not the Ways
and Methods of the Spirits Operations by the Word,
yea can say with the Man unto whom the Lord <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
restored his Sight, <hi>One thing I know, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
I was born blind, now I see.</hi> This Power of the
Word, as the Instrument of the Spirit of God for
the Communication of Saving Light and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
unto the Minds of Men, the Apostle declares,
2 <hi>Cor. 3. 18. chap.</hi> 4. 4, 6. By the Efficacy of
this Power doth he evidence the Scripture to be the
Word of God. Those who believe, find by it a
Glorious Supernatural Light introduced into their
Minds, whereby they who before saw nothing in a
distinct affecting manner in Spirituals, do now
clearly discern the Truth, the Glory, the Beauty,
and Excellency of Heavenly Mysteries, and have
their Minds transformed into their Image and Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Lineness.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:106952:91"/>
And there is no Person who hath the
Witness in himself of the kindling of this Heavenly
Light in his Mind by the Word, but hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the Evidence in himself of its Divine Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
            <p>3. It doth in like manner evidence its Divine
Authority by the <hi>Awe,</hi> which it puts on the Minds
of the <hi>Generality of Mankind</hi> unto whom it is made
known, that they dare not absolutely reject it.
Multitudes there are unto whom the Word is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
who <hi>hate</hi> all its Precepts, <hi>despise</hi> all its Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<hi>abhor</hi> all its Threatnings, like nothing, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of nothing of what it declares or proposes, and
yet dare not absolutely refuse or reject it. They
deal with it as they do with God Himself, whom
they hate also, according to the Revelation which
he hath made of Himself in his Word. They wish
he were not, sometimes they hope he is not,
would be glad to be free of his Rule, but yet dare
not, cannot absolutely deny and disown Him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of that Testimony for Himself, which he
keeps alive in them whether they will or no. The
same is the Frame of their Hearts and Minds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Scripture, and that for no other Reason
but because it is the Word of God, and manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it selfsso to be. They hate it, wish it were not,
hope it is not true, but are not by any Means able
to shake off a Disquiet in the Sense of its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority. This Testimony it hath fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Hearts of Multitudes of its Enemies;
<hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 5.</p>
            <p>4. It evidences its Divine Power in <hi>administring
strong Consolations</hi> in the deepest and most unrelieva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Distresses. Some such there are, and such many
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:106952:91"/>
Men fall into, wherein all Means and Hopes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
may be utterly removed and taken away. So
is it when the Miseries of Men are not known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any that will so much as pity them, or wish
them Relief; or if they have been known, and
there hath been an Eye to pity them, yet there hath
been no Hand to help them. Such hath been the
Condition of innumerable Souls, as on other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
so in particular under the power of <hi>Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;</hi>
when they have been shut up in filthy and
<hi>nasty Dungeons,</hi> not to be brought out but unto
Death by the most <hi>exquisite Tortures</hi> that the Malice
of Hell could invent, or the bloody Cruelty of Man
inflict. Yet in these and the like Distresses doth
the <hi>Word of God</hi> by its Divine <hi>Power</hi> and Efficacy
break through all interposing Difficulties, all dark
and discouraging Circumstances, supporting, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing,
and comforting such poor distressed Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
yea commonly filling them under overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Calamities <hi>with Joy unspeakable, and full of
Glory.</hi> Though they are in Bonds, yet is the
Word of God not bound; neither can all the <hi>Power</hi>
of Hell, nor all the Diligence or Fury of Men keep
out the Word from entring into Prisons, Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Flames, and to administer strong Consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
against all Fears, Pains, Wants, Dangers,
Deaths, or whatever we may in this mortal Life be
exposed unto. And sundry other Instances of the
like Nature might be pleaded, wherein the Word
gives <hi>evident Demonstrations</hi> unto the Minds and
Consciences of Men of its own Divine Power and
Authority; which is the second Way whereby
the Holy Ghost its Author gives Testimony unto its
Original.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:106952:92"/>
But it is not meerly the <hi>Grounds and Reasons</hi>
whereon we believe the Scripture to be the Word of
God, which we designed to declare. The whole
Work of the Holy Spirit enabling us to believe them
so to be was proposed unto Consideration. And
beyond what we have insisted on, there is yet a
further peculiar Work of his, whereby he effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ascertains our minds of the Scriptures being
the Word of God, whereby we are ultimately
established in the Faith thereof. And I cannot but
both admire and bewail that this should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
by any that would be esteemed Christians.
Wherefore if there be any Necessity thereof, I
shall take Occasion in the Second Part of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
further to confirm this Part of the Truth thus
far debated, namely, <hi>that God by his Holy Spirit
doth secretly and effectually perswade and satisfy the
Minds and Souls of Believers in the Divine Truth and
Authority of the Scriptures,</hi> whereby he infallibly
secures their Faith against all Objections and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
whatsoever; so that they can safely and
comfortably dispose of their Souls in all their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments,
with respect unto this Life and Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
according unto the undeceivable Truth and Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of it. But I shall no further insist on these
Things at present.</p>
            <p>Three Things do offer themselves unto Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from what hath been discoursed.</p>
            <p>1. What is the Ground and Reason why the
meanest and most unlearned Sort of Believers do as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
unto this Truth, <hi>that the Scriptures are the
Word of God,</hi> with no less Firmness, Certainty,
and <hi>Assurance</hi> of Mind, than do the wisest and most
Learned of them. Yea ofttimes the Faith of the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:106952:92"/>
former Sort herein is of the best Growth, and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Consistency against Oppositions and Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Now no <hi>Assent of the Mind</hi> can be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with any more Assurance, than <hi>the Evidence</hi>
whose Effect it is, and which it is resolved into,
will afford. Nor doth any Evidence of Truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
an Assent unto it in the Mind, but as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
and understood. Wherefore the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of this Truth, wherein soever it consists,
must be that which is perceived, apprehended and
understood by the meanest and most unlearned Sort
of true Believers. For, as was said, they do no less firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
assent and adhere unto it, than the Wisest and most
Learned of them. It cannot therefore consist in
such subtil and learned Arguments, whose Sense
they cannot understand or comprehend. But the
Things we have pleaded are of another Nature.
For those <hi>Characters</hi> of Divine Wisdom, Goodness,
Holiness, Grace, and Sovereign Authority, which
are implanted on the Scripture by the Holy Ghost,
are as legible unto the Faith of the Meanest, as of the
most Learned Believer. And they also are no less
capable of an Experimental <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> of the
Divine Power and Efficacy of the Scriptures in all
its Spiritual Operations, than those who are more
Wise and Skillful in discerning the Force of <hi>External
Arguments</hi> and Motives of Credibility. It must
therefore of necessity be granted, that the formal
Reason of Faith consists in those Things, whereof
the Evidence is equally obvious unto all Sorts of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
            <p>2. Whence it is that the Assent of Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we believe the Scriptures to be the Word of God,
is usually affirmed to be accompanied with more
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:106952:93"/>
               <hi>Assurance</hi> than any Assent which is the Effect of <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
upon the most demonstrative Principles. They
who affirm this, do not consider Faith as it is in this
or that Individual Person, or in all that do sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believe; but in its own Nature and Essence, and
what it is meet and able to produce. And the
<hi>Schoolmen</hi> do distinguish between a <hi>Certainty</hi> or
<hi>Assurance of Evidence,</hi> and an <hi>Assurance of Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi>
In the latter they say the Certainty of <hi>Faith</hi>
doth exceed that of Science; but it is less in respect
of the former. But it is not easily to be conceived
how the Certainty of Adherence should exceed the
Certainty of Evidence, with respect unto any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
whatsoever. That which seems to render a
Difference in this Case is, that the Evidence which
we have in Things <hi>scientifical</hi> is Speculative, and
affects the Mind only; but the Evidence which we
have by Faith effectually worketh on the <hi>Will</hi> also,
because of the Goodness and Excellency of the
Things that are believed. And hence it is that the
whole Soul doth more <hi>firmly adhere</hi> unto the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Faith upon that Evidence which it hath of
them, than unto other Things whereof it hath
clearer Evidence, wherein the Will and the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are little or not at all concerned. And <hi>Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture</hi>
giveth a Reason of no small weight, why
Faith is more certain than Science, not with the
Certainty of <hi>Speculation,</hi> but of <hi>Adherence; Quoniam
fideles Christiani, nec Argumentis, nec Tormentis,
nec Blandimentis adduci possunt, vel inclinari, ut
Veritatem quam credunt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vel ore tenus negent; quod
nemo peritus alicujus scientiae faceret, si acerrimis
Tormentis cogeretur scientiam suam de conclusione ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua
Geometrica vel Arithmetica retractare. Stultus
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:106952:93"/>
enim &amp; ridiculus esset Geometra, qui pro sua scientia
in Controversiis Geometricis mortem anderet subire,
nisi in quantum dictat Fides, non esse mentiendum.</hi>
And whatever may be said of this <hi>Distinction,</hi> I
think it cannot modestly be denied, that there is a
greater Assurance in Faith, than any is in <hi>scientifical
Conclusions;</hi> until as many good and wise Men will
part with all their worldly Concernments, and
their Lives, by the most exquisite Tortures, in the
Confirmation of any Truth which they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
meerly on the Ground of Reason acting in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Sciences, as have so done on the Certainty
which they had by Faith, that the <hi>Scripture is a
Divine Revelation.</hi> For in bearing Testimony
hereunto, have innumerable Multitudes of the
Best, the Holiest and the VVisest Men that ever were
in the VVorld, chearfully and joyfully sacrificed
all their <hi>Temporal,</hi> and adventured all their <hi>Eternal</hi>
Concernments. For they did it under a full Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
that in parting with all temporary things,
they should be eternally Blessed, or eternally Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
according as their Perswasion in Faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
true or false. VVherefore unto the Firmitude
and Constancy which we have in the Assurance of
Faith, three Things do concur.</p>
            <p>1. That this <hi>Ability of Assent upon Testimony,</hi>
is the highest and most noble Power or Faculty
of our rational Souls; and therefore where it hath
the highest Evidence whereof it is capable, which
it hath in the Testimony of God, it giveth us the
highest Certainty or Assurance, whereof in this
VVorld we are capable.</p>
            <p>2. Unto the Assent of Divine Faith there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
an <hi>especial internal Operation of the Holy
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:106952:94"/>
Ghost.</hi> This rendreth it of another Nature than any
meer natural Act and Operation of our Minds.
And therefore if the Assurance of it may not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
be said to exceed the <hi>Assurance of Science</hi> in
Degree, it is only because it is of a more excellent
kind, and so is not capable of Comparison unto it
as to Degrees.</p>
            <p>3. That the Revelation which God makes of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
his Mind and Will by his Word, is more <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,</hi>
and accompanied with greater Evidence of
his <hi>infinitely Glorious Properties,</hi> wherein alone the
Mind can find absolute Rest and Satisfaction (which
is its Assurance) than any other Discovery of Truth
of what sort soever is capable of. Neither is the Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the Mind <hi>absolutely perfect</hi> in any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the Enjoyment of God. Wherefore the
Soul by Faith making the nearest Approaches,
whereof in this Life it is capable, unto the Eternal
Spring of <hi>Being, Truth</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> it hath the
highest Rest, Satisfaction and Assurance therein
that in this Life it can attain unto.</p>
            <p>3. It followeth from hence, that those that would
deny either of those two Things, or would so sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
between them, as to exclude the <hi>Necessity</hi> of
either unto the Duty of Believing, namely, the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Work</hi> of the Holy Spirit on the Minds of
Men, enabling them to believe, and the <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Work</hi> of the same Holy Spirit giving Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in and by the Scripture unto its own
Divine Original; do endeavour to expell all
True Divine Faith out of the World, and
to substitute a probable Perswasion in the room
thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:106952:94"/>
For a Close unto this Discourse, which hath now
been drawn forth unto a greater Length than was at
first intended, I shall consider some Objections that
are usually pleaded in Opposition unto the Truth
asserted and vindicated.</p>
            <p>It is therefore objected in the first Place, that
the Plea hitherto insisted on cannot be managed
without great Disadvantage to Christian Religion.
For if we take away the <hi>Rational Grounds,</hi> on
which we believe the Doctrine of Christ to be
True and Divine, and the whole Evidence of the
Truth of it be laid on things not only derided by
Men of <hi>Atheistical Spirits,</hi> but in themselves such as
cannot be discerned by any but such as do believe,
on what <hi>Grounds</hi> can we proceed to convince an
Unbeliever?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer</hi> 1. By the way, it is one thing to prove
and believe the Doctrine of Christ to be True and
Divine; another to prove and believe the Scripture
to be given by Inspiration of God, or the Divine
Authority of the Scripture, which alone was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
unto Consideration. A Doctrine True and
Divine may be written in and proposed unto us by
Writings that were not <hi>divinely and infallibly inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;</hi>
and so might the Doctrine of Christ have
been, but not without the unspeakable Disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the Church. And there are sundry Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which forcibly and effectually prove the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Christ to have been <hi>True and Divine,</hi>
which are not of any Efficacy to prove the Divine
Authority of the Scriptures; though on the other
hand, whatever doth prove the Divine Authority
of the Scriptures, doth equally prove the Divine
Truth of the Doctrine of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:106952:95"/>
2. There are two Ways of <hi>convincing Vnbelievers;</hi>
the one insisted on by the <hi>Apostles</hi> and their <hi>Followers,</hi>
the other by some <hi>learned Men</hi> since their Days.
The Way principally insisted on by the Apostles was
by <hi>preaching</hi> the Word it self unto them in the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Demonstration of the Spirit, by the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
whereof manifesting the Authority of God in it,
they were convinced; and <hi>falling down acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
God to be in it of a Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 1 Cor. 2. 4, 5. ch. 14.
25, 26. It is likely that in this their <hi>Proposal of
the Gospel,</hi> the Doctrine and Truths contained in
it unto Unbelievers, that those of <hi>Atheistical Spirits</hi>
would both deride them and it; and so indeed it
came to pass, many esteeming <hi>themselves</hi> to be <hi>Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi>
and their Doctrine to be <hi>errant Folly.</hi> But yet
they desisted not from pursuing their Work in the
same way, whereunto God gave success. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
VVay is to prove unto <hi>Vnbelievers</hi> that the
<hi>Scripture is True and Divine</hi> by rational Arguments,
wherein some learned Persons have laboured, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in these last Ages, to very good purpose.
And certainly their Labours are greatly to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
whilst they attend unto these Rules.
(1.) That they produce no Arguments but such
as are <hi>cogent,</hi> and not liable unto just Exceptions.
For if to manifest their own Skill or Learning they
plead such Reasons as are capable of an Answer and
Solution, they exceedingly prejudice the Truth by
subjecting it unto dubious <hi>Disputations,</hi> whereas
in it self it is Clear, Firm, and Sacred. (2.) That
they do not pretend their rational Grounds and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to be the Sole Foundation that Faith hath
to rest upon, or which it is resolved into. For this
were the ready way to set up an Opinion instead of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:106952:95"/>
Faith Supernatural and Divine. Accept but of
these two Limitations, and it is acknowledged that
the rational Grounds and Arguments intended may
be rationally pleaded, and ought so to be, unto the
Conviction of Gainsayers. For no Man doth so
plead the <hi>self-evidencing Power</hi> of the Scripture, as
to deny that the Use of other external Motives and
Arguments is necessary to stop the Mouths of <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists,</hi>
as also unto the further Establishment of them
who do believe. These Things are subordinate, and
no way inconsistent.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, if we will attend unto our own
and the Experience of the whole Church of God,
the way whereby we come to believe the Scripture
to be the <hi>Word of God</hi> ordinarily is this and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
God having first given his <hi>Word</hi> as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of our Faith and Obedience, hath appointed
the <hi>Ministry of Men,</hi> at first extraordinary, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ordinary, to propose unto us the Doctrines,
Truths, Precepts, Promises, and Threatnings
contained therein. Together with this Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, they are appointed to declare that
these things are not from <hi>themselves,</hi> nor of their
own <hi>Invention, 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 14, 15, 16, 17. And this is
done variously. Unto some the VVord of God in
this <hi>Ministry</hi> thus comes, or is thus proposed,
preached or declared, whilst they are in a Condition
not only utterly unacquainted with the Mysteries
of it, but filled with contrary Apprehensions and
consequently Prejudices against it. Thus it came
of old unto the <hi>Pagan World,</hi> and must do so unto
such Persons and Nations as are yet in the same
state with them. Unto these the first Preachers of
the Gospel did not produce the <hi>Book of the Scriptures,</hi>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:106952:96"/>
and tell them that it was the Word of God, and
that it would evidence it self unto them so to be.
For this had been to despise the Wisdom and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of God in their own Ministry. But they
preached the Doctrines of it unto them, grounding
themselves on the Divine Revelation contained
therein. And this Proposition of the Truth or
Preaching of the Gospel was not <hi>left of God</hi> to
work it self into the Reasons of Men by the Suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
of it thereunto; but being his <hi>own Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
for their Illumination and Conversion, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
it with Divine Power, and made it effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
unto the Ends designed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16. And
the Event hereof among Mankind was, that by
<hi>some</hi> this <hi>new Doctrine</hi> was derided and scorned, by
<hi>others</hi> whose <hi>Hearts God opened to attend unto it,</hi> it
was embraced and submitted unto. Among those
who after the Propagation of the Gospel are
born, as they say, <hi>within the Pale of the Church,</hi> the
same Doctrine is variously instilled into Persons ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
unto the several Duties and Concerns of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to instruct them. Principally the <hi>Ministry
of the Word</hi> is ordained of God unto that End
wheron the Church is the Ground and Pillar of
Truth. Those of both Sorts unto whom the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
mentioned is preached or proposed, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
unto the Scriptures as the Sacred Repository
thereof. For they are told that these things come
by <hi>Revelation</hi> from God, and that Revelation is
contained in the <hi>Bible,</hi> which is his Word. Upon
this Proposal with Enquiry into it and Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, God co-operating by his Spirit, there is
that Evidence of its Divine Original communicated
unto their Minds through its Power and Efficacy,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:106952:96"/>
with the Characters of Divine Wisdom and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
implanted on it, which they are now enabled
to discern, that they believe it and rest in it as the
immediate Word of God. Thus was it in the Case
of the <hi>Woman of Samaria,</hi> and the Inhabitants
of <hi>Sychar,</hi> with respect unto their Faith in Christ
Jesus, <hi>John</hi> 4. 42. This is the way whereby
Men ordinarily are brought to believe the Word of
God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14, 15. and that neither by exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Arguments or Motives, which no one Soul
was ever converted unto God by, nor by any meer
naked Proposal and Offer of the Book unto them,
nor by Miracles, nor by Immediate Revelation or
private subjective Testimony of the Spirit; nor is
their Faith a Perswasion of Mind, that they can
give no Reason of, but only that they are so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded.</p>
            <p>But it will be yet further objected, that if there
be such clear Evidences in the thing it self, that is,
in the Divine Original and Authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that none who freely use their Reason can
deny it; then it lies either in the naked Proposal of
the Things unto the understanding; and if so, then
every one that assents unto this Proposition, <hi>that
the whole is greater than the part,</hi> must likewise as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
unto this that the Scripture is the Word of God;
or the Evidence must not ly in the naked Proposal,
but in the Efficacy of the Spirit of God in the
minds of them unto whom it is proposed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. I know no Divine, Ancient or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern,
Popish or Protestant, who doth not assert that
tere is a work of the Holy Ghost on the minds of
men necessary unto a due Belief of the Scriptures to
be the VVord of God. And the Consideration
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:106952:97"/>
hereof ought not by any Christian to be excluded.
But they say not that this is the Objective Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
or Evidence on which we believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be the VVord of God, concerning which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
is our Enquiry.</p>
            <p>2. We do not dispute how far or by what means
this Proposition, <hi>the Scripture is the Word of God,</hi>
may be evidenced meerly unto our Reason; but
unto our understanding as capable of giving an
Assent upon Testimony. It is not said that this is a
first Principle of Reason, though it be of Faith, nor
that it is capable of a <hi>Mathematical Demonstration.</hi>
That the whole is greater than the part, is self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
unto our Reason upon its first Proposal; but
such none pretends to be in the Scripture, because
it is a Subject not capable of it. Nor do those
who denying the self-evidence of the Scripture, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
by their Arguments for its Divine Authority
to give such an Evidence of it unto Reason, as is
in first Principles, or <hi>Mathematical Demonstrations,</hi>
but content themselves with that which they call
a Moral Certainty. But it is by Faith we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to receive the Truth of this Proposition, which
respects the Power of our Minds of assent unto
Truth upon Testimony, infallibly on that which is
infallible. And hereunto it evidenceth its own
Truth, not with the same, but with an Evidence
and Certainty of an higher nature and nobler kind
than that of the <hi>strictest Demonstration</hi> in things na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
or the most forcible Argumens in things
moral.</p>
            <p>3. It will be objected, that if this be so, then
none can be <hi>obliged to receive the Scripture</hi> as the
Word of God who hath not Faith, and none have
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:106952:97"/>
Faith but those in whom it is wrought by the Spirit
of God, and thereinto all will be resolved at last.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Indeed there is no Room for this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection;
for the whole Work of the Spirit is pleaded
only as he is the <hi>efficient Cause of Believing,</hi> and not
the <hi>objective,</hi> or Reason why we do believe. But</p>
            <p>2. We must not be ashamed to resolve all we do
well, spiritually and in obedience to the Command
of God, unto the Efficacious Operation of the Holy
Ghost in us, unless we intend to be ashamed of the
Gospel. But this still makes his <hi>internal Operation</hi> to
be the <hi>efficient,</hi> and not his <hi>internal Testimony</hi> to
be the formal Reason of our Faith.</p>
            <p>3. It is another Question, whether all Obligation
unto Duty is and must be proportionate unto our
own Strength without Divine Assistance; which we
deny: and affirm that we are obliged unto many
things by virtue of Gods <hi>Command,</hi> which we have
no power to answer but by virtue of his <hi>Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Where the Proposal of the Scripture is made in
the way before described, those unto whom it is
proposed are obliged to receive it as the Word of
God, upon the Evidence which it gives of it self so
to be. Yea every Real, True, Divine Revelation
made unto Men, or every Proposal of the Scripture
by Divine Providence, hath that Evidence of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from God accompanying of it, as is sufficient to
<hi>oblige them</hi> unto whom it was made to believe it, on
pain of his Displeasure. If this were otherwise, then
either were God obliged to confirm every particular
Divine Revelation with a Miracle (which as to its
Obligation unto Believing wants not its difficulty)
which he did not, as in many of the Prophets; nor
doth at this day at the first Proposal of the Gospel
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:106952:98"/>
to the Heathen; or else when he requires Faith and
Obedience in such ways as in his Wisdom he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
meet, that is in the ordinary Ministry of the
Word, they are not obliged thereby, nor is it their
Sin to refuse a Compliance with his Will.</p>
            <p>5. If this Difficulty can be no otherwise avoided,
but by affirming that the Faith which God requires
of us with respect unto his VVord, is nothing but
a <hi>natural Assent</hi> unto it upon rational Arguments
and Considerations which we have an Ability for,
without any spiritual Aid of the Holy Ghost, or
respect unto his Testimony, as before described;
which overthrows all Faith, especially that which is
Divine. I shall rather ten thousand times allow
of all the just Consequences that can follow
on the Supposition mentioned, than admit of this
Relief. But of those Consequences this is none, that
any unto whom the Scripture is proposed are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
from an Obligation unto Believing.</p>
            <p>In like manner there is no difficulty in the usual
Objection which respects particular Books of the
Scripture, why we receive them as <hi>Canonical,</hi> and
reject others; as namely, the <hi>Book of Proverbs, and
not of Wisdom; of Ecclesiastes, and not Ecclesiasticus.</hi>
For,</p>
            <p>1. As to the Books of the Old Testament, we
have the Canon of them given us in the New,
where it is affirmed, that unto the <hi>Church of the
Jews were committed the Oracles of God:</hi> which
both confirms all that we receive, and excludes all
that we exclude. And unto the New, there are no
Pretenders, nor ever were to the least Exercise of
the Faith of any.</p>
            <p>2. All Books whatever that have either them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:106952:98"/>
pretended unto a Divine Original, or have
been pleaded by others to be of that Extract, have
been and may be from themselves, without further
help, evicted of falshood in that pretence. They
have all of them hitherto in matter or manner,
in plain Confessions, or other sufficient Evidence,
manifested themselves to be of an human Original.
And much Danger is not to be feared from any that
for the future shall set forth with the same pretence.</p>
            <p>3. VVe are not bound to refuse the <hi>Ministry of
the Church,</hi> or the Advantages of Providence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Scripture is brought unto us, with the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
which either directly or collaterally any
one Part of it gives unto another. Although the
Scripture be to believed <hi>for it self,</hi> yet it is not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
to be believed <hi>by it self,</hi> without the help of
other means.</p>
            <p>4. On these Suppositions I fear not to affirm that
there are on every <hi>Individual Book of the Scripture,</hi>
particularly those named, those Divine Characters
and <hi>Criteria,</hi> which are sufficient to difference them
from all other VVritings whatever, and to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
their Divine Authority unto the Minds and
Consciences of Believers. I say of <hi>Believers;</hi> for
we enquire not on what Ground unbelievers, or
those who do not believe, do believe the VVord of
God, nor yet directly on what outward Motives
such Persons may be induced so to do. But our
sole Enquiry at present is, what the Faith of them
<hi>who do believe</hi> is resolved into. It is not therefore
said that when our Lord Jesus Christ (for we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
that there is the same Reason of the first
giving out of Divine Revelations, as is of the
Scripture) came and preached unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:106952:99"/>
those meer VVords, <hi>I am the Light of the World,</hi> or
the like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had all this Evidence in them or with
them; for nothing he said of that kind may be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from its Circumstances; but supposing the
Testimonies given in the Scripture before hand to his
Person, Work, Time, and Manner of Coming, with
the Evidence of the Presence of God with him in the
declaration that he made of his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and himself
to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> were bound to believe
what he taught, and himself to be the Son of God the
Saviour of the World, and so did many of them upon
his Preaching only, <hi>John</hi> 4. 42. And in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
they were bound to believe the <hi>Doctrine of John
Baptist,</hi> and to submit unto his Institutions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he wrought no Miracle, and those who did
not, rejected the Counsel of God for their Good,
and perished in their unbelief. But although our
Lord Jesus Christ wrought no Miracles to prove
the Scripture then extant to be the VVord of God,
seeing he wrought them among such only as by
whom that was firmly believed; yet the VVisdom
of God saw it necessary to confirm his <hi>Personal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry</hi>
by them. And without a Sense of the Power
and Efficacy of the Divine Truth of the Doctrine
proposed, <hi>Miracles themselves</hi> will be despised; so
they were by some who were afterwards converted
by the Preaching of the VVord, <hi>Acts 2. 13. chap.</hi> 3.
7, 8. or they will produce only a false Faith, or a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished
Assent upon an Amazement, that will not
abide, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 13, 21.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Summary Representation of the
<hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> of that Faith
wherewith we believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be the Word of God, with
some <hi>Attestations</hi> given unto the
Substance of what hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
concerning it, shall give
a Close to this Discourse. As to the first Part of this
Design, the Things that follow are proposed.</p>
            <p>I. Unto the Enquiry, on what Grounds or for
what Reason we believe the Scripture to be the
Word of God, many Things are <hi>supposed,</hi> as on all
hands agreed upon, whose Demonstration or Proof
belongs not unto our present Work. Such are,</p>
            <p>1. The Being of God, and his Self-subsistence,
with all the Essential Properties of his Nature.</p>
            <p>2. Our Relation unto him and Dependance on
him, as our Creator, Benefactor, Preserver, Judge,
and Rewarder, both as unto Things Temporal,
and Eternal. Wherefore,</p>
            <p>3. The <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>whatever may be known
of God by the Light of Nature,</hi> whatever is manifest
in or from the Works of Creation or Providence,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:106952:100"/>
and necessary Actings of Conscience, as to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Rule and Authority of God, is supposed as
acknowledged in this Enquiry.</p>
            <p>4. That beyond the Conduct and Guidance of
the Light of Nature, that Men may live unto God,
believe and put their Trust in him, according to
their Duty, in that Obedience which he requireth
of them, so as to come unto the Enjoyment of Him,
a Supernatural Revelation of his Mind and Will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, especially in that Condition wherein all
Mankind are since the Entrance of Sin, is necessary.</p>
            <p>5. That all those unto whom God hath granted
Divine Revelations immediately from Himself, for
their own use, and that of all other Men unto
whom they were to be communicated, were infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
assured that they came from God, and that
their Minds were no way imposed on in them.</p>
            <p>6. That all these Divine Revelations, so far as
they are any way necessary to guide and instruct
Men in the true Knowledg of God, and that Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
which is acceptable unto him, are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Scriptures, or those Books of the Old
and New Testament which are commonly received
and owned among all Sorts of Christians.</p>
            <p>These Things I say are supposed unto our present
Enquiry, and taken for granted; so as that the
<hi>Reader</hi> is not to look for any direct Proof of them
in the preceding Discourse. But on these Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
it is alledged and proved,</p>
            <p>1. That all Men unto whom it is duly proposed
as such, are bound to believe this Scripture, these
Books of the Old and New Testament, to be the
Word of God; that is to contain and exhibit an
Immediate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Divine, Supernatural Revelation of his
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:106952:100"/>
Mind and Will, so far as is any way needful that
they may live unto him; and that nothing is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in them, but what is of the same Divine O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal.</p>
            <p>2. The Obligation of this Duty of thus Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Scripture to be the Word of God, ariseth
partly from the Nature of the Thing it self,
and partly from the especial Command of God.
For it being that Revelation of the Will of God,
without the Knowledg whereof, and Assent where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
we cannot live unto God as we ought, nor
come unto the enjoyment of him; it is necessary that
we should believe it unto those Ends; and God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
it of us, that so we should do.</p>
            <p>3. We cannot thus believe it in a way of Duty,
but upon a sufficient Evidence and prevalent Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
that so it is.</p>
            <p>4. There are many cogent Arguments, Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and Motives to perswade, convince, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
unprejudiced Persons, that the Scripture is the
Word of God, or a Divine Revelation, and every
way sufficient to stop the Mouths of Gain-sayers,
proceeding on such Principles of Reason, as are
owned and approved by the Generality of Mankind.
And Arguments of this Nature may be taken from
almost all Considerations of the Properties of God,
and his Government of the World, of our Relation
unto him, of what belongs unto our present Peace,
and future Happiness.</p>
            <p>5. From the Arguments and Testimonies of this
Nature, a firm Perswasion of Mind defensible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all Objections, that the Scripture is the Word
of God, may be attained; and that such, as that
those who live not in Contradiction unto their own
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:106952:101"/>
Light and Reason through the Power of their Lusts,
cannot but judg it their Wisdom, Duty, and Interest
to yield Obedience unto his VVill as revealed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p>6. But yet that Perswasion of Mind which may
be thus attained, and which resteth wholly upon
these Arguments and Testimonies, is not entirely
that Faith wherewith we are obliged to believe the
Scripture to be the VVord of God in a way of Duty.
For it is not to be meerly Human, how firm soever
the Perswasions in it may be, but Divine and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural,
of the same kind with that whereby we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the things themselves contained in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>7. VVe cannot thus believe the Scripture to be
the VVord of God, nor any Divine Truth therein
contained, without the effectual Illumination of our
Minds by the Holy Ghost. And to exclude the
Consideration of his VVork herein is to cast the
whole Enquiry out of the Limits of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>8. Yet is not this VVork of the Holy Spirit in the
Illumination of our Minds, whereby we are enabled
to believe in a way of Duty with Faith Supernatural
and Divine, the Ground and Reason <hi>why</hi> we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
or the Evidence <hi>whereon</hi> we do so, nor is our
Faith resolved thereinto.</p>
            <p>9. VVhereas also there are sundry other Acts of
the Holy Spirit in and upon our minds, establishing
this Faith against Temptations unto the contrary,
and further ascertaining us of the Divine Original
of the Scripture, or testifying it unto us; yet are
they none of them severally, nor all of them joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the formal Reason of our Faith, nor the Ground
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:106952:101"/>
which we believe upon. Yet are they such as that
as without the first VVork of Divine Illumination
we cannot believe at all in a due manner; so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his other consequent Operations we cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
stedfastly against Temptations and Oppositions.
VVherefore,</p>
            <p>10. Those only can believe the Scripture aright
to be the VVord of God in a way of Duty, whose
minds are enlightned, and who are enabled to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
by the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>11. Those who believe not are of two Sorts, for
they are either such as oppose and gainsay the VVord
as a cunningly devised Fable; or such as are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
without prejudice to attend unto the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it. The former Sort may be resisted, opposed,
and rebuked by external Arguments, and such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Considerations as vehemently perswade the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Original of the Scripture, and from the same
Principles may their mouths be stopped as to their
Cavils and Exceptions against it. The other Sort
are to be led on unto believing by the Ministry of
the Church in the dispensation of the VVord it self,
which is the Ordinance of God unto that purpose.
But,</p>
            <p>12. Neither sort do ever come truly to believe,
either meerly induced thereunto by force of moral
Arguments only, or upon the Authority of that
Church by whose <hi>Ministry</hi> the Scripture is proposed
unto them to be believed. VVherefore,</p>
            <p>13. The formal Reason of Faith <hi>Divine and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural</hi>
whereby we believe the Scripture to be
the VVord of God in the way of Duty, and as it is
required of us, is the Authority and Veracity of
God alone, evidencing themselves unto our Minds
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:106952:102"/>
and Consciences in and by the Scripture it self. And
herein consisteth that Divine Testimony of the Holy
Ghost, which as it is a Testimony gives our Assent
unto the Scriptures the general nature of Faith, and
as it is a Divine Testimony gives it the especial na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Faith Divine and Supernatural.</p>
            <p>14. This Divine Testimony given unto the Divine
Original of the Scripture in and by it self whereinto
our Faith is ultimately resolved, is evidenced and
made known, as by the Characters of the infinite
Perfections of the Divine Nature that are in it and
upon it; so by the Authority, Power and Efficacy
over and upon the Souls and Consciences of Men,
and the Satisfactory Excellency of the Truths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
therein, wherewith it is accompanied.</p>
            <p>15. Wherefore although there be many co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
external Arguments whereby a moral stedfast
Perwasion of the Divine Authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
may be attained, and it be the principal Duty
of the true Church in all Ages to give Testimony
thereunto, which it hath done successively at all
all times since first it was intrusted with it; and so
although there be many other Means whereby we
are induced, perswaded, and enabled to believe it,
yet is it for its own sake only, efficaciously mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing
it self to be the Word of God, or upon the
Divine Testimony that is given in it and by it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
that we believe it to be so with Faith Divine
and Supernatural.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Corel.</hi> Those who either deny the necessity of an
internal subjective Work of the Holy Ghost
enabling us to believe, or the objective Testimony
of the Holy Spirit given unto the Scripture in and
by it self, or do deny their joynt concurrence in
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:106952:102"/>
and unto our Believing, do deny all Faith properly
Divine and Supernatural.</p>
            <p>This being the Substance of what is declared
and pleaded for in the preceding Treatise; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Obloquy of some, and confirm the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of others, I shall add the Suffrage of Antient
and Modern Writers given unto the principal Parts
of it, and whereon all other things asserted in it do
depend.</p>

<hi>We have the Lord himself for the Principle or
Beginning of Doctrine, who by the Prophets, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,

[This is that which we lay down as the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Ground of Faith, namely, the Authority
of the Lord himself instructing us by the Scriptures.]
So he adds; <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.
<hi>And if any one suppose

not be kept.</hi> [that is, if we need any other Principle
whereinto to resolve our Faith, the Word of God is
no more a Principle unto us.] <hi>But he who is faithful
from himself is worthy to be believed in his Sovereign
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:106952:103"/>
Writing and Voice, which as it appeareth is administred
by the Lord for the benefit of men. And certainly we
use it as a Rule of judging for the invention of things.
But whatever is judged, is not credible or to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
until it is judged; and that is no Principle which
stands in need to be judged.</hi> The Intention of his
Words is, that God who alone is to believed for
himself, hath given us his Word as the Rule where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we are to judg of all things. And this Word is
so to be believed, as not to be subject unto any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Judgment; because if it be so it cannot be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Principle or a Rule. And so he proceeds;
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
<hi>Wherefore it is
meet that embracing by Faith the most sufficient inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable
Principle, and taking the Demonstrations
of the Principle from the Principle it self, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
by the Voice of the Lord himself unto the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of the Truth.</hi> In few Words he declares
the Substance of what we have pleaded for. No
more do we maintain in this Cause, but what <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi>
doth here assert; namely, that we believe the
Scripture for it self, as that which needeth no antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
or external Demonstration; but all the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Demonstration of its Divine Original is
to be taken from it self alone; which yet he further
confirms, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:106952:103"/>
               <hi>For we would not attend or give credit sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to the definitions of Men, seeing we have right al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to define in contradiction unto them. And seeing it is
not sufficient meerly to say or assert what appears to be
Truth, but to beget a belief also of what is spoken, we
expect not the Testimony of Men, but confirm that which
is enquired about with the voice of the Lord, which
is more full and firm than any Demonstration, yea
which rather is the only Demonstration.—Thus we
taking our Demonstrations of the Scripture out of the
Scripture, are assured by Faith, as by Demonstration.</hi>
And in other places, as <hi>Strom.</hi> 4. he plainly affirms
that the way of Christians was to prove the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

he were, I would hold him, and ask him and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
him for thy sake, that he would open these
things unto me, and I would apply the ears of my
body to the sounds breaking forth from his mouth.
But if he should use the Hebrew Language, in vain
should he affect my sense, for he would not at all
touch my mind; if he should speak Latin, I should
know what he said; but whence should I know
that he spake the Truth? and if I should know
this also, should I know it of him? Within me,
in the habitation of my own thoughts, Truth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, nor any barbarous
Language, without the Organs of mouth or tongue,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:106952:104"/>
without the Noise of syllables, would say, he
speaks the Truth; and I being immediately assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or certain of it, would say unto that servant
of thine, thou speakest Truth. Whereas therefore
I cannot ask him, I ask thee, O Truth, with which
he being filled spake the things that are true; O
my God, I ask of thee; pardon my sins, and thou
who gavest unto this thy servant to speak these
things, give unto me to understand them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That which is most remarkable in these Words is,
that he plainly affirms that Faith would not ensue
on the declaration of the Prophets themselves if they
were present with us, unless there be an <hi>internal
Work</hi> of the Holy Spirit upon our minds to enable
us, and perswade them thereunto. And indeed he
seems to place all Assurance of the Truth of Divine
Revelations in the inward Assurance which God
gives us of them by his Spirit; which we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
considered.</p>
            <p>The second <hi>Arausican Council</hi> gives full Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

            <p>To descend unto later times wherein these things
have been much disputed, yet the Truth hath beam'd

               <q>I
have often thought with my self whence the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it self is so perswasive, from whence it doth
so powerfully influence the minds of its hearers,
that it inclines or leads them not only to receive an
Opinion, but surely to believe. This is not to be
imputed to the Evidence of Reasons which it doth
not produce, nor unto the Industry of Art, with
words smooth and fit to perswade, which it useth
not; see then if this be not the cause of it, that we
are perswaded that it comes from the first Truth or
Verity. But whence are we so perswaded but from
it self alone? as if its own Authority should effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
draw us to believe it. But whence I pray
hath it this Authority? we saw not God preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
writing, or teaching of it; but yet as if we
had seen him, we believe and firmly hold, that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:106952:105"/>
the things which we read proceeded from the Holy
Ghost. It may be this is the Reason why we so
firmly adhere unto it, that truth is more solid in it,
though not more clear than in other writings; for
all Truth hath a perswasive power, the greater
Truth, the greater power, and that which is greatest
the greatest Efficacy of all. But why then do not all
believe the Gospel? Answ. Because all are not
drawn of God. But what need is there of any long
disputation? we therefore firmly believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
because we have received a Divine Inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
assuring of us. And in what Sense this is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
hath been declared in the preceding Discourse.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I shall close the whole with the Testimony of
them, by whom the Truth which we assert is most
vehemently opposed, when it riseth in opposition
unto an especial interest of their own.</p>
            <p>Two things there are which are principally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
against in the Doctrine of <hi>Protestants,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
our belief of the Scripture. The first is with
respect unto the Holy Spirit as the efficient cause of
Faith, for whereas they teach that no man can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Scripture to be the Word of God in a due
manner and according unto his duty, without the
real internal Aid and Operation of the Holy Ghost,
however it be proposed unto him, and with what Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
soever the Truth of its Divine Original be
confirmed; this is charged on them as an Error and a
Crime. And secondly, whereas they also affirm that
there is an inward Testimony or Witness of the
Holy Spirit, whereby he assures and confirms the
minds of men in the Faith of the Scriptures with an
Efficacy exceeding all the perswasive Evidence of
outward Arguments and Motives; this also by some
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:106952:106"/>
they are traduced for. And yet those of the <hi>Roman
Church</hi> who are looked on as most averse from that
Resolution of Faith which most Protestants acquiesce
in, do expresly maintain both these Assertions.</p>
            <p>The Design of <hi>Stapleton, de principiis Fidei,
controver.</hi> 4. lib. 8. cap. 1. is to prove, <hi>impossibile esse
sine speciali gratia, ac dono fidei divinitùs infuso, actum
verae fidei producere, aut ex veri nominis fide credere.</hi>
Which he there proves with sundry Arguments,
namely, <hi>that it is impossible to produce any act of Faith,
or to believe with Faith rightly so called, without special
Grace, and the Divine Infusion of the Gift of Faith.</hi>
And <hi>Bellarmin</hi> speaks to the same purpose; <q>
                  <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta

               <q>The Arguments which render the

            <p>
               <hi>Melchior Canus, loc. Theol.</hi> lib. 2. cap. 8. disputes
expresly to this purpose; <q>

               </q> 
               <q>This
is firmly to be held, that human Authority, and all
the Motives before mentioned, nor any other which
may be used by him who proposeth the Object of
Faith to be believed, are not sufficient causes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
as we are obliged to believe; but there is
moreover necessary an internal efficient Cause mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
us to believe, which is the especial Help or
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:106952:106"/>
Aid of God.</q> And a little after he speaks yet more

               <q>Wherefore all external human Perswasions or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
are not sufficient Causes of Faith, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

Cause, that is, a certain Divine Light, inciting
to believe, or certain internal Eyes to see, given us
by the Grace of God.</q> Yea all other learned men
of the same Profession do speak to the same purpose.</p>
            <p>The other Assertion also they do no less comply
withal; <q>
                  <hi>Arcanum divini Spiritus Testimonium prorsus

<q>The secret Testimony of the Spirit is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

                  <hi>Whereas</hi> (saith he) <hi>we have hitherto
pleaded Arguments for the Authority of Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
which even by themselves ought to suffice prudent
persons to induce their minds to belief, yet I know not
whether there be not an Argument greater than they all,
namely, that those who are truly Christians do find or
feel by experience their minds so affected in this matter
of Faith, that they are moved</hi> (and obliged) <hi>firmly to
believe, neither for any Argument that we have used,
nor for any of the like sort that can be found out by
Reason, but for somewhat else which perswades our
minds in another manner, and far more effectually
than any Arguments whatever.</hi>
               </q> And to shew what
he means by this internal Argument and Perswasion,
he affirms elsewhere, that, <q>

            <p>These few Testimonies have I produced amongst the many
that might be urged to the same purpose, not to confirm the
Truth which we have pleaded for, which stands on far surer
foundations; but only to obviate Prejudices in the minds of
some, who being not much conversant in things of this Nature,
are ready to charge what hath been delivered unto this purpose
with Singularity.</p>
