            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Likewiſe being an Engliſhman, whoſe Patronage in general you ſeem to avouch by thoſe Worthy Collections of Engliſh Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophick Chymical Authors, formerly publiſhed by you. I know you have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Coat of Arms for my Paternal Family, in your Heraulds Office, which would ſuit with the ſaid Epitaph, if it were only as it is alſo intended for a plain Sculpture to be upon my Grave Stone: Yet ſuch Scutcheons had not

Yet ſince they and their Explanations are Philoſophick (and the Philoſophers Patrons are Truth and Reaſon, which ſhould govern all ſorts of men) I was the more confident of allowance and approbation. And indeed Sir, I may affirm, they were made in a Living Grave, 1652.

Some likewiſe would have it conſiſt of three, Salt Sulphur, and Mercu y ☉. <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>. &amp; ☿.

For ſo Death and Deſtruction of outward Form, will be but as a Back-door to the Soul and Spirits true Birth, and its Bodies eternal Life and Union, till it come at laſt to the higheſt perfection, by its fulneſs of Tincture. Thus is the Philoſophical Corner-ſtone, made a true Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, though rejected and ſcoffed at by many.

                  <p>HEre Reader make a little pauſe, and take this ſhort hint for thy true inſtruction of the <hi>Alchaheſt</hi> and <hi>Macchabean Fire,</hi> burning in Water, and as a Serpent (or Latex) lying hid in the Cavernes of the Earth, and in other things and places; being nevertheleſs but one Anomolous Balſammick Salt, paſſing through the world, which almoſt every man knows and needs, though he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves not the marks to be that thing. I ſay, it is the <hi>Primum ens Salium,</hi> and hath a mark or croſs affixt on it from the Almighty, which (as <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaith) the Adept do know, and every curious Philoſophick ſearcher, may find to be a ſure and certain token of its true Alchaheſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Virtue, beyond any Demonſtration: And indeed we muſt not ſeek, or think to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This mark then I ſay is not the mark of <hi>Cain,</hi> or any Beſtial curſe, but clean contrary, and can preſerve life; ſo that none can kill it, though they would devour it; which mark till you find, you ſhoot at Rovers; and though the Aſs have ſuch an outward mark with Ignomy, yet Chriſt was pleaſed to ride upon it, and to grace the Croſs after by his mighty power of ſufferings on it, he having a Balſamick conſtant virtue of Patience therein over it. Some light is given of this mark and token upon it, both by <hi>Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> the glory of Chymiſts, and by brave <hi>Helmont</hi> his great Interpreter, but coucht cloſe up from the Ruſtick obſervation in convenient places; yet their preparations are plainly ſet down to be only ſimple diſſolution and coagulation, with eaſie heat, till it come to its tranſmuted form, without any commiſcible ferment Heterogeneous to it ſelf; but this Serpent biting his own Tail, by digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Putrefaction becomes Invenomed, and ſo by ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mortified into the ſmalleſt Attoms poſsibly in nature; and then is raiſed, circulated, and revived for eternity to ſome higher Orb or Elixir, and ſo not poſsible to mix with any elementary impurity, or ferment to be tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but ſeperates and preſerves all and every eſſential concrete whereto it is joyned from corruption, and the cauſes of death without any diminution of its or their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire created virtue.</p>

                  <p>I May tell thee here nevertheleſs, That though the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſubject of this foregoing Liquor, called the <hi>Alcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſt</hi> be but one Anomalous Salt, or firſt beginning of Salts, with ſuch a noted mark, and <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> like, doth ſuch great or mighty works, yet nevertheleſs the leaſt Elixira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſubject in the Philoſophers Kingdom (though the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perfected Salt) will doe ſuch Alchaheſtical effects, and ſome beyond, eſpecially being rapt up (like <hi>Paul)</hi> from the Quaternary Elements, into the Chriſtalline third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens above the fixt Stars and Planetary Orbs: For <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus</hi> his high prepared Samech, and every Alcaliſate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinerated wine of vegetables being brought to their full preparation and perfection, are Alchaheſtical, at leaſt Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaneous, as a <hi>Circulatum minus;</hi> and alſo all other Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamick Quinteſſential things, and Concretes in the three u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal kingdoms of nature. But more eſpecially the true Mercurial Saline, and Sulphurous Elixirs of Philoſophers wrought up and exalted to the bright Chriſtalline or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Orbs, influences in ſpiritual fuſible liquid Forms, and appearencies are ſo univerſally Alchaheſtical, that I ſay they may do the ſame things, if not greater, and make bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter exalted Balſamick ſeparations and preparations, then the ordinary ſaline Alchaheſt. But the manner of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration (&amp; <hi>modus diſpoſitionis)</hi> muſt be thought on to bring this to effect: For the degrees of Hierarchy are much conducing to and for the Glory of Angelical powers and influences: And yet the ſaid Alchaheſt (as a good fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner)
<pb facs="tcp:99781:20"/>
may prepare the way or Foundation to this grand Elixir. 'Tis true, the Alchalizate parts of Samech, and other Alcalyes, after their ſufficient reſolutions and pure ſoft apparelling for their firſt addreſſes to win their beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Caeleſtial Bride, and her beloved and delightful influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces muſt have a hot and moſt pure affection (chac'd from Adultery, yet Fuſibly melting with heat;) and then each of them with a ſtrong clutch (like a Domeſtick Thief, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs gently and at leiſure) will take away his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of her Chariot at ſuch a time when he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And Reader, this greater ſecret may be here revealed; That ſome affirm, all the Concreats and things in natures, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:99781:21"/>
I might further enlarge with ſome rare Philoſophick particular preparations in every kind or thing, and of the univerſal Spirit, and general Phlegmatick <hi>Menſtruum</hi> or diſſolvent, and of ſome ſweet oyls and ſpirits of Balſamick, Salts, Sulphurs, and Mercuries, &amp;c. both for <hi>Menſtruums</hi> and Medicines; and to ſet forth <hi>Butlers</hi> Magnetick, My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, Phyſical, Anodyne Stone, with other Sympatheticks, Magneticks, &amp;c.

                  <p>PErhaps here ſome may ſay, it is not eaſie to find or underſtand all written in this ſhort volume, by ſolitary experiments, or publick Print, which I confeſs to be true; nor could I, till I had the bleſsing to converſe with ſome Philoſophick Authors, and had living words to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate it; whereby likewiſe I felt and found out <hi>Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi> in their concealments, which I have here given thee a Key to open; and if it may be any help unto thee, acknowledge it from God; if thou diſlike it, thy time and charge will not be much prejudiced by theſe few lines, and might he ſpent worſe, but take it for good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or how elſe thou pleaſeſt, ſo thou forfeit not thy Chriſtian name by envy, or ſpeaking evil of what thou knoweſt not.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:99781:21"/>
And thus I hope in this ſhort diſcourſe I have ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explained my Philoſophical anygmatical Scutcheons, and Epitaph, with the Alchaheſt, Samech, and other Elixirs, as alſo my adjoyning words and Figures, the reſt I leave, (if thou be more curious) to be explained by the aforeſaid Authors, and multitude of others better experienced in this Art; and if thou yet ſhalt blame me for thy want of apprehenſion hereof by theſe writings, or of my Figures and Epitaph, I am reſolved to be dumb and ſilent like a dead man ſtill; for if I deſerve blame I ought to bear it quietly; if otherwiſe, I have been uſed to ſcandals and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches from <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court, to <hi>Jobs</hi> Dunghil, and can take it for a Glory to ſuffer patiently; for I have ſet down what the Philoſophers and Adeptiſts have ſaid and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>viva voce,</hi> and in Print; nor could I or they give this knowledge in the plaineſt words, without the peculiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of God: Wherefore if thou deſireſt this great bleſſing, ask it of him who giveth liberally and upbraideth not when it may tend to his glory. But be ſure thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare thy ſelf by purity and holineſs, with true mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as thou deſireſt thy work ſhould proſper and thrive. And therefore pray affectionately, That God, in and through Chriſts ſpirit, may enliven thee from dead works, and ſeparate light from thy dark body and Chaos of ſin, that ſo being truly baptized into him and his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by an Eſſential and Living Seed of Faith, thou maieſt improve thy Talent, and mount through and above the quaternary defiling world into the Trivne power, and at laſt come to the quinteſſential, or Super celeſtial Central circle of Peace, and Heavenly Beatitude.</p>

                  <p>MOſt Noble and Acute Searchers into the Vulcanick Anatomy: I would not be wanting to manifeſt the glory and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of this ancient Spagyrick Art, which I have ſeen and done, by proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting a very little of the Tranſmuting Powder on a piece of impure Lead, which in a moment) was thereby changed into the moſt fixt pure Gold, enduring the ſharpest examination of fire, ſo that none need doubt, but certainly know the firſt material Mercury of Philoſophers is to be found, and is as a fountain overflowing with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effects. Yet it is not in my thoughts to teach any man this Art, of which I my ſelf am yet ignorant, but only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe the proceedings I have ſeen. For it is only the part
<pb facs="tcp:99781:27"/>
of Bruits to ſpend their life in ſilence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not to declare that which might propagate the honour of the moſt Wiſe, Omnipotent God our Creator: It being ungrateful for men, (who ought to participate of the divine nature) not to glorifie their maker. I ſhall therefore without flouriſhing, faithfully relate whatever I ſaw and heard from <hi>Elias Artiſta,</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this miracle. For truly I was not ſo intimate, that he would teach me to prepare the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Medicine throughout the Artificial, Chymical, Phyſical Method, yet he vouchſafed ſuch a rational Foundation in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Phyſick, that I ſhall never ſufficiently extoll his praiſe.

But I know many Stupid men will contradict this truth. This man will have it to be a work of the Devils, another a hodge-podge, another to be the ſoul of gold; ſo that with one ounce of this Gold may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain be tinged only one ounce of Lead, and no more; but this is repugnant to <hi>Kifflers</hi> atteſtation, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as I ſhall ſhew you: Another perhaps believes it poſſible, but ſays, The Sawce is dearer then the meat; Yet I wonder not at all, for according to the Proverb,

Wherefore <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid right, in his book of Manners, Thou art not yet happy if the ruder ſort deride thee not. But whether men believe deride or contradict, there is a certainty of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of Metals; for mine eyes have ſeen it, my hands done it, and handled this ſpark of Gods ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting wiſdom, or the true Catholick, Saturnine, Magneſia of Philoſophers (a very Fire ſufficient to pierce Rocks) a treaſure equivalent to 20 Tun of Gold. What ſeekeſt thou more? I believed it with the eyes of <hi>Thomas</hi> in my fingers, I have ſeen I ſay in nature, That moſt ſecret ſupernatural Magical Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn known to none but a Cabaliſt Chriſtian: And we judge him the happieſt of all Phyſicians, to whom this Soveraign Potion of our Medicinal Mercury is known; or of the Medicine of the <hi>Sun</hi> of our <hi>Aeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culapius,</hi> againſt the violence of death, for which elſe grows no better <hi>Panacea</hi> in all the Gardens. But the great God reveals not promiſcuouſly theſe his Solomonical gifts; for it ſeems to moſt men a wonder, when they ſee the creature, by an Occult im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted magnetical virtue of it's like, to be brought into a real activity,</p>
                  <p>As for example. The ingenerated magnetical, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential vertue, in Iron from the Loadſtone; in gold from Mercury; in Silver from Copper; and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently

in all the Metals, Minerals, Stones, Hearbs and Plants, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But here I may deſervedly ask, Which of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Philoſophers is ſo acute, to perceive by what means or obumbration the Imagination in any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with Child doth tinge venomous or monſtrous things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and diſpatcheth its work within a very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if it be brought to activity by any external object, I believe many will ſay, it is a Morto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical diveliſh work; but ſuch Bablers are afraid of the Reſplendency of the Eſſential Light of Truth, wherewith their Owl-like Eyes are lamentably af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. But as I may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

But are all men defective in their light of underſtanding, becauſe I or thou are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in knowledge, how the Powers Created to one and the ſame end may be brought into activity. Thouſands of ſuch things might be inſtanced; although thou doſt not know the ſplendor in the Angels, the candid brightneſs in the Heavens, the Perſpicuity in the air, the clear Limpidity in the waters, the variety of colours in the Flowers, the hardneſs in Stones and Metals, the Proportion in living Creatures, the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God in regenerated men, Faith in true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and Reaſon in the Soul: Yet is there in them ſuch a beauty, which very few mortals have through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceived, or plainly known.</p>
                  <p>Now why ſhould there not be ſuch an admirable
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99781:29"/>
virtue in the true Philoſophers Stone, which truly I have ſeen and known to be ſo. Yet hereby I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour not to perſwade the worthy and unworthy alike, to labour in this work. I rather dehort buſie ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, from this moſt perillous ſecret, like as from ſome Holy of Holies; Yea, let every diſcreet Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent be exceeding cautious in reading and keeping company with Sophiſticate falſe Philoſophers. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs to ſatisfie curious Naturaliſts, I ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate faithfully whatſoever was acted between <hi>Elias</hi> the Artiſt, and Me, concerning the nature of the Philoſophers Stone.</p>
                  <p>It is a thing much brighter then <hi>Aurora,</hi> or a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle, more ſplendid then the Sun or Gold, and more beautiful then the Moon or Silver; Inſomuch that this moſt recreating light, can never be blotted out of my mind, though it ſhould not be believed by Learned Fools, or Illiterate Aſſes, bubling nothing but the gloſs of haughty proud eloquence. For in this exulcerated old malignant Age, nothing can be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from ſlanderous Carpers; But all ſuch Batts and Bratts do err from Truth, and in progreſs of time vaniſh, miſerably enſnared in their own errors, yet our aſſertion ſhall ſtand till the very end of all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, being built upon the eternal foundation of Triumphant Truth. And although this Art be not yet known to all, the Adept do aſſert according to experience, That this natural Miſtery is only to be found with the great <hi>Jehovah,</hi> Saturninely placed in the Center of the World. In the interim, we account them happy, who by the help of art, are careful how they may waſh this Philoſophical Queen, and circulate the Catholick Virgin Earth, within a Magick, Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Chriſtalline Artifice; Nay, as <hi>Khunrade</hi> ſaith, they aone ſhall ſee the Philoſophers King crowned with

The which afterwards he poured upon one pound of common Lead in an open glaſs, diſh or platter, uſual for confections or conditures; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter two weeks there appeared a moſt curious Star of Silver, ſwimming upon it, as if it had been delineated with a Penſel and pair of Compaſſes by ſome ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Artiſt.

To which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, I never met with an Adept, or ſaw ſuch a Medicine, though I read much of it, and have wiſhed for it. Then I asked if he were a Phyſitian, but he preventing my queſtion, ſaid, he was a Founder of Braſs, yet from his youth learnt many rare things in Chymiſtry, of a friend particularly, the manner to extract out of Metals many Medicinal Arcana's by force of fire, and was ſtill a lover of it. After o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther large diſcourſe of experiments in Metals, This <hi>Elias</hi> asked me if I could know the Philoſophers Stone when I ſee it, I anſwered not at all, though I had read much of it in <hi>Paracelſus, Helmont, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilius,</hi> and others; yet dare I not ſay <hi>I</hi> could know the Philoſophers Matter. In the Interim he took out of his Boſome Pouch or Pocket, a neat Ivory Box, and out of it took three ponderous pieces or ſmall Lumps of the Stone, each about the bigneſs of a ſmall Wallnut tranſparent, of a paile Brimſtone colour, whereunto did ſtick the internal ſcales of the Crucible, wherein it appeared this moſt noble ſubſtance was melted; The value of them might be judged worth about Twenty Tuns of Gold, which when I had greedily ſeen and handled almoſt a quarter of an hour, and drawn from the owner many rare ſecrets of its admirable effects in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

and Metallick bodies, and other Magical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, I returned him this Treaſure of Treaſures; truly with a moſt ſorrowful mind, after the cuſtom of thoſe who conquer themſelves, yet (as was but juſt) very thankfully and humbly, I further deſired to know why the colour was yellow, and not red, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by colour, or purple, as Philoſophers write; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that was nothing, for the matter was mature and ripe enough. Then I humbly requeſted him to beſtow a little piece of the Medicine on me, in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual memory of him, though but the quantity of a Coriander or Hemp Seed, He preſently anſwered, Oh no, no, this is not lawful though thou wouldſt give me as many Duckets in Gold as would fill this room, not for the value of the matter, but for ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar conſequences, nay, if it were poſſible (ſaid he) that fire could be burnt of fire, I would rather at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant caſt all this ſubſtance into the fierceſt flames. But after he demanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if I had another private chamber, whoſe proſpect was from the publick Street, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently conducted him in to the beſt furniſhed room backwards, where he entred without wiping his Shooes (full of ſnow and dirt) according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom in <hi>Holland,</hi> then not doubting but he would beſtow part thereof, or ſome great ſecret treaſure on me, but in vain; for he asked for a little piece of gold and pulling off his Cloak or Paſtoral habit, opened his Doublet, under which he wore five pieces of Gold hanging in green ſilk Ribons, as large as the inward round of a ſmall Pewter Trencher: and this Gold ſo far excelled mine, that there was no compariſon, for flexibility and colour; and theſe Figures with the Inſcriptions ingraven, were the reſemblance of them, which he granted me to write out.</p>

I being herewith affected with great admiration, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know where and how he came by them. Who anſwered, An outlandiſh friend who dwelt ſome days in my Houſe (giving out he was a Lover of this art, and came to reveal this art to me) taught me various Arts; Firſt, How out of ordinary Stones and Chriſtalls, to make Rubies, Chryſolites and Sapphires, &amp;c. much fairer then the ordinary. And how in a quarter of an hour to make <hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> of which one doſe would infallibly cure the Peſtilential Diſſentary (or Bloody Flux) and how to make a metallick Liquor moſt certainly to cure all kinds of Dropſies in four days: as alſo a limpid clear water ſweeter then hony, by which in two hours of it ſelf, in hot ſand, it would extract the Tincture of <hi>Granats, Corals, Glaſſes,</hi> and ſuch like more, which I <hi>Helvetius</hi> did not obſerve. My mind being drawn beyond thoſe bounds, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how ſuch a noble juice might be drawn out of the metals, to tranſmute Metals; but the ſhade in the water deceived the dog of the Morſel of Fleſh in his mouth. Moreover he told me his ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter cauſed him to bring a glaſs full of rain water, and fetch ſome refined Silver laminated in thin plates, which therein was diſſolved within a quarter of an hour, like Ice when heated: And preſently he drank to me the half, and I pledged him the other half, which had not ſo much taſte as ſweet milk; whereby me thought I became very light hearted. I thereupon asked if this were a Philoſophical drink, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we drank this Potion? He replied I ought not to be ſo curious. And after he told me that by the ſaid Maſters directions, he took a piece of a Leaden Pipe, Gutter or Siſtern, and being melted put a little ſuch ſulphurious powder out of his Pocket, &amp; once
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99781:37"/>
again put a little more on the point of a Knife, and after a great blaſt of Bellows in ſhort time poured it on the red ſtones of the Kitchin Chimney, which proved moſt excellent pure Gold; which he ſaid brought him into ſuch a trembling amazement, that he could hardly ſpeak: But his Maſter thereupon again incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged him, ſaying, Cut for thy ſelf the ſixteenth part of this for a memorial, and the reſt give away amongſt the poor, which he did. And he diſtributed ſo great an Alms as he affirmed (if my memory fail not) to the Church of <hi>Sparrenda:</hi> But whether he gave it at ſeveral times or once, or in the Golden Maſſe, or in Silver Coyn, I did not ask. At laſt ſaid he <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>going on with the ſtory of his maſter, he taught me through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this almoſt Divine Art. As ſoon as this his Hiſtory was finiſht, I moſt humbly beg'd he would ſhew me the effect of Tranſmutation to confirm my faith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but he diſmiſſed me for that time in ſuch a diſcreet manner, that I had a denial. But withall promiſing to come again at three weeks end, and ſhew me ſome curious Arts in the Fire, and the manner of projecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, provided it were then lawful without prohibition. And at the three weeks end he came, and invited me abroad for an hour or two, and in our walks having diſcourſes of divers of natures ſecrets in the fire; but he was very ſparing of the great <hi>Elixir,</hi> gravely aſſerting, that was only to magnifie the moſt ſweet fame, and name of the moſt glorious God; and that few men indeavored to ſacrifice to him in good works, and this he expreſſed as a Paſtor or Miniſter of a Church; but now and then I kept his ears open, intreating to ſhew me the Metallick tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation; deſiring alſo he would think me ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to eat and drink and lodge at my houſe, which I did proſecute ſo eagerly, that ſcarce any Suiter could

plead more to obtain his Miſtreſs from his Corrival; but he was of ſo fixt and ſtedfaſt a Spirit, that all my endeavors were fruſtrate: yet I could not forbear to tell him further I had a fit laboratory, and things rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and fit for an experiment. and that a promiſed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour was a kind of debt; yea, true ſaid he, but I promiſed to teach thee at my return with this proviſo, if it were not forbidden.</p>
                  <p>When I perceived all this in vain, I earneſtly craved but a moſt ſmall Crum or Parcel of his pouder or Stone, to tranſmute four Grains of Lead to Gold; and at laſt out of his Philoſophical commiſeration, he gave me a Crum as big as a Rape or Turnip ſeed; ſaying, receive this ſmall Parcel of the greateſt Treaſure of the World, which truly few Kings or Princes have ever known or ſeen: But I ſaid, This perhaps will not tranſmit four Grains of Lead, whereupon he bid me deliver it him back, which in hopes of a greater Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel I did; but he cutting halfe off with his Nail, flung <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

which may tend to the ſingular honour of God, that ſo they may live in the Theoſophical truth, and not at all die Sophiſtically. After I made my confeſſion to him, that whilſt this Maſſe of his Medicine was in my hands, I indeavoured to ſcrape a little of it away with my Nail, and could not forbear; but ſcratcht off nothing, or ſo very little, that it was but as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible Atome, which being purged from my Nail, and wrapt in a Paper; I projected on Lead, but found no tranſmutation; but almoſt the whole Maſſe of Lead flew away, and the remainder turned into a meer glaſſy Earth; at which unexpected paſſage, he ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſaid, thou art more dextrous to commit Theft, then to apply thy Medicine; for if thou hadſt only wraped up thy ſtollen prey in Yellow Wax, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it from the ariſing fumes of Lead, it would have penitrated to the bottom of the Lead, and tranſmuted it to Gold; but having caſt it into the fumes, partly by vi lence of the vaprous fumes, and partly by the Sympathetick alliance, it carryed thy Medicine quite away: For Gold, Silver, Quick-ſilver, and the like Metals, are corrupted and turn brittle like to Glaſs, by the Vapours of Lead.

any; for as for the matter, out of which our Magiſtery is made, I would have thee know there is only two Metals and Minerals, out of which it is prepared; but in regard the Sulphur of Philoſophers is much more plentiful and abundant in the Minerals; therefore it is made out of the Minerals. Then I asked again, What was the <hi>Menſtrum,</hi> and whether the operation or working were done in Glaſſes, or Cruſibles? He anſwered, the <hi>Menſtrum</hi> was a Heavenly Salt, or of a Heavenly Virtue, by whoſe benefit only the wiſe men diſſolve the Earthly Metallick body, and by ſuch a ſolution is eaſily and inſtantly brought forth the moſt Noble <hi>Elixir</hi> of Philoſophers. But in a Cruſible is all the operation done and performed, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the very end, in an open fire, and all the whole work is no longer from the very firſt to the laſt then four days, and the whole work no more charge then three Florens; and further, neither the Mineral, out of which, nor the Salt, by which it was performed, was of any great price. And when I replyed, the Philoſophers affirm in their writings, that ſeven or nine Months at the leaſt, are required for this work.

And Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly attributing the error of my projecting the grand theft of his powder in the dirt of my Nail to his charge, becauſe it tranſmuted not the Lead that time; And laſtly, becauſe he gave me too ſmall a proportion of his ſaid Medicine (as I thought) to work upon ſo great a quantity of Lead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as he pretended and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for it, Saying further to my ſelf, I fear, I fear indeed this man hath deluded me; Nevertheleſs my wife wrapped the ſaid matter in Wax, and I cut halfe an Ounce, or ſix Drams of old Lead, and put into a Cruſible in the fire, which being melted, my wife put in the ſaid Medicine made up into a ſmall Pill or But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, which preſently made ſuch a hiſſing and bubling in its perfect operation, that within a quarter of an hour all the maſſe of Lead was totally tranſmuted into the beſt and fineſt Gold, which made us all amazed as Planets ſtruck. And indeed (had I lived in <hi>Ovids</hi> Age) there could not have been a rarer Metamorphoſis then this, by the Art of Alkemy. Yea, could I have enjoyed <hi>Argus</hi>'s Eyes, with a hundred more, I could not ſufficiently gaze upon this ſo admirable and almoſt miraculous a work of nature; for this melted Lead (after projection) ſhewed us on the fire the rareſt and moſt beautiful Colours imaginable; yea, and the greeneſt Colour, which as ſoon as I poured forth into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n Ingot, it got the lively freſh Colour of Blood; and being Cold ſhined as the pureſt and moſt refined tranſplendent Gold. Truly I, and all ſtanding about me, were exceedingly ſtartled, and did run with this Aurified lead (being yet hot) unto the Goldſmith, who wondred at the fineneſs, and after a ſhort trial of Touch, the judged it moſt excellent Gold in the whole
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99781:40"/>
world, and offered to give moſt willingly fifty Florens for every Ounce of it.</p>
                  <p>The next day a rumor went about the <hi>Hague,</hi> and ſpread abroad; ſo that many illuſtrious Perſons and Students gave me their friendly viſits for its ſake: Amongſt the reſt the general Say-maſter, or Examiner of the Coynes of this Province of <hi>Holland,</hi> Mr. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius,</hi> who with others earneſtly beſeeched me to paſs ſome part of it through all their Cuſtomary trials, which I did, the rather to gratifie my own Curioſity. Thereupon we went to Mr. <hi>Brectel</hi> a Silver-Smith, who firſt tried it <hi>per Quartam, viz.</hi> he mixt three or four parts of Silver with one part of the ſaid Gold, and laminated, filed, or gramilated it, and put a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Aqua Fort</hi> thereto, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſſolved the Silver, and ſuffered the ſaid Gold to precipitate to the bottom; which being decauted off, and the Calx or Powder of Gold dulcified with water, and then reduced and melted into a body, became excellent Gold: And whereas we feared loſs, we found that each Dram of the ſaid firſt Gold was yet increaſed, and had tranſmuted a Scruple of the ſaid Silver into Gold, by reaſon of its great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent abounding Tincture.</p>
                  <p>But now doubting further whether the Silver was ſufficiently ſeparated from the ſaid Gold, we inſtantly mingled it with ſeven parts of Antimony, which we melted &amp; poured into a Cone, &amp; blowed off the <hi>Regulus</hi> on a Teſt, where we miſſed eight Grains of our Gold; but after we blowed away the reſt of the Antimony, or ſuperfluous <hi>Scoria,</hi> we found nine Grains of Gold more for our eight Grains miſſing, yet this was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what pale and Silver-like, which eaſily recovered its full Colour afterwards; So that in the beſt proof of fire we loſt nothing at all of this Gold; but gained as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99781:40"/>
aforeſaid. The which proof again I repeated thrice, and found it ſtill alike, and the ſaid remaining Silver out of the <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> was of the very beſt flexible Silver that could be; So that in the total, the ſaid Medicine (or <hi>Elixir)</hi> had tranſmuted ſix Drams and two Scruples of the Lead and Silver, into moſt pure Gold.</p>
                  <p>Behold I have now related the full Hiſtory, from the Philoſophical Eggs to the <hi>Golden</hi> Apples, (as the Proverb goes) and though I have the Gold, yet where the Philoſopher and <hi>Elias</hi> is I know not; but whereſoever he is the Almighty God (protector of all Creatures) ſhelter him from all danger under hiswings; and bring him to Eternal bliſs and happineſs in his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdom, after the end of his full pilgrimage in this life, for the ſuccour and relief of Chriſtendome. and the whole world, Amen.</p>

Kingdom. But Sir? For what end ſo many Medicaments? when by a moſt few we may much ſooner and ſafelyer reſtore the health of man, if the diſtemper be not deadly, either out of defect of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or putrifaction of any noble part, or the whole conſumption of the radical humidity; for in ſuch deſperate caſes neither Galenical Cures, nor Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Tinctures can be helpful; but it is not thus in ordinary diſeaſes, where nevertheleſs often men are conſtrained before their fatal Term, to travail out of this moſt ſweet light amongſt the dead, for want of ſpeedy and potent remedies.</p>

                     <p>Truly I am only a Founder of Braſs, yet almoſt from my Cradle my <hi>Genius</hi> prompted me to ſearch Curioſities in the fiery Art, and I have dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſearched through the internal nature of Metals, and though now I forbear aſſidual labour and accurate Scrutiny, yet ſuch labours and lovers are delightful to me; and I believe the moſt high, great and good God, will in this our Age afford his Spagyrick Sons the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallick myſteries <hi>gratis</hi> yet, by praying, and labouring to attain them.</p>

                     <speaker>Phyſician.</speaker>
                     <p>I grant God affords his commendable good things <hi>gratis,</hi> yet he hath ſeldom given or doth eaſily ſell to his Sons this Medicinal <hi>Nectar</hi> for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:99781:42"/>
For we know certainly that infinite numbers of Chymiſts have and do ſtill draw water through a Sieve, whilſt they preſume to prepare the univerſal Stone of Philoſophers, and out of the Books of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing Adeptiſts, none can learn the manner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it, or know their firſt matter. And whilſt one ſearcheth on the loweſt root and foot of the Mountain, he never aſcends to the higheſt top, where only he can eat and drink the <hi>Ambroſia</hi> and <hi>Nectar</hi> of the <hi>Macro-Sophiſts</hi> or Philoſophers. In the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim it is the part of a good Phyſician, for want of that univerſal <hi>Elixir,</hi> to keep a pure and ſafe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and apply to diſeaſes ſuch reſtoring remedies in which he certainly finds the effect and Virtue of Curing them. Therefore in all deſprate Diſeaſes I uſe ſuch moſt ſimple Medicaments, that the Patients either ſpeedily recover, or are brought into ſome way of their former better health.</p>
                     <p>For there are various kinds of Salts generated in the Glandules and Lymphatick Veſſels, after the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction of this or that received nouriſhment, which afterwards flouriſh out in various humours, and cauſe either internal or external diſtempers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teacheth us, that as many conſtitutions or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions, ſo many diverſities of Diſeaſes, although it be the very ſame Diſeaſe in general. As we have experience in them who drink Wine, where divers operations preſently manifeſt themſelves.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Peter</hi> having drunk Wine, preſently begins to be angry and furious on the contrary: <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to have a Lamblike timidity; but <hi>Matthew</hi> ſings, and <hi>Luke</hi> weeps.</p>

                     <p>From the contagious Scorbutical poiſon, the Radical Juice of <hi>Peter</hi> in his Lymphatick Veſſels and Kernels is turned into Acidity, which abſtructs
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99781:42"/>
the paſſages and Organs of all the whole body. From whence ſprings up under the skin diſcolourd Azure or Skie-colour ſpots; but in the time of the Plague they bud forth in the likeneſs of Cornes of Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
                     <p>But the Juice of the ſame parts in <hi>Paul</hi> is changed into an opening bitterneſs from whence in the skin grow red ſpots under the Arms and Legs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like unto flea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites; but in the plague time Carbuncles.</p>
                     <p>But the Juice or humidity of the ſame parts in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> is turned ſomewhat ſweet and eaſie to be putrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whence bud forth under the skin watry Tumors on his Arms and Legs, the like almoſt you may ſee in Hydropical Patients; but in the peſtilence riſeth peſtilential Tumors.</p>
                     <p>But of the ſame parts in <hi>Luke,</hi> the Juice is changed into a ſharpe ſalty drineſs, whence come forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the skin of his Arms and Legs, precipitations of the ordinary ferment of the fleſh, and ſuch exſicca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as commonly fall out in the conſumtive Atrophia; yea; moſt often into the true Atrophia: But in the Plague, come forth moſt ardent ſwellings, with diſtractedneſs until death.</p>
                     <p>Behold my friend! No Phyſician, by one univerſal Medicine can Cure this only Diſeaſe of the Scorbutick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtilential or Febrile-poyſon, but indeed by means of a particular Vegetable or Mineral granted in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from God, we may; for I can ſuccour and handle all Scorbutical patients, with one Scorbutical Herb, as Scurvy-graſs, or Sorrel, or Fumitary, or <hi>Baccabungia,</hi> called Brooklime or Red Coleworts; yea, much leſs can we ſuccour them with one remedy compounded of all theſe divers ſpecies; for as much as there is ſuch an Antipathy between Scurvy-graſs and Sorrel, as there is between fire and water, and the ſame
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99781:43"/>
Antipathy is alſo obſerved between the Herb Fumita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and <hi>Baccabungy:</hi> Therefore</p>
                     <p>The Corrector of <hi>Peters</hi> Scorbutical, colouring Salty, and ſower Poyſon, is made with the bitter Volatile Salt of the Herb Scurvy-graſs.</p>
                     <p>The Corrector of <hi>Pauls</hi> Scorbutick, tinging, ſalty and bitter poyſon, is made with the fixt ſowr Salt of the Herb Sorel.</p>
                     <p>And the Corrector of <hi>Mathew's</hi> Scorbutick ſalty tinging ſweet and moiſtening poyſon, is made with the help of the fixt bitter and drying Sulphur of the Herb Fumitary.</p>
                     <p>But the Corrector of <hi>Luke's</hi> Scorbutical Tingent, Salty, ſharp and drying poyſon, is made by the help of the ſweet moiſtening <hi>Mercury</hi> of the Herb <hi>Bacca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bungy,</hi> Brooklime or Red Coleworts: As out of the External ſignature of thoſe Herbs is very eaſie to judge the ſpecifick internal remedy, againſt theſe divers Scorbutical Diſeaſes. Verily my feiend; if this be well obſerved, a prudent Phyſician will doubt of the univerſal Medicine.</p>

In the interim it is not at all impoſſible that there is alſo in the Kingdom of Minerals (being the higheſt) an univerſal Medicine, by whoſe only benifit we may effect and afford all which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted by thee of many Remedies out of the lower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Kingdom of Vegetables. But our moſt great and good God for ſome weighty Reaſons, hath not given this kind of magnificent Chariſmal gift or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent Science promiſcuouſly to all Philoſophers; but hath revealed the ſame to a few, though all the Adeptiſts agree that this Science is true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that none ought to doubt of the truth thereof in the leaſt.</p>

                     <p>Sir beſides the mentioned things, there are yet other obſervations ſtrenuouſly oppoſing the operation of an univerſal medicine; Partly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto mens age and ſtrength; Partly by reaſon of the Sex, and other circumſtances, whilſt there is a plain difference between the tender and ſtrong: Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by nature or education, and between the male and the female; young man and maid; and between the beginning, middle, or end of the diſeaſe; And it muſt be known if the diſeaſe be inveterate, or but lately have invaded the party; and laſtly, if the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this diſeaſe be promoted, or in another be precipitated: For the Effervency of the Ferment is made in the Stomack, or inteſtines, and indeed many contradictions are againſt the Univerſal Medicine, and few Phiſitians have <hi>Thomas a Didymus</hi> Spectacles at their fingers ends.</p>

                     <p>You have argued very Philoſophically; for ſo many men, ſo many minds. And as ſweet Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick pleaſeth not every <hi>Mydas</hi> ears, or the ſame meats and drinks pleaſe every Pallate: So the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of unskilful perſons are very different concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Univerſal Medicine, both for humane and Metallick Bodies: And certainly the operation of this differs much from particular Medicines; Some where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of nevertheleſs are in a manner univerſal, or ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, as the Herb Scurvygraſs, curing all ſorts of the Scurvy, marked with Azure ſpots; Sorrel, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Scurvy with red ſpots; Beccabungia (red Coleworts or Brooklime) Atrophia, or the Conſumptive kind: and Fumitary Tumors of another kind: Eſpecially with ſuch Phiſicians to whom the aboveſaid obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are in high eſteem. Beſides there is a vaſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the univerſal Medicine of true Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, which revives all the vital ſpirits, and the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99781:44"/>
particular Medicament of a ſlight cure; where only the venome of humours boyling againſt nature (in this man ſowre; in another bitter, &amp;c. and in one Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in another ſharp) is corrected: and if theſe corruptions be not preſently removed by the uſual Emunctories of Mouth, Noſtrils, Stool, Urine, or Sweat; then certainly the Corruption of one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets another diſeaſe; for every ſpark of Fire having food, and not quencht, will ariſe to the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration But if there be a defect in the motions of the Vital Spirits, then this is impoſſible to be effected by particulars; wherefore it concerns every conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious Phiſitian to learn how he may promote the motion of the vital ſpirits, to a natural digeſtible heat, which is moſt ſecurely and beſt performed by our u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Medicine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which the ſick are notably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created; for as ſoon as this more then perfect Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine removes the mortifying ſeeds, Nature is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, and ſo loſt health recovered; and that only by a harmonious Sympathy between it and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Spirits; Wherefore the Adept do call it the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, of Nature, defence of old Age, and againſt all Sickneſſes, yea, of the very Plague and Peſtilence; For this being a kind of <hi>Salamander,</hi> communicates its virtue and (as a Salamander) makes a man live till his laſt appointed time againſt all the Fiery Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical Darts of the angry Heavens or their Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent Influences.</p>

                     <p>Sir! I underſtand by your diſcourſe, That this Medicine doth nothing to the correcting of depraved or corrupt humours, but only by ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Vital Spirits, and our Balſamick Nature; but other practical Chymiſts teach how to ſeperate he impure from the pure, and ripen the unripe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> o make the bitter become a little ſower or Acid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:99781:44"/>
and the ſower ſweet, and ſo to turn ſharp into mild<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mild into ſharp, ſower into ſweet, and ſweet into ſower. Alſo I underſtand you ſay this univerſal me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine cannot prolong life beyond its prefixed time, but only preſerves it from all venome and deadly ſickneſs, which agrees with the vulgar belief, That the Life depends only upon the will of God. But paſſing by theſe things, my queſtion is ſtill, whether a mans former nature may be converted into another new nature? So that a ſlothful man, may be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into a diligent nimble man and a Melancholy man by nature be made a merry man; or the like.</p>

                     <speaker>Elias,</speaker>
                     <p>Not at all Sir, for no Medicine hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to transform the nature of man in ſuch a manner, no more then wine drunk by divers men changeth the perſons nature, but only provokes or deduceth what is in man potentially into Act; For the univerſal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine works by recreating the vital ſpirits, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoreth that health which was ſuppreſſed for a time. In the ſame manner the heat of the Sun never tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutes the Hearbs and Flowers, but ſtirs up their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential powers to become active. For a man of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly temper is again raiſed up to his natural me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy diſpoſition, and a merry man to become merry. And ſo in all deſperate diſeaſes, it is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and moſt excellent preſervative. Nay if there could be any prolonging of Life. Then <hi>Hermes, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſus, Treviſan,</hi> and many others having had the ſaid Medicine would never have undergone the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of death, but have prolonged their lives perhaps to this very day: It were therefore the part of a mad Lunatick to believe that any Medicine in the world could prolong life longer then God limits.</p>

all you have ſaid touching the Univerſal Medicine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no leſs regular then fundamental; Yet till I can prepare the ſame my ſelf, it profits me not: Indeed ſome Illuſtrious men have written of it ſo cautiouſly in dark Aenygma s, that very few can underſtand their progreſs to the end; and if one could purchaſe all theſe Authors, this ſhort life might be therein conſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med, and not attain the thing.

And <hi>Van Helmonts</hi> experiment proves the ſame, But eſpecially <hi>Alexander Scotus,</hi> and <hi>Count Ruſſes</hi> Experiment, well known at <hi>Prague,</hi> and as here you may ſee the inſcriptiors done before the Roman Emperour <hi>Caeſar Ferdinando</hi> the Third; Where with one grain of Tincture were tranſmuted three pound of Mercury into the nobleſt pure gold. Yet I confeſs I never ſaw a true Adep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, or projection made, and therefore cannot ſo abſolutely conclude theſe things to be true.</p>

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99781:48"/>
to multiply the ſame, in their golden or ſilvery Homogenity. For we ſee that the bodies of all creatures are not only eaſily deſtroyed, but as ſoon as they ceaſe to live, they hurry to their graves in putrefaction, <hi>viz.</hi> to their old Chaos and darkneſs of <hi>Orcus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>THus my Friend <hi>Elias</hi> taking leave, left me three weeks, and to this very day; nevertheleſs, (as a Spur) he impreſſed all theſe things deep in my mind, and <hi>Paracelſus</hi> confirmed them, ſaying, That in, with, of, and by metals ſpiritualized and cleanſed, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Metals made, and alſo the living gold and Silver of Philoſophers, as well for humane as metallick bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.

Wherefore if this gueſt my Friend, had taught me the manner of preparing this Spiritual and Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Salt he ſpake of, by and with which <hi>I</hi> might (as it were) within their own matrix, gather the ſpiritual Rays of Sun or moon, out of the Corporal Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſubſtances, Then truly from his own light he had ſo enlightened me, that <hi>I</hi> ſhould have known how Magnetically (by a Sympathetick power) in other imperfect corporeal metals, their internal ſouls might be Clarified and Tinged, ſo that their own ſimilary bodies being of like kind, might be tranſmuted into Gold or Silver, according to the nature of red Seed, into a red body; or of the white Seed into a white and pure body; For <hi>Elias</hi> told me that <hi>Sendivogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> his Calybs was the true Mercurial Metallick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, by help of which (without any Corroſive) an Artiſt might ſeperate the fixt rayes of the Sun or Moon, out from their own bodies, in a naked Fire, in open Cruſible, and ſo make them Volatile and Mercurial, fit for a dry Philoſophick Tincture (as he partly communicated and ſhewed me before he went) to tranſmute the Metals For all learned Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts muſt conſent, that <hi>Pyrotechny</hi> is the mother and Nurſe of many noble Sciences and Arts, and they can eaſily judge from the Colours of the Chaos of metals in the fire, what metallick body is therein. And truly, every day, metals and tranſparent ſtones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are yet ſo procreated in the bowels of the Earth, from their proper, noble, vapourons ſeed, with a ſpiritual Tingent Sulphurous Seed, in their divers Salty Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trixes; for the common Sulphur, (or the Sulphur of any pure or impure metal, whilſt yet conjoyned with its own body) being mingled only with Salt-Peter in the burning heat of Fire, will be eaſily changed into

Almoſt ſo likewiſe is a Chicken generated and hatcht out of the white of an Egg, by a gentle natural heat; and thus alſo from the ſeminal Bond of Life of any metal, is made a new and much more noble metal, by a heat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to a ſalty fires nature, Though few Chymiſts know perfectly how the internal virtues of metals (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways magnetically moving according to their harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or diſconſonancy) are diſtinguiſhed; and why one metal hath ſuch a ſingular Sympathy or Antipathy with the other metal, as is ſeen in the Magnet with Iron, in Mercury with Gold, in Silver with Copper, very remarkably.

                  <p>TAke four ounces of Sand or Flints, or other Stones, neal them red hot in a Cruſible, and quench them in cold water, and ſo they become tractable to be beaten or ground to powder.

rather ſome ſpirit of Urine, and it will ſo mortifie the <hi>Aqua Regis,</hi> that the Gold will preſently precipitate in a yellow Powder to the bottom; Cant off the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and waſh the ſaid Gold with more freſh water till the powder of Gold be ſweet and perfectly clean; after dry it very warily, elſe the ſaid Gold will ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate with that force as to break the glaſs in pieces, and whatſoever elſe is about it. But if you mix a little powder of vulgar brimſtone to the ſaid Calx or Powder of Gold, and let it glow in a glaſed Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, then it will not fulminate at all. After this mix therewith ſome Borax and reduce it in a Cruſible. And thus you may know what quantity of Gold is contained in the reſt of the Sand or Flints of that nature. <hi>N.

Now in ſuch a caſe you need not preſently mix the ſaid calx of Gold with Borax, becauſe both the Gold and Iron would be reduced together, and ſo would be adulterate, and diſappoint you of your expectation in that Trial; But ſuch mixt Gold muſt be ſeparated from the Iron on the Teſt with Lead, and ſo your proof will be good and without error.</p>
                  <p>There is another ſort of trial and proof of Sand, flints, and Stones, &amp;c. But ſince this way is eaſie and ſufficient, we ſhall reſt herein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>N. B.</hi> Yet my Councel is, inſtead of <hi>Aqua Regis,</hi> to make uſe of Spirit of Salt, which will be cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, with <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> and ♂ for a Loadſtone, and Antimony for the flux.</p>
                  <p>Now learn the difference of natural, corporal, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Gold, and that which is volatil and ſpiritual, which is the <hi>Primum ens Auri,</hi> or firſt beginning of G ld. ☞ Conſider therefore that corporal gold by
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99781:58"/>
corroſive waters or ſalts, is eaſily extracted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, but the ſpiritual is not ſo.</p>
                  <p>But now the reaſon that corporal gold, by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid proofs and experiments, is always<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> extracted and drawn forth, and happens upon this account, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the ſaid white ſand there may be no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral gold at all, yet by the aforeſaid proofs, ſome is extracted, though truly not much, nor more then the Silver was which the Lead contained which was uſed in the ſaid Trials. Note therefore that the ſaid ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the melting, drew the ſaid ſpiritual gold out of the ſaid flints, ſtones, or ſand; ſo that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it became ting'd and tranſmuted into corporal gold; the which was very apparent hereby, for that no more gold was found then the quantity of Silver contained within the ſaid Lead; and as it was in the other parcel of common Lead, uſed in that Trial; for if more corporal gold had been in the Sand or Lead, it muſt neceſſarily have exceeded the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Silver in the ſaid Lead, for the Silver contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſaid Lead, mixt with the ſaid Flints, could not fly away in the air, to leave room only for ſo much corporal gold, and therefore the cauſe that the Silver remained not Silver (as in the common Lead was) that it was tranſmuted and turned to Gold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the Tincture, and ſpiritual gold drawn out of the firſt <hi>Ens</hi> of ſand, ſtones, and flints; and muſt be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to the ſaid firſt Ens or ſpiritual gold contained in the ſaid ſand, ſtones or flints.</p>
                  <p>Now I have written this book only for the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of corporal gold out of ſand, ſtones, and flints, &amp;c but we leave the ſpiritual gold for the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, that they may make their Stone out of it.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, <hi>N. B.</hi> Whoever ſeeks to draw gold
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99781:59"/>
out of ſand, ſtones, and flints, &amp;c. Let them chuſe ſuch ſtones, ſand, &amp;c. out of which they may draw cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral gold, with good profit which the Womb of common, white ſand, and flints cannot bear or bring forth.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon nevertheleſs, I wiſht you to take white ſand or flints, &amp;c. to make experiments and trals, was becauſe every one might ſee, that in all kind of ſand, good gold is contained, though out of all it cannot be profitably extracted, by reaſon the white ſand and flints, &amp;c. are often without corporal gold, but never without ſpiritual gold, by the which nevertheleſs ſilver may be tinged, and tranſmuted into good gold, as may plainly appear by and in the aforeſaid practice and tryals.</p>
                  <p>But now the Philoſophers ſeek not corporal gold but ſpiritual, and they will know where, and in what ſubjects the ſpiritual or firſt eſſence of gold is moſt plentifully contained, and how to get the ſame with eaſe. Therefore although the ſaid firſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of gold be in white ſand, and white flints, &amp;c. yet the ſaid Philoſophers will not meddle with that ſo willingly, nor will any expert true Philoſophers, tye themſelves ſo to one ſubject, as not to uſe any other thing to get their Tincture; To whom it is well known that the firſt eſſence of gold is found in every thing throughout the whole earth; for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is any Sulphur, there may be had the firſt eſſence of Gold to have their Tincture. But now in all Vegetables, Animals, and Minerals, there is a Sulphur certainly known and found, Therefore in all parts of the world, the matter of the Philoſophers ſtone may be had every where: ſo that the Poor may have the ſame without charge, no leſs then the rich, according to what the Philoſophers doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99781:59"/>
ſaying their matter is every were, and you may have the ſame in any parts of the world without money, and it meets you, and is trod on under feet, and caſt out on the Dunghils; for ſo the true Philoſophers do ſay, and write. Alſo a true Philoſopher will not require or need much Gold for his Medicine; for if he have but halfe an ounce which he brings to perfection, it will ſuffice for his whole life, and be in in his power to multiply, and bring it to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as often as he pleaſe; and neceſſity ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
                  <p>So that it may eaſily be demonſtrated, that not only Gold, but ſomewhat more rare <hi>(viz:)</hi> the true Tincture is in Stones, which the Ancients did intimate in theſe words. <hi>Auro quid melius Jaſpis,</hi> &amp;c What is better then Gold, a <hi>Jaſper Stone,</hi> &amp;c. So</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paracelſus</hi> exceedingly commends <hi>Red-Talc, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats, Antimony,</hi> and <hi>Lapis Lazuli;</hi> expreſſing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the Tincture or firſt Eſſence of Gold may be gotten out by ſublimation, &amp;c. Take notice alſo further, that the firſt Eſſence of Gold may be found in any other ſmall or meaner ſtones, and amongſt the firſt and chief of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Blood ſtone, <hi>Sythydis, Magneſia, Pedemontana, Emery,</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>In the which alſo it is ſo fixt, that to poſſeſs it there needs no other art, but the manner of extracting it, and giving it ingreſs by Gold. On the other ſide, the firſt <hi>Ens</hi> of Gold, in the Vegitable, Animal, and Mineral Sulphurs, <hi>Marcaſites</hi> and <hi>Antimony</hi> are had in plenty; but are ſo Volatil, that thoſe little ſtones are to be preferred.</p>
                  <p>But now in brief I ſhall ſhew, that in ſtones (of which hot Countries hath moſt Gold) there is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixt Gold, but alſo Volatil; whence the true Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99781:60"/>
may be perfected: For whoever can make the firſt Eſſence of Gold that is in ſtones Volatil, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it by diſtillation, doth get a graduating water by which our quick fluid Mercury or Quick-ſilver may be coagulated to good Gold. And whoever can joyn, and marry this Volatil firſt Eſſence of Gold to Corporal Gold, and this with that to be made one, and procure Ingreſſion, he may hope for far more good, and may expect undoubtedly to enjoy the ſame to a better uſe and profit: For that the firſt Eſſence of gold is more uſeful and needful to prepare the Tinctures then Corporal gold it ſelf, as not a few Philoſophers have ſignified by the following words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who ſay, <hi>Gold and Silver are not made by them, unleſs this firſt Eſſence do effect it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt <hi>Ens</hi> alſo of Gold, which lies hid in all Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitables and Animals, doth Coagulate Mercury, even to Yallowneſs, but not conſtant and fixt; but if it be made fixt, it alſo fixeth and Coagulateth with conſtancy, but doth not ſo before. It remains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt aſſured true, that where ever Sulphur is found, there is alſo the firſt Eſſence of Gold, and where the firſt eſſence of Gold is, there is alſo the Tincture; wherefore, being Sulphur is found in every thing of the world, to the leaſt Herb, Stone, and Bone. It follows that alſo out of any little Herb, piece of Wood, little Stone and Bone &amp;c. the true Tincture may be prepared.</p>

                  <p>But however whilſt I live, (by Gods Grace and Providence) I ſhall be helpful to my neighbour, by uſing my Talent to ſerve them, and like a moſt bright ſhining Light will ſhew the wonderful great myſtery of God, to the Ignorant and ſimple people, againſt the will of all the enemies of Truth, though they fret and vex never ſo much at it, I have reſolved ſo to do; Yea, behold though my adverſaries ſhould all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire and wholly devour me alive, they ſhould ſwallow but a mean or lean Morſel of Earth; for <hi>Glauber</hi> ſhould be and remain <hi>Glauber</hi> ſtill, till the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the World or Ages; now if theſe men were of the ancient ſtamp and frame of faith and virtue, they would not detract and ſcandalize their Innocent neighbour, without deſerving ill at their hands.</p>

                  <p>Now further I ſay; although every one ſhould uſe this Extraction of Gold for their Imployment or Trade, yet the one would not be a hindrance to the benefit of the other, by reaſon Stones and Sand are obvious to every body in all Countries, as alſo the Salts that are uſeful to extract the ſame are plentiful, ſo that nothing is wanting but a lover of the work to ſet his hand unto it.</p>

                     <hi>Solomon</hi> writ not from the purpoſe ſaying that great virtue was in Herbs, Woods and Stones: For that which is fixt in Stones is Volatil in Herbs. As in my little Treatiſe Printed 1663. demonſtrated; although the firſt <hi>Ens</hi> of Gold (whence Gold may be made) be in both.</p>
                  <p>We read alſo in <hi>Eſdras</hi> there is much Earth to Veſſels or Pots; but a little pouder or duſt to make Gold. And all ſorts of Earth are not ſo rich to gain by Extraction of Gold, nor it is to be thought that all Stones and Sand and every one are ſo rich in Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Gold as to yield any profit; yet they ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the firſt <hi>Ens</hi> of Gold, or yield ſuch a Calx, by which (or the help thereof) good Gold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may be made; the which Calx or Pouder, if we knew how to extract and order, we would make greater accompt, and eſteem it more then of Gold it ſelf. Now ſince ſuch an Aurifying, or Goldma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Pouder is ſo largely extended and diffuſed in Stones and Sand, &amp;c. Yet it is not eaſy to beat it or
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99781:64"/>
force it out with a Hammer, but only by a peculiar Art, is to be extracted, and perfected; thereupon the blind multitude of covetus Gold hunters will not believe it no more then Ignorants, who knows nothing of the Art; and yet this art hath been always e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed amongſt Philoſophers as their greateſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of Secrets, and ſo hath been preſerved amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>Alſo where <hi>Paracelſus</hi> writes of the firſt Ens or Eſſence of Gold, he tells us it may be drawn forth by ſublimation; and <hi>Baſilius Valentinus</hi> alſo tells us, That the preparation of the Univerſal Tincture, may be compared to the diſtillation or extraction of the burning ſpirit of wine from the Lees, and may ſo be obtained; Oh friends, this is truly a ſufficient clear compariſon; for as in a great quantity of Lees of Wine or Beer, a little of the good ſpirit is hidden and the reſidue is a uſeleſs mud; and yet that little quantity of ſpirit is drawn out with profit by means of Diſtillation out of that great quantity of mud or Faeces, and is thereby concentrated into a little room, and withall is ſo virtuous and piercing a ſpirit that one ſpoonful thereof is more worth, then the whole Runlet or Veſſel full of Faeces. Now by ſuch ways or means would the Philoſophers have us draw forth and extract the <hi>Primum Ens</hi> or Form of Gold by art, out of Stones and Sand, though diſperſed and diffuſed far abroad in them, and ſo to concentrate their virtue and Tincture into a ſmall compaſs, of the which a very ſmall quantity (if but as big as a Pea) is of more worth and value, then a great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of uſeleſs and unprofitable dead Earth.</p>
                  <p>Further, I would not conceal this from thee, that throughout all <hi>Germany</hi> by, and in the Rivers are found ſtones, the which abound with Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99781:64"/>
and are ſufficiently rich; and if you beat or break them to pieces, you will find within ſome of them ſome little holes, pits, or concavities, with a yellow or fusky dark powder, which being melted with Borax will yield a ſilvery Gold, I muſt avouch and affirm I never ſaw or knew any mortal man, that underſtood or obſerved thoſe ſtones before, much leſs the golden powder hid in them; which without doubt is by reaſon of mens careleſneſs to find out the Phyſical great myſteries of God.</p>
                  <p>Here now I muſt admoniſh all men, that it were of great conſequence and concernment for Parents to place their Children to be trained up in their youth, with ſome honeſt Artiſt, or workman to teach them that, which in caſe of neceſſity might gain them an honeſt and commendable livelihood. But the rich having a plentiful eſtate, think they ſhall leave enough for their Children, never to want; yet if one misfortune or another happens upon them, or upon their Children, as Burning of Houſes, or Ships, or Goods loſt by Pyrats or Thieves, or Creditors fail, or Ships miſcarry, Then whither to turn or what courſe to take they know not, but only to fly away, or live like Vagabonds, or fill a Gaol; and all this for want of ſome laudable Art learnt in their youth. And thus they become deſperate, The one forſakes Wife and Children to Travel to the <hi>Indies,</hi> where not a few are devoured by beaſts or Canibals, ſome drowned or ſtarved, others ſell themſelves or become Souldiers, and like mad Dogs at laſt are ſlain; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers after they have ſpent their means cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt or provide for their family, and ſo become vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous livers, and have a miſerable doleful life, till they periſh and go to hell. All which might have been avoided by learning ſome good mechanick Arts in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99781:65"/>
their youth, or flouriſhing conditions. But when dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and raging times approach, or that too many be of a Trade in a City, the one beggers the other, and ſo there is no remedy but phyſick which may likewiſe fail. But a Phyſitian might learn ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe that would get a livelyhood, beſides his practice, Then he need not make ſo many viſits to gape for his fees of his poor diſtreſſed Patients: And ſo the Lawyer need not for baſe Profit ſell the Law or their Clients Cauſe to prepare himſelf a ſeat in Hell, where afterwards to dwell for ever. Nor the Divine be afraid of his Patrons, or Benefactors, and ſo ſooth them up in their ſins, but preach the truth to all without flattery, and ſo prefer Gods honour, and the peoples real good, with a true zeal before his private profit, to the hazard of his ſoul. So alſo of all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Now having declared or toucht this matter, I am paſſing and go away ſighing and mourning, That the Genuine Hermetick Philoſophy and Medicine, is ſo little practiced or eſteemed, as alſo the natural true Alchymy (and not adulterate) which genuine Art is the Queen of all Arts, and ſhall remain ſo to the worlds end.</p>
                  <p>When as therefore this art of extracting ſand and ſtones, is ſo great a treaſure and uſeful as we have heard, and careleſly kickt by men at their feet every where; why do we not rather extract them to nouriſh our ſelves and families, and defend us from the injuries of the times, handſomly and honeſtly. Why do we not I ſay leave the <hi>Indies</hi> to their own Inhabitants, and mannage our own Countries or earth in <hi>Europe</hi> where we dwell, where is abundantly ſufficient to ſuſtaine us, for whatever we want; I cannot but again and again ingeniouſly confeſs, that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99781:65"/>
if it were poſſible to renew my youth, or call back but ten years, I would not neglect publickly to profeſs and teach the true Philoſophy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Medicine, and Alchymy, and ſo make it to be known demonſtratively. But the ſand of my glaſs is almoſt run, and my day far ſpent, ſo that I cannot undertake theſe ſo laborious practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but muſt leave and reſign the ſame to other more in their prime of youth and ſtrength, whilſt I am fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and vaniſhing hence. But all the good I can do whilſt I live by faithful writing, I ſhall not neglect for my neighbours profit and advantage, And (God fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring my purpoſe) I ſhall ſhortly publiſh unheard of Secrets; here now it only reſts to ſet an end to this Tractate.</p>

                  <p>WHatſoever I have written in this little Book of extracting Gold out of Sand, Stones, and Flints, is ſo true and certain that there needs be no queſtion thereof. Yet I may tell thee, as ſoon as this Treatice came under the Preſs, another way of extracting Gold out of Stones came into my mind far better then the former. By which gold may be drawn out and extracted much ſooner and better: becauſe to this my new way, there is no need at all of Kettles of Copper or Braſs, &amp;c. but great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities may be extracted without boyling in or with ſuch veſſels, but in others that are every where to be had; ſo that one man in this new way in one day may eaſily extract the Gold out of a thouſand (M) pounds of ſand or ſtones, &amp;c. ſo that I cannot chuſe but communicate this alſo (which is far beyond th eformer) If I ſhall underſtand, this may be generally profitable, and gratefully accepted in theſe bad times and fear of worſe. Whereby to be publickly ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to my Country, and future generations. And ſo I commit all to the guidance and protection of the Almighty.</p>

To do Evil for good, is deviliſh; Evil for Evil, Natural, Senſual and Beſtial; Good for Good, Humane; and Good for Evil, Divine. The Wiſdom therefore from above is ſtill Pure, Holy, and Good; gotten by mortification on the Croſs of Chriſt, and brings Joy and Peace in the Holy Ghoſt for the Kingdom of Heaven; but hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,

amazement, and miſery attend the reſt, who live not after the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of the Croſs of Chriſt (which is the power of God to Salvation) but after the Fleſh, and do evil to ſerve the Devil. To know and fear God therefore is perfect Righteouſneſs, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Eternal Life; ſo that the Patriarchs and many termed Heathen, not having the outward name of Chriſt, may have his Spirit and Eſſential name, and be better members of him then we who live not thereafter: <hi>For</hi> (as the Scripture ſaith) <hi>he was the Rock of Ages, was ſlain from the beginning, and hath enlightned every one that cometh into the World, and was before</hi> Adam. But moſt men do not know nor fear God; but ſuperficially believe there is a God, and therefore talk of him as Parrots, and ſometimes worſe by Lyes, Oaths and Curſes, &amp;c. And therefore have no true faith in him or his Son: For did they truly know
<pb facs="tcp:99781:69"/>
and conſider him ſtill in his proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and works, to be Infinite, Wiſe, Omnipotent and Omniſcient (just as well as merciful) and that he is able to destroy them in a Moment, in the very Act of ſin) then would they fear him, (the firſt degree of Wiſdom) and ſo after Chriſts Example avoid all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and appearance of ſin, as they can and will do in ſome Acts for a very Childs being preſent: And ſo would believe that he who made and Created the Eye and Ear, and gives it Life and Senſe in the instant of its exerciſe, can both ſee and hear as well as any Eye and Ear, which can ſee or hear nothing at any time without his help; and likewiſe that he is as really preſent (though inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the outward Senſe) as any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can be which he hath made; yea, and that he knows our very ſecreteſt thoughts too, in whom we live, move, and have our Being.

                  <p>This Knowledge conſiſts chiefly in three things. 1. To know God. 2. Our ſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. That which God hath created<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>After Wiſdom and Knowledge, followeth Judgment; namely, to diſcern Good from Evil; Light from Darkneſs; Truth from Falſhood: Upon judgement and underſtanding followeth Election and will, to doe the one, and to ſhun the other.</p>
                  <p>The Knowledge or Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all things is threefold; Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 1. Of Men, 2. Of Angels, 3. Of God. The underſtanding (or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) of Men is but in part. The Knowledge of Angels is in fear and trembling; But Gods knowledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is perfect.</p>
                  <p>Wiſdom, Knowledge, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
<pb facs="tcp:99781:71"/>
thereof, cometh from the ſpirit alone, which is in Men, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and God. For the ſpirit ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth into all, even into the depth of God. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 11.</p>
                  <p>The Wiſdom, Knowledge, and Underſtanding of men is three-fold, after the ſpirit of the ſame. Namely, The ſpirit of men generally in this world is Fooliſhneſs in Gods eyes, for let men be never ſo Learned and VViſe, yet the perfect and true wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is hidden from them, becauſe they do not know themſelves, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 25. Some of theſe wiſe men are called Philoſophers, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Spirit of Sects boaſting of the holy Scripture, of God, and of Chriſt: but they have no knowledge of them, becauſe their Spirit is not of God, but they are only mens o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of God, and of Chriſt; and are carnally and earthly minded, full of errours and confuſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:99781:72"/>
Laſtly, The Spirit of Gods holy Ones, who being godly and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally minded, are taught of God.</p>
                  <p>The VViſdom and knowledge of the firſt is full of folly, darkneſs and Ignorance. The wiſdom of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is full of miſleading Philoſophy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and continual contentions. The wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the third ſort of men who are Godly, is but in part, although true and good. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 29. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. 8. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9. 11.</p>
                  <p>Truly wiſe men dive into the beſt gifts and perfection, which are of three ſorts, Charity, Prophecy and Examination.</p>
                  <p>Love and Charity are the Center, and contain the circle of all godly virtues and have Faith and Hope, but Propheſying hath all knowledge, wiſdom, and doctrine. Laſtly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination containeth all underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, judgment and diſcretion. In
<pb facs="tcp:99781:72"/>
theſe three things all is contained that belongeth to wiſdom, the Center whereof is the word of God.</p>
                  <p>This is that which all men ought to ſtudy, and ſhould communicate to others according as they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a gift of the Spirit of grace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; That God the Author of all good, may be glorified: and that none do boaſt of gifts and extol himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others; but rather be humble: And then none ought to quench the Spirit, neither in himſelf nor others; but rather to ſtir it up. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let no man deſpiſe Prophecy, that he may not offend God, his neighbour, nor ſcandalize himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Love forbeareth all: The wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the ſpirit ſearcheth all, and Examination tryeth all.</p>
                  <p>Since we have undertaken, through the admonition of the ſpirit, to ſpeak of wiſdom (as much as our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in part may afford) Therefore

we intreat the Reader in Love, that thoſe whom we diſpleaſe (or who are offended) would tolerate us in love, As knowing that wiſemen alſo muſt bear with fools; And things ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in this book may not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be rejected, but rather be ſuffered to ſtand, remembring that God alſo is patient unto Sinners. But if any one do think himſelf wiſe, let him ſhew the ſpirit of Judgment, and let him diſcern thus, leaſt he judge himſelf alſo. For we hold that we alſo have received a gift of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grade, which we will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to dye; but to the praiſe of the Lord we will put it out to uſe, out of love to the Children of wiſdom; although not as an inſtruction, but as a good teſtimony to our ſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we have received a gift of the Spirit not in vain.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon that induced us to the writing of this book is, becauſe we
<pb facs="tcp:99781:74"/>
hope to be Beneficial to the children of wiſdom. It may be we have publiſht the like twelve years ago, the Title of it being <hi>Aurora Sapientiae:</hi> yet ſince it hath been deſired by ſome again, I have not altered the Title, hoping that it is not a little mended and corrected. I have ſet it out briefly, that it may neither be tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Reader, nor chargeable to the Buyer, nor yet painful to the Printer. Benevolous Reader, take all in good part, and thus we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the well wiſhers to Gods graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ptotection.</p>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:99781:77"/>
The firſt book of Nature contains ſeven other books which are the ſeven Elements, of which in particular here<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Theſe ſeven Books have three other books oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, which are the three contrary Elements, of which alſo hereafter.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond book, the Holy Writ is divided into three other books, as into the Law of the Old: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Goſpel of the New: and into the Eternal Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of the everlaſting Teſtament and Covenant, which comprehends the book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Third book of Man is only one book, and is ſealed to the blind, but opened to the ſeeing. In this book is hidden, ſealed; and alſo manifeſt and opened all Wiſdom: and man is called the Image or Honour of God: (o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Out of the firſt book we learn <hi>Philoſophia</hi> the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Wiſdom in and about the knowledge of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted natural things which are of the Elements: and we learn this wiſdom out of the three Principles and ſeven Elements; and diſcern the ſame from the three contrary Elements, elſe we cannot find the truth of the Natural Wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>Out of the ſecond book we learn <hi>Theologia</hi> or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, the wiſdom unto Salvation; and that in the three foreſaid books through the ſeven ſpirits, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 11. and we di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>nguiſh it from all humane gloſſes, and books of Prophane ones. For the book expounds it ſelf, and needs no humane inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, but only hath need of Faith, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all things.</p>
                  <p>Out of the Third Book, which is Gods Image, we learn the true knowledge of God; as alſo his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99781:77"/>
and eſſence, and his whole Myſtery: in ſo much as he that deſires to know God, muſt learn to know him in his image, and that perfectly; which perfect knowledge is this, That God is man, and that he is true man, who is of God; and God is in him.</p>
                  <p>This is the wiſdom, that is myſtical hitherto, and yet is manifeſt but only to the wiſe: and is called <hi>Theoſophia;</hi> becauſe God doth no where ſo clearly manifeſt himſelf as in man, who is his image, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 7. Therefore man needs not to go far, but only into himſelf, to learn the true knowledge of God, and to ſeek after God in himſelf; and himſelf in God. If he do not thus, all is vain, and no where elſe any wiſdom to be found. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 27. <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 21.</p>
                  <p>Seeing the three other books proceed only from the one Book, as the world of God, therefore all three do teſtifie unanimouſly of this book <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>All wiſdom and knowledg, with their myſteries in theſe books, we may not learn any where elſe, but only through the ſame Spirit, who himſelf hath pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned theſe books, made, and teſtified. He therefore who is deſirous to ſtudy theſe books, muſt from the bottom of his heart acknowledge and confeſs his own blindneſs, folly and ignorance; and muſt pray unto the Father of Lights, for illumination, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and underſtanding, that he would ſend his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit which may lead us into all truth, and take us away from all fooliſhneſs. and falſhood, and may bring us to the Light of Gods glory.</p>
                  <p>Which may not be done by any other means, then
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99781:78"/>
through a love to God, and to mans own ſalvation, and through a holy life without all Hypocriſie, and through the Light that commeth from above, and not from beneath, from man and his wiſdom, which all thoſe muſt learn to deny, that deſire to learn the wiſdom of the holy ones.</p>
                  <p>We will ſpeak thus; That hitherto all theſe books were ſealed up, but are now opened in the end of the World according to the Prophecy, 4 <hi>Eſd.</hi> 6. 20. <hi>Dan</hi> 12. 9. <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. 7. And if wiſe worldly men are offended at this, they betray themſelves, that the wiſdom of the holy one is not in them</p>
                  <p>The books of wiſdom teſtifie unanimouſly of the word by which all things are created, and in which only all wiſdom doth reſt, and which is the beginning of all beginnings, in which is all, and without which nothing is, which is all in all, <hi>God bleſſed for ever; Amen.</hi>

                  <p>Now we hold altogether that this is the proper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of God, and no other, which the holy writ clearly ſignifieth. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 45, 47, 48. who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Image and Similitude. hath created a ſpiritual <hi>Adam,</hi> and Terreſtrial man; when God ſaid, <hi>Let us make</hi> Adam <hi>or Man after our image, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our Similitude,</hi> Gen. 1. 26, 27.</p>
                  <p>Now the word being the Beginning of all Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, there is contained in the ſame the Light, Life, and Love. The Light affords the <hi>Revelation</hi> of God, for God is Light, and dwelleth in Light, and is the Father of Lights.</p>
                  <p>Life is the virtue and power of God, and a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Spirit, who hath, createth, and preſerveth all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Love is a Teſtimony of God, in which is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt; in one word which is called</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, the ſpiritual <hi>Adam,</hi> and heavenly Man, Meſſias, who is Eſſential, Alpha and Omega.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now the word being the true Principle in God himſelf, then conſequently all proceedeth from the word, out of which do chiefly manifeſt themſelves three general Principles, in which Principles, with and through which, all things are contained, and are theſe, namely, God, Nature, Element.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:99781:79"/>
Now theſe three general Principles afford alſo a threefold world, namely a divine uncreated from God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing world from Eternity, then an Angelical world, which proceedeth or lighteth forth, or ſhineth forth out of the Light in which God dwelleth; and laſtly an Elementary world, whoſe Original came out of the water.</p>
                  <p>After theſe three general Principles, proceed alſo three ſpecial Principles, namely <hi>Ghoſt, Wind</hi> and <hi>Water.</hi> Now every world hath its proper Ghoſt, Wind and Water in their Kind and Nature. All things Created out of the divine world from above are Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated out of Water and Spirit from above, through the wind and breath of the Omnipotent God; for to the Divine world is properly competent the Spirit; to the Angelical is properly competent the wind, and to the Elementary world is water proper.</p>
                  <p>After theſe ſpecial Principles, follow laſtly particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Principles, each of which hath its proper Being, out of which, in which, and from which it conſiſts: But theſe three Principles proceed from the former, and are Spirit, Soul, and Life, and Body: All bodies are out of the Water: All Life and Soul out of the Wind: And all Spirit out of the Spirit. But concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Angels, their Body is out of the Wind of the Angelical World, their Soul and Life a Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame, and their Soul a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Theſe are our Principles in the Wiſdom, out of which all things have their Original: Whether other Principles may be ſhewed unto us, we do much doubt.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> firſt mover of all things is the Word, for in it is the Life.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Secundum mobile,</hi> Second mover of all things,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99781:79"/>
is the Spirit, through which all things are Cre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ated.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tertium mobile,</hi> Third mover is the Wind, and theſe three moving Principles are the <hi>Perpetnum mobile,</hi> everlaſting mover of all things, by which all things move, live, and have their Being.</p>
                  <p>But theſe three do reſt upon the Water bodily; out of which the World is and all things are: And in the Air; according to the Life, wherein all things are: And in Heaven, from which all things come from above after the Spirit; but the Spirit from God, from which he cometh and returneth thither. <hi>John.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 30. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 28. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 7.

                     <hi>GOd,</hi> being the beginning of all Beginnings; as from which all things proceed, then his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is from no other: He is without a beginning, becauſe he is not from another; yet though he hath his beginning from no other, he repreſenteth in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf his beginning to all.</p>
                  <p>This beginning of God is not a beginning to God himſelf, but to us; for he himſelf is <hi>all</hi> in <hi>all.</hi> Now that he might ſhew himſelf to us men, to teſtifie and inſtruct us of him, therefore God ſheweth himſelf in his beginning, which is the Word, which is God himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Now through this VVord is ſhewed to us, teſtified and taught that, and what God is, and who he is: But without word or ſpeaking may be neither Doctrine nor Teſtimony, nor a preſentation; as Reaſon doth make it manifeſt. Therefore the VVord is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of God to us, out of which all Teſtimonies, Names and Relation of God do proceed; as out of the depths of God, which conſiſt in their own proper Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, wind and water.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:99781:80"/>
The name of God is but one, according to the Eſſence, which no man knoweth, but only he upon whom he is written, with the living Letters of the Spirit of God, and his VVord Eſſentially, which is Chriſt, and thoſe that are of his Being. Theſe are they in whom the VVord dwelleth Eſſentially, and that ſee his Glory in a Light and Eye that no body elſe can ſee. All the names of God come together only in this one name: <hi>For the whole fulneſs of the Godhead dwe leth in him bodily, who is called Alpha and Omega.</hi> Zach. 14. 9. Col 2. 9. <hi>He that ſeeth him ſeeth alſo God, and the Father, and the living Word, and the quickning Spirit.</hi> John 14. 9. 1 John 1. 1 Cor. 15. 45. Even ſo he that ſeeth man, ſeeth alſo with the Body, the Soul, and the Spirit, which are in their Nature inviſible.</p>
                  <p>The Teſtimony of God conſiſteth in three: Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in three witneſſes, which are the Father, the VVord, and the Holy Spirit. Now as the name pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the word, ſo doth every Teſtimony of God, and reſteth only upon the dear and true wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is called <hi>Amen; which is the beginning of Gods Creatures.</hi> Rev. 3. 14. And the Teſtimony of God ſtands thus. <hi>God Father, Word, Holy Ghost, Amen,</hi> which is Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe no body can teſtifie of God, but he himſelf alone; and all Teſtimonies of Truth muſt be juſtified by three: Therefore God alſo teſtifieth of himſelf by three; but they are not three perſons, But one onely perſon, and one only God; even as in one Earthly mans Body, Soul and Spirit cannot be three diſtinct perſons, ſo in God are not three perſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:99781:81"/>
But this is the Teſtimony of God to us in the <hi>Name (non in Nominibus, ſed in Nomine) of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt</hi> which conſiſt in the word, which three are one thing and one: But this Teſtimony none acknowledgeth ſave he that hath it within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Eſſentially, that is, that hath the Spirit out of God, and is annointed and ſealed with it. This is the Teſtimony of God with one word, <hi>through which we are Sons and Heirs of God.</hi> Rom. 8.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The <hi>Revelation</hi> of God conſiſts <hi>in ſeven Powers, which are the ſeven Spirits of God.</hi> Rev. 1. 4. Chap. 4. 5. Chap. 5. 6. Zech. 4. 2, 10. And reſt upon him who is called, and is <hi>Jeſſe;</hi> who is of no other; but out, through, in and of himſelf, is is ſelf ſubſiſting, in whom is all, who hath all; <hi>Alſo the fulneſs of the Godhead.</hi> Rev. 3. 1. Iſa. 11. Col. 2. 9. For through him all things are Created in Heaven and in Earth, and by him all things are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, by him alſo all is Redeemed and reconciled; He Reigneth over all, and hath all under his Power, through him all loſt things are reſtored at his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious coming; He alſo holdeth Judgment over all fleſh, over quick and dead; And laſtly he will make old things new, and will aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and put away all old things Everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Myſtery of God conſiſts in One, Three and Seven; and according to this Myſtery all other things are Created and conſiſt in One, out of Three, through Seven; and are therein teſtified, learned, manifeſted, or juſtified; nothing at all excepted whatſoever it be; and that for this Reaſon That God in his myſtery may be learned and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in and on all his Creatures.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>NAture</hi> is the ſecond Principle and beginning of all things, and ſtands betwixt God and the Elements, through which God worketh into the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, at, through, and by means, and is in its conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration even as Angelical, whoſe beginning is out of God a forth-blown Breath, VVind and Air of the Almighty, in which conſiſts the Soul and Life of all Created things, and every living Soul, and is concentred and faſtened together eſſentially, bodily, and ſelf-ſubſiſting in the Tree of Life, even as God in Chriſt, and the whole Elementary world in Man.</p>
                  <p>This ſecond Principle is not everlaſting according to the beginning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet eternal according to the end, even as the Angels are. It is not Created out of nothing, as this world; but proceedeth from God, even as the Life from the Spirit, as a Breath, VVind, or Air doth proceed; and is alſo the breath of Gods VVord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which is Life thus, that the ſpeaking of the word is a living Eternal Breath, and is diſtinct from God, as a living breath or Soul from the quickening Spirit.</p>
                  <p>The living breath, Soul or Life of all things i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its Original out of the Nature, but the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99781:82"/>
Spirit out of God, namely after his meaſure, and the body out of the Elements. The Spirit as the Soul, or the Life are diſtinct thus: As God, who is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, and the quickening Spirit himſelf, and hath Life from no other, becauſe himſelf is the Spirit: And as the living Soul, having her Life not out, from, and by, or through it ſelf, but out of the Spirit, which maketh things alive, whoſe breath is the Life. Now that is ſouliſh which hath its Life not from it ſelf, but from the Spirit, and which is not a Spirit, but only a breath.</p>
                  <p>All things whatſoever are in their Being, have the food of thir Souls and Life out of Nature, and that from Heaven through the Wind and Air, from which all that hath breath doth live und feed, as through the forth-going breath of the VVord contained in the ſecond Principle; for the word of God feeds every Spirit, Life and Body with its breath or blowing upon; becauſe Life is in the word, which beareth all things by his power, even as it hath Created all things.</p>
                  <p>Now as all things conſiſt of Body, Soul and Spirit, ſo they have three ſorts of food to their ilfe &amp; ſubſtance, the bodily food to the body, out of the Elements, as from that which cometh out of the waters, and out of the Earth, whence alſo the body doth come, is taken and is made. The ſouliſh food to the Soul &amp; Life in every thing out of Nature, through both the Elements of VVind and Air, from whence alſo the Life and Soul doth bome. The Spiritual food to the Spirit, and that from God, at from whom the Spirit is, namely each Spirit according to its meaſure, and to the Spirit in every way this food cometh from Heaven, through the Spirit and Light, as from the three Spiritual Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, from whence alſo the Spirit did come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:99781:83"/>
Nature doth aſſemble it ſelf in her Spirits Life, and body to the wind, Air and water.</p>
                  <p>The Angelical world in its body is no earth, as the Elementary is, but it is the right body of the water, out of which it ſubſiſteth, and that body is here beneath with us ICE, but above it is an Angelical earth like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Chriſtal.</hi> And in a word, it is a moſt noble Salt of Life, fertile, or conſtant, or firm over all, and is the Paradiſe in it ſelf. It is an Angelical Air, which doth not fetch breath there as the living Soul, for the Life of Nature is Eternal in regard of the end; but it liveth and moveth in the Virtue of Gods word Eternally, <hi>ſine respiratione,</hi> or without breathing.</p>
                  <p>Therefore death cannot Reign in the Angelical world over the Nature, and over the Tree of Life, but is rather overcome by it (how much more by God) for the Tree of Life ſtands unmoveable: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the breaking of the fruit of this Tree, at the glorious coming of Chriſt, all ſhall come from death to life, and ſhall be freed and redeemed from death, Devil and Curſe. Laſtly, in its Spirit alſo it is of an Angelical Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the power of the word and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of God. Thus namely, that the Dragon hath no power over it, but is conquered by the Spirit of the ſame, is caſt out, and quite extruded and caſt away; How much more th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n by God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing the Nature in her Spirit is the wind of the Almighty, and a going forth of the Light in which God dwelleth, and cannot come to that evil one, or may not fall into an evil, neither may it be blaſted or poiſoned by the breath of the old Serpent.</p>
                  <p>The Divine world in its being is compared to the moſt noble body of the water and earth, as it were to a Heavenly body which is and are an Eſſential Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Salt, as the moſt noble and pure Gems, precious
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99781:83"/>
ſtones, and gliſtering Gold. In its Life it is the breath of the Almighty, a Soul and Life proceeding out of the mouth of God in and to an Eternal Life; and in its Spirit, the Spirit of the Lord it ſelf, who is God praiſed for ever. God is the Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the Soul or the Life, and the Elements are the Body: But be it known, that each world hath its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Nature and Element, and that the one world is never changed into the other, neither can it be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor one Principle general into another.

the Spiritual water after the body. And again, the water out of the Salt; each world is, and doth flow out of the other,</p>
                  <p>The Nature ſtands to the Angelical world, and is a flowing out of the divine world; and the Elementary world is an overflowing of the Nature and Angelical world.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Man cometh forth out of the three worlds, and is the concentred or conjoyned <hi>Centrum</hi> of all the worlds.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeven Elements or Powers of the world, as Spirit Wind, Air and Water; Light, Heaven and Earth, and are ſuch, by which, in, and through which this world conſiſts and ſubſiſts, and without which it cannot ſubſiſt.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſeven Elements are Created out of ſuch a one, which in the Elementary world are <hi>all</hi> in <hi>all,</hi> and are incorruptible; namely Salt, which is an excretion of Nature, <hi>Execrementum quaſi ſobriè ſumptum,</hi> whereby in this world all things bodily ſubſiſt, and are preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Now there is a threefold Salt, namely, a Spiritual, ſouliſh, and a Bodily and Palpable. The Bodily is fixt and permanent, both in Water and Fire: Whence we know out of what, wherein, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all things ſtand firm and conſtant, both in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the Fire, that they may not be drowned, and wherewith they are cloſed up. The Souliſh Salt is flying; becauſe life and Soul is in it, and the growth of all whereby all things receive both body and life: but when it cometh down again, and turneth to the fixed Salt again, then they receive Life. But the Spiritual Salt is a right true eſſence, and in this world the moſt noble Being of all Being <hi>(Spiritus univerſi)</hi> the Spirits of the Elements, and their Light, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in its Eſſence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:99781:84"/>
The Spiritual Salt dwelleth in the Spirit, Light and Heaven, and giveth to the body of the Reſurrection, as Spiritual from the Spirit, Light and Heaven.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Volans</hi> or flying Salt dwelleth in the Wind, Air, Rain, and Dew, this giveth out of wind and air to the body after death,</p>
                  <p>The fixed Corporeal Salt dwelleth in water and earth, out of which this our body doth ſubſiſt: But Salt is the right fixed Salt, and the right water of Life, which is a dry water, and together water and Earth, in which the air and wind is ſecretly hid, and alſo the Heavens, Light and Spirit in its depths, which are then the ſeven Powers of the Element and world; and all ſeven may eaſily, undeniably, and manifeſtly to the eye be demonſtrated, if the ſame be Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mized.</p>
                  <p>This only Element of all Elements, is a Power of all Powers in this World: The Salt is an Excrement of Nature by the Word of God, and is bodily a ſeed of the water, and all Elements from whence the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did ſpring, or proceed, or flow, by the breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit of the Lord for a ſeed to all the world, and abundantly increaſed by the moving of the Spirit of the Lord; ſo that the whole Earth is formed out of it.</p>
                  <p>The fixed Salt is threefold, as in the Earth, in the Water, and in Heaven. The flying Salt alſo, as in Rain, Water and Dew, Air and Wind. The Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial alſo is threefold, as in the light Spirit, and upper water. The waters ſupplie three places or degrees, for out of them them the world did ſubſiſt, which is remarkeable, always the one is hid in the other. The flying Salt is the Key, and openeth with it, deſcending in the Spring, that every thing raiſeth from the dead,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99781:85"/>
greeneth and groweth, and with its aſcending in the Harveſt ſhutteth them again.</p>
                  <p>The Elements are threefold, namely, Spiritual Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and Bodily. There are three of the Spiritual Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as bodily, the Heaven; Souliſh the light, and Spiritual the Spirit. The Souliſh are twofold, as Wind and Air. The bodily alſo, as Water and Earth: Always the one is hid in the other, and the one always comprehends the other ſix in it; and always the one of them is bodily manifeſt, viſible, and knowing, or palpable, but the other ſix are hid in it.</p>
                  <p>Each Element alſo in it ſelf is threefold, as ſpiritual, ſouliſh and bodily. The ſpiritual earth is, and are the Precious ſtones or Jewels, and that is the body of the Spirit. The ſouliſh earth is the gold, the ſpiritual water bodily are the Pearls, the ſouliſh is the Amber, afterwards the Corals bodily.</p>
                  <p>In all theſe dwell many Powers, eſpecially if out of water and ſpirit by means of the Fire, they are made new and ſpiritual. All Elements are in the one with all their Powers, which is a ſpiritual Rock, out of which the water of Life doth ſpring to all Creatures, and ebbeth and floweth in the whole world, and filleth up Elementarily all in all. And when in the end of the world, this one is taken away from them, then all the Elements are conſumed in and by the fire.</p>

                  <p>THe three ſpecial Principles, as far as they are Principles, come according to their Original, as the ſpirit from God, the wind from the Nature, and the water from the Rocks and Wells of the Element. Every body in the Elementary world is out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, even alſo Heaven and Earth. All living, ſoul and breath is from the wind, in all bodies, and all ſpirits are from the ſpirit: The ſpirit hath by it the light and Heaven, the wind, the air, the water, the earth. Now as every thing hath its original; ſo it is of the ſame fed, nouriſhed, and thither it returneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                  <p>Now the water is a gathered, concentred, and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily palpable air. The air is a ſoft ſenſible bodily ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered wind. And the wind is a living gathered ſpirit. But the ſpirit is ſuch an out-ſpoken word, which Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateth and maketh ſome living thing; ſo that it ſtands there eſſentially, where it was before. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 29, 30.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of the Creation, the ſpirit moved on the water; by which moving is underſtood the wind, by which the ſpirit hath breathed on the waters, and made them fertile for the Creation of the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:99781:86"/>
All things that are, move and have a Being, have their original from the one, infini eternal Father, <hi>EHE<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E, JEHOVAH</hi> and <hi>JESSE,</hi> which is the eſſential, ſelf-ſubſiſting, living word, which is and was in the beginning, and remaineth everlaſtingly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to which word all other things are juſt nothing. Through it all things are Created, are preſerved, nouriſhed and fed in their ſpirit and life, as through the breath of the Almighty. 4 <hi>Eſd.</hi> 16. 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 4.</p>
                  <p>Now by the three ſpecial Principles, as ſpirit, wind, and water, which are Elements alſo, all Creation is finiſhed, not only becauſe they are the means by which the general Principles do work; but alſo becauſe they contain in them the right ſeed of all things, and the ſame in the only true Element of which we made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion afore. For theſe three bear in their body all Salt and feed, fixed; and flying, and eſſential; as alſo Heaven and Earth, with all that is therein, and bring forth into the world, each to its proper ſelf-ſubſiſting, or ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>Now as all is produced out of the ſpecial Principles, according to the Creation and Nativity: But the ſin with the curſe and corruption hath made all evil; ſo muſt all that is born anew return to water, wind, ſpirit, and out of the ſpirit and ſpiritual water, muſt by the wind be born anew to the Image of the Coeleſtials; yet ſo, that in their glory they be no other then Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and divine, and bear the Image of the Coeleſtials. This new birth goeth out of the upper waters, and out of a Coeleſtial earth to ſpeak Elementarily, and are nothing elſe but ſalt. There is another birth alſo that goeth out of the fire, and is done in pain and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The new birth out of the water, and through the water is done in drowning by water to death,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99781:86"/>
That out and in the earth is done through death and Corruption: The birth out of the fire, as a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry element, is done in and through the fire in Hell. Every new birth and regeneration is done through the ſpirit, as alſo every Creation and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>The new birth out of the water is done, when water is to be poured upon that which ſhall be new born: which the bad contrary elementary doth drown, kill, and reduceth to nothing: And on the contrary ſtirreth up the good, draweth it out and maketh it glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and diſtinguiſheth the good from the bad, rejecteth the bad, and chooſeth the good, and keeps it.</p>
                  <p>The new birth out of earth is done, when a thing is reduced to its proper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dyeth and putrifieth therein, then afterward cometh forth again, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth out of the earth with a new and ſpiritual body, and parteth with the naughty and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>The new birth in the fire is done, when all is caſt into the fire, and that which doth not hold fire is conſumed by degrees: and only that which is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual remaineth and is ſaved: and then afterward the new birth with a ſpiritual body cometh forth: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3 13, 14, 15. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4 6. Although we ſpeak here Phyſically and Elementarily; yet underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding men will judge Theologically, and the Wiſe may ſearch Phyſically, how every thing hath its true Earth, Water, and Fire, and ſo mark and obſerve this myſtery.</p>
                  <p>Now is the Spirit, Wind, and Water, by which all things in the world are effected. Theſe the word ſendeth forth to all Creations, Births, and Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Theſe are never quiet, for they are by and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99781:87"/>
with the Word, the <hi>Perpetuum Mobile,</hi> as above was mentioned, and co-operate continually into the Light, Heaven, Air, and Earth: which four Elements ſtand ſtill unmoveable into which the three ſpecial Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples do overflow with their body, ſoul, and ſpirit, as to the Water, Wind and Spirit; and work out all, and finiſh the ſame. The water is as it were the Element, the Wind is like as Angelical, and the Nature, and the Spirit is Divine.</p>

                  <p>There is a threefold body, namely, a ſenſible or palpable out of Water and Earth: a Souliſh out of Wind and Air<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a ſpiritual, out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Light and Spirit. So is an Elementary hody, an Angelical, and a Divine, very well to be diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed on man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:99781:87"/>
Further the Soul is corporeal out of the Air from whence it is fed alſo: and ſouliſh out of the Wind: and Spiritual out of the Light. The Spirit is Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> from the Heaven: Souliſh out of the Light: and ſpiritual out of the ſpirit of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, out of the Nature, and of God, according as the Creature is. Out of theſe three general Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Man hath alſo a threefold ſpirit according to his meaſure, and is the perfecteſt creature: Always one body dwelleth in the other: and as ſoon as one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is diſſolved and broken; in the ſame moment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother and more noble body is manifeſt, and that in all things. If now the body becometh nobler, needs muſt the Spirit be more noble, high and glorious. But this is the body, after which the wiſe do ſeek; Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Salt which containeth all in it ſelf. This bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy they drown in a Water, which floweth out of the Centrum of the Vegetables; and draw out all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which afterward come together in a celeſtial ſpiritual body, and afford that precious jewel. All things that are killd and dye naturally, are drownd in a cold Saturnine Water, for all natural death is done by coldneſs; but what is kill'd in the Fire without a Saturnine Water, is not fit to Nature for a better ſtate. Only the Salt we ſeek in the fire, and then through the Water, and afterwards cleanſe and purifie it with the Baptiſm of Fire and of Water. We ſhould therefore ſix our thoughts on the water, and uſe the fire very carefully, becauſe it is a contrary Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before which nothing can ſubſiſt, but only the Salt.</p>
                  <p>This is the true body of all Elements, and of all things in the whole world, if that be taken away, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> all periſheth quickly, and the Gold it ſelf alſo in the Fire. This is the right Heaven, wherein dwell all

powers, and is in all things in the whole world their <hi>Heaven,</hi> and is compared to the Tree of Life in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the ſoul according to the higheſt degree, is out of the nature: According to the ſecond degree, from the Light; and according to the third degree, out of the <hi>Wind.</hi> Theſe are the Principles of the living ſoul: ſoul and ſpirit are diſtinct, as God and Nature, Spirit and <hi>Wind;</hi> as Angel and living ſoul, yea as ſpirit and breath.</p>
                  <p>The middle Principle among the three Principles, is always inſtead of the <hi>Mother,</hi> as the Nature, <hi>Wind,</hi> and <hi>Soul.</hi> The body is the Child; which the ſpirit, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s a Father begets through the ſoul. Out of the ſpirit cometh the ſoul, he lets it out as his breath and from both theſe the body: The firm ſoul and ſpirit, as the true life and ſpirit which is like unto the Angelical world, is always in the right body of all things that is, in the <hi>Salt,</hi> when it is opened, then they come forth in a great clearneſs, as in an Angelical glory.</p>
                  <p>At laſt the ſpirit of all things is out of the three ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Principles, in each according to their portion and meaſure. Now the ſpirit affords the right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eſſence, the <hi>forma eſſentialis, differentia ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca abſtractum eſſentiae,</hi> and nothing elſe. From the ſame the body and ſoul alſo receive their eſſence, whereby the one from the other eſſentially and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, are diſtinguiſhed; as man from beaſts; a beaſt, foul, fiſh, vermin, &amp;c from others: and ſo one thing from another.</p>
                  <p>All Creatures are diſtinguiſhed chiefly into three: as into <hi>Animalia,</hi> all living ſouls: into <hi>vegetabilia,</hi> all that grow and ſpring out of the earth: and into <hi>Mineralia,</hi> things that grow under the earth, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99781:88"/>
are digged out, and ſo in the water alſo. Theſe are diſtinct as the three Principles, and in our wiſdom always a fair harmony doth repreſent it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>All living ſouls conſiſt out of Water and bloud, in their ſeeds through a moiſt warmth, and a warm moiſtneſs each in its mother. All growing things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in their ſeed, out of a ſlimy water, through the Salt, which is fixed in the root, flying in the herb, leaf and graſs, and eſſential in the flower; and all three concentre at laſt in the ſeed.</p>
                  <p>All <hi>Minerals, Metals,</hi> and what belongeth to it grow out of a fat earth, which the Salt of the earth doth hatch: and do coagulate through a cold fire, which is a <hi>Saturnine Water,</hi> that is, a fiery water, and a wateriſh fire that doth not burn.</p>
                  <p>Even as upon earth all things grow by rain and dew, as alſo in the earth it raineth, thaweth, and is miſty, thereby grow the Minerals, Metals, and the like; and all this from the ſalt fixed, flying and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential The flying Salt begets <hi>Sulphur,</hi> the eſſential begets <hi>Mercury.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. VIII. Of the Elements, and contrary Elements in the Creation.</head>
                  <p>THe ſeven Elements or Powers of the world do reſt only upon one, which is a right well of all Elements in our thoughts, becauſe it containeth all. An Element is ſuch a thing, out of which, and in which the world and all doth conſiſt; without which, nothing can ſubſiſt Again, a contrary Element is ſuch whereby the world and Elements are altered and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and at laſt muſt quite periſh thereby.</p>
                  <p>Now all things are Created out of three Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples <hi>Materialiter,</hi> namely out of the word, as out of a ſpiritual; out of nature, as a ſouliſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and out of the Elements and contrary Elements, as an incorporeal-corporeal, and Corporeal-incorporeal; that is, out of the Elements after ſomething, and out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Elements according to nothing.</p>
                  <p>The word is the all, the Elements are the ſomething; and the contrary Elements are the nothing The no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is become ſomething by the word of God; and the ſomething will become nothing again, when at laſt the word is taken away. Although the contrary Elements were once nothing, yet in the Creation they are a Principle along, becauſe they were made, which were not afore, and are of God counted not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99781:89"/>
evil, but good; becauſe God did look upon them, and hath covered and hid their Principle, which was nothing, yet concentred and faſtened together, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal in and on the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, which muſt have ſtood there as a witneſs; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the world was Created out of nothing; yet this ſhould be undiſcovered and not aſhamed, that is, it ſhould not be broken, namely, that the ſhame of the whole world might not not ſtand aſhamed before the face of all the world, and for a confuſion be quite dead and periſh.</p>
                  <p>Now as long as the contrary Elements remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and in their concentrated Center were not broken, they are very good: But ſo ſoon as they are known in their depths, they are ſuch a thing as puts the world to a ſhame, and at laſt altogether doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it, and reduceth it to nothing.</p>
                  <p>Theſe contrary Elements are three, Darkneſs as Corporeal, Fire as Souliſh, and corruption as Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; yet Corruption before the fall was no Corruption, but only an alteration, not unto evil, but unto good, and a change and exchange of all Created things. The Fire before the fall was not conſuming, but in its knowledge was good and uſeful: In like manner dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was very good, and for a reſt and refreſhing to all Creatures; but now it is an habitation to ill Spirits, and as far as darkneſs in the air reacheth and goeth, ſo far and high alſo in the air hath Satan his Dominion and Reign. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 22. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6 12. And ſo are the contrary Elements become hereditary to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan through ſin, who is the Prince of darkneſs, and Potentate of the fire, and the fire over him, and a principle and beginner of perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:99781:90"/>
Out of darkneſs, Hell is harched, which is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. 1. <hi>Corporeal,</hi> according to its place, under the earth in the nethermoſt places. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 28. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19. 2. <hi>Souliſh</hi> in the Reign of the Devil, and Prince of darkneſs in high places. 3, <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> in the Devil himſelf and his Children. This Hell will be caſt at laſt into the fiery Lake.</p>
                  <p>Out of the fire is produced an unquenchable ever burning Sulphur, and ſuch a conſuming fiery flame, which killeth life, and yet always maketh death a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live.</p>
                  <p>The Helliſh fire is three fold; in the Hell, in the Devil and his Children, and in the fiery Pool: Out of this alteration, or rather perdition, is at laſt <hi>Death</hi> gotten; which in its bodylineſs is a cold fire, and a fiery coldneſs: According to the <hi>Souliſhneſs,</hi> a gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worm that continueth, devoureth, and never eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, yet always conſumeth and ſtill begetteth again: According to the Spirit, <hi>Death</hi> is the Devil himſelf eſſentially, who hath begotten ſin, and ſin hath begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten him, the <hi>Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now darkneſs was good before the fall; for light was hid therein, which God commanded to come forth out of the darkneſs: The fire alſo was good before the fall; for life reſted therein, becauſe no flame was burning in the fire, nor was manifeſt. The change and alteration was good alſo before the fall; becauſe love did ſhew it ſelf therein, by the increaſe of the Creatures. Now ſince <hi>Light, Life</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all, therefore they were comprehended alſo in the contrary Elements; but they were ſeparated from the ſame, and thruſt out and parted through ſin; and ſo that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was very good became exceeding bad, and turned good and evil to a contrary and adverſe thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:99781:90"/>
After the fall <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> were begotten, and the fire was made manifeſt, Viſible and Corporeal; So that it went up into the height by Reaſon of ſin; ſo that by Gods permiſſion and command it may fall down from Heaven upon the wicked world, eſpecially it doth lye in and on the fiery Cherub before the door of Paradiſe, and guardeth the way to the Tree of Life; but in the glorious and joyful coming of the great God <hi>Jeſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> this fiery Cherub muſt be gone and come down, and all contrary Elements muſt reduce to nothing, that is, they muſt no more Reign; and alſo the Devil himſelf muſt from above be caſt down, taken Captive, and in Priſon muſt be bound a thouſand years, to the glorious liberty and Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Creature, from the Vanity, Curſe and Death, where all things as they were Created, will be renewed.</p>

                  <p>BEfore this Elementary world was Created of God, the Angels, and the Angelical world, and Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, which were above the upper waters, were firſt, and that ſo certain, as the nature was firſt before the Elements, and God before all things. Therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways out of the upper things, things beneath were gotten, and the upper is always before that which is below, even as the Spirit is firſt before the Soul and Body,</p>
                  <p>Now the Angels God hath called through his word out of the ſame light, wherein God dwelleth after their ſpirit, for that end, that they ſhould ſerve him, and hath preſented them in the fiery flame, after the Soul, and as a wind, after their body.</p>
                  <p>Now the Angels being out of the light, wherein God dwelleth, therefore they can know on, in, and out of the ſame, what Gods command is, and this light is the face of God in Heaven, a ſpiritual food of the Angels, which light the Angel of the Children may behold, whereas on the contrary the Angels of ſinful men may not behold it, until the ſinner doth true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,

then his Angel may appear again before that light, and before the face of the Lord, of which there is great joy among the other Angels: But as long as the ſinner doth not repent; ſo long appeareth the Devil before God, and accuſeth the ſinner day and night before him.</p>

                  <p>So the fiery flame unknown to <hi>Lucifer,</hi> undiſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and hid, was blown up by himſelf out of envy and grudgings, ſo that it turned to an eſſential anger, yea to a conſuming fire, wherein at firſt did reſt the life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but was afterwards turned into a living death, which never dyeth, and a deadly eternal life made manifeſt, as a ſoul to Satan.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99781:92"/>
all Gods Teſtimony wholly, as alſo the Teſtimony of good Angels. He is a Knave or Lyer from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through ſin, which hath begotten him, and he hath begotten ſin, he is ſins father, and ſin is his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that hath begotten him, and he her through covetouſneſs in the leering eye of ſelf-love and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>Now as ſin is that evil, and found out in its Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by <hi>Lucifer,</hi> ſo it hath turn'd him into an evil one, and one is the Principle of the other; and ſo he can be excuſed by no means. So <hi>Lucifer</hi> hath murdered himſelf, and hath loſt the <hi>Angelical Printiple,</hi> and is, and remaineth a forlorn Child, and ſon of <hi>Perdition</hi> the right Antichriſt for ever.</p>
                  <p>Thus is ſin gotten through coveting, and coveting through looking upon, and looking upon through imagination, and that through ſelf-love, and that through an arrogant liberty, this through <hi>ſecurity,</hi> and that through <hi>wantonneſs,</hi> where there is no fear; for as fear is the beginning of wiſdom, ſo is wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the beginning of folly and ſin. He that is fearful will not eaſily hazard upon ſinning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lucifer</hi> was Created of God a good Angel; and that ſo, that he might eaſily have been kept from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: So alſo might <hi>Man</hi> if he would himſelf; but <hi>ſelf-will</hi> brought him to that ſin, yea his own <hi>wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> but now he could not be ſo perfect Created, that he could not fall into ſin at all. The reaſon is, becauſe his weight, meaſure and number could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it; becauſe he was not born of God, but had his Principles beſides God, although through God; but what is born of God and of his ſeed, that cannot ſin, becauſe it is born of God, to whom it is impoſſible to commit ſin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:99781:92"/>
Thus is made clear and manifeſt the mighty abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant difference in the <hi>Creation,</hi> which was very good at the <hi>Renovation,</hi> which was done in and on the old Creature, by means and help of the ſpirit of God, and among the new births from above of God, which is it alone to make Children and Heirs of God, and Co-heirs of Chriſt, unknown to the world, and their wiſe Children.</p>
                  <p>Now the Angels conſiſting out of <hi>Wind, Fire</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> and the fall of <hi>Lucifer</hi> ſtanding before them as a warning; therefore they cover their feet and faces before God with fear and trembling, and are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſhamed of themſelves, that they may find grace before the <hi>Lord God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now they are a fiery flame for a protection of the godly, and a perdition and death to the wicked: God alſo is a conſuming fire in his Angels, not on, or in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and will come alſo with his Angels, and his <hi>Power,</hi> and with fiery flames to judgment.</p>

                  <p>HItherto the light was not reckoned under the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by the wiſe of the world, though it be the firſt of them in the Creation, for in all Creatures the Bloud and Eyes are firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not the Heart.

                     </gap> is a dwelling of the ſeven ſpirits of God, as the darkneſs is an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Evil ſpirits. In the light dwelleth the ſpirit of the Lord, the ſpirit of wiſdom and underſtanding, the ſpirit of Counſel and of ſtrength, the ſpirit of Knowledge and of the fear of the Lord. All wiſdom underſtanding and knowledge, all judgment and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and every truth and righteouſneſs cometh from, and out of the light, and through the ſame.</p>
                  <p>And as the light doth illuminate the whole world, and maketh day, and is the day it ſelf: So it illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates alſo every ſpirit in all living ſouls; and as there is no day without light, neither can be; ſo no wiſdom, nor knowledge nor underſtanding can be without light. But the light in its body, in our opinion, is a pure eſſential ſpiritual Salt from which all Gemms and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99781:93"/>
ſtones get their Colour; as alſo all Flowers and Beauties their fairneſs. All which the ſpirit of light doth work, and adorneth all things with beauties; for in the light all Colours are hid, and are gotten by the ſame, the ſoul of the light is nothing elſe, but a joyful Life out of Nature, as an Angelical Life, and his ſpirit and eternal love proceeding from the ſpirit of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Out of this light God hath made the lights of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which are coagulated, living and comprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble lights, and are nothing elſe in their eſſence, but a ſpiritual eſſential and exceeding pure Chriſtalline ſalt, ſo high tempered, as ever any thing may be without any quality or property of heat; coldneſs, warmth, moiſtneſs, drought, and have their proper motion in and on themſelves; eſpecially the Sun <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thoſe lights of Heaven do ſhew always and every where clearly the power of the Elements and contrary Elements, what their operations be, through which powers all things in the whole world are finiſhed and wrought upon, but through the lights of Heaven no leſs then a Looking Glaſs ſheweth ſuch and ſuch you ſee.</p>
                  <p>Now the powers of the Elements and contrary Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments change and revolve daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly. Now becauſe out of the light cometh know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which ſearcheth out all the depths in every ſpirit, ſoul and body, and preſents them in the lights of Heaven, propheſie, tell, and give to underſtand to the beholders, who are the Children of the light. The ſpirit of light ſearcheth all in all things, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the lights of Heaven every aſcendent or ſpirit

in all things, and alſo in Man, namely what ſpirit, ſoul and body he hath received at his nativity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Elements and oppoſite Elements, as alſo what ſpirits do incentre in him: All which if bad or evil Man may decline<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or reſiſt by the holy and good ſpirit, as a beaſt can ſhake off the duſt or flyes.</p>
                  <p>Now the Lights of Heaven rule the whole world, namely acording to their time, and ſhew things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, paſt, and future: Now becauſe every Element hath its ſpirits, as the Earth, the Water, and the Air, and their eyes are more ſpiritual then our bodily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they can therefore ſpy ſomething in the lights of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and reveal it to Man: But the Children of light do not uſe the Communion of ſuch ſpirits at all, neither ſhould it be; becauſe it is the next degree to <hi>Witch-craft<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> The Natural Magick can do much; of which the wiſe Men of the Eaſt made uſe profitably, who clime to Chriſt: But the Angelical may do more yet, and much more the divine.

For by the natural Magick, Devils may be caſt out, and great wonders done by it. The Prince of darkneſs can turn to the ſhape of of an Angel of light, and will have every where his hand in the work.

hath his proper Angel, and his bad Angel alſo: By the good Angels all good things man doth, are ſet down truly, and the bad Angels obſerve all evil that man doth, and when once the books are to be opened, men will be judged according to their works and words. Well be it with him, who hath blotted out his black Regiſter with repenting tears. The ſpirit we cannot ſee, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs our eyes be opened.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, between light and darkneſs, light and fire is ſuch a great difference, as between life and death; bleſſedneſs and perdition; yea as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the Devil.

                  <head>CHAP XI. Of the Principle of the fire, and its Myſtery.</head>
                  <p>THere is a threefold fire, namely, the fire of the contrary Element, the fire of the Angels, and the fire of the Devils.</p>
                  <p>The fire of the contrary element is threefold. Firſt before the fall, a ſtill reſting and unmanifeſted fire, without a burning flame. Secondly, after the fall, a kindled, manifeſted, burning, flaming fire. Thirdly, a cold wateriſh fire, which doth not burn, yet ſmoketh, &amp; worketh into the earth upon Minerals, and Metals. With this cold wateriſh fire all things are forced, and the Metals alſo; for it doth calcinate them, and turneth them as it were into aſhes, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and openeth them.</p>
                  <p>This fire is chiefly threefold, as 1. <hi>Vegitable,</hi> which is as it were tempered, and is a well rectified Vineger, which is extreamly uſeful. Of which not many words, <hi>Sat ſapienti dictum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is a mineral fire, which chiefly is the true ſpirit of <hi>Nitre,</hi> a ſpiritual water out of Salt-peter, which hath both heat and cold, and is Infernal and Coeleſtial.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:99781:95"/>
Thirdly, <hi>Mercurial</hi> or <hi>Saturnine,</hi> a ſtrong Salt that hath not its fellow. Without this no Metal is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred, nor broken, or groweth, in which is a great myſtery hid, more then can be Imagined. But the true ſpirit of <hi>Nitre</hi> muſt not be prepared without a cold fire; for the raging, horrible, and furious Hell, which is in Saltpeter, muſt in its devouring and conſuming fire be over whelmed, drowned and devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and be reduced to a bleſſed Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Now when a Heavenly Water is at hand, then a new birth from above out of water and ſpirit can follow. Here lyeth hid a great <hi>Medicine</hi> in time of the raging Plague, Head-aches, Leavers, Stone, Gout, and many more diſeaſes, to be uſed. And truly the time is come, when all things muſt be made manifeſt; and although we have not yet with our hands prepared it; yet the ſpirit of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom can teach us all what is ſecret and myſtical, who ſearcheth into all deepneſſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and can ſhew, teſtifie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and make known to us that which no eye hath ſeen, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Ear hath heard, and which hath never entred into mans heart.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is alſo a Metalline cold fire, which reduceth all Metals, yea Gold it ſelf to nothing; only that noble grain in the Gold hidden, ſtayeth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, which cannot be forced, and that fire is Lead, <hi>Saturn,</hi> which devoureth all Metals, and conſumeth alſo it ſelf in the fire at laſt: Even as the common fire doth conſume and devour all wood, and at laſt it ſelf is conſumed, and goeth out: But in the Cinders that remain, there lyeth the treaſure hidden, which muſt be drawn out of it with hot water.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:99781:96"/>
The Metals have two ſorts of waters, a Cold and a Hot, and both are fire. The Cold is <hi>Saturn,</hi> Lead, the Hot is <hi>Mercury.</hi> Now as the one is an extream Helliſh Cold; ſo is the other extream hot of a Helliſh Heat; ſo that by reaſon of heat it ſtands in a continual flowing, although it feels outwardly Cold.</p>
                  <p>Now in this fire water, the Metals, eſpecially Gold, after their death, are born anew, namely, in the Metalline world, and Reign; and yet are anew Clarified, Chriſtalline, Spiritual, Heavenly body; which is ſo glorious, that it can make inferiour and leſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, yet to his nature not unlike Metals to his own ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>So much is it worth to know the nature of fire, and its myſtery, without which no good or profitable uſe of it may be had, for our good; for all muſt be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led firſt in the cold fire, even as it were through its Winter, according to the proceeding of nature, muſt dye and putrifie, if it ſhall be produced again in a new body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the fire according to its principle, is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out of darkneſs, from thence it is produced, and returneth into it again: But darkneſs was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten out of the <hi>Nothing,</hi> and that <hi>Nothing</hi> ſtood there in the beginning of the Creation to the <hi>Something,</hi> as a Teſtimony of that which was Created: For all that is made and Created, that was before <hi>nothing,</hi> and before it be faſhioned, then it was not faſhioned without a frame, and was as it were a <hi>dark Ens</hi> or <hi>Being,</hi> out of which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is born the Light, that is a faſhionable <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> that is out of the <hi>inviſible,</hi> a <hi>viſible</hi> thing is made.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:99781:96"/>
Therefore the darkneſs and fire, in a good ſenſe, and before the fall, are an excrement of the Light, yet are good and uſeful, even as that which a Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter heweth or cutteth away from that matter, which he intends to make ſome faſhionable thing: Even as Chips from wood are of the ſame ſubſtance with that which is framed out of it; yet an excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, and when theſe Chips are flung into the fire, they return to nothing. So the contrary Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments when they are known<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are no more good, but an oppoſition, adverſe and ſtark nought.</p>
                  <p>Further be it known, that in the divine world are no contrary Elements, nay there can be none in it, although their power hath preſſed into it yea in the depths of God, in which it grew dark, when the <hi>Lord</hi> of glory dyed on the Croſs, and the fire of the raging wrath of God conſumed the ſame, and death and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition killed him, Who can ſpeak it out, or who knows what this ſaying doth mean!</p>
                  <p>Alſo in the Angelical world there is no darkneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but yet there is fire. This Angelical fire is an <hi>Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the light, out of which the ſpirit of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ngels is; and this fire alſo in the beginning, and before the fall hath been a quiet and unknown fire, and very good; becauſe it was and is the ſoul of the Light in the Angels: But after the fall it was manifeſt, known and turn'd to a flame, and ſuch a one wherein the raging anger of God doth reſt, in which all Gods Judgments do conſiſt, and come out of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>This fire now in the Angels with its rage, anger, and conſuming flame is not evil at all; but a juſt fire of Gods juſtice to puniſh the wicked. All anger, rage and judgment proceed out of the Angelical world, as alſo the Law, which was promulgated with fire. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 53, 38. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 2.</p>

There is a threefold <hi>ſalt,</hi> namely a <hi>Divine, Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> and <hi>Elementary.</hi> All muſt be ſeaſoned with ſalt, if it ſhall laſt good, and ſalt is the moſt noble and wholſomeſt Balm, the beſt preſervative and Conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative, the higheſt ſtrengthening. The <hi>ſalt</hi> of the <hi>Divine world is a true light, a Spirit and VVater</hi> from above, whereby we are illuminated, breathed on, and baptized, yea ſeaſoned and ſalted, that the helliſh may have no power over us. For every one muſt be ſeaſoned with fire, and muſt be tried with fire, who and what doth ſubſiſt in it, that is bleſſed, elſe it is nothing at all. <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 49, 50. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 14. The ſalt of the <hi>Angelical world</hi> is a quick life, in its glory concentred of God into the Tree of Life; which when it ſhall be broken at the glorious coming of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> then all Created things in Heaven and Earth, in this Elementary world, he will ſo gloriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and powerfully ſeaſon with ſalt, that they ſhall be freed and redeemed from ſin, <hi>Curſe, Death, Devil,</hi> Vanity, Pain and Miſery, and that will be a noble food at that great <hi>Supper,</hi> of which as of an <hi>Angelical,</hi> and <hi>Coeleſtial</hi> Manna, all fleſh, that is, all Created things and whole Creatures, ſhall eat, and drink, and feed, And then alſo ſhall be put away the ſharp, bitter, ſowre, conſuming, devouring, periſhing, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, reducing <hi>ſalt</hi> of the contrary Element, it ſhall dye, and to its place be ſeparated. Of the elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>ſalt</hi> we have ſpoken already above.</p>
                  <p>There is another <hi>ſalt</hi> alſo of the contrary element, which is threefold; namely in the Earth, Sea and Air, The <hi>ſalt</hi> of the contrary element, is a ſharp devouring, conſuming <hi>ſalt,</hi> and reigneth in all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and is always mixed with the good <hi>ſalt</hi> which in the conſuming ſharp <hi>ſalt</hi> is held Captive, and can no ſooner be ſet at liberty, till that which holds it Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99781:98"/>
be drowned and killed by a cold fire, which is a water above mentioned.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Salt</hi> now is predominant chiefly in the <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> in the <hi>Mineral Salts,</hi> as common <hi>Salt, Vitriol, Saltpeter, Alume, Salmoniak,</hi> &amp;c. and is as it were fixed in this.

                  <p>Laſtly in all Arſenicks is the <hi>Salt</hi> of the contrary Elements, eſſential and ſpiritual. True it is a right Poiſon, but having an eſſence, why ſhould not ſome thing be hidden in it.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be carefully and purely killed with a cold fire, and be reduced to a new noble birth.</p>
                  <p>It is to be obſerved by the by, that every Lee, eſpecially that of quicklime is a cold fire, and that ſame in the unmature Metals, that have yet their <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, Mercury</hi> and <hi>Arſenick,</hi> may doubtleſs be of good uſe, eſpecially in ſome Iron or Copper <hi>Mines,</hi> in which the Sulphur of <hi>Sol,</hi> the glory of Gold ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently appeareth; for the flying muſt through a fixed, be made firm and glorious.

True we cannot ſpeak with Tongues; for we are more taken up with <hi>Propheſying,</hi> according to the grace beſtowed upon us. Therefore we will give the interpretation of it to others, to let them ſearch, to learn what <hi>Scha Ma Jm</hi> meaneth.</p>
                  <p>So much is known, that out of <hi>Scha Ma Jm</hi> all other things are come, as alſo the water, out of which <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> in the beginning of the Creation were Created; for it is not enough that we know, how that the world was Created out of the <hi>water;</hi> but we ask alſo from whence came that <hi>water</hi> then, out of which the world was made?

                  <p>It is manifeſt, that all <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Dew,</hi> before it is a bodily <hi>Water,</hi> is firſt a <hi>Vapour.</hi> But how<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and out of what, and from whence, and whereby that <hi>Vapour</hi> ariſeth, muſt be ſearched into: And in our opinion it is nothing elſe, but ſuch a bodily ſpirit, who in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf incloſeth all in all, and yieldeth and giveth all to all, and at laſt gathereth all to himſelf. Out of which now the world is Created, that ſame is alſo in all things, and without it there is nothing no where, and when that is taken away from it again, then it can be no more of a being.</p>

                  <p>THe Creation in its order is threefold. Firſt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral in the <hi>Scha Ma Jm,</hi> which was the firſt <hi>Materia,</hi> and is yet, out of which corporally all things are Created, into which all Principles come together, and are concentred: Afterward <hi>Special,</hi> on and in the <hi>Element,</hi> as <hi>Lights, Heaven, Earth,</hi> and <hi>Water, Spirit, Wind,</hi> and <hi>Air,</hi> are contained in <hi>Scha Ma Jm.</hi> Laſtly Particular, as in all theſe things, which out, on, in, and by the <hi>Elements</hi> were Created, produced and made.</p>
                  <p>The firſt that was made in the particular Creation, were the <hi>Vegitables,</hi> all growing things on earth, as Graſs, Herbs, Trees, amongſt which the Vine Tree is the chiefeſt. Now every thing hath its proper ſeed in it ſelf: Therefore here ceaſeth Creation; and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi> and <hi>birth</hi> begins, out, in, and by his own ſeed; but at firſt all things were brought forth out of the earth, on Graſs, Trees and Herbs, through the <hi>Word, Spirit</hi> and <hi>Salt.</hi> The <hi>Salt</hi> hath given to the Graſs, Herbs and Trees their bodies, which they all have in them. The <hi>Spirit</hi> hath given them Power and Virtue, eſpecially for Phyſick; but the <hi>Word</hi> giveth the bleſſing to it. The true Phyſick. Virtue and Bleſſing may be ſought, and gathered out of the ſalt of the

                     </gap>n hath begun from, and on the <hi>lower,</hi> and went upwards. As now the earth is adorned with Graſs, Herbs and Trees; So had God on the fourth day adorned the Heaven and Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Lights, Sun, Moon and Stars, which came forth and grew out of fixed flying and <hi>flying-fixed Salt</hi> of the <hi>Heaven,</hi> and are even as the precious ſtones of the earth. They are fixed in their Heavenly body, and at the higheſt temper, but they are flying in their courſe, although ſome of them do ſtand ſtill.</p>
                  <p>The chief Lights of Heaven are the ſeven <hi>Planets. Saturn</hi> is the higheſt, and belongeth to the earth, and ſtandeth to the earth; who knoweth whether he were the higheſt at the beginning, or whether he came to be the higheſt after the fall, and that <hi>Mercury</hi> was to give place to him. Many things are to us hid, and much of myſtical ſecrecy is in them. For <hi>Saturn</hi> eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all, and is <hi>Death,</hi> and domineers over all. But <hi>Mercury</hi> maketh alive and growing. Of all much were to be ſaid, but <hi>Sapienti ſatis.</hi> Therefore we muſt take good heed to the contrary elements, which
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99781:102"/>
over the fall ruled over all: But we muſt be careful and witty to rule over them, that <hi>death</hi> may be drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſwallowed up in victory.</p>
                  <p>On the fifth day God Created out of the Waters all things that live therein, and alſo the Birds out of the <hi>flying ſalt</hi> in the water: Hence it is that they are ſo flying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and theſe have their particular conſideration by reaſon of the <hi>flying ſalt,</hi> and in their Feathers they are Phyſical in <hi>flying Mercurial</hi> diſeaſes, as in the Falling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſickneſs, Madneſs, Giddineſs; for theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes have their original from the Spirits, through Gods permiſſion, and muſt be cured with a flying Salt, which is reduced to the higheſt degree.</p>
                  <p>Be it known alſo, that there is great Virtue in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones, as in <hi>Pearls, Amber, Coral,</hi> namely, when they are firſt baptized with a Coeleſtial water, which be altogether <hi>Spirit.</hi> The <hi>Load-ſtone</hi> alſo hath its myſtery: And who can tell all? We may well ſay, <hi>Great are the works of the Lord:</hi> He that obſerveth them taketh delight therein, and to them they are propounded. On the ſixth day <hi>God</hi> Created all the <hi>beaſt of the earth, and the Worms, and at laſt man,</hi> with him he cloſed up the Creation. Among the <hi>

No Creature is ſo bodily fair and ſubtil as the <hi>Serpent.</hi> Now becauſe ſhe was at firſt always about Man, therefore the <hi>Devil</hi> did perſwade her to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99781:102"/>
Man, that he ſhould break of the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and eat of the fruit thereof.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe the <hi>Serpent</hi> is Mercurial and flying, and is the Center of all Beaſts, therefore needs muſt there be a great myſtery in her for Phyſick, if rightly prepared for the Mercurial diſeaſes, eſpecially being full of bones.</p>
                  <p>Therefore God hath finiſhed the work of Creation on the ſixth day, with and on men; of whoſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereafter; and on the ſeventh day the <hi>Lord</hi> did reſt, and bleſſed that ſame day. The ſix days bear a Curſe by Reaſon of ſin; but the ſeventh day that now truly cometh, that bringeth bleſſing and reſt, Joy, Honour and Glory; which joyful day of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, we through the ſpirit of Propheſying do an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciate to all Creatures under Heaven in an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Goſpel, and a very joyous Meſſage, which to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciate is given to us from the ſpirit of propheſying.</p>

                  <p>II is known out of the Holy Scriptures, that all things are made and Created by the word, and that yet all things are made by the word, and are preſerved through the word. But here we will not ſpeak <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologically,</hi> but only <hi>naturally</hi> according to the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; Neither do we ſpeak <hi>Theoſophically</hi> of the depths of God, both which we ſave till another time and place.</p>
                  <p>The word of Creation is the general power of God, out of which, in which, and by which all things are, ſubſiſt, and will be. This general power of Almighty God every Creature makes uſe of for its beſt good: But only Man abuſeth it, as alſo do the Devils and Spirits by Gods permiſſion: Hence it cometh, that men muſt give an account of every idle word; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have abuſed the breath of the Almighty, and uſe it to ſin. Oh, that I could lay a Lock to my mouth, that I might not tranſgreſs with my Tongue.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe now all Myſteries are hid in the word, therefore the ſame alſo performs all things in the world: Therefore we will ſay, that hence ariſeth a three fold Magick through faith, that is a power to know ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to bring it to an effect.</p>

                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:99781:103"/>
Firſt there is a <hi>Natural Magick,</hi> which cometh out of <hi>Natural Faith,</hi> wherein there is ſuch a <hi>Magnet</hi> or <hi>Load ſtone,</hi> that it can draw all things to it. This faith is gotten in <hi>Man,</hi> either of nature in his Spirit, which is the true and right aſcendent, namely the ſpirit of man, and by no means this or that Aſtre or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation, as the ignorant do imagine, which is only <hi>in ſignam aſcendentis,</hi> &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Or this faith through the art and inſtruction of the natural <hi>Magick,</hi> is wrought in man, ſo that his ſpirit receiveth the aſcendent, and rejoyceth in the ſame. As the aſcendents in an may very well be tranſmuted, tranſplanted, and altered by the ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>Of his natural <hi>Magick,</hi> without Witchcraft, the wiſe men of the Eaſt made lawful uſe, who knew the Star, and proceeded ſo far therein, that they go not only great knowledge, but have alſo done wonders.</p>
                  <p>This natural <hi>Magick</hi> is learned out of the true and perfect degree from the Spirit of God, and goeth before and beyond the aſcendent, becauſe commonly other Spirits do mingle themſelves into it.

                  <p>From this natural <hi>Magick</hi> art the falſe Magicians took theirs, and becauſe the true aſcendent was not in them, namely the Spirit of God, but had only their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, or their Maſters aſcendent, therefore alſo <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer</hi> made ſhew of an Angel of <hi>Light,</hi> and became aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in them, and made <hi>Sorcerers</hi> of them. Now as true Magicians know and perform all by the Word of God, which ſpeaketh in them, operates out of them, and by them; ſo the <hi>Sorcerers</hi> abuſe the word in its power, and perform wonders thereby, till <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſtaff and

                     <hi>Balaam</hi> was a right natural Magician; but the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous ſpirit was aſcendent in him, that he went to the <hi>Sorcerers,</hi> that is to the ſpirit of Sorcery, and the ſpirit of Avarice had blinded his eyes, that he could not ſee the Angel that reſiſted him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Aſs ſaw him and was ſhye, therefore <hi>Balaam</hi> muſt be kill'd by the Sword, as others that deſerved it.

                  <p>Secondly, There is a Prophetical and Apoſtolical Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical art, which cometh out of faith of Gods Spirit in his Children, in which the word with glory dwelleth; the ſame ſpeaks to them, in them, as in the Prophets we read, <hi>The Lord hath ſpoken to me;</hi> namely, not always outwardly with a loud voice, but rather inwardly. Thus old <hi>Simeon</hi> had an anſwer from the <hi>Lord;</hi> thus the <hi>Lord</hi> alſo ſpake through the Ephod, &amp;c. By this Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal art the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> have done ſo many Miracles, raiſed the dead, and only by the word.</p>
                  <p>This Magical art the Devil preſumeth to imitate, namely that the word ſhould ſpeak out of <hi>Chrystals,</hi> by looking into it, out of Rings, wherein perhaps dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth a ſpirit, and ſpeaketh out of it, &amp;c. But this is not the word, but only a ſpirit bewitched into it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, There is yet a higher <hi>Magick</hi> of Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which worketh over and beyond nature, and that through <hi>faith,</hi> as when <hi>Moſes</hi> divided the waters with his Red, and <hi>Joſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The <hi>Sorcerers</hi> alſo think to make uſe of this <hi>Magick,</hi> but theirs is meer Witchcraft by Gods permiſſion; and yet things are performed really by them, even as the <hi>Egyptian Sorcerers</hi> brought up Frogs, &amp;c. but not by the finger of God, but by the ſpirit of the Devil, by which ſhortly the three unclean ſpirits and Frogs will do wonders, to ſeduce the Kings of the earth, as alſo other falſe <hi>Prophets. Rev.</hi> 16. 13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 29. Laſtly the word ſpeaketh out, in and by all things, becauſe it is in all things, and that by the ſignature and mark of every thing in the external viewing, and ſheweth clearly what is hidden within of power and virtue, if only the ſpeech and voice of the word could be heard and underſtood: But in the renewed future world, all theſe things will be clear and manifeſt to the praiſe of God.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XVI. Of the myſtery of the Created lower viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things.</head>
                  <p>GOd hath brought forth all Created viſible ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary things out of the inviſible that were ſo at the beginning, he made them to ſomething and viſible, and gave to every of them a <hi>Body, Soul</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> after their kind, and in them he hath hid his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible glory, that is the inviſible in the viſible. and the Coeleſtial in the Terreſtrial. This is the myſtery after which we muſt diligently ſeek, that is after the hidden <hi>wiſdom,</hi> which no eye hath ſeen, nor can ſee, neither ear hath heard, nor hath it entred into mans heart.</p>
                  <p>All theſe ſublunary Created things viſible, have a Terreſtrial body, and is viſible: But they have alſo a Coeleſtial body hid within them inwardly: The ſame is ſo long inviſible, till the viſible body is diſſolved and broke; and afterward the inviſible body is ſet forth to appear viſibly, which is heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Spiritual, conſiſting out of water and ſpirit, and is nothing elſe but a Chriſtalline, yea new born ſalt of life, which cannot be overcome by the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Element.</p>
                  <p>Further, every thing hath a <hi>ſouliſh life,</hi> that is ſuch a one which muſt fetch breath out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon air, and this is nouriſhed by the ſame, a life, which in a moment is and muſt be mortal, ſo that nothing is laſting of it. Now to this <hi>ſouliſh life</hi> is a quickening Spirit, which doth not fetch breath, as
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99781:105"/>
                     <hi>ſouliſh life;</hi> but it hath life, and is in it ſelf a Spirit of life, and not a breath, and hath eternal life in him, and is nothing elſe but the Spirit of God, and the breath of the Almighty that quickneth all. Laſtly, all things have a ſpirit, that returneth thither from whence it came, and doth not ſtay in the dead; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not the ſpirit of the dead, but of the living, and is the Spirit of God, which in and by the old Creation and Creature doth not ſtay for ever, but only in and by the <hi>new,</hi> which is from above. Thus nothing is laſting in this world, but <hi>vanity</hi> and <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi> but it ſheweth to us clearly, how that all theſe Created ſublunary viſible things are an Image of the things above.</p>
                  <p>This myſtery God hath diſcovered to his Children and to the wiſe, that namely this lower Created viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Elementary world is an Image of the upper viſible Spiritual, Coeleſtial, yea divine world. Therefore when the viſible Elementary world doth vaniſh, then the ſpiritual world yet inviſible, will be made m nifeſt and viſible: Therefore there is no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which doth not ſhew the myſtery of the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour ſpiritual world; of which myſtery and wonders in the future renewed world in <hi>Zion</hi> will be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now the Apoſtle ſiath clearly,</hi> We do not look upon the viſible, but upon the inviſible, <hi>2 Cor. 4. 18.</hi> Seek the things that are above, and not the things on Earth. <hi>Col. 3. 2.</hi> In my fathers houſe are many dwellings that laſt for ever, <hi>ſaith Chriſt.</hi> John <hi>14. Why ſhould we regard the viſible things which are fading away. The Apoſtle ſaith,</hi> If there be a Souliſh body, then there is a Spiritual body alſo. <hi>1 Cor. 15. 44.</hi> And when this houſe of our Earthly Tabernacle is broken, then we have an houſe from above of God, which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99781:106"/>
is not made with hands. <hi>2 Cor. 5.</hi> There are Terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al bodies, there are alſo Coeleſtial. <hi>1 Cor. 15. 40. Yet always the Spiritual, Coeleſtial, and yet invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, are hid within the ſouliſh, Terreſtrial, and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as God his inviſible glory continually pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down into this ſublunary world, ſo he gathereth it to him again, and then when all is ended in the end, he will ſet them before him in a new Creation, as it is written <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 5. <hi>Behold I make or Create all things new.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before this new Creation cometh, the renewing of the old Creation and Creature goeth before. Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the joyful coming of the <hi>Lord,</hi> which will be with great power and glory, becauſe all ſhall be ſet free that is called Creature. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23. From the Devil, Curſe, Death, then will be the joyful <hi>Jubile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we muſt know, that there will be great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the renewing, and the new being it ſelf. The old Creature is made new in its old being; but the new Creature hath a new eſſence, and that not from below, as the old, but from above, For above is the right eſſence, below is o ly the type and Image; this is the myſtery we are to obſerve. Above are the right Principles and Elements; theſe below are only a ſhadow: Below are meerly Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial bodies; but above are the Coeleſtial, although they are hid in thoſe below.</p>
                  <p>The Terreſtrial bodies are meer Aſhes, but the Coeleſtial are a noble ſalt of life. The Terreſtrial life is only ſouliſh and a mouth full of breath: If that be gone, then down falls all. But the Coeleſtial life is an Eternal life and cannot dye. The Terreſtrial ſpirit is but a wind, if that be gone it flyeth into the air and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99781:106"/>
vaniſheth: But the Spirit of God is a quickening Spirit' even as God himſelf is.</p>
                  <p>Now as all things are an Image of the Heavenly, ſo in truth the ſouliſh <hi>Adam,</hi> and Terreſtrial <hi>man,</hi> is an Image alſo of the Spiritual <hi>Adam,</hi> and Heavenly man, which is <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This is the great and miraculous Myſtery which thou O <hi>man,</hi> O <hi>Adam,</hi> O thou Image of God chiefly above all things ſhouldſt obſerve, that thou maiſt know thy ſelf in God, and God in thee, and maiſt know and learn what man is, what <hi>Adam</hi> is, what the Image of God is, that is, what thou thy ſelf art (of which in our book <hi>Adam)</hi> which is the greateſt wiſdom; Namely for one to know himſelf, after a perfect and true knowledge, which is ſpirit and truth: He that doth not regard this, but deſpiſeth it, which yet is Gods Image, rebuketh himſelf, and will be rebuked of God alſo.</p>

                  <p>In this part now <hi>Man</hi> is <hi>Souliſh,</hi> like unto the living Souls and Beaſts, which have all theſe but in their portion and meaſure, number and weight, namely as much as belongeth to them. According to this, man hath no more then they, and hath with them a living Soul, out and after the Elements, of equal beginning out of the earth, and of like going down to the earth

again. <hi>Sal.</hi> in <hi>Eccleſ</hi> 3. 19. After, Man hath more then the Beaſts which is out of another world, namely out of the Angelical; which is the <hi>Mind,</hi> which in its ſpirit is a <hi>Preacher</hi> of the Law, in all men from Nature, and hath the Knowledge, Will and Conſcience to good, directs Man to all good, and accuſeth man in evil things, in his Conſcience. <hi>Num.</hi> 2. 15, 16. Laſtly, Man hath alſo a higher and more glorious thing in him, which is the Breath of the <hi>Almighty</hi> a Heavenly Soul and life from God, which God breathed into the firſt mans Noſtrils and face, wherewith he hath marked and teſtified his divine inward love to his Image, in and on a piece and part of the Eternal light and life. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Job</hi> 27. 3. <hi>c.</hi> 33. 4. According to this part, Man is Immortal, becauſe he hath ſuch a treaſure within him, namely the Breath of the Almighty, and thus herein he is very much diſtinct from the beaſts, yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is above the Angels In this Heavenly Soul is hidden the Kingdom of God, and in this Breath of the Almighty conſiſts the true <hi>Manhood,</hi> by which he becometh a true immortal man: But in the other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary part, he is like unto the Beaſts, Terreſtrial, Corruptible, Mortal, Duſt and Aſhes,</p>
                  <p>Now man having received at the Creation ſuch a part out of God, from thence he can be made partaker of the new birth, Creation and Creature from God, of his Nature and Eſſential ſeed, which is the moſt holy Fleſh and Bloud of the <hi>Word,</hi> which is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and thus the new man is the new Creature out of <hi>Gods,</hi> and his quickening <hi>Words</hi> ſeed, that is of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of this Spiritual <hi>Adam</hi> and Heavenly man, of his fleſh and bone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Gods Inheritance: And this body together with this Heavenly Soul, and the Holy Ghoſt from God in its full ſelf-ſubſiſtance, doth not perſonally appear, till after the Angelical glory and laying down of the ſame body. Laſtly, in the end it entreth into the divine world: Hence it is ſaid not to be manifeſt yet, what the Children of God are, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.

                  <p>According to the Elementarineſs there is a threefold body in man, whilſt he liveth out of <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> when he is dead, out of <hi>wind &amp; earth</hi> till the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; when he riſeth out of Spirit, Light and Heaven, and know that every Element hath its proper body, life and ſpirit.

                     </gap>, eſſentially, bodily the Image of the inviſible God. <hi>Col.</hi> 5. 15, For God is a Spirit, and and may not be felt nor ſeen, unleſs it be in his eſſential ſubſtance, and ſubſtantial eſſence. Even as Man in his true Manhood, after which he is diſtinguiſhed from all other living Souls, a Spirit or Spiritual in and on his Spiritual Soul, and Mans Spirit cannot be ſeen, felt or known, otherwiſe then in his body, in which he dwelleth with all his fulneſs. So the inviſible God, who is a Spirit, cannot be ſeen or known but in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his ſubſtantial body, as in which God the Father,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99781:109"/>
the <hi>Word</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> together with the whole fulneſs of the Godhead dwelleth bodily. <hi>John</hi> 14 9. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 9. And this is the Spiritual <hi>Adam,</hi> a quickening Spirit, the Heavenly Man, the <hi>Lord</hi> out of Heaven 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 45, 47.</p>
                  <p>The Image of God is threefold; Namely 1. the Image of the Eſſence eſſentially, after man is, his own Image in his own proper Eſſence and Body: So <hi>Chriſt</hi> alſo is the eſſential and bodily Image in God, even as Mans body in Man, and ſo is <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as Man is in his body, his own eſſential ſelf-ſubſiſting bodily, and perſonal Image. 2. The Image of that form, on the outward appearance of that form, Face and Members, 3. The Image of the living proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Power, or what name ſoever it may be called. <hi>Here</hi> is manifeſt the Myſtery of the Image of God, and that <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>God</hi> was much ſooner a Man then we; for we are in all things faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after him, and ſo his <hi>counterfeit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt the Image of God, and Man who is out of Gods Image and honour are thus diſtinguiſhed; Namely, 1. As the Image and Eſſence. 2. As Eſſence and Eſſence. 3. As Spiritual, Heavenly and Divine, and as Souliſh, Terreſtrial and from beneath, that is as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Adam,</hi> Man and Man, and as above and beneath. The Souliſh <hi>Adam</hi> is not an Image of God after the Eſſence, as <hi>Chriſt, Reaſon,</hi> becauſe his Eſſence is Terreſtrial, and from beneath; but in and on that Terreſtrial body only that Image in that manner, as a counterfeit, and that in a Terreſtrial <hi>ſouliſh Eſſence</hi> from beneath out of the Earth: So is the Souliſh <hi>Adam</hi> and Terreſtrial Man, an Image of the Spiritual <hi>Adam</hi> and Heavenly man, as a ſtony wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en or Image of Wax of a living mans Image, is not in humane Eſſence, on the Fleſh and Bloud, but in another being.</p>

                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:99781:109"/>
Now as Eſſence and Eſſence are one diſtinct from another; ſo is frame and frame. 1, The inward form of God, is the moſt holy Godhead, which with all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs dwelleth bodily in Chriſt. Of this form man hath received the Breath of the Almighty in a Heavenly Soul to his inward eſſential form and true Manhood. 2. The bodily viſible, palpabl and perſonal form of God, eſſentially in which God perſonally appeared, and perſonally was made manifeſt, is the fleſh of the word the body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> After this man hath a body of fleſh, bloud and bones, but not Divine, Spiritual and Heavenly, but Souliſh, Terreſtrial, and from beneath. 3. The manifeſt face. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, and looks, and preſence on the head, body and all Members, and their Powers and ſtrength. After this alſo is Man framed, and thus to be looked on; in which conſideration ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Myſteries may be obſerved, although the ſpirit of Errour ſaith, as if God had no Head, Eyes, Ears, Face, Noſe, Mouth, no Hands nor Feet, becauſe he is a Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which rather befalls thoſe Spirits of Errour, he hath Eyes and ſeeth not, neither acknowledgeth the Image of God in <hi>Chriſt</hi> and in Man, hath Ears and heareth not, and a Heart, and underſtandeth nothing,</p>
                  <p>Further Man is made after Gods ſimilitude, and is like unto God; Namely 1. on the Heavenly Soul, <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>Immortal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <hi>The Stone which the builders rejected, is become the Corner Stone, and it is marvellous in our Eyes;</hi> for the Spiritual Rock, of which all the <hi>Fathers</hi> have eaten and drunk from the beginning of the world, and upon which the Church of God is founded and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, remained unknown, till to the ſeventh Trumpet, where the Myſtery of God muſt be manifeſted, and is alſo made manifeſt; for the Spiritual <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Man</hi> in his Divine Fleſh and Bloud, through which we are ſo dearly bought, is thruſt away from the <hi>Holy</hi> place; and on the contrary another Fleſh and Bloud from beneath out of ſinners is brought into the Holyeſt for an abomination of the deſolation.</p>

                  <p>Concerning the Myſtery of <hi>God</hi> in the Creation of <hi>Man,</hi> it is thus that <hi>God</hi> hath Created <hi>Man,</hi> a <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Woman.</hi> Gen. 1. 27. And took the <hi>Woman</hi> out of the <hi>Man, Chap.</hi> 2. 21, 22.

But the Divine, Spiritual and Heavenly <hi>Eve</hi> is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. 1. The moſt holy Godhead it ſelf. 2. The Church of Chriſt. 3 The Heavenly Soul in <hi>Man.</hi> This is the body of Chriſt his Church, whoſe Saviour he was made, for which he gave himſelf. The <hi>Divine Eve</hi> as the moſt Holy Godhead is the Mother of us all, and the right <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is from above. The Spiritual <hi>Eve</hi> as the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Mother, the Spouſe of the Lamb. The Virgin and Daughter of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The Heavenly Soul is the Heavenly <hi>Eve,</hi> a <hi>Maid</hi> of the Lord, a <hi>Daughter</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who was married
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99781:111"/>
to a Terreſtrial <hi>Man,</hi> who brought her to great miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and death; but the <hi>Lord</hi> was made a <hi>Servant</hi> for her, and hath made her free again through his death, and hath married unto her a new <hi>Adam man,</hi> out of his fleſh and bone, of which ſhe hath a divine Inheritance.</p>
                  <p>Now if we ask after the Myſtery of <hi>God,</hi> how that may be made known, anſwer is, on <hi>man</hi> it may be known: There is but one <hi>man</hi> in one <hi>Perſon,</hi> but in it three witneſſes of his ſubſtance, as Body, Soul and Spirit, and in ſeven Powers: The Spirit is always in ſtead of the Father, and is the Father himſelf alſo, and begetteth by the Soul, as by the true Mother, to himſelf a body, which is the <hi>Child</hi> and the Son, in which dwelleth all fulneſs. So there is but one <hi>God,</hi> in one only <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> but in three Witneſſes, <hi>Father, Word</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and in ſeven Spirits or Powers of <hi>God: God</hi> is a Spirit and a Father, and begets through the <hi>Word,</hi> and in the ſame to himſelf a Body, a <hi>Child,</hi> a <hi>Son,</hi> in which he with all his fulneſs dwelleth bodily, in this manner, that he that ſeeth the Father, ſeeth the Son alſo, the word it ſelf, the quickening Spirit, and the quickening <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Afterward <hi>God</hi> begets a Son, not after the <hi>Perſon,</hi> or a perſonal diſtinction, as one Man another Man, elſe there would be two Gods, although there is but one only God: But after the Teſtimony for our ſakes he begets a Son, that we namely by that Witneſs, as of the Father and Son in God, might be made Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Heirs and Co<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>heirs out of his Seed, fleſh and bones; for <hi>God</hi> in and for himſelf needs neither Father nor Son, becauſe there is never no more in him but one in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but even himſelf is <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> and all in all, neither are there two or three, but <hi>One</hi> only, and none elſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Laſtly <hi>God</hi> begets alſo a <hi>Son,</hi> and is a father after the Teſtimony, and that to all Creatures, and what ever
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99781:111"/>
he hath Created, namely, that all might have a truſt and confidence in him as alſo the young <hi>Ravens,</hi> when they are forſaken by the old ones. This Teſtimony is done by the Spirit, which from God is in all things, and fills up all. <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 1. Who it is that cryeth to God out of the young <hi>Ravens, Who is a God of the Spirits of all Fleſh.</hi> Num. 16. 22. And remembreth to <hi>God,</hi> that he is a father of all Creatures, and cannot, neither ought to forſake them. Now the Spirit is it, that calleth upon <hi>God</hi> in all Creatures, and praiſeth and glorifieth, him where is is ſaid in the <hi>Pſalm. All that hath breath Praiſe the Lord; Every Spirit Laud and Praiſe the Lord; The Earth, the Sea, and the Trees in the Foreſt Praiſe the Lord.</hi> O <hi>man</hi> there is much in the Spirit, the knowledge of him availeth much; for if you do not know him, you are but a Beaſt without a Spirit, as <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> and others more have it.</p>

Holineſs and Righteouſneſs: And the <hi>Divine Love</hi> containeth the whole Spirit, and poureth him out into our hearts, and thereby we know, that God hath loved us, becauſe he hath given us of his Spirit, which cryeth in us <hi>Abba,</hi> and giveth Teſtimony to our Spirit, that we are the Children of God; He poureth forth our Tears and Prayers before God, that we might find grace before the <hi>Lord,</hi> and teacheth us to pray aright before the Lord about things that are above, &amp; maketh interceſſion for us with unſpeakable ſighs.</p>

                  <p>Of this great glory and unſpeakable joy, the Spirit propheſieth in all Creatures, yea in all Lights of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and in all the Elements. But where are the Seers, where are the Hearers, and where are the Obſervers.</p>
                  <p>Further concerning the time of the world, it is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in 1. 3. and 7.

Now if 1656. are ſummed up with the other, then the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is born into the world of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> in the year of the world 4230.</p>
                  <p>The third time of the world is from Chriſts Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

                  <p>Concerning the aboveſaid threefold number, 7. 49. 70. therein is the Myſtery clearly ſignified without any diminution or addition, if only you will open your Eyes, Ears and Hearts to ſee, hear and obſerve, clearer it cannot poſſibly be told, theſe numbers in themſelves calculated, namely, to know certainly how many years every hour of the twelve do contain, becauſe the 6000. years are not compleat, but thoſe days muſt be ſhortned</p>
                  <p>But now as in the former times and judgments over the world, always ſeven days went before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came upon the world: So it is now in and with the time of the judgment over this world. <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 4. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 6. <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.

                  <p>COurteous Reader, we conclude this our <hi>Jehior</hi> or <hi>Morning Light,</hi> and ſalute you in the <hi>Lord,</hi> from the <hi>Lord</hi> in the Spirit of Grace and Supplication, which the <hi>Lord</hi> will pour out over us all, through the Power from above, that we might find Grace before him at his coming, and may not be put to ſhame when he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reader,</hi> if you are a wellwiſher to Wiſdom, then take of us the Crumbs which we have gathered from the Lords Table, and accept of them till <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech</hi> cometh, and diſtributeth the Holy <hi>Shew-bread,</hi> and to drink of the <hi>New Wine</hi> of his distributing at the great Supper of the <hi>Nuptials</hi> of the Lamb in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> the fruits whereof himſelf will
<pb facs="tcp:99781:116"/>
ſet up. You are to give thanks with us to him, from whom all good gifts come from above the <hi>Father</hi> of Lights, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he would inlighten us all, turn us to him, and make us happy for ever. This is according to the love of God, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſire is, that <hi>all men may be ſaved,</hi> and that <hi>all may come to the knowledge of the Truth:</hi> Therefore let us be merciful, loving and perfect, <hi>Even as our Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father is merciful, loving and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> that it may be known and revealed, that we are his Children.</p>
                  <p>But Curteous Reader, if you affect fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and art a deſpiſer of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> go to, and deſpiſe, but be ſure that you do not deſpiſe men herein, but <hi>God</hi> himſelf, who hath given us his Spirit, and from whom all Wiſdom cometh, and think that the Spirit of judgment will require an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of you in that day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But Reader, if you are a</hi> Phariſee <hi>and Hypocrite, and ſeekeſt rather Honour from</hi> Men, <hi>then from</hi> God; <hi>We'll conſider</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:99781:116"/>
                     <hi>then, what the</hi> Lord <hi>ſaith,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 30. He that honoureth me, him I will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour alſo, and he that deſpiſeth me, ſhall be deſpiſed again. <hi>And Chriſt ſaith,</hi> Mat. 10. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. He that confeſſeth me before men, him will I alſo confeſs before my Heavenly Father that is in Heaven. He that denieth me before men, him will I alſo deny before my Heavenly father.</p>
                  <p>But Reader, if you are a ſimple <hi>Heart,</hi> and art not fit for Wiſdom, then abide on, in, and by the fear of the <hi>Lord,</hi> in a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life; which fear is not only the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Wiſdom, but alſo the end of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and it is no help to man, though he be able to ſpeak with an Angelical Tongue, and had all knowledge, and underſtood all Myſteries, and had ſuch a faith, whereby he could remove Mountains, and withall had not the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which endured everlastingly, all will profit you nothing. Therefore bleſſed are the Babes and ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings which know not theſe outward
<pb facs="tcp:99781:117"/>
things, <hi>for theirs is the Kingdom of God,</hi> becauſe the Spirit of God is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in them. Therefore let no man be puffed up with Knowledge: And for our part we are not extol'd therewith, for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan alſo doth buffet us with fists, and doth upbraid us with our ſhame. Therefore we humble our ſelves that the <hi>Lord</hi> may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of us in mercy, <hi>Who giveth Grace to the humble, and beholdeth low things, and him that is of a contrite heart, and trembleth at his Word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, This is the Concluſion, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one examine himſelf, and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Spirit, Truth and Wiſdom, and no otherwiſe, whether God, Christ, and the Holy Ghoſt be in him, which every one may know by his thoughts, Words and Works, in his affection, will, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and in his Knowledge and Conſcience. Every good thing is from God, and of God, and not of Men. All Sin is from the Devil, who ſeduceth man, and leadeth him to perdition and destruction. Well be to him,
<pb facs="tcp:99781:117"/>
who ſeparates bad from good, rejects bad things, and maketh choice of good, and beareth fruit thereby.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lord Zeboah</hi> will at last take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the evil Eternally, and reſtore the good again, and return bad things to that evil one, and recompence it upon his head, <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord our God be gracious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and help forward the works of his hands, yea, the works of his hands he will help forward, <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Praiſed be the Lord that cometh, and bleſſed be his glorious name. All the world be full of his Honour,</p>

                  <p>BE pleaſed to underſtand, that ſome <hi>(ſmall Number)</hi> of theſe Books in this Catalogue cannot abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called Chymical, but have a very near affinity thereunto, the knowledge of natural Philoſophy being an Introduction to ſupernatural things; nor do I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to publiſh this as an abſolute Collection of <hi>Engliſh Chymical Authors;</hi> (diſtruſting I may have forgotten ſome of common note) but rather as an Eſſay to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke others (better able) to perfect it. Several of theſe Books I have drawn out of the Catalogues of <hi>And: Maunſel, William London,</hi> and the <hi>Mercurius Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarius;</hi> others I have more largely tranſcribed from the Books themſelves, with the Date when Printed, and in what Volume, as near as the ſhortneſs of my time would permit, having but a few days to Collect it; and therefore I crave excuſe for my miſtakes, and leave the perfecting thereof to time, and other mens ingenuity, who ſhall pleaſe to take the pains to add what ſhall come within the verge of their Knowledge, or be preſented to their view. <hi>Vale.</hi>
