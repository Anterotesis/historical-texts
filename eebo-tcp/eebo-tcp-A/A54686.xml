            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And can truly say and aver with many witnesses to confirm it, that my long observations ever since the year 1628. until now, compleating almost full 46 years of the said persecutions, disloyalties, misusages, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr in order and design to his Murder, and the many Plots afterwards intended against his late Royal Majesty, King <hi>Charles</hi> the second, and his now Sacred Majesty, and my <hi>Researches</hi> into the Records and Antiquities of this and other Nations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Just Rights and Praerogatives of our Kings and Princes, for the publick good, and the avoiding the manifold miseries and damage that attend the Witchcraft and Madness of Rebellion, and to the end that I might recal into the right way of truth those very many No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, learned, grave and pious men, that perfectly hated Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and yet by fear or force going along with the Tide to secure themselves and Estates as well as they could, and with the Vulgus and Rabble that had cut the reformed Church of <hi>England</hi> into no less than 160 Sects or new fashioned Religions, and so far strayed from their Mother the reformed Church of <hi>England,</hi> as they ran out of their Wits as much as their Religion, so that they could not stop themselves in that their mad Career until they came to an opinion that it was <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> to be <hi>Rebellious,</hi> and that Rebellion or Sedition for any thing called <hi>Religion</hi> was, or at least ought to be warrantable by some or other word of God, when by his <hi>new light</hi> they should be enabled to discover it, hath given me, like old <hi>Barzillai,</hi> no quiet until I had done my

And may find that they have by a Factious and Seditious Ignorance, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bold adventure enticed many good men and Lawyers out of the paths of truth into an horrid Confusion and Rebellion, for which they may suffer in the next World, unless they can furnish their gross mistakes with some invisible or misinterpreted Record that every man may fancy, and frame a new and better Government of the Kingdom, and carve and make his own Religion, and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cize and propagate their own vain imaginations and self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lreated ignorant Fancies instead of Laws and Records.

the whole Province of <hi>York,</hi> and Excommunicated the Sheriff; Into which County the King, with his Queen <hi>Isabel,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards making their Progress, in their Journey towards <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and exacting great Fines of Offenders in his Forests, the Archbishop his Brother refused him Wine, and the Honour of the Bells at <hi>Beverly.</hi> A reconciliation was notwithstanding made betwixt them, by the mediation of four Bishops, and as many Barons, with a great sum of money, and a promise to reform excesses on both parts: When the King, upon <hi>Easter</hi> after his return from the North, was again Crowned at <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and with him his Queen, by the Archbishop <hi>Hubert;</hi> and there the Earls and Barons of <hi>England</hi> were summoned to be ready with Horse and Armour, to pass the Seas with him presently after <hi>Whitsontide;</hi> but they holding a Conference to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at <hi>Leicester,</hi> by a general consent, sent him word, that unless he would render them their Rights and Liberties, they would not attend him out of the Kingdom; whereupon he required of them security, by the delivering up unto him the principal of their Castles, and began with <hi>William de Albany,</hi> for his Castle of <hi>Belvoir,</hi> who delivered unto him his Son as a Pledge, but not the Castle.</p>
               <p>And the King, with the King of <hi>France,</hi> being after soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the Popes Legate, obtained a Subsidy of the fortieth part of all their Subjects Revenues for one year, by way of Alms, to succour the <hi>Holy Lands;</hi> for the levying whereof in <hi>England, Geffery Fitz-Peter,</hi> Justiciar in <hi>England,</hi> sent out his Writs by way of request and perswasion, (not as of due, or by co-action) to avoid example.</p>
               <p>Howsoever, the King of <hi>France</hi> declared for <hi>Arthur,</hi> to whom he married his youngest Daughter, required King <hi>John</hi> to deliver up unto him all his Provinces in <hi>France,</hi> and by a peremptory day summon'd him to appear personally at <hi>Paris,</hi> to answer what should be laid to his charge, and abide the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of his Court, which he refusing, was by sentence adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lose all which he did hold in <hi>France</hi> of that Crown; who thus beset with the King of <hi>France</hi> on the one side, and his Nephew <hi>Arthur</hi> and the Barons of <note n="o" place="margin">Daniel 130.</note> 
                  <hi>Anjou</hi> on the other, who laid siege to <hi>Mirabel,</hi> defended by <hi>Eleanor</hi> Mother of King <hi>John,</hi> who by her intermedling, turbulent, and unquiet spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, had done him no good: with great expedition relieved it, by defeating the whole Army; carrying away Prisoners Earl <hi>Arthur, Hugh le Brun,</hi> all the Barons of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and 200 Knights.</p>

Whereupon, <hi>Arthur</hi> being shortly after murdered in Prison, and the deed laid to his charge, with the cruel execution of many of his Prisoners, it so exasperated the Nobility of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Poicteau,</hi> as they all took Arms against him, and sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd him to answer in the Court of Justice of the King of <hi>France;</hi> which he denying, was condemned to forfeit the Dutchy of <hi>Normandy,</hi> which his Ancestors had held by the space of 300 years: and of that, and all his other Provinces in <hi>France,</hi> became wholly dispossest.</p>
               <p>And with that disastrous success returning into <hi>England,</hi> charged the Earls and Barons with the reproach of his losses in <hi>France,</hi> and fined them to pay the fourth part of all their Goods, for refusing their aid, to which the feudal Laws and their tenures had obliged them.</p>
               <p>Neither spared he the Church or Commonwealth in the like Imposition: of which <hi>Geffery Fitz-Peter,</hi> Justiciar of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> was Collector for the Laity, and <hi>Hubert</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> for the Clergy.</p>

               <p>In <hi>anno</hi> 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. of his Reign, another Imposition was laid, of the 13<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> part of all the moveables of the Clergy and Laity, which was again opposed by the Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> who so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly accursed the Receivers thereof <note n="p" place="margin">Daniel 131.</note> within his Province, and departed out of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Unto which also was added a miserable breach betwixt Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance and Authority; for <hi>Hubert</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> being dead, a great controversy happened betwixt the King and the Pope, upon the Monks of <hi>Canterbury's</hi> (who were sent about it to <hi>Rome)</hi> election of <hi>Stephen Langton</hi> a Cardinal; who, though an <hi>English-</hi>man born, had been bred in <hi>France,</hi> and an adhaerent to that King; Being thus elected, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated by the Pope at <hi>Viterbium</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> the election of the Bishop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> whom the King had procured to be elected, being made void, and those Monks and the rest of the Agents sent home, with the Popes Letters, exhorting the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignly to receive <hi>Stephen Langton;</hi> and charging the Monks remaining at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> by virtue of holy Obedience, to obey the Archbishop in all Temporal and Spiritual matters: With which the King being greatly displeased, seized upon all which the Monks had, who with their Prior hasted away to <hi>Flanders.</hi>

And writing a sharp Letter to the Pope concerning the wrong done unto him, in making void the election of <hi>Gray</hi> Bishop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and advancing <hi>Stephen Langton,</hi> a man unknown to him; and which was more to his prejudice, without his consent: gave him to understand, that he would stand for the liberties of his Crown to the death; constantly affirming, that he could not revoke the election of the Bishop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and that if he were not righted therein, he would stop up his passages of his Subjects to <hi>Rome;</hi> and, if necessity required, had in his Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and other his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, Archbishops, Bishops, and other Prelates, of so sufficient Learning, as they needed not to beg Justice and Judgment of Strangers. Unto which as angry a Letter being returned, and two Monks, who were staid at <hi>Dover,</hi> having been sent from <hi>Rome</hi> to demand his assent for the election of <hi>Stephen Langton,</hi> admonished him to endeavour to give him and the Church their Right, and not to cast himself into those difficulties from whence he could not easily release himself: since He in the end must overcome, to whom all knees bow in Heaven, Earth, and Hell, whose Vicegerency here below he exercised; Neither was it safe for him to repugn God and the Church, for which the glorious Martyr and Bishop <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Becket</hi> shed his Bloud: especially since his Father and Brother, late Kings of <hi>England,</hi> have in the hands of the Legates of the Apostolick See, abjured (which the Records and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials of <hi>England</hi> do with great clearness contradict) that (as he pleased to call it) <hi>Impious Custom.</hi>

               <p>Which they being ready to obey, with tears beseeching him that he would call home the Archbishop and the Monks of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and avoid the scandal of interdiction: The King in a great Passion against the Pope and Cardinal, interrupting their Speech, Swore, that if they, or any other, should dare to put the Kingdom under Interdiction, he would presently send all the Clergy of <hi>England</hi> to the Pope, and confiscate their Goods; and that if any of <hi>Rome</hi> should be found within any part of his Land, he would cause their Eyes to be put out, their Noses cut, (over fierce punishments long before usually and indifferently inflicted upon offending Criminals, Laicks

The Pope seeing that he would not yield, proceeded to an Excommunication of his Person, which did put him into a desperate rage against the Clergy, who durst not execute the Popes Mandate for many days after; which Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the King was accompanied with that of the Emperour <hi>Otho</hi> his Nephew, and all the Estates of <hi>Germany</hi> and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire were absolved from their Obedience and Fidelity: But the King having gained great Treasure from the <hi>Iews</hi> made a Voyage into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where receiving the Homage of many, and reducing much of that Country to his obedience, ordained the same to be governed by the Laws and Customs of <hi>England</hi> (the contests whereof were not then fully settled) making the Coin and Money thereof to be there Currant, and leaving <hi>John Grey</hi> Bishop of <hi>Norwich</hi> to be Justiciar, and there after three Months stay returned into <hi>Wales,</hi> which had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled; reduced them to Obedience, taking 28 of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of their best Families for Pledges: Whence returning in the <hi>13th.</hi> year of his Reign, he required, and had of every Knight that attended not his Army in that Expedition, two Marks; and at <hi>Northampton</hi> received the Popes Agents, <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulphus</hi> and <hi>Durandus,</hi> who were sent to make a Peace betwixt the Kingdom and Priesthood, (too many of whom in matters against the King were seldom at odds) by whose exhortation, and the consideration of the State of the Kingdom, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented that the Archbishop, and all the exiled Bishops, and Monks of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> should in peace return to their own; but refused to make satisfaction for their Goods taken away.</p>

return, having been relieved with much Provisions out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and Impositions for Escuage, a Parliament was in the <hi>28th.</hi> year of his Reign assembled at <hi>Westminster,</hi> wherein his Wars, the revolt of <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> who joyned together, and the present occasions of the necessary defence of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, being pressed, nothing could be effected without the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Reformation, and the due execution of Laws; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he came again himself in person, and pleaded his own necessities; but that produced no more than a desire of theirs, <note n="a" place="margin">Daniel 161.</note> to have ordained, that four of the most grave and discreet Peers should be chosen as <hi>Conservators</hi> of the Kingdom, and sworn of the Kings Council both to see Justice observed, and the Treasure issued, and ever attend about him, or at least three or two of them: That the Lord <hi>Chief-Justiciar</hi> and Lord <hi>Chancellor</hi> should be chosen by the general voices of the States assembled, or else be of the number of those four; and that there might be <hi>two Justices of the Benches, two Barons of the Exchequer,</hi> and one Justice for the <hi>Jews;</hi> and those likewise to be chosen by Parliament, that as their Function was publick, so should also be their Election. At which time the Pope sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Legate with a large power to exact money for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, his Agent was disgracefully returned, with an answer, <hi>That the Kingdom was poor, the Church in debt, and it was of a dangerous consequence to the State to be exposed to the will of the Pope; and therefore seeing a General Councel was shortly to be held at</hi> Lyons, <hi>if the Church would be relieved, it were fit to be done by a general consent of that Councel.</hi>

               <p>And the Emperour <hi>Frederick</hi> at the same time, by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the King, which were openly read, desiring, as he had often before, <hi>That the Pope might have no supplies ou of</hi> England; <hi>for that therewith he did oppress him, by seizing upon his Castles and Cities appertaining to the Empire: notwithstanding his often sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions, desire of Peace, and offers to refer the cause to the arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kings of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> France, <hi>and the</hi> Baronage <hi>of both Kingdoms;</hi> and entreating <hi>that he might not receive a detriment, whence as a Brother and Friend he expected a favour,</hi> added, <hi>that if the King would be advised by him, he would by power free the Kingdom from that unjust Tribute which Pope</hi> Innocent <hi>III. and other Popes had laid upon it;</hi> Which pleasing the Assembly, the business took up so much time, as (the design of a share in the Government, something like, if not worse then a <hi>Co-ordination,</hi> meeting with no concessions or effect) they only granted an Aid to the King for the Marriage of his Daughter, 20 <hi>s.</hi> of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Knights Fee, not without much ado, and repetition of all

               <p>After which, and his return from an expedition with great charges into <hi>Scotland,</hi> a Parliament was summoned, where he moved for an Aid against an Insurrection in <hi>Wales,</hi> and for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to supply his wants, and pay his Debts, which were so great, as he could not stir out of his Chamber for the clamour of those to whom he ow'd money for Wine, Wax, and other necessaries of House-keeping: which wrought so little, as to his face they denied to grant him any thing; and enquiry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made what Revenues the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> had in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> they found them to have been annually 60000 Marks; which being notified to the General Councel at <hi>Lyons,</hi> the Pope was so vexed therewith, as he was said to have uttered these words, <hi>The King begins to</hi> Frederize, <hi>it is fit that we make an end with the Emperour, that we might crush these pety Kings; for the Dragon once destroyed, these lesser Snakes will soon be trodden down.</hi>

               <p>In the <hi>32d.</hi> year of his Reign a Parliament being convoked, he was upon requiring another aid sharply reproved for his breach of promises; and it was alledged, that his Judges were sent in Circuit under pretence of Justice to fleece the people; that his needless expences amounted to above 800000 <hi>l.</hi> and advising him to recal the old Lands of the Crown, and pull them from his Favourites, enriched with the Treasure of the Kingdom, told him of his Oath made at his Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>The King promised redress, but nothing was effected: so that after sundry meetings, and much debate, the Parliament was prorogued until <hi>Midsummer</hi> following; and at the next Session he tells them, that <hi>they were not to impose a servile condition upon him, or deny him that which every one of them might do, to use whom they pleased as Counsel; Every Master of a Family might place or displace what Servants he pleased; Servants were not to judge their Masters, nor Subjects their Prince, or hold them to their conditions; and that he that should so encline to their pleasures, should not be their King, but as their Servant.</hi>

               <p>And being constrained to furnish his wants with the sale of his Plate and Jewels, his Crown of Gold, and <hi>Edward</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor's Shrine, and with great loss received money for them, enquired who had bought them; whereunto answer being made, that the City of <hi>London</hi> had bought them; <note n="d" place="margin">

               <p>The <hi>Poictovins</hi> landing at <hi>Boloign,</hi> had much-a-do to gain passage into their own Countreys, by reason that <hi>Henry de Montfort,</hi> Son to the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> whose power was very great in <hi>France,</hi> had followed them thither.

                  <hi>Richard Gray,</hi> whom the Lords had made Captain of the Castle of <hi>Dover,</hi> intercepted as much as he could of what the <hi>Poictovins</hi> carried over, and enriched himself thereby.

               <p>Notwithstanding which pretended care, the Lords enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the service of the King's Tenants which dwelt near unto them, were as <hi>totidem Tyranni,</hi> furnished the especial Fortresses of the Kingdom with Garrisons of their own, sworn to the common State; and took the like assurance of all Sheriffs, Bailiffs, Coroners, and other publick Ministers, with strict Commissions upon Oath to examine their behaviour.</p>
               <p>And to make the King and his actions the more odious, and their own more popular, it was rumoured, that the King's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities must be repaired out of the Estates of his people; and he must not want, whilst they had it.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the King, to defend himself from such scandals, was constrained to publish his Declaration, <hi>to desire the people to give no credit to such false suggestions; for that he was ready to defend all Rights and Customs due unto them.</hi>

               <p>So that the provisions made at <hi>Oxford</hi> must needs be those, and none other, which the King of <hi>France</hi> and his Parliament and great Council, upon so grand and deliberate a hearing, declared to be null and void, as derogatory to Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and amounting to a total dis-herison of the King therein; and if they were not those provisions, the maintainers of any such opinion are to shew what other provisions made at <hi>Oxford</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> III. were referred unto him, or condemned by him.</p>
               <p>It being not to be understood by any, that will not make their ignorance, self-conceitedness, designs and evil purposes to be the rules of their reason, that the exception of King <hi>John</hi>'s Charter was to be extended to the collateral security, and when they have sweat and laboured at it beyond any the rules of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Learning, will never be able to entice or draw any religious, good, wise or learned men to subscribe to such a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox, <hi>That twenty-five</hi> Conservatorships <hi>should be intended or understood to be only</hi> Twenty-four, <hi>and those subcommitted to</hi> Four; <hi>that the King's putting into his rebellious Barons hands four of the strongest Castles which he had, as pledges and security, with power for all that would to take Oaths, to distrain and take arms, and set the common people upon him: were, or are within the true meaning or construction of that</hi> Magna Charta; <hi>or that it was ever within the meaning, intention, or words of that</hi> Magna Charta, <hi>granted by him unto his Subjects, to be holden of him and his heirs</hi> in capite, <hi>that the word or notion of</hi> Liberties <hi>mentioned therein, should or could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a Law, Rule, or Custom, that those that were the Grantees, and to be governed, should rule their Governours, (which no where appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be consonant to that Reason, Iustice and Order which God Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self praescribed, and gave as a rule for the better ordering of the Sons of men and all their Generation;) or that the granter of those Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties in those Charters, did thereby ever intend, or so express, or understand, that by the grant of those Liberties and Benefits, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of</hi> England <hi>were entituled to a Right or Authority to govern their King; and if he do not therein behave himself according to the Interests or Votes of a giddy multitude, (who are as seldom to be pleased, as they are to be brought into one and the same opinion, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, interest, or design) should be vested with a power or authority to compel him.</hi>

               <p>But it seems, saith Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> that that award of the King of <hi>France</hi> was not full and satisfactory to all parties, (although the King's permission thereupon afterwards made, chargeth the dissatisfaction on the Barons part) whom to content as well as he could, he and the Barons, by mutual consent, did by their
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42937:48"/>
Letters Patents, submit (as he said) that award to <hi>H.</hi> Bishop of <hi>London, H. le Despencer,</hi> Justiciar of <hi>England, Bartholomew</hi> Earl of <hi>Anjou,</hi> Cousin-jerman to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Abbot of <hi>Beck,</hi> to amend or correct, by way of addition or detraction (in or to the said award) whatever they should judge meet for the settling and securing of Peace.</p>
               <p>And the King was so great a lover of Peace, and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wisher of the good of his people, as after he had granted unto them more Liberties than they could claim, and in modesty could ask of a Sovereign that would preserve that Superiority, and those Rights which God had given Him, for His own and the Peoples good, which can never be, without an <hi>Obedience of Subjects,</hi> and a <hi>care of a Prince to protect them,</hi> by doing justice to Himself as well as to Them; and was so willing to give them satisfaction in any thing just or reasonable to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, as he was content to wave and lay aside the advantage which he fairly gained by the aforesaid award or ordinance of the King of <hi>France,</hi> in defence and maintenance of his own just Rights, and therein of his means to govern and protect them, (which no Prince in <hi>Christendom</hi> at that time would have done) and at the same time adventure the censure or ill will of a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Potent Prince, that would not take it kindly to have an award made with so much Justice, Judgment, and care, to be reviewed by a part of his People, and such as were no friends to the Rights of Kings, and had been long in opposition to their King, and encouraged a long and lasting Rebellion against him, and by such a new reference or review, subjecting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the Excommunication and Ecclesiastical Censures of the Pope's Legate, by which He and his Kingdom had already so greatly suffered.</p>
               <p>Yet, in that so great a Storm and Tempest of State would not so much injure Himself, his Dignity, and occasional or necessary emergent affairs of Government, as not to provide that they should not so much as speak, treat, or ordain any thing, <hi>circa emendationem ordinationis, seu pacis praedictae per quod Regnum</hi> Angliae, <hi>per alios quàm indigenas gubernetur, nec castrorum custodia, seu alia balliva Regno praedicto aliis quàm indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genis fidelibus non suspectis committetur,</hi> (which with a clause next following, might also probably be inserted to please the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> and to secure him from after or former ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, <hi>that he was himself an Alien,</hi> or that such allegations might not be any hinderance to him or <hi>William de Valence</hi> to have the custody of any of the King's Castles, who had yet

               <p>For that haughty Earl <hi>Montfort</hi> hated the King, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring all he could his destruction, so thwarted all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and domineer'd over him, as the King told him openly, That he feared him more than any Thunder or Tempest in the world.

               <p>And the King, to get time, summoned a Parliament at <hi>London,</hi> where he won many Lords to his party, and with them <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Cornwal</hi> his Brother, King of <hi>Almaine, Henry</hi> his Son, <hi>William Valence,</hi> with the rest of his Brethren; marches to <hi>Oxford,</hi> whither divers Lords of <hi>Scotland</hi> repair unto him; as, <hi>Iohn Comyn, Iohn Baliol,</hi> Lords of <hi>Galloway, Robert Bruce</hi> and others, with many <hi>English</hi> Barons, <hi>Clifford, Percy, Basset, &amp;c.</hi> from thence with all his Forces went to <hi>Northampton,</hi> took Prisoner young <hi>Symon Montfort,</hi> with fourteen other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal men; thence to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> spoiling the Possessions ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the Barons in those parts.</p>

               <p>Which not being condescended unto, or thought fit to be allowed, <hi>Montfort</hi> with his Partners seeing no other means but to put all to the hazard of a Battel, made himself more ready than was expected, placed on the side of an Hill near <hi>Lewis,</hi> where the Battel was to be fought, certain Ensigns without men, which seemed afar off to be Squadrons ready to second his men, (whom he caused all to wear <hi>White Crosses,</hi> both for their own notice, and signification of the candour and innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his cause, which he desired to have believed to be only for Justice.)

The first Demand in that Parliament which was made by the King  <note n="n" place="margin">
                     <hi>Danoel's</hi> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the life. of King <hi>H.</hi> 3 and <hi>Matthew Paris.</hi> 1002. 1003.</note> and the Legat, was, That the Clergy should grant a Tenth for three Years to come, and for the Years past, so much as they gave the Barons for defending the Coasts against the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion of Strangers:</p>
               <p>Whereto they answred, That the War was begun by unjust Desires, which yet continued, and it was more necessary to treat of the Peace of the Kingdom, to make use of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the benefit thereof, and not to extort Moneys, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the Land had been so much destroy'd by the War, as it would never be recovered.</p>
               <p>When it was required, That the Clergy might be taxed by Laymen according to the just Value:</p>
               <p>They answer, It was neither Reason nor Justice that they should intermeddle in collecting the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, which they would never consent unto, but would have the Antient Taxation to stand.</p>
               <p>It was desired, That they would give the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of their Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronies and Lay-fees according to their utmost values:</p>
               <p>They answered, That they were impoverished in attending the King in his Expeditions, and their Lands lay untilled by reason of the Wars.</p>
               <p>It was moved, That in liev of a 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> they should give among them 30000 Marks to discharge the King's Debts, contracted concerning the Kingdom of <hi>Sicily:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They answered, They would give nothing, in regard that all those Taxations and Extortions formerly made by the King, were never converted to his own Use, or the Benefit of the Kingdom.</p>

Demand being made, That all the Clergy-men which held Baronies or other Lay-fees, should personally serve in the Wars:</p>
               <p>They answer, They were not to sight with the Material Sword, but the Spiritual, and that their Baronies were given of mere Almes.</p>

                  </gap> which the Bishops of <hi>Rochester, Bath, and the Abbot of Westminster</hi> stood bound to the <hi>Pope's Merchants,</hi> for the King's Service at their being at the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They answered, That they never consented to pay such Loan, and therefore were not bound to discharge it.</p>
               <p>Then the Legate from the Pope required, That without delay Praedication should be made throughout the Kingdom, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite men to take the Cross for the Recovery of the <hi>Holy</hi> Land:</p>
               <p>Whereunto Answer was made, That the greatest part of the People were already consumed by the Sword, and that if they should undertake that Action, there would be none left to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Kingdom, and the Legate seemed to desire to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the Nation and introduce Strangers.</p>
               <p>Lastly, when it was urged, That the Praelates were bound to yield to all the Kings Demands by their Oath at <hi>Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> where they did Swear to aid him by all means possible they could:</p>
               <p>They answered, that when they took that Oath, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood no other Aids than Spiritual and wholsome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</p>
               <p>So nothing but Denyals being obteyned in that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Legat imployed some to Sollicite the disherited Lords, that held the Isle of <hi>Ely,</hi> to leave off their Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and return to the Peace of the King, the Faith and Unity of the Church, according to the Form provided by the <hi>Dictum de Kenilworth,</hi> made by a Commission of the King (no Dict or Act of Parliament) to 12 <hi>of the Peers,</hi> for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of their Inheritances, given away by the King for Five say some, other Seven, years Profits.</p>
               <p>They who had no Lands were to give their Oaths, and to find Sureties for their Peaceable Behaviour, and make such Satisfaction and undergo such Penances, as the Church should appoint; they who were Tenants should lose their right to their Farmes, <note n="o" place="margin">Dictum de <hi>Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nilworth</hi> anno. 51.

and have no power of recovering their Estates; in which Composition or <hi>Dictum,</hi> some Persons, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Symon de Montfort</hi> himself and his Heirs, were excluded.</p>
               <p>To which they answered, That they hold the Faith recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from their Catholick Fathers, and their Obedience to the Roman Church, as the Head of all Christianity, but not to the Avarice and wilful Exactions of those who ought to Govern the same. And that their Praedecessors and Ances<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, whose Heirs they were, having Conquered the Land by the Sword, they held themselves to be unjustly <note n="r" place="margin">Mat. Paris. 1003 &amp; 1004.</note> disherited, and that it was against the Popes Mandate they should be so dealt withal:</p>
               <p>That they had formerly taken their Oaths, to defend the Kingdom and Holy Church (all the Prelates thundring the Sentence of Excommunication against such as withstood the same) and according to that Oath they were prepared to spend their Lives; and seeing they Warred for the benefit of the Kingdom and Holy Church, they were to sustain their Lives by the Goods of those that detained their Lands, which the Legat ought to cause to be restored to them.</p>
               <p>Besides, they declared to the Legat, That they had irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently ejected out of the Kingdom the Bishops of <hi>Winches<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, London</hi> and <hi>Chester,</hi> whereby the Councell of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was in great part weakned; willed that they might be restored to their Lands, without Redemption; that the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of <hi>Oxford</hi> might be observed, and that they might have Hostages delivered unto them into the Island, to hold the same peaceably for five years to come, until they might perceive how the King would perform his Promises.</p>
               <p>But this Stubbornness so exasperated the King, as the next year following, with a mighty Army he did so beset the Isle, as he shut them up, and Prince <hi>Edward</hi> with Bridges made on boats entred the same in diverse places, and constrained them to yeild.</p>
               <p>And in the 52d. year of <note n="s" place="margin">Mat.

                  <p>That those new contrived Writs of Summons, made by undue Means upon such a disturbed Occasion, could neither obtain a proper or quiet Sitting in <hi>Parliament,</hi> or the pretended Ends and Purposes of the Framers thereof, and that such an hasty and indigested Constitution could never be intended to erect a third Estate in the Kingdom, equal in power with the KING and his great Councel the House of <hi>Peers,</hi> or consistent with the pretended Conservatorships, or to be co-ordinate with the KING and his great Councel of <hi>Peers,</hi> or to be a curb to any of them, or themselves, or upon any other design, then to procure some Money to wade through that their dangerous Success.</p>

               <p>IN regard that very many of the Counties, and a great part of <hi>England,</hi> as most of the Northern, much of <hi>Wales,</hi> and the Marches thereof under the Influence and Power of <hi>Valence</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke, Mortimer, Clare</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloucester, Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Le Strange,</hi> and other <hi>Welsh</hi> Lords Marchers, and of <hi>John Balioll,</hi> and other of the Northern Barons joyned to the Power and Influence of <hi>Gilbert de Clare</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloucester</hi> after his forsak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Montfort,</hi> neither could or were like to come unto that so packed Parliament; for <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Cornewall</hi> had very many Borough Towns in that County; <hi>Wales</hi> and its thirteen Shires, and the largely priviledged Earldom of <hi>Chester</hi> sent no Knights or Burgesses to sit in the House of Commons in Parliament, either then, or before, or since, until by an Act of Parliament made <note place="margin">26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 26. 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. ca. 13 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 11.</note> in the later end of the Raign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Eighth,</hi> they were Authorised to be Elected for that Purpose; <hi>Warren</hi> Earl of <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey,</hi> and <hi>Sussex</hi> was not in those Counties destitute of many, <hi>Ferrers</hi> Earl of <hi>Darby</hi> falling off from <hi>Montfort</hi> could not but in the large extent of his Estate drew away very many of their well-Wishers, Followers, Friends, Allies, Tenants, or Dependants, and such as held of them by Knights Service, and in Soccage or Burgage, and many Knights, Citizens, and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses to be so elected (except those in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> if any did then appear to have been chosen) as not dareing to come to that kind of New Parliament without a Convoy; Although the Power of the Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi> one of their Associates in the County of <hi>Essex</hi> was then very great, whilst they were almost daily and hourly haunted and tormented in their minds and Estates with Jealousies, Fears and Dangers, and the often sad and dolorous tidings of Devastations, Slaughters, Plunders and Sequestrations; that misused King himself not being able
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42937:70"/>
to have any of his Servants or Subjects that he had, sent for to come unto him, without a Convoy to defend them from Spoil and Pillage.</p>
               <p>And the exactest Search, that hath been or can be made, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find any formal or certain Sitting of a Parliament, any Writs or Indentures returned, any Session, Act or thing done in that so newly framed Parliament, when the minds of the Rebels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were so tormented and distracted with Fears and Cares to preserve themselves and their Royal Booty, as they could neither be safe in keeping of him, or restoring him to his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; for that the abused Lyon, patient for a while against his Will, once let loose might remember past Injuries, and tear them in Peices; and no Act or Memorial can be seen of any more, than the Petition of two of the Knights Elected for the County of <hi>York,</hi> and their Allowance of Wages, where the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Party seemed to be most powerful, (no Burgesses of the many Towns and Boroughs in that large County at all, it seems, then Appearing or Petitioning) by a Tax or Levy made upon that County, which created the first President or Custom of giving Wages unto Knights of the Shires (no other Knights of the Shires or Burgesses of Townes, if there were or had been any Elected, then demanding the like Allowance) and that which was allowed the said <hi>Yorkshire</hi> Knights was, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Expences supposed in their helping to guard the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time parts to keep out Strangers, or the Kings own Subjects in his several Provinces of <hi>France,</hi> from coming from the parts beyond the Seas to assist him, no Journal or Record of any Petitions made, or Grievances exhibited, Conferences, Debates, Decisions, Acts, Orders or Ordinances, and that one that was made was only to engage and cozen as many as they could of the Bishops and Clergy into their own Design.</p>
               <p>And therein none of the Commons, or men of that Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, do seem at all to trouble their Heads, or be named as Actors or Consenters therein; for it is expresly said to be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>Per Commun assentement du Roy &amp; des Prelaz des Contes &amp; des Barons de la tere, &amp; a fermete en tesmoinaunce le Roy &amp; les hauz Hommes de la tere ont mis leur Seus;</hi> neither doth there appear to to have been any Prorogation or Adiournment thereof.</p>
               <p>And there was like to have been no small want of Money, when <hi>Symon de Montfort</hi> and his Partners, especially after the Earl of <hi>Gloucester's</hi> Sullennes and Departure from them, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and keep together so instable a People, and so great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for the guard of their Royal Prisoners and their own evil Doings, marching and maintaining their Army from place to

place, Ungarrisoning and Garrisoning divers of the King's Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and Places of strength, together with the no small Charges of their disloyal Contrivances, Envoys, and Ambassadours to their good Friends, the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Pope.</p>
               <p>Their great Necessities appearing very demonstrable, in their harshly pressing the Bishops for some Arreares of the Clergy, Tenths, Seizing and Sequestration of the Rents and Estates, as much as they could come at, of the Loyal Party to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Use of the King, taking away the Tax and Tallage of the Judaism or Banks of the <hi>Jews</hi> (the then, besides the <hi>Caursini</hi> the Popes Bankers or Brokers, only Usurers of the Kingdom,) which had been assigned to the Prince; not omitting the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into their hands the Tolls and Profits of the Markets and Fairs appertaining to his Mannor of <hi>Stamford,</hi> who untill the very instant of his Escape from the Castle of <hi>Hereford,</hi> where he had long lain a quiet Prisoner under their Persecution, had enjoyed them.</p>
               <p>All, or but some, of which might have given them a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Opportunity, if they had had the mind or least In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to it, to have taken those few Commons that were with them into their Association, and moulded them into a never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>before-used Form or Figure of a Parliament (ever since so mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takenly called,) or Constitution of a third Estate and House of Commons therein, when anciently and long before our Kings great Councels or Parliaments consisted only of such Lords Spiritual and Temporal, as they should please to advise withal, and those Commons which they had with them do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have made any Act of Parliament or Ordinance for the raising of Money to support the charges of their Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</p>
               <p>But that part of the Baronage appeared to have been so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to take them into their Company, or give them any occasion to contemn or lift themselves above their former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as when in the Difficulties with which they wrestled, upon the Prince's denying his Consent ever to have been given to a supposed Ordinance then lately (as they would have as many as they could make believe it) to have been made at <hi>London,</hi> by the Prelates and Barons, by the unanimous Assent of the King and his Son the Prince <hi>&amp; totius Communitatis Regni,</hi> concerning the setling of Peace in the Kingdom, the freeing of the Prince from his Imprisonment, and the Discharge of the ill Opinion which many of the People had of their Actions, they were constrained to send Writs in the King's Name the 12<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>June</hi> in the same year of that imprisoned King, dated at <hi>Hereford,</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:42937:71"/>
unto the Bishops of <hi>London, Winchester, Ely, Salisbury, Chester, Coventry</hi> and <hi>Lichfeild, Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> and the rest of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, who may then be understood to have been absent to come <hi>omni festinatione</hi> to advise with him at <hi>Gloucester,</hi> to assist him with their Councels, and be a Means to take off those Rumours which had been raised, that by the Testimony of the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and the rest of the Prelats, the Truth might appear, that it was not the King himself, but the Rebels (as whilest he was in their Power he was made to stile his Son the Prince and his Loyal Party.) But none of the Commons before summoned, or designed to have been summoned, had any new Writs sent unto them for that purpose to meet at <hi>Gloucester,</hi> which would have been very necessary, if they could have born any Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to that supposed Ordinance, (which is not in any of the Records of that year, or any other year, those <hi>monumenta vetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statis &amp; veritatis,</hi> to be seen;) or if they had had any Vote in that imaginary Parliament, it would not have been said in that King's Writ, dated at <hi>Westminster</hi> the first day of <hi>February</hi> in the year aforesaid, and in the Close Rolls of that year, That although upon some Discords arising amongst the Scholars in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> the King had given leave, that there might be an University established at <hi>Northampton,</hi> yet being infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by all the Bishops of the Kingdom, that it would great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inconvenience the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> he did <hi>de concilio mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum</hi> strictly forbid it.</p>
               <p>But if there had been any Proceedings upon those Writs, for the Election of Members to constitute an House of Commons, for that or any long time expended in the duration thereof, few of whom either came, or were willing or dared to be present at that new-fancied Parliament, which could not be believed to have had any Duration or long Continuance, if it had at all gained a lawful beginning, or could have overcome those many Obstructions, which lay before them, those two Knights of the Shire sent out of <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> who had obtained a Writ for their Wages or Charges in coming, tarrying, or returning, and were possibly gone homeward, or shortly going, would not have made such hast to be gone.</p>
               <p>It being alwayes to be remembred, that although King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the <hi>First</hi> had so subdued <hi>Wales</hi> as to make them obedient unto such Laws as he would have them obey, yet King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Eighth</hi> was the first that removed the Barr and accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med distances and Enmities, that had long continued between the <hi>English</hi> and the <hi>Welsh,</hi> when in the 27<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> year of His Reign he did incorporate his Dominion of <hi>Wales</hi> with his Kingdom

               <argument>
                  <p>That the <hi>Majores Barones,</hi> or better sort of the Tenants in <hi>Capite,</hi> Justly and Legally by some of our Ancient Kings and Princes, but not by any positive Law (that of the enforced Charter from King <hi>John</hi> at <hi>Running Mede,</hi> being not accounted to be such a Law) were distinguished and separated from the <hi>Minores,</hi> or lesser sort of the Tenants in <hi>Capite.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>FOR it could be no design in the Framers or Contrivers of his Charter, to make any distinction betwixt the <hi>Majores,</hi> or <hi>Minores Barones,</hi> of the Kingdom; or to leave to Posterity a definition of either of them; or a Rule for after Ages, for that would have unpolitickly very much disturbed and distracted that rebellious Assembly at <hi>Running Mede,</hi> or could be likely to obtain any more thereby, as to their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our Kings great Councels (the word Parliament being not then in use amongst us) than to have a Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel shortly called to settle the manner of Assessment of Aides upon Knights Fees, and to that only end to Summon the Tenants in <hi>Capite,</hi> which were not all of that sort, being not the <hi>Majores</hi> or <hi>Magnates</hi> then, and yet understood by our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be the Barons long before, and ever since, at the good Will and Pleasure of our Kings, usually Called and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned by them to their Great Councels upon urgent Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions; the <hi>Majores Barones</hi> being to be there present to advise thereupon: Which, for after Assemblies of that nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly to be holden, would have been very Numerous, Trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Cambden</hi> Brit. 122.</note> as he thought, asserted, That King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Third, Post Magnas perturbationes, &amp; enormes vexationes inter ipsum &amp;</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monem de Monte forti, <hi>ex tanta multitudine quae seditiofa &amp; tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulenta fuit Optimates quosque rescripto ad Comitia evocaverit;</hi> yet Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> saith, That in all that he hath met with since the <note place="margin">

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:42937:120"/>
the Persons that were excluded from it, and was perswaded to give little Credit unto the Author cited by Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> but rather to conclude, That not long after that grand Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of King <hi>John</hi> (like enough in that time) some Law was made, that induced the utter Exclusion of all Tenants in Chief from Parliaments; besides the Ancient and Great Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, and Baronies (which <hi>Mathew Paris</hi> saith, King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Third</hi> reckoned to be <hi>Two Hundred</hi> and <hi>Fifty)</hi> and such other as the King should in like sort Summon; and that there <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Selden</hi> tit. ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor 713.</note> were Barons by Writ, as well as Barons by Tenure, cites a Testimony out of <hi>Mathew Paris,</hi> who speaking of King <hi>Henry</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mathew Paris 81. <hi>edict.</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</note> the <hi>Third,</hi> saith, That in the <hi>Twenty Nineth</hi> Year of his Raign, <hi>Rex edicto publicè proposito de submonitione generaliter factâ fecit certificari per totam</hi> Angliam, <hi>ut quilibet</hi> Baro <hi>tenens ex Rege in Capite haberet prompta &amp; parata Regali praecepto omnia servitia Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taria quae ei debentur tam Episcopi &amp;</hi> Abbates <hi>quàm Laici Barones,</hi> Barons holding <hi>in Capite,</hi> as if some held not so, which must be such as were Barons by Writ only.</p>
               <p>The Tenants in Chief being by those Differences distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished in their Titles, Possessions, and Reliefs, were so much less in Honor, than the greater Barons, who had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Writs at every Summons, and all the ancient Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the Title of Baron still remaining to them: It was the less difficult for those greater Barons to Exclude the rest wholly at length from having any Interest in the Parliaments of that Time, under the name of Tenants in Chief on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>And although in somewhat a different, and much inferiour manner to the <hi>Majores Barones,</hi> their Number, Greatness of Provinces and Estates, or near Alliance in Blood unto the Crown, is not much unlike the distinction made in <hi>France</hi> of the <hi>Douze Pairs,</hi> not exclusively to the other Baronage; which our <hi>Mathew Paris,</hi> and their own Authors will E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, were not only before, but are there to this day continued as a Degree of Honor, different from the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rones Minores,</hi> or the <hi>Vulgus</hi> or Common People, much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to that lesser Baronage; yet the Annalls and Records of <hi>France,</hi> are not yet accorded of the precise time of the first Institution of their <hi>twelve Pairs,</hi> lately Augmented to a much greater number.</p>

Parliament, and Proved or disproved by Certificate of the Marshall of the Kings Host, who is enabled thereunto by his Roll kept for that purpose.

               <p>And such kind of Courts for lands holden in <hi>Capite</hi> or by Knights service, should not by the most ordinary and mean Capacities, be understood to be one and the same with the great Court or Councell of Parliament, which many times by the Power and Authority of the King in that his Highest Court, corrects, and rectifies the defaults of the other.</p>
               <p>Our high Courts of Parliament, having the Judges of the Land subordinate to their Prince, whether they have lands holden in <hi>Capite</hi> or no land, summoned by his writs to give their Councell and advice as to matters of Law, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient customs of the Kingdom, wherein the King is attended with his great Ministers or Officers of State, as the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, Treasurer, Privy Seal, great Chamberlain of <hi>England,</hi> Lord Steward, and Chamberlain of his houshold, and Lord Admirall, whether of the degree of Barronage, or holding of him <hi>in Capite,</hi> or not, with other great &amp; solemn formalities becoming the honour and State thereof, with which that most honourable assembly is accompanied, greatly different from those lesser Courts or Councell of summoning and calling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, those that were only proper or obliged to actions of war, or to know how their services were performed, when our Parliaments being summoned to treat and advise of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, concerning peace and the defence of the Church, and <hi>de quibusdam arduis</hi> only, and have sometimes no matters of war consulted thereon.

               <p>And was no more then what every Earl and Baron had in their Courts and Jurisdidictions, when they summoned the Tenants, holding of them by Knights service, to their Courts of honour, or their honorary Possessions which were in our records frequently stiled, as the honors of <hi>Eagle, Eye, Leicester, Hedingham, Penerel, Arundel,</hi> &amp;c. to which purpose they had their Escheators, Feodares, and Stewards to preside, or offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate therein, subordinate unto them, when they called their

               <p>So as to rescue the words of that Learned Author from those wicked and absurd interpretations, which the late Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-Rebells and Monarchy-Underminers would have put upon them, It must either be thought that that worthy book of his, hath in that particular Place and words so catcht at, fallen under the fate of many Eminent Books or Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts even amongst those of the venerable Fathers of the Church, who have not in a long race or course of Time and contingences been able to escape the hands of Corruptors, as the Books or works of the Excellent <hi>Origen</hi> did by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busy designs and rashness of <hi>Russinus,</hi> the many Spurious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscripts of the <hi>Vatican</hi> Library, and of other Popish Authors <note place="margin">Baronius <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls</hi> ad An. 315. 12. 13. 14. 15.</note> so acknowledged to be by <hi>Baronius,</hi> and some other of their own Writers.</p>
               <p>Or rather that the good man intended no more by the word <hi>Magister</hi> then an instructor or an Assistant, as the <hi>Jews</hi> called their Doctors <hi>Rabbies;</hi> or as <hi>Origen</hi> was called, by way of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency, the Master of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches, and <hi>St. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> called <hi>Tertullian</hi> so who was never his Master; and our Famons Lawyer, <hi>Littleton,</hi> gave no less a name to Judge <hi>Newton</hi> his Predecessor.</p>
               <p>And that he used the word <hi>Socii,</hi> but as <hi>Aeneas</hi> is sayd to <note place="margin">Virgills Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neids.</note> have done to his afflicted <hi>Trojans</hi> in their wandrings to seek new habitations, when in his Oration to comfort them, he
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:42937:133"/>
saith, <hi>O Socii neque enim ignari, sumus ante malorum;</hi> or as <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> did when he encouraged his Soldiers with the acceptable title of <hi>Commilitones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or as our laws and reasonable Customs have done in the titles and use of the <hi>Masters</hi> of <hi>Chancery,</hi> Subordinate to the Lord Chancellors or Keepers of the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> who sit and say nothing; or as in the acts of our Courts of Justice are done, where they are recorded and said to have been done by the Chief-Justice <hi>&amp; Socios Suos;</hi> or as in the case of an <hi>associate</hi> unto a Chief Justice, or any of the Kings Justices Sitting by and under the Kings Commissions of <hi>Oyer</hi> &amp; <hi>Terminer,</hi> where an equality, co-ordination, or Superiority so <hi>contra-</hi>distinct and opposite each unto other can never be Claimed or allowed.

And certainly were that <hi>Summus ille vir</hi> great man of Learning now Living, he would Ingeniously Confess that, that even in his own times our great Physitian the Learned Doctor <hi>Harvey</hi> hath Discovered and made it to be Confessed and Believed, without any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of the Learned in the Medicinall Art, that the blood in the body of a man doth Circulate unto the Heart, which <hi>Gallen, Hypocrates, Avicen, Averroes,</hi> or any the <hi>Medici,</hi> Physitians, and Anatomists <hi>Pancirello</hi> and his learned <hi>Commentator Salmuthius</hi> that Travailed so much in the search of the <hi>Occultia &amp; nova reperta</hi> of the World from the Creation thereof, never met withall or were able to Demonstrate as he hath done, and Mr <hi>Selden</hi> must of necessity permit it to be likewise believed that our <hi>English</hi> Annalists, Historians and records will witness, that before the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 1. and that grand Parliament, or congress of him and the aforesaid Christian Kings mentioned by <hi>Fleta,</hi> our <hi>Henry</hi> the 2.

               <p>For who but such disciples or proselites can find the way to imagine or believe that when King <hi>William Rufus</hi> dined at his Marble table where the Court of <hi>King's-hencb</hi> now sitteth in his large <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> and his Nobility and many of his Court attendants sat at their meat at their many lower ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the same hall, could perswade themselves or others to suppose an equality in degrees and Power, or that the King because they did all sit but in one room or House was no more then co-ordinate with them.</p>
               <p>For in the grand feasts of the <hi>Inns</hi> of Courts, Houses, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, or Societies, for the study of our Law, the Judges, Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, Barristers, and utter Barristers are not so ill used as to be in danger of any the like argument, because one Common hall or room contained them all; and the honor of the King or his Privy Councel are not diminished because there are greater or lesser degrees amongst them sitting in one and the same Councell Chamber.

               <p>The Lord Keeper in his reply alleadged that to make more laws might seem Superfluous, and to him that might ask <hi>Quae causa ut crescunt tot magna volumnia legum?</hi> It may be answered in <hi>promptu causa est crescit in orbe malum.</hi>

               <p>Mr <hi>Francis Bacon said for the prerogative royall of the Prince, for his part he ever allowed it, and is such as he hoped should never be discussed, the Queen is our Sovereign, hath both a restraning and enlarging liberty of her Prerogative, that is, hath power by her patents to set at liberty things restrained by Statute Law, by Non obstante's of Penall Laws or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and by her Prerogative to restrain things that are at liberty as by her Letters-Patents for new inventions, license for transportation, &amp;c. But Mr Speaker pointing to the bill said, this is no stranger in this place, but a stranger in this vestment, the use hath been ever by petition to humble our selves to her Majesty, and by petition to desire to have the grievances redressed, especially when the remedy toucheth her in Right or Prerogative; If her Majesty make a patent or a Monopoly to any of her servants, that we must cry out against, but if she grants it to a namber of Burgesses or a Corporation, that must stand, and that forsooth is no Monopoly, I say and I say again
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:42937:220"/>
that we ought not to deal or meddle with or judge of her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Prerogative I wish every man therefore to be carefull of this point.</hi>

               <p>Upon the great debate of Monopolies, as they called them, granted by the Queen, a list being brought into the House, she having notice thereof sent for the Speaker and declared unto him, that <hi>for any patents granted by her, whereby any of her Subjects might be grieved or oppressed, she would take present order for reformation thereof, her Kingly Prerogative was tender, and therefore desired them not to speak or doubt of her carefull reformation, but that some should presently be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, others suspended, and none put in execution, but such as by a Tryall at Law should appear to be for the good of the people, which he reporting to the House to his unspeakable joy</hi> (as he said,) <hi>and comfort,</hi> but thereupon <hi>Secretary Cecill said
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:42937:221"/>
that there was no reason all should be revoked, for the Queen meant not to be swept out of her Prerogative.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And therefore gave them a caution for the future, to believe that what soever is subject to a publick exposition cannot be good, and said that Parliamentary matters were ordinarily talked of in the streets, that the time was never more apt to disorder, or make ill interpretations of good meanings, and thought those persons would be glad that all Sovereignty were turned into Popularity, we being here but the popular bouch, and our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but the liberty of the Subject; if any man in the House speak wisely we do him great wrong to interrupt him, if foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let us hear him out; we shall have the more cause to tax him, and I do heartily pray that no member of this House may plus verbis offendere quam concilio inuare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr <hi>Francis Moore</hi> moved that the Speaker in the name of the House might give thanks to her Majesty for setting at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty her Subjects from the thraldom of those monopolies, <hi>and crave pardon for any extravagancy of words in that House.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr <hi>Wingfield wept</hi> and said his heart was not able to conceive, or his tongue express the joy that he had in that message, but his opinion and Mr <hi>Francis Moore</hi> and Mr <hi>Francis Bacon's</hi> were against the making of the Apology, for that would be to accuse themselves of a fault, when they had committed none, and being put to the vote, it was by the whole House agreed, that the Speaker should return the Queen their humble thanks.</p>
               <p>Mr <hi>Donald</hi> wished that her gracious message might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in their books; others that it might be in <hi>Letters of Gold,</hi> others in their Hearts. <note place="margin">Idem ibidem fal. 258. &amp; 29<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If he hath, he desireth to be censured by you, and if he hath not, it will be a good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to this Honourable House here present, who are Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in this Court; (and yet he might have remembred what long and learned debates and disputes there had lately been amongst themselves, whether the Custom of that House was or had been in cases of grievance to proceed by Bill, or Petition to the Queen, and it was resolved that it was the most proper and dutiful way to proceed by Petition, which was done accordingly) in clearing the Gentleman of that offence when it came before them, which had then no higher esteem in Sir <hi>Edward Hobbyes</hi> opinion, than to be previous to an after disquisition which that Law and the Queens Writ, and the Election of that part of the people that brought them thither, neither did or could give them any greater authority than <hi>ad faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endum &amp; consentiendum</hi> to do and perform that which the King and Lords in Parliament should ordain to be done and performed, and when all should be rightly considered was an offence) too often by more than one or once since practised, to procure a Membership in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly in an House of Commons in Parliament (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Mr. <hi>Belgrave</hi> that should as little have been countenanced as there was any just or legal Warrant for it, wherein Mr. <hi>Comptroller</hi> said, I know the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to be an honest Gentleman, and a great Servant to his Prince and Countrey, I think it very fit to clear
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:42937:223"/>
him, I wish it may be put to the Question, I will be ready to vouch your sentence for his offence when it <note place="margin">P. 330. 321. and 322.</note> comes there, but if any other matter appears upon open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cause, with that we have nothing to do. Mr. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary Cecil</hi> who had not long before said in the same House, <hi>he was sorry to see such disorder, and little do you know how for disorder this Parliament is taxed, I am sorry I said not slandered, I hoped that as this Parliament began gravely and with Judgment, we should have ended modestly, and at least with discretion, I protest I have a Libel in my pocket against the proceedings of this Parliament,</hi> could when he came to speak of Mr. <hi>Belgraves</hi> aforesaid offence say, he had heard it spoken of diversly, but for his own part he was more apt to move against Mr. <hi>Dyet</hi> a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of that House that drew the Information in the Court of <hi>Star-Chamber against</hi> Mr. <hi>Belgrave,</hi> that he should be well punished for seeking to diminish the <hi>Praerogative</hi> of the Court (a power or word never before believed to be proper or applicable to the House of Commons in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament) by praying Aid of the Court of <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> for an offence done to us this Court sitting, (which complexedly with the House of Peers in Parliament hath been, and ought to be stiled a Court, but not separately as to its own constitution or practice;) And desired that Mr. <hi>Belgrave</hi> may be cleared here, which will be a good Inducement not to censure him heavily there, Mr. <hi>Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scroft</hi> said, <hi>we ought not proceed against a Fellow member un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he be called; It is not apparent to us that he made the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, it is under Mr.</hi> Attorneys <hi>hand, and therefore ought to be intended his, for now it is upon Record under his hand, against which we can receive no Averment,</hi> by speech of others, but by the Gentlemans own words, <hi>viva voce.</hi> And so there was no more said of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>But it was put to the question whether he should be cleared of the offence to the House yea or no, and all cryed <hi>I, I, I,</hi> only young Mr. <hi>Francis Grantham,</hi> who gave a great No, <hi>at</hi> which the House laught, and he blusht.</p>
               <p>Some of the Members of the House of Commons observed and found fault, that when the Members were Voting, the contradicting party went out of the House leaving the affirming party in the House, they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:42937:224"/>
did it more to continue and abide in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, than for any affection they had to the Vote of the other, <hi>and there might be also a great mistake in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the whole number of the Members, when some ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came at all, or tarried but a little, while many others were strugling in or out about their own Domestick or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Affairs.</hi> Upon Friday <hi>December</hi> the 18th. <hi>Anno. Dom.</hi> 1601. as the Speaker was going to the House in the morning, the Queens General Pardon was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him, which he took and delivered into the House, which they sent back again, because it was not brought according to course (an haughtiness not usual or comely for those that were to receive such vast bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits by it.) The Collection for the Clerk of the Houses Servant supplying his Masters place at 12 <hi>d.</hi> each Member, amounted unto 25 <hi>l.</hi> which was after the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 500 Members.</p>
               <p>Afterwards Mr. Attorney General assisted by Dr. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> on the right hand, and Dr. <hi>Stanhop</hi> on the left, brought to the House her Majesties free and general Pardon, and delivered also to the House their Subsidy-Bill, for the grant of four entire Subsidies, Eight Fifteenths and Tenths, the Subsidy of the Clergy, was sent in a Roll ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the usual Acts, whereunto Sir <hi>Edward Hobby</hi> took exceptions because it was not sent in a long Skin of Parchment under the Queens Hand and Seal, so it was sent back again, and then the other was sent.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> upon the Speakers Speech at the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Parliament said, <hi>That Laws were to have the Queens Royal Assent, as God should direct her Sacred Spirit,</hi> that she saith touching their <hi>proceeding in the matter of her Praerogative, that she is persuaded that Subjects did never more dutifully, and that she understood they did</hi> obiter <hi>touch her Praerogative, and not otherwise, but by humble Petitions, and therefore that thanks that a Princess may give to her Subjects she willingly yieldeth;</hi> but now she well perceiveth that private respects are privately mask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under publick pretences; as for the grant of the Subsidies, and the manner of giving the Subsidies, <hi>it was not persuasive or by persuasive Inducements, it was speedy, freely, and of Duty, with great</hi> Contentment, that no Prince was ever more unwilling to exact <hi>or receive any thing from the Subject, then she our most Gracious Soveraign, for
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:42937:224"/>
we all know she never was a greedy Grasper, nor strait-hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed keeper, and therefore she commanded him to say, that you had done plentifully, dutifully and thankfully;</hi> And ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded also an admonition to the <hi>Justices</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> (many of which probably were Members there present) <hi>that they would not deserve the Epethites of prowling Justices, Justices of quarrels, who counted Champerty good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Justices who did suck and consume the Wealth and good of the Commonwealth,</hi> and also to those <hi>who do lye if not all the year, yet at least three quarters of the year at</hi> London, and after some Bills or Acts of Parliament signed with <hi>la Royne se voult,</hi> or <hi>come il est desire,</hi> and some others with <hi>la Royne savisera</hi> dissolved that Parliament in <hi>Anno</hi> 1601.</p>
               <p>Which may be justly accompanied with the Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Annotations of that eminent and learned Lawyer Mr. <hi>William Noy</hi> Attorney General of that pious Prince and Martyr King <hi>Charles</hi> the first, who was by death <note place="margin">M. S. of Mr. <hi>William Noy,</hi> the learned Attorney Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of King <hi>Charles</hi> the first.</note> arrested and called out of this World before his Royal Masters Persecution, and ever to be detested Murder, and in all probability if he had then been living, would have done more towards the rescue of his Royal Person and Government, than all these silent Lawyers that crouched under the burdens of the Rebellious miscalled Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and their Man of sin <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards cheated them of their Prey.</p>
               <p>In former times, especially since the admittance of Commons elected to Sit in our great Councils in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, all the Acts of Parliament were framed and drawn up upon the Petitions of the Parliament, and the Kings Answers thereunto by the Judges, and the Kings learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Council at Law compendiously, and very often after the ending of the Parliament, or some good part of time afterwards, and if any thing were oversliped by the Commons, a clause was added to help the same.</p>
               <p>But on the other side, after the Petitions and Answers were read, and the Royal Assent given, Additions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the meaning of the Commons have been added, and sometimes somewhat omitted.</p>
               <p>All Bills commonly called Petitions, were most usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exhibited by the Commons, it being their part <hi>pete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re leges,</hi> as best knowing what was amiss.</p>
               <p>At the making of the Statute of <hi>Merton</hi> in <hi>Anno 20. H.</hi> 3.
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:42937:225"/>
concerning Trespasses in Parks and Ponds, the answer <note place="margin">Ro. Parl. 20 H. 3. n. 11.</note> was, it is not yet discussed, for the Lords demanded the imprisonment of the offenders therein, and the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed it, wherefore it was deferred.</p>
               <p>Some Petitions were formerly indorsed <hi>coram Rege,</hi> against which the Commons petitioned in 6 <hi>E. 3. n.</hi> 31. for that nothing was done upon their Petitions, and therefore prayed that theirs might be answered before the Parliament ended. Some Bills have been exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their names, which they agreed not unto, as in <hi>Anno 21. E.</hi> 4. 3. concerning exceptions of Villenage, where the Commons in their Petition afterwards al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it to be expresly against the Laws and Customs of the Land, and therefore prayed the King and his good Council, to prevent the mischiefs, which might happen by that Petition, and maintain the good Laws and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms of the Land in his time, and the times of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, by the sages of the Law used, and without having regard to the Petitions of any singular Persons to the overthrow and open undoing of the Law of the Land.</p>
               <p>The Commons prayed that the Petitions, which were delivered by them in the last Parliament, and by our <note place="margin">Ro. Parl. 22 E. 3. n. 30.</note> Lord the King, Prelates and Grandees of the Land an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered and granted, be held, and the answers before granted, not changed by any Bill delivered in this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in the name of the Commons, or of any other, for the Commons do not avow any such Bill.</p>
               <p>Unto which was answered another time, the King by the advice of the Prelates and Grandees caused to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the Petitions of the Commons touching the <note place="margin">Ro. Parl. 25. E. 3. n. 39.</note> Laws of the Land, that the Laws had and used in times past, nor the process used hereafter, cannot be changed without making thereon a new Statute, the which thing to do <hi>the King would not then, nor yet can intend for divers reasons, but as soon as he can intend it, he will take the Grandees and Sages of his Council about him, and Ordain upon such Articles and others touching the amendment of the Law by their Advice and Council, so as reason and equity shall be done to all his Leiges and Subjects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 25. E. 3. Item priontles Commons,</hi> that for no Bill, especially of singular Persons, no Statute heretofore or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained be changed, nor other process made upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the Statutes, which hath not been used in times past.</p>

About which time, or not long before, the Commons did use to present their Bills (or Petitions) to the Re ceivers of Petitions appointed by the King by one select Messenger (no constant Speaker it seems being then made use of, or Mace or Ensigns of Honour carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, by one of the Kings Serjeants at Arms, granted or allowed by the King, of which honourable circumstances Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> acknowledgeth he could find no original) accompanied with divers other of the House, which probably, saith Mr. <hi>Noy,</hi> might produce such or the like inconveniencies.</p>
               <p>A Subsidy was granted upon condition that their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions <note place="margin">Ro.

Petitions of the Commons were not alwaies delivered in Parliament to the Receivers of Petitions, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times delivered publickly to the Lords themselves, sitting in their upper House, unless sometimes when the Lords had finished the charge given them by the King, and had no occasion to sit dailiy in their House, then they were delivered to the Clerk of the Parliament.</p>
               <p>Petitions also were sometimes in Parliament directed to be delivered to the Lord Chancellor, who might of himself give them such Remedies, as the ordinary course of the Chancery would.</p>

               <p>And the reason is, because an Ordinance is of a lower nature than a Statute, and cannot repeal a Statute, which is of an higher, and that Ordinances of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are seldom published by Proclamation, as the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes were, whereby the Subjects might know how to direct their actions.</p>

E. 3. n 6. 23.</note> the Commons should be granted, upon which requests and conditions by <hi>Commandment of our Lord the King</hi> by the assent of the Praelates, Earls, Barons and Commons, a Committee of Praelates, Earls, Barons, the Treasurer, some of the Judges, and ten Knights of the Shires, six Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens and Burgesses, whom the Commons should chuse to sit from day to day, as also concerning the Petitions of the Clergy, and put the same into a Statute.</p>
               <p>The which Archbishops, Bishops and others, having heard and tried the said requests by Common assent and accord, caused the Points and Articles to be put into a Statute, the which our Lord the King by the assent of all in the said Parliament <hi>commanded to be ingrossed, sealed, and firmly to be kept throughout the whole Realm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Divers things are entred in the Parliament Rolls which had not the consent of the Commons, for that they might have been concluded by the King and the Lords without them, yet none such could have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, but those which were determined in the open house, and not privately at a Committee.</p>
               <p>The Answers to the Commons were appointed to be read <hi>Sedente Curia,</hi> and a Committee appointed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <note place="margin">Ro. Parl. 45. E. 3. n. 8. 13. 42.</note> the Answers to the rest after <hi>Easter,</hi> and so the Clerk having only read those that were answered, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ended, saith the Record, in <hi>Lent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Shortly after upon the examination of the Subsidy, that it would not answer the expectation, he hastily summoned a <hi>Magnum concilium</hi> in Octabis Trin. following.</p>
               <p>Where after a further grant of a Subsidy, the Petitions which were not answered the last Parliament being read before the King, Grands and Commons, the King gave them leave to depart, and so ended the Councel. One of the last Parliament against Impositions upon Woolls without assent of Parliament is made into a Statute.</p>
               <p>And happily it was answered at the Councel and not at the Parliament.</p>
               <p>And if that very age interpreted it to be legally done, we must do so also saith, that learned Commentator.</p>

E. 3. n. 1.</note> their Petitions, and desired Answers, it was told them that it pleased the King, if any of them would stay to attend and have Answers of their Petitions, that the rest might depart, and it was not unusual in those times for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to have leave to depart, and yet the Lords to stay and dispatch business afterwards, and the same reputed to be done in Parliament <hi>prout Anno 6.

               <p>Whereunto it was answered (probably by the Lords) let <hi>the King be advised and do further by advice of his Councel that which he shall will to be done.</hi>

               <p>Whereunto the King answered, as touching the first point, let the Statute be kept, as touching the 2d <hi>the Councel will</hi> advise the King that it be not done, for they be advised that it is against the Statute.</p>
               <p>And note, saith that learned Observator, that the King was then beyond the Seas, and the Lords would not give a direct answer in his absence to what concerned his power to grant an Office in fee.</p>
               <p>The Commons shew that the <hi>Scots</hi> entred <hi>England</hi> in the Kings absence, and pray that the Prisoners taken in <note place="margin">Ro. Parl. 21. E. 3. n. 9.</note> the Battel at <hi>Durham</hi> may be so ordered, as the damage and danger happen not again.</p>
               <p>To which was answered, the King will advise therein with his Grands, and by their advice ordain that which shall be for the best, and so do, as the Commons shall be out of doubt of that which they suppose <hi>by the help of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which being a matter of State, the Lords would not conclude without the King, but leave it to himself and his Privy Councel.</p>

               <p>Unto which was answered, The King will advise with his good Councel, that nothing shall be done in this case unless it be for the honour of himself and the Realm.</p>
               <p>

               <p>The Commons do shew, that whereas the men of the Navy have assented to all Taxes currant in the Land, yet their Ships are taken, and many lost in the Kings Service without any recompence given unto them.</p>

               <p>And it was the observation of Mr. <hi>Noy</hi> that faithful and learned Attorney of his late Majesty, that in the Raign of King <hi>E.</hi> 3. in whose time the Answers of <hi>le Roys' avisera</hi> first began by reason of his being continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in War beyond the Seas, the King or his Councel had no leisure, or at least no will to answer, &amp; so in time <hi>s' avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sera</hi> became as bad as a denyal, and no other Answers given to such Petitions shewed, that the King was not pleased to grant them.</p>
               <p>The Commons alledging, that notwithstanding the Statute made concerning Lands seized into the Kings hands by his Escheators, the Lands after Enquest taken, and before it can be returned into Chancery are granted to Patentees, and before the Tenant can be admitted to traverse, the Lands are many times wasted, do pray, that none be outed by reason of such Enquests until they be returned into the Chancery, and the Occupiers warned by <hi>Scire facias</hi> to answer at a day to come, when if they do not appear and traverse, and find Sureties to <hi>answer the profits, and commit no wast,</hi> if it be found for the King, and that if any Patent be granted, or any thing done to the contrary, the <hi>Chancellor</hi> do presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal the same, and restore the Complaint to his possession without warning the Patentee or other occupier as well for the time past as the time to come.</p>
               <p>The Answer unto which was, <hi>The King willeth and
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:42937:232"/>
Commands</hi> upon great pain that the Escheators hereafter do duly return all their Enquests in the Term and upon the pain heretofore ordained by the Statutes.</p>
               <p>And further it is accorded by the Lords of the Realm if it <hi>please the King,</hi> that before such Enquests be return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Chancery, the King shall not hereafter make any Patent of such Lands in debate unto any, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that the <hi>King of his abundant</hi> grace will abstain one month after such return, within which time the party may traverse the Office, and that the King will not make any Patent of such Lands unto any Stranger, and if after any be made, it shall be void.</p>
               <p>But touching that which is demanded of Patentees made hereafter <hi>le Roys' avisera.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It being observed by that worthy <hi>Observator,</hi> that as he conceived the first part was answered by the Kings Councel, and by them reported to the Lords, who added the rest of the Answer, <hi>if it please the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And yet the said Answer is vacated upon the Roll, being Crossed all over with a Pen, and the reason thereof given in the margent with a contrary hand to that of the Roll, which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that it was done after the Parliament was ended, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the said Roll was ingrossed,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quia dominus noster Rex noluit istam responsionem affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare, sed verius illam negavit pro magna parte dicens, soit usez come devant en temps de ses nobles progenitors Roys d Angle terre out ad estre use, Et ideo cancellatur &amp; damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And there can be no question but this answer (in the affirmative) was allowed (at the least not denyed) at the time of the Royal assent, and that afterwards when the Statute was to be drawn up, the King taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the words <hi>(si plest au Roy)</hi> did deny it, and so the Roll was vacated.</p>
               <p>And the Councel (which ought to be intended the Kings <hi>Privy Councel,</hi> for the Lords were the Kings great Councel, and they or any Committee of them assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Judges whilst the Parliament was in being were at the dissolution or proroguing thereof all gone out of their former power or employ, and nothing ought to debar a King from advising with his Privy Councel by whose Advice, as the Writs of Summons do import his
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:42937:232"/>
greater Councel was called to assist them as well as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the time of Parliament, or after it was ended, and whether the one or the other had just cause to advise the King not to grant that Petition for it, omitted the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sureties to commit no Wast, and to answer the Issues to the King, which the Commons offered in their Petition, and the Lords, if <hi>the King so pleased,</hi> that no Patent be made to any stranger of the Lands in debate, which the Commons never desired.</p>
               <p>But the Councel were the willinger to let it pass, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was in the Kings Power to deny it afterwards, as he did, whereas, had it been the practice of those times, the Councel would rather have kept back the Answer, and not suffered it to have been read at the time of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Royal Assent,</p>
               <p>In the fame Parliament (after the said Petition was granted, and the Assent cancelled as aforesaid) the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons delivered openly in Parliament a great Roll or Schedule, and another Bill annexed to the said Roll con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining about 41 Articles, one of which remains <hi>Cancelled</hi> and <hi>Blotted</hi> out.</p>
               <p>And in a Petition do pray the King their Leige Lord and the <hi>continual Councellors</hi> about him (which can be no otherwise understood than of his constant privy Councel) that of all the said Articles comprised in the said Roll and Schedule or Bill, which are in the file of other Bills in this Parliament, good Execution and true Justice be done for the profit of the King our Lord and his whole Realm of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon after it was said by the Chancellor of <hi>England</hi> on the Kings behalf to the Knights of the Shires, Citizens and Burgesses there present, that they sue forth their Writs (for their Wages) the Praelates and Lords arose and took their leaves of the King their Lord, and so departed that present Parliament.</p>
               <p>And after the Parliament ended, the Commons delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto the Lords two great Bills, for the Commonalty of <hi>great Yarmouth,</hi> the which Bills with the Indorsements thereupon made by the Lords, were also on the <hi>Filace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Divers Bills are there mentioned to be delivered, and some mentioned to have been answered (as happily all were) (saith that diligent <hi>Observator)</hi> by the Lords of his Majesties Councel after the Parliament ended.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="524" facs="tcp:42937:233"/>
And therefore no marvel if all the Answers were not read on the last day of the Parliament, when some of them were not made until after the Parliament ended; and there is a Petition directed to the thrice redoubted <note place="margin">Ro. Parl. 51. E. 3. n 22, 23.</note>

               <p>For <hi>Magna Charta</hi> to be confirmed unto them, and for a general pardon setting down the Articles thereof, whereof many were granted and many <hi>qualified as the King and his Councel pleased to answer the same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it was not the use and practise of those times to keep back any Answer that was justly displeasing to the King and his Councel, much less any other.</p>

               <p>In the same year a Petition of the Commons concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Attorneys was granted by the King, and both the <note place="margin">Ro. Parl. 11.

               <p>
                  <hi>Yet notwithstanding the Kings Councel so misliked them, that when the Clerk attended with the Roll of that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the drawing up of that Statute</hi> (as the manner was) <hi>those two Petitions and Answers were not thought good to be inserted in the Statute, and therefore they did write in the Margent of the said Roll against the same, these words, Respectuatur per Dominum Principem &amp; Concilium,</hi> which is written with another hand, <hi>[&amp; si non antea] le Roy le veult,</hi> answered to a Petition of the Commons without a Statute made there, is only an Ordinance.</p>

               </p>
               <p>When an Ordinance had its first motion and being in the House of Lords in Parliament, and agreed on, and was drawn in the form of an Act of Parliament, it was afterwards to receive the Assent of the Commons in Parliament.</p>
               <p>In divers Parliaments when the Commons Petitioned for a <hi>Novel Ley,</hi> which the Lords were willing enough to yield unto, and the King to grant, yet for that the King
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:42937:234"/>
intended not to make any Statute that Parliament, those Petitions have been deferred to another time, and divers others which did not demand a new Law, were granted and reputed for good Ordinances or Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>As when in 21 <hi>E.</hi> 3. The Commons prayed that in <note place="margin">Ro. Parl. 21. E. 3. n. 13.</note> Writs of Debt or Trespass, if the Plaintiff recover dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges against the Defendant, that he have Execution of the Lands which the Defendant had the day in which the Writ was purchased.</p>
               <p>Unto which the King answered, <hi>This cannot be done without a Statute, whereupon the King will advise with his good Councel,</hi> and further do that which shall seem best for his people.</p>
               <p>In the same year the Commons do shew, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before these times it hath been used, that if Lands <note place="margin">Ro. Parl. 21. E. 3. n. 47.</note> had been given to a man and his Wife, and the Heirs of their Bodies issuing, and the one dies, no Issue having been had betwixt them, the other may commit Wast without being impeached thereof, that it may <hi>please our Lord the King to ordain thereof Remedy, and that in such case a Writ of Wast be ordained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which the King answered, <hi>Demurge entre les autres Articles dont novel ley est demandez.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eodem Anno,</hi> Shew the Commons, that whereas a Writ of Possession doth not lye of Tenements deviseable, though they be not devised to the great damage of all the Commons, that it would please our Lord the <hi>King and his good Councel,</hi> to ordain by Statute that Writs of Possession my lye and hold place as well of Tenements deviseable in case where they are not devised, as of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and that there be saved to the Tenants their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers in case that they be devised.</p>
               <p>Whereunto <hi>the King answered,</hi> Let it remain amongst the other Articles, whereof a New Law is demanded.</p>
               <p>In the 22d year of the Raign of the same King they <note place="margin">Ro. Parl. 22. E. 3. n. 20. and 21.</note> do pray, that for that many are disinherited by <hi>non Claim,</hi> although they have good Right, and namely, those who are not learned in the Law, that <hi>non Claim</hi> be gone and utterly taken away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To which the King answered, This would be to make a New Law, which thing cannot be done for the shortness of time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eodem Anno,</hi> Pray the Commons, that where a man
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:42937:234"/>
is attainted at the Suit of the Party for Trespass done against the Peer, and the Trespasser taken and let by the Marshal and his Marshals to Mainprise, or at large they be charged with the Damages.</p>
               <p>To which the King answered, To put an Issue to this Article in manner as they pray, it would be to make a new Law, the which the King is not advised yet to do.</p>
               <p>The Commons do pray, That the Issues and Amercia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Green Wax, be certainly expressed in the <note place="margin">Ro Parl. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The Roll of the Parliament of 34 <hi>E.</hi> 3. is lost.</p>
               <p>In the 17th year of the said Kings Raign, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons do pray, the King to desire the Parliament to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how he might gain the Arrears of the first year, and be put in a way for to gain the second year of the said Aid with less grievance to the People.</p>
               <p>But the Lords and Commons were so exasperated by the Excommunication threatened by the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> against them all, because the King would not admit him into the Parliament, and that they requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Declaration to be first made and agreed upon, that the Peers of the Land, whether Officers or not, be not bound to answer the Kings Suit but in Parliament, and it was a whole week before the King would agree un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
               <p>All which time the Archbishop demanded entrance, standing upon his right as <hi>primus Par Angliae,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be admitted upon pain of Excommunication. At the last the said Declaration being first agreed upon by a special Committee of the Lords, the King granted it, and presently upon the same day the Archbishop was admitted, who demanded Tryal by his Peers.</p>
               <p>But as touching the Aid for the King, the Lords and Commons <hi>incensed by the Clergy,</hi> flatly answered, that if the conditions of the grant in <hi>Anno</hi> 14. were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, they would pay none.</p>
               <p>After which the Laity and the Clergy exhibited their Petitions (as the manner then was) severally but peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the one for the other, as they never did since
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:42937:235"/>
or before, except in <hi>Anno 25. E.</hi> 1. when the Popish Clergy had put that great and Victorious King also to the like plunge, and their Petitions being answered by the Kings Councel (who were the standing Committee for that purpose) but the Lords and Commons disliked thereof, and obtained a Special Committee of themselves to consider of the same, which being reported and well liked, a Statute was made thereupon by a Committee of the Grands and Commons, which being read before the King, and Sealed with his great Seal, and delivered to the Grands and Commons, divers of the Kings Councel, as the Treasurer, some of the Justices of both Benches, the Steward of his House and the Chamberlain were sworn upon the Cross of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to observe the same as much as to them belonged, but yet the said Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, Treasurer, and Justices made their <hi>Protestation,</hi> that they assented not to the making of the said Statute, nor to the form thereof, neither could they keep the same if they were contrary to the Laws and Usages of the Realm, which they were sworn to observe, which disorderly Parliament ending in <hi>May,</hi> and the King intending not to suffer the said Statute to be put in Execution, sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned his great Councel to meet at <hi>London</hi> in <hi>July</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, to Repeal the same, but there were so many of the Praelates called thereunto, although the Archbishop was omitted, that he could not effect his desire therein, wherefore he summoned another great Councel to meet at <hi>Westminster</hi> about <hi>Michaelmas</hi> following, whereby the Assent of the Earls, Barons, and other wise men, (not warning any Praelates) the said Statute was repealed.</p>
               <p>In which Statute so Repealed, there will appear to have been many inconveniences both to the King and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if it had continued in force.</p>
               <p>The 2d Chapter whereof touching Tryal by Peers swerved very much from the true meaning of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> cap. 26. <hi>Nullus liber homo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For that appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Tryal to be by his Peers, but restrains it not unto any place, whereas this limits the Tryals of the Peers of the Land to be in Parliament only, which would be very inconvenient to the King to wait for a Parliament for every Offence, and very troublesom to the Commons to be so often troubled thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and no way beneficial for the Temporal Lords, for they, whether in Parliament, or out of Parliament, were ever to be tried per Nobiles Pares.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="529" facs="tcp:42937:235"/>
The 4th Chapter had Clauses, that the King should place New Officers when they fall but by accord of the <hi>Grands, which shall be nearest in the Country, which is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the dignity of the King, to be thus limited in the choice of his Officers, and prove as inconvenient to the Subject, if those Grands should not be men of Merit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the King shall take all Offices except the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into his hands the 3d day of every Parliament, and the Officers be put to answer every complaint, and if they be attainted, shall be judged by the Peers in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and the King shall cause Execution to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced and be done accordingly without dclay, which <hi>is altogether unjust and against all Right and Reason and against the Law, to put any man out of his place before Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Conviction, and against the Right and Dignity of the Crown to bind the King to Execute the judgment of the Peers;</hi> And it is <hi>observable, that it was not in the Petition, but was added afterwards by the Committee, who drew up the Answer to the same, and so was the 4th Clause penned by the said Committee much more beneficial for the Subjects than was in the Petitions or Answers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which particulars <hi>well considered, no man can blame the King for his dissimulation at that time, and his Repeal of that Statute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Parliament of 18 <hi>E.</hi> 3. where the King having summoned a former Parliament in the year before, and therein pacified the Lords and Commons so well as they all agreed, that the said Statute made in the 15th year of his Raign, should be Repealed and taken away, and loose the name of a Statute, for as much <hi>as it is prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and contrary to the Laws and Usages of the Realm, and to the Rights and Praerogatives of the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for that some Articles were comprised in the said Statute which were reasonable, and according to the Law and Reason; It was accorded by <hi>our Lord the King and his Commons,</hi> that of such Articles and others accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this present Parliament, a new Statute be made by the advice of the Justices and other Sages, and held for ever.</p>
               <p>And no Statute being made, the Commons prayed the King to have the Answers to their Petitions in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in manner of a <hi>Patent under the great Seal of England</hi> for every County, City and good Town, one Patent <hi>for
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:42937:236"/>
the comfort of the People, which</hi> the King granted by the advice of the Praelates and Grands, <hi>most of which were the Judges, Officers of State, and Privy Councellors of the King, which Patent was sealed and entred in the Patent Roll, under which was written, la Charter ensealer pour les Communs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After which the King summoned three Parliaments in 20, 21, <hi>and</hi> 22. But no Statute was made in either of them. The next Statute was made in <hi>Anno 25 E.</hi> 3. in which year the King had two Parliaments and Statutes made, but mention nothing by whom they were made, only the Commons do pray, that the Petitions reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably prayed by the Commons be granted, confirmed and sealed before the departure of the Parliament.</p>
               <p>And in the same Parliament <hi>n.</hi> 43. The Commons praying, that the Statute made the last Parliament touching Reservations, be published and put in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Unto which the King answered, <hi>Let the Statute be viewed and recited before the Councel, and if need be in any point, let it be better declared and amended, as the Statute of the King and the Realm be kept.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which it appeareth, that the <hi>Councel</hi> penned the Statutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 27. E.</hi> 3. The King summoned a great Councel, whither many Commons were sent, and it was agreed, that the Ordinances of the said <hi>Councel</hi> should be recited in the next Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 28. E. 3. n.</hi> 16. The Commons prayed, that the Ordinances of the Staple, and all the other Ordinances made at the last great Councel, which they have seen with great deliberation, be affirmed in this Parliament, and held for a Statute to endure for ever.</p>
               <p>Unto which the King and Lords agreed with one mind, so <hi>always, that if any thing be to be put out, let it be done in Parliament when need shall be, and not in any other manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And accordingly there is an <hi>Addition</hi> at the end of the first Chapter against Provisors, as in the <hi>Statute</hi> Roll and Print, but not in <hi>rot. Concilii Anno</hi> 27. nor yet in the <hi>Parliament</hi> Roll <hi>de Anno 28. E. 3. That whole Addition seeming to be added by the Councel alone, and yet shewed to the Parliament for their consent before the said Statute was published.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="531" facs="tcp:42937:236"/>
And it is observable by that of 27 <hi>E. 3. n.</hi> 43. and this of 28 <hi>E. 3. n. 16. That the Statutes were most usually made long after the Parliament ended,</hi> although in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of 14, 15. <hi>and 18 E.</hi> 3. they were engrossed and sealed in the time of Parliament <hi>sedente curia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Statutes were made when some of our Kings were beyond Sea, which happened often in the Raigns of. <hi>E. 3. and H.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 25. E.</hi> 1. a Parliament was held at <hi>London</hi> when the King was in <hi>Flanders</hi> by his Son <hi>Edward,</hi> and the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute made therein was put into the form of a <hi>Charter or Patent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 13. E.</hi> 3. were two Parliaments whilst the King was beyond the Seas, <hi>but no Petitions or Statutes in either.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 14. E.</hi> 3. a Parliament was holden in the Kings absence beyond the Seas by his Son <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>Cornwal</hi> Guardian of <hi>England,</hi> but no Petition of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons nor Statute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 23. E.</hi> 3. a Parliament was held in the Kings ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence by <hi>Lyonell</hi> the Kings Son, Guardian of <hi>England,</hi> and divers Petitions of the Commons were then answered, but no Statute made thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 51. E.</hi> 3. the King could not be present at the beginning of the Parliament, but granted a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to <hi>Richard</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> to begin the same, <hi>Et ad faciendum ea quae pro nobis et per nos facien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da fuerint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet the Lords went to the King (lying sick at <hi>Sheene)</hi> the day before the Parliament ended, where he gave his Royal Assent unto the Answers made unto the Petitions, and commanded them to be read the next day in full Parliament, but yet no Statute was made thereon, notwithstanding the Commission, for the Commission was but for matters to be done in Parliament as the words <hi>Ibidem facienda fuerint</hi> do import.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 8. H</hi> 5. a Parliament was held in <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Humfrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> the King being then beyond the Seas, wherein the Commons petitioned <hi>n.</hi> 16. That whereas it had been told them by divers Lords in this Parliament that the Petitions to be delivered to the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> Guardian of <hi>England,</hi> shall not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grossed before they be first sent beyond the Seas to
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:42937:237"/>
our Soveraign Lord the King to have therein his Royal Assent and Advice, wherefore <hi>may it please the said Lord Duke</hi> to ordain by authority of this present arliament, That all the Petitions delivered by the Commons to the said Duke in the Parliament be answered and determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within this Realm of <hi>England</hi> during the said Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and if any Petition remain not answered and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined during the said Parliament, that they be held for void and of none effect, and that this Ordinance be of force and hold place in every Parliament to be held in the Realm in time to come.</p>
               <p>To which was answered, <hi>Soit avise per le Roy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Howsoever it may be conceived, that all the Petitions with the Answers were sent to the King for his Advice and Assent which of them should be in the Statute, and which not, for in that Statute consisting of three Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which was made that year, there are only two of the answers to their Petitions determined that is made into the said Statute, <hi>viz. pet. n.</hi> 4. in the 2d <hi>cap. and pet. n.</hi> 7. in the 3 <hi>cap.</hi> The Commons did not Petition for <hi>any thing contained</hi> in the 5th <hi>cap.</hi> neither is there any thing recorded thereof in that Parliament Roll; &amp; although one other of the Commons Petitions <hi>n.</hi> 15. for Women Aliens the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of <hi>Englishmen</hi> to have Dower was granted absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the Petition <hi>n.</hi> 8. against Retail of sweet Wines altogether, and the Petition <hi>n.</hi> 9. That <hi>Gascoign</hi> Wine should not be sold for above 6 <hi>d.</hi> the Gallon were granted with be it as <hi>is desired if it please the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet neitheir of these Petitions are in the Statute.</p>
               <p>The usual time for making the Statutes, was after the the end of every Parliament, yea after the Parliament Roll was engrossed,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 3. R.</hi> 2. The Temporal Lords met in the great Councel after the Parliament was ended, where the Clerk read unto them the Enrolment of the Ordinance in that Parliament touching the power of the Justices of the Peace.</p>
               <p>At which time it is probable the Statute was made, and that Ordinance quite altered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 11 H. 4. n. 28. and</hi> 63. The Petitions and their Answers agreed on in Parliament, are entred in the Roll with the rest, which past into the Statute of that year, and in the margent was written with another hand, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectuatur
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:42937:237"/>
per dominum Principem &amp; concilium,</hi> and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of those are in the Statute, by which it is very plain, that the Kings Councel met after the Parliament was ended to consider of the Petitions which were answered, and which of them were fit to be put into the Statute, and which not, and when the Clerk attended with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Roll, the Councel thought fit to respite those, and to deny them they could not.</p>
               <p>And it is evident by the many additions in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and alterations thereof, from the Answers agreed on in Parliament, that the Statutes were made after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>And many Chapters in several Statutes are not at all entred in the Parliament Rolls, as 27. <hi>E. 3. cap. 5, 6, 7, 8. Eodem Anno cap.</hi> 7. &amp; 19. 2. <hi>R. 2. apud Westm. cap. 3. Eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem Anno cap. 15 9.

H. 6. cap.</hi> 3. The use being for the Clerk to bring the Bills themselves as well as the Roll before the <hi>Kings Councel,</hi> who penned the Statute out of the original.</p>
               <p>The Statutes were antiently drawn into a form of Law, and certain Articles out of the Petitions and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 25. E. 3. n.</hi> 23.

               </p>
               <p>Unto which was answered, <hi>le Roy ottroie a cest Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet the Statute hereupon made omitteth the words, <hi>viz. For it is against the right of the Realm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 11th Chapter omitteth the clause in the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz. And not of other fees as have been levied of late.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the same year Petition <hi>n. 18. It is prayed, that nul Enditour soit mis en Enquest sur la deliverance de la Endi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee nient plus en trespass qu' en felonys 'il soit challenge pour celle cause per celui qu' est enditee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Statute thereupon <hi>cap. 3. Is in rot. statut. Auxint accorde est que nul Enditour Soit misen Enquest sur la deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance

               <p>Which is more favourably penned for the Subject, taking away all dispute, whether the <hi>Enditor</hi> might have been of the Jury or not, in case of Felony, before the making of this Statute.</p>
               <p>And such kind of alterations happen often.</p>
               <p>The 4th Chapter of this Statute agreeth with the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, <hi>n. 19. Save that after the words presentment, de bons &amp; loy al &amp; du visne,</hi> there is added in the Statute, <hi>ou tiel face se farce,</hi> where such act is done which explains out of which visne the presentment is to be.</p>
               <p>But the Print is very false, for there it is said, that it shall be lawful for every man to Exchange Gold for Silver, so as no man can hold the same as exchanged, nor take the profit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereas in the Answer to the Petition and Statute Roll it is, that it shall be well lawful to any man to exchange Gold for Silver, or for Gold or Silver, so as no man can hold a common exchange, nor nothing take of the people for the same exchange.</p>
               <p>The 13th Chapter of that Statute <hi>Anno</hi> 15. is taken out of the Answer to the Petition <hi>n.</hi> 22. and somewhat out of the Petition also.</p>
               <p>The 15 <hi>cap.</hi> out of the Petition <hi>n.</hi> 41. and the Answer also.</p>
               <p>The 13th <hi>cap.</hi> of the Statute of 28 <hi>E.</hi> 3. was made part out of the Petition and Answer <hi>n.</hi> 47. and part out of the Petition alone <hi>n.</hi> 55. and the last part thereof out of the Petition and Answer <hi>n.</hi> 50. but the Statute hath more concerning Tryals of Merchants <hi>n.</hi> 55. and for Marriners <hi>n.</hi> 50. than is in the said two Petitions and Answers.</p>
               <p>Of the 16th Article of the Statute of <hi>Westm</hi> two touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conditional grants, the answer is referred to the Judges to advise thereof till the next Parliament.</p>
               <p>The Statutes thus drawn into divers heads or Articles were shewn to the King, &amp; upon his approbatio engros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed sometimes with a Praeamble, &amp; an <hi>Observari volumus</hi> in the conclusion, and at other times without any praeamble at all, and by Writs sent into every County to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed.</p>

               <p>The Statute <hi>de circumspecte agatis</hi> was but an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance upon the complaint of the Bishop of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich.</hi>

not enrolled in the Statute Roll, the first in the Statute Roll being that of 6. <hi>E.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>The Statute of Wast is but an Ordinance upon a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate in Parliament, <hi>and the Justices commanded to proceed accordingly.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Articles concerning the Kings Praerogative, and the Answers thereunto, are only recited, and not drawn up in the form of a Statute, and seems to be but an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance made in Parliament, and the <hi>Justices of the Bench,</hi> directed to observe the same, else it had not been regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred, saith that very able <hi>Commentator</hi> Mr. <hi>Noy,</hi> in our antient Manuscripts, the venerable Conservators of our Statute Laws, and otherwise had long ago perished with our Parliament Rolls, whereof divers are missing of the Subsequent times, all of the former to 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3.

               <p>The revocation of the Statute of <hi>Anno 15. E.</hi> 3. and the Statute against <hi>Maintenance Anno 20. E.</hi> 3. being Acts made in the Kings great Councel and not of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were directed to the Sheriff to be published, and so was the Statute of Labourers in the 23 year of that Kings Raign, and also to the Bishops.</p>
               <p>And all other the Statutes of <hi>E.</hi> 3. to the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> 6. were drawn up in the form of Letters Patents, or with a short Praeamble, that the things following were ordained in Parliament, and sent with a Writ to
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:42937:240"/>
every Sheriff to be published, whereof some remain yet in the Tower of <hi>London</hi> unsent in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> 6. Probably because that about that time the invention of Printing was brought into <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Insomuch as in those times,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. No Statute hath been made (in some Parliaments) although sometimes agreed upon.</item>
                  <item>2. Many things have been omitted.</item>
                  <item>3. Many things added.</item>
                  <item>4. A Statute hath been made wherein the Commons gave not their Assent.</item>
                  <item>5. Wherein neither Lords or Commons assented.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 18. E.</hi> 3. The Commons exhibited a Petition containing 12 Articles, which were presently answered, and together with the Subsidy grant was made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Statute, sealed, delivered and published, <hi>Sedente Curia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And afterwards in the same Parliament they exhibited another Petition against Provisions from <hi>Rome,</hi> which was agreed and assented unto by <hi>the King, Earls, Barons, Justices, and other Sages of the Law, that the matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the said Petition, should be put into a covenable form according to the prayer of the</hi> Commons <hi>n.</hi> 32. &amp; 39. <hi>and yet no Statute at all made thereupon.</hi>

It is agreed that the Answer to this Petition shall be put into the Statute,</hi> and so the Statute was entred by the Clerk amongst the rest in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Roll (a thing then usual) <hi>and yet that was not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished with the other Statutes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For in the next Parliament in the same year <hi>n. 43. The Commons prayed it might be published and put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 3. R 2. n.</hi> 38. The Commons Petition against Extortions, was absolutely granted.</p>
               <p>And notwithstanding the protestation of the Praelates to the contrary, it was enrolled, and yet afterwards at a great <hi>Councel the Lords then assembled said, it was not their intent it should be enrolled, and no Statute was made thereon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 11. H. 4. n.</hi> 28. &amp; 63. Two several Petitions of the Commons were absolutely granted and entred in the

Parliament Roll, <hi>and afterwards when the Councel met to draw up the Statute they were respited.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 25. E. 3. n.</hi> 59. and <hi>cap.</hi> 3. Tit. Collations all this Clause was omitted out of an answer to a Petition of the Clergy, <hi>viz. It is accorded by the King, the Grands, and Commons, that after Judgment rendred for the King and the Clerk in Possession, the Presentment cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And there are added in that Statute two special Clauses for the Clergy which were not in the Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And afterwards <hi>Anno 13. R. 2. n. 59. cap.</hi> 1. Collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the like Clause for the <hi>King is wholly omitted,</hi> viz. <hi>And further, the King willeth, that Ratification granted for the incumbent after that the King presented and commenced his Suit, shall be allowed hanging the Plea, nor after Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given for the King, but that such Judgment shall be fully executed as reason demandeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 37. E. 3. n.</hi> 10. The Commons petitioned, that the grand Charter, and the Charter of the Forest, and the Statute made <hi>Anno</hi> 36. of our Lord the King that now is, touching Pourveyors, and the other Statute made in his time, and the time of his Progenitors, be firmly kept and maintained in all points, and be duly Executed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law, and that Writs be granted to every one who will sue upon every point; contained in what Statute soever.</p>
               <p>And if any Justice or Minister be dilatory to any Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute thereof made, that so much as he hath done to the contrary be held for nothing, and erroneous.</p>
               <p>To which was answered, <hi>Il plest au Roy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet notwithstanding that Petition was thus abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely granted and agreed upon, the Statute made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>cap.</hi> 1. is only, that <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and all other Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, shall be kept and duly Executed, omitting all the test.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 45. E. 3. n.</hi> 14. They Petition that King, that it <hi>please him of his Grace and Majesty, to command, charge and ordain,</hi> that the great Charter, and the Charter of the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest be kept and held in all points, and that the Franchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Customs, and Liberties heretofore used be held and kept in form as they were granted or used.</p>
               <p>To which was anwsered, <hi>Re Roy le voet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet in the Statute thereon, <hi>cap</hi> 1. is no more than
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:42937:241"/>
thus; It is ordained that the <hi>great Charter, and the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Forest be held and kept in all points, and omitteth all the rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 2. R. 2. n. 27. cap.</hi> 1. The Statute <hi>is penned much larger for the Liberties of the Church, than is in the Petition or Answer, and the salvo for the Kings Regality, is wholly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 3. R. 2. n. 26. cap.</hi> 1. They agree for the Liberties of the Church, but <hi>Magna Charta, and Charta de Foresta are wholly omitted in the Statute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 3. R. 2. n. 37. cap.</hi> 3. Touching Provisions, <hi>the special abuses of the Pope are omitted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 13. R. 2. n. 40. cap.</hi> 3. In the Oath which the Justices are to take, <hi>the words duly, and without favour are omitted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 25. E. 1. cap.</hi> 5. &amp; 7. (Touching Aids, Taxes and Prises granted to the King, but not to be taken for a Custom; And a release for Tole taken by the King, for Wooll, and a grant that he will not take the like without common consent, and good will) were agreed by the Lords and Commons in that Parliament, sealed with the Kings Seal, and the Seals of the Archbishop, and Bishops, who with the Kings Councel were voluntarily sworn to the performance thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 28. E. 1. cap.</hi> 2. The saving was added by the King <hi>and his Councel, at the drawing up of the Statute, as appears</hi> by the words therein, <hi>viz.</hi> The King and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, <hi>do not intend by reason of the Statute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item cap. 20. At the conclusion was added a saving for the King.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>And the like may be believed where some things have
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:42937:241"/>
been done, or Grants or Charters said and entred in the Parliament Rolls, to be <hi>Authoritate Parliamenti,</hi> which as the Judicious Mr. <hi>Noy</hi> hath observed, do not without other circumstances prove a common Assent of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for that some of the Answers to divers Petitions of the Commons in Parliament <hi>temporibus R.</hi> 2. &amp; <hi>H.</hi> 4. were put upon the Files only, and not entred in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Rolls.</p>
               <p>And the same words are in divers Acts of Parliament, mentioned to be inrolled in the Parliament Rolls of 4 &amp; 7 of <hi>H.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 4. H.</hi> 4. The Commons pray, that the most suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient <note place="margin">Ro. Parl. 4. H. 4. n. 95.</note> 
                  <hi>Welshmen</hi> of every Lordship be chosen to keep the Peace, and to answer for all Felonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they were wont to do unto the <hi>Conqueror of Wales</hi> in the time of King <hi>Edward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which the King answered, let this Petition be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Councel to be thereof advised, and the same Councel have power to provide Remedy therein, according to their discretion by Authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>In the 7th year of the Raign of the said King, the Commons prayed the King, that certain Petitions exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Bartholomew Verdon,</hi> and his companions, might graciously be exploited, <hi>per authoritatem Parliamenti,</hi> whereupon the King by the Advice and Assent of the Lords in Parliamenr, and at the request of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons granted the said Petition, as by the Endorsement thereof filed amongst the special Petitions may appear.</p>
               <p>But afterwards <hi>Anno 8. H. 5. n.</hi> 12. The Commons perceiving those words, <hi>(Authoritate Parliamenti)</hi> often used by the Lords alone in their Answers to Petitions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to the Receivers, appointed by the King, whereby the parties complained of, were oftentimes constrained to answer Causes, determinable at the Common Law, before the Kings Councel, or in the Chancery, exhibited the Petition ensuing, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Praying the Commons in this present Parliament, that if any man sue a Bill or Petition, with these words, <hi>(au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritate Parliamenti)</hi> and the Answer be made, let this Bill or Petition be committed to the Councel of the King, or to the Councellors of the King to execute and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the contents thereof (whereas the said Bill or Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:42937:242"/>
is not by the Commons of the Land, required to be affirmed or assented unto) that no man to such a Bill or Petition, unless the Assent or Request of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> be endorsed, <hi>be bound</hi> to answer contrary to the Laws of the Realm.</p>
               <p>Unto which was answered, <hi>soit aviser per le Roy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the foot of many Charters and Writs, have been indorsed, <hi>per ipsum Regem &amp; totum concilium in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento,</hi> and sometimes, <hi>per ipsum &amp; concilium suum in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamento,</hi> and at other times, <hi>per petitionem in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 4. H. 4. n.</hi> 116. The Commons pray, that whereas one <hi>Thomas Taynleur</hi> Approver, had appealed divers honest men very falsly, for which he was drawn and hanged; it would please the King to grant out Writs of the Chancery, unto the Justices, to cease all process against the party so falsly appealed, which was granted <hi>assensu Praelatorum Procerumque,</hi> &amp;c. And the form of the Writ there set down and underneath was written <hi>per petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem in Parliamento.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In publick Ordinances the words of ceremony are sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom expressed, only the matter agreed upon is record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the manner and form of the agreement, and by whom in particular, is most usually omitted, yet neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be understood, for such was the practice and usage of that age.</p>
               <p>In cases which require no new Law, those Acts were seldom entred; it was thought sufficient if they were on the file <hi>prout Fitz Herberts Abridg. tit.</hi> Parliament <hi>Anno 33. H. 6. n.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>Neither did those necessarily require the Common Assent of Parliament, for the Petitions granted <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Parliamenti</hi> do not prove the <hi>Common Assent,</hi> unless they were exhibited by the Commons, otherwise they were such only as were delivered to the Receivers of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions appointed by the King at the beginning of every Parliament, and they were answered by the <hi>Tryers</hi> then also appointed for the same, amongst whom none of
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:42937:242"/>
the House of Commons, were ever appointed, and those answers, or the matters themselves being heard before the Lords in Parliament as Petitions of great weight and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty alwaies were, for such alwaies had the additions of <hi>Authoritate Parliamenti,</hi> the first of them beginning <hi>tempore Richardi</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>And whether those words be added or omitted, yet such Answers ever did and will bind, <hi>so as they be not contrary to the Laws and Customs of the Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There needed no publication of Ordinances, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Chancery,</hi> when the <hi>Chancellor</hi> was present, nor concerning the <hi>Courts of Justice,</hi> when the <hi>Judges</hi> were present in <hi>Parliament,</hi> neither touching the grievances of the Kings <hi>Ministers</hi> and other Officers, for some of them were ever present in Parliament.</p>
               <p>And the Commons were so careful to have their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Rolls engrossed as in 2d <hi>Henry 4. n.</hi> 26. divers days before the end of the Parliament they did by their Speaker beseech the King that the business done, and to be done in this Parliament, be enacted and engrossed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the departure of the Justices, <hi>whilst they have them in their memory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto which it was answered, that the Clerk of the Parliament should do his endeavour to enact, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gross the Substance of the Parliament, <hi>by advice of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices, and after shew it to the King and Lords in Parliament to have their advice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which it appeareth, that the Parliament Roll was not drawn up by the Clerk alone <hi>ex officio,</hi> but with the advice of the <hi>Justices;</hi> and although it was here said, that it should be afterwards shewed unto the King, and Lords to be approved of by them, yet it is not to be thought that the King and Lords did usually examine the same, but the Judges advice was usually had therein, how else could the Commons require the same to be ingrossed <hi>whilst it remained in the Judges memory?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Parliament Roll of 11. <hi>E. 3. For the creation of</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But in <hi>Anno 5. H.</hi> 4. The Commons exhibiting their Bill in Parliament in the behalf of the Prince to be made <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> did recite that grant of King <hi>E.</hi> 3. to

               <p>
                  <hi>Annis 7. &amp; 8. H. 4. n.</hi> 65. The Speaker in the name of the Commons prayed the King and the Lords in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that certain of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal whom it pleased them to appoint, and a certain number of the Commons whose names he had written in a Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule or any 11. 10. 9. 8. 7. or 6. of them might be at the Enacting and Ingrossing of the Rolls of Parliament, and that his Prayer and Petition might be enacted of Record in the Roll of Parliament, which request the King graciously assented unto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 1. H. 4. n.</hi> 45. The Commons agreed, that the King might moderate the Statute against Provisors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 2. H. 4. n.</hi> 45. They complain to the King, that the same was otherwise entred in the Parliament Roll, than was agreed on by them, and that it might be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, which the King granted, but upon Protestation that it should not be drawn into Example. Whereupon the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Justices, and Councellors of the King, being severally examined in full Parliament, in the presence of the King, and all the Commons, testified that the said moderation was duly and justly entred and Enacted in the Parliament Roll, in manner as it was spoken and agreed on, by the said Lords and Commons, the which entring and enacting so made <hi>the King remembred to be well and truly done as it was agreed on in the last Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So careful were the Commons of the Parliament Rolls, the only Treasury of those publick Ordinances, and yet never petitioned touching the Roll of Statutes, nor to be present when they were made, for they knew full well that that did belong meerly to the King and his Councel.</p>
               <p>But only did put his Majesty in mind in <hi>Anno 2. H. 5. n.</hi> 10. That the Statute ought not to be drawn up con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the meaning of the Petitions which were then granted, and afterwards to prevent that inconvenience, they themselves framed their Bills in form of a Statute, which order continueth to this day.</p>

exemplified, was exhibited in the Parliament at <hi>York</hi> at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and answered in the next Parliament at <hi>Easter</hi> following.</p>
               <p>Some had Writs out of the <hi>Chancery</hi> for the setling and confirming of what was granted to them by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>prout Anno 16. R.</hi> 2. For livery to be made to <hi>Aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brey de Vere</hi> of the Lands entailed unto him.</p>
               <p>The Act of Parliament of 28 <hi>E.</hi> 1. being granted and published with a <hi>saving to the Right and Praerogative of the Crown,</hi> was afterwards upon the murmuring of some of the Lords and Commons against that <hi>Proviso, republished</hi> without it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Statutes were not Enrolled, until the King had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed thereof, and commanded it to be ingrossed, sealed and kept.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Things perpetual were made into a <hi>Statute</hi> and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary into an <hi>Ordinance,</hi> or signified by Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</p>
               <p>In the Parliament of 15 <hi>E.</hi> 3. A Statute was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner extorted from that glorious King, and a special Committee appointed to pen it, against which the Kings Councel protested, and the King by his Proclamation or Declaration revoked the same for that he assented not, but dissimuled, which remains upon record to this day to that Kings great dishonor, if not rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
               <p>Which that great Attorney General Mr. <hi>Noy</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to clear in this manner.</p>
               <p>The Commons having granted the year before a very large Subsidy to the King toward the <hi>French</hi> Wars to be paid in two years under divers conditions, and the Statute drawn up by a special Committee of Lords and Commons, who took great care that the King should be duly answered the said grant, and the Subjects enjoy his Majesties graces in those conditions expressed, and the King going into <hi>France</hi> with full confidence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the said money accordingly, but being abused by his Officers that which was paid so spent as little came to his hands, so as for want of money he was enforced to accept of a Truce when he was in probability of a great Victory if not of the Conquest of all <hi>France,</hi> whereupon returning suddenly, he fell first upon the Officers, who excusing themselves, laid the blame upon the Collectors,
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:42937:244"/>
which caused the King to send out strickt Commissions to enquire thereof. But he was most incensed against the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who had encouraged him to those Wars, willing him to take no care for treasure, because he would himself see him abundantly furnished by the said Subsidy, which failing, and the King under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that the Pope sided with the <hi>French,</hi> mistrusted the Praelates in general, but especially the Archbishop, and reprehended him sharply for it, who presently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of manifold violences against the Liberties of the Church and <hi>English</hi> Nation comprehended in <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> and thus the Clergy incensed the Commons against the King and the Commissioners, which he had appointed to enquire of the abuses of the Collectors, who had enquired of divers matters in <hi>Eyre</hi> beyond the limits of their Commissions, which bred such ill humours in the Lords and Commons, as when in the 15th year of his Majesties Raign, when he had in Parliament shewed the necessity of the <hi>French</hi> Wars, and that the Aid grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him the year before was withheld and ill spent by his Officers, and therefore desired the Parliament to consider how Malefactors might be punished, and the Law kept in equal force both to Poor and Rich, the Commons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up their advice in writing for a <hi>Commission,</hi> to be directed to the Justices in each Shire, <hi>d' Oyer &amp; Terminer</hi> these matters in general.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>King,</hi> the Praelates and Grandees thought fit to add <hi>Articles of the said enquiry, and therefore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto the Commons certain Articles which were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the said Praelates and Grandees, for them to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise, and give their Assent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The which being viewed and examined by them, they assented that <hi>good Justices,</hi> and Loyal, be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to hear and determine all the things contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the said Articles, for <hi>the profit of our Lord the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Assent of the Lords is many times omitted to be entred, and so likewise hath many times been that of the Commons.</p>
               <p>In the same year the Commons exhibited their Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the confirming of a Statute made in the 15th year of the said Kings Raign, which was general <hi>n.</hi> 26. And in general for all Statutes, and the other special <hi>n.</hi> 27. for that in particular.</p>

                  <hi>Anno Eodem</hi> a Bill was exhibited by the Clergy into the Lords House against a Bull from the Pope to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Possessions of the <hi>Cistertian</hi> Monks from the payment of Tythes, which being there answered, was carried to the Commons by the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> himself, to have their Assent, and told them, that the King and the Lords were attended upon with the Answer to the same, and afterwards the Commons came before the King and the Lords in Parliament, and made divers requests, and amongst others shewed that the Archbishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> delivered them the Petition touching the order of <hi>Cistertians,</hi> to which Answer the said Commons agreed.</p>
               <p>

               <p>And though there have been Revocations of Patents during pleasure, of Protections and Presentations, and Revocations of Revocations <hi>quibusdam certis de causis,</hi> yet never was there any Revocation of any Pardons granted where the King was not abused or deceived in the grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof.</p>
               <p>For in Letters Patents for other matters, Reversals were not to be accounted legal, where they were not upon just causes proved upon Writs of <hi>Scire facias</hi> issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Chancery, and one of the Articles for the deposing of King <hi>Richard 2d.</hi> being that he revoked some of his Pardons.</p>
               <p>The <hi>recepi's</hi> of Patents of Pardon, or other things were ordained so to signifie the time when they were first brought to the Chancellour, as to prevent contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies concerning priority or delays, made use of in the Sealing of them to the detriment of those that first ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them.</p>

               <p>So they that would have Attainders pass by Bill or Act of Parliament to make that to be Treason which by the Law and antient and reasonable Customs of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> was never so before to be believed or adjudged, or to Accumulate Trespasses and Misdemeanors to make that a Treason which singly could never be so, either in truth, Law, right, reason or Justice.</p>

               <p>The House of Commons if they will be Accusers, wherein they may be often mistaken, when they take it from others, and have no power to examine upon Oath, wild and envions Informations, and at the same time a part of the Parliament, subordinate to the King, will in such an Act of Attainder be both Judge and Party, which all the Laws in the World could never allow to be just.</p>
               <p>And such a course, if suffered, must needs be dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory and prejudicial to the Rights and Priviledges, and Judicative Power of the Peers in Parliament, unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelled,
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:42937:261"/>
and unpresidented, when any Judgments given by them, shall by such a Bill of Attainder, like a Writ of Error, or as an Appeal from them to the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, be enervated or quite altered by an Act of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder framed by the House of Commons, whereby they which shall be freed or absolved by their Peers, or by that Honourable and more wise Assembly, shall by such a <hi>back</hi> or <hi>by-blow</hi> be condemned, or if only Fined by the House of Peers, may be made to forfeit their Estates and Posterities by the House of Commons; or if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the Upper House, be absolved in the Lower, who shall thereby grow to be so formidable as none of the Peerage, or Kings Privy-Councel shall dare to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please them, and where the <hi>dernier Ressort,</hi> or Appeal, was before and ought ever to be to the King in his House of Peers, or without, will thus be lodged in the House of Commons, and of little avail will the Liberty of our Nobility be to be tryed by their own Peers, when it shall be <hi>contre caeur,</hi> and under the Control of the House of Commons.</p>
               <p>Or that the Commons disclaiming, as they ought, any power or Cognisance in the matters of War and Peace, should by a Bill of Attainder make themselves to be Judges and Parties against a Peer, both of the Kings Privy Council and Great Council in Parliament, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Matters of that Nature.</p>
               <p>For if the <hi>Commons</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> had never after their own Impeachments of a <hi>Peer</hi> or <hi>Commoner,</hi> Petitioned the King to pardon the very Persons which they had Accused, as they did in the Cases of <hi>Lyons</hi> and <hi>John Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,</hi> in the 51 year of the Raign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third whom they had fiercely accused in <hi>Parliament</hi> but the year before the Objection that a <hi>Pardon</hi> ought not to be a Bar against an Impeachment, might have had more force than it is like to have.</p>
               <p>Neither would it, or did it discourage the exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any for the future, no more than it did the many after Impeachments, which were made by the <hi>Commons</hi> in several <hi>Parliaments,</hi> &amp; Kings Raigns, whereupon punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments severe enough ensued; For if the very many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments and Informations at every Assizes and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sessions in the Counties, and in the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> at <hi>Westminster,</hi> in the Term time, ever since the

Usurpation and Raign of King <hi>Stephen</hi> and the <hi>Pardons</hi> granted shall be exactly searched and numbred, the foot of the Accompt will plainly demonstrate, that the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> for Criminal Offences have not been above, or so many as one in every hundred, or a much smaller and inconsiderable number, either in or before the first or latter instance, before Tryal or after, and the <hi>Pardons</hi> granted by our Kings, so few and seldom, as it ought to be confest, that that Regal Power only proper for Kings, the Vicegerents of God Almighty, not of the People, hath been modestly and moderately used, and that the multitude of Indictments and Informations, and few Pardons now extant in every year, will be no good Witnesses of such a causelesly feared discouragement.</p>
               <p>And it will not be so easily proved, as it is fancied, that there ever was by our Laws or reasonable Customs an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Or that there was any such Institution (which would be worth the seeing if it could be found or heard of) that it was the Chief to be taken care of, or that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it consequently the Government it self would be destroyed.</p>
               <p>To prove which groundless Institution the Author of those Reasons is necessitated (without resorting, as he supposeth, to greater Antiquities) to vouch to Warranty the Declaration of that excellent Prince, King <hi>Charles</hi> the First of Blessed Memory, made in that behalf (when there was no Controversie or Question in agitation or debate touching the power of pardoning) in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the nineteen Propositions of both <hi>Houses</hi> of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> wherein stating the several parts of this well regulated Monarchy, he saith, the King, the House of Lords, and the House of Commons, have each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Priviledges.</hi>

And this kind of excellently tempered <hi>Monarchy,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the power to preserve that Authority, without which it would be disabled to protect the Laws in their Force, and the Subjects in their Peace, Liberties and Properties, ought to have drawn unto him such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and reverence from the Nobility and Great Ones, as might hinder the Ills of Division and Faction; and cause such a Fear and Respect from the People as might impede Tumults and Violence.</p>

               <p>And would make the King, by some scattered or distorted parts of that Answer, mangled and torn from the whole context and purpose of it, to give away those undoubted Rights of his Crown, for which, and the preservation of the Liberties of his People, he died a <hi>Martyr;</hi> the Author and his Party endeavouring all they can to translate the Assent of the <hi>Commons</hi> required in the Levying of Money into that of the power of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning, and jumbling the Words and Sense of that Royal Answer, cements and puts together others of their own to fortifie and make out their unjust purposes, omitting every thing that might be understood against them, or give any disturbance thereunto.</p>
               <p>And with this resolution the Author proceedeth to do as well as he can, and saith, that</p>

<pb n="584" facs="tcp:42937:263"/>
by Pardons of a like nature.</p>
               <p>As if the pardoning of one must of Necessity amount to many, or all, in offences of a different nature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted at several times by several persons (which is yet to be learned) and the Justice of the Nation which hath been safe and flourished for many Ages, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing some necessary Pardons granted by our Princes, can be obstructed or defeated in a well constituted Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment under our Kings and Laws; so it may ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly be wondred upon what such jealousies should now be founded, or by what Law or Reason to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, if it shall thus be suffered to run wild or mad.</p>

               <p>King <hi>James</hi> was assured by his Councel that he might pardon Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> Sir <hi>Griffin Markham</hi> with many others then guilty of Treason, and the Earl of <hi>Somerset</hi> and his Lady, for the Murder of Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> without any commotion in the Brains of the rest of his Subjects, some of whom were much disturbed that he after cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> to be executed for a second Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence upon the Score of the former, not at all pardoned, but reprieved or only respited.</p>

               <p>Nor doth an Impeachment of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons virtually, or ever can from the first Constitution of it be proved or appear to be the voice of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Subject of the Kingdom; for if we may believe Mr. <hi>William Pryn,</hi> one of their greatest Champions, and the Records of the Nation and Parliaments, the Commons in Parliament do not, or ever did Represent, or are Procurators for the Lords Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, and their numerous Tenants and ancient Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that hold in <hi>Capite,</hi> nor for the many Tenants that should be of the Kings ancient Demesne and Revenues, nor for the Clergy, the multitude of Copy-holders heretofore, as much as the fourth part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, neither the great number of Lease-holders, Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that are not Free-holders, Citizens or Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <note place="margin">

               <p>And to men that have not yet proceeded so far in the School of <hi>Revelation</hi> as to be sure of the Spirit of Prophesie, it may prove a matter of ill consequence that the universality of the People should have occasion ministred and continued to them to be apprehensive of utmost dangers from the Crown, from whence they of right expect Protection.</p>
               <p>And a Wonder next a Miracle, from whence the Premisses to such a trembling and timorous conclusion can be fetched, or how a People, whose valiant and wiser Fore-fathers were never heretofore scared with such <hi>panick fears,</hi> nor wont to be affrighted with such <hi>Phantasmes,</hi> should now suspect they can have no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from the Crown, when some of them do at the same time labour all they can to hinder it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>When no Histories <hi>Jewish, Pagan</hi> or <hi>Christian,</hi> can shew us a People, unless in Cases of intollerable Villanies, Petitioning their Kings, that they would not Pardon, when all are not like to be Saints or Faultless, and it will ever be better to leave it to the Hearts of Kings, and God that directs them, than to believe Tyranny to be a Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and Petition for it.</p>
               <p>And the most exact search that can be made, when it findeth the Commons petitioning in Parliament to the King or House of Peers, that they may be present at some Tryals there, upon their Impeachments, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not meet with any one President where they ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, or were granted such a reasonless Request, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued and set on by other Mens Designs to have one Mans Tryal had before another, and by strugling and wrestling for it, expose the King and Kingdom to an utter destruction.</p>
               <p>And therefore in those their fond importunities might do well to tarry until they they can find some Reason why the Lords Spiritual may not Vote or Sit as Judges or Peers in Parliament, in the Case of the <hi>five Lords,</hi> as well as of the Earl of <hi>Danby.</hi>

               <p>And the King may acquit (which amounteth to a Remission or Pardon) by a more Supream Authority than any of His Judges (some particular Cases where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Appeals are, or may be brought, only excepted) do
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:42937:265"/>
ordinarily by an authority derived from no other, not to be debarred by probabilities, or possibilities, or by consequences, not always to be foreseen or avoided.</p>
               <p>For a Man pardoned for Man-slaughter, may be so unhappy as in the like manner afterwards to be the death of five or ten more; 20000 Rebells pardoned at a time as in the Insurrections of <hi>Wat Tyler, Jack Cade, &amp;c.</hi> may be guilty of the like Offence, twenty or forty years after: The Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> that hath an allowance of Tolls and Profits to take a care of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and wholsomness of Food, might be, as they are, too much careless, and undo them in their Health and well being.</p>
               <p>The Judges may as those in the Raign of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the First, and <hi>Thorp</hi> in the Raign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, be guilty of Mildemeanours, yet that is not to bereave us of that good which better Men may do us in their administration of Justice, our Kings have granted Priviledges to certain Cities and Towns not to pay Subsidies, and granted Pardons as their Mercies and right reason inclined them, in the course of their several Raigns for many Ages last past, yet have not acquitted or left unpunished all the Offenders ever since, there being a greater likelyhood that they would not be so easie in pardoning, where they were to gain so much by Attainders, Fines and Forfeitures</p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>panick</hi> and vain Fears, such as <hi>in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantem virum cadere non possunt,</hi> should not be permitted to affright our better to be imployed Imaginations, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we had a mind to be as wise as a small and pleasant Courtier of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighths, who would never endure to pass in a Boat under <hi>London-</hi>Bridge lest it should fall upon his Head, because it might once happen to do so.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Magna Charta's</hi> and all our Laws which ordain <hi>no man to be condemned or punished without Tryal by his Peers,</hi> do allow it where it is by Confession, Outlawry, <hi>&amp;c</hi> and no Verdict.</p>
               <p>Did never think it fit that Publick Dangers, such as Treason should tarry, where Justice may as well be done otherwise without any precise Formalities to be used therein.</p>
               <p>For although it may be best done by the advice of
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:42937:265"/>
the Kings greatest Council the <hi>Parliament,</hi> there is no Law or reasonable Custom of <hi>England</hi> either by Act of Parliament, or without, that restrains the King to do it only in the time of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Returns, Law-Days and Terms appointed and fixt, have ever given place to our Kings Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> Inquiries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon special and emergent occasions.</p>
               <p>And notwithstanding it will be always adviseable that Kings should be assisted by their greatest Council, when it may be had, yet there is no Law or Act of Parliament extant, or any right reason or consideration to bind Him from making use of His ordinary Council in a Case of great and importunate necessity.</p>
               <p>For Cases of Treason, Felony and Trespass, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted out of Parliament, first and last granted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Priviledges by our and their Kings and Princes, there can be no solid Reason or cogent Argument to perswade any man that the King cannot for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of Himself and His People, in the absence or interval of Parliaments, punish and try Offenders in Cases of Treason, without which there can be no Justice, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection or Government, if the Power of the King and Supream Magistrate shall be tyed up by such, or the like as may happen, Obstructions.</p>
               <p>So that until the Honourable House of Commons can produce some or any Law, Agreement, Pact, Concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Liberty or Priviledge to Sit and Counsel the King, whether he will or no, as long as any of their Petitions remain unanswered (which they never yet could or can) (those grand Impostors and Figments of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus tenendi Parliamenta,</hi> and the supposed <hi>Mirror of Justice,</hi> being as they ought to be rejected) when the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Records will witness that many Petitions have, for want of time (most of the ancient Parliaments not expending much of it) been adjourned to be determined in other Courts, as in the Case of <hi>Staunton</hi> in 14 <hi>E.</hi> 3. and days have been limited to the Commons for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting of their Petitions; the Petitions of the <hi>Corbets</hi> depended all the Raigns of King <hi>Edward</hi> the First and Second, until the eleventh year of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, which was about sixty six years, and divers Petitions not dispatched, have in the Raign of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,

been by the King referred to the <hi>Chancellor</hi> and sometimes with a direction to call to his assistance the <hi>Justices</hi> and the <hi>Kings Serjeants</hi> at <hi>Law,</hi> and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons themselves have at other times prayed <hi>to have their Petitions determined by the Councel of the King,</hi> or by the <hi>Lord Chancellor.</hi> And there will be reason to believe that in Cases of urgent necessity for publick safety, the King is and ought to be at liberty to try and punish great and dangerous Offenders without His Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Parliament.</p>
               <p>The Petitions in <hi>Parliament</hi> touching the pardoning of <hi>Richard Lyons, John Peachie, Alice Peirce, &amp;c</hi> and a long process of <hi>William Montacute</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> were renewed and repeated again in the <hi>Parliament</hi> of the first of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, because the <hi>Parliament</hi> was ended before they could be answered</p>

               <p>And although some of this latter quarrelling Age
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:42937:267"/>
have Espoused an Opinion, too much insisted upon, that an Impeachment brought by the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons against any one makes the supposed Offence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it be Tryed, unpardonable.</p>
               <p>A Reason whereof is undertaken to be given, because that in all Ages it hath been an undoubted Right of the Commons to Impeach before the Lords any Subject for Treason or any Crime whatsoever.</p>
               <p>And the Reason of that Reason is (supposed to be) because great Offences complained of in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are most effectually determined in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>Nor was the House of Lords from its first and more ancient original, intituled under their King to a Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power to their Kings, in common or ordinary Affairs, but in <hi>arduis,</hi> and not in all things of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but in <hi>quibusdam,</hi> as the King should propose and desire their advice, concerning the Kingdom and Church in matters of Treason or publick concernments, and did understand themselves, and that high and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Court, to be so much forbid by Law, ancient usage and custom to intermeddle with petty or small Crimes or Matters, as our Kings have ever since the sixth year of the Raign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the first, ordained some <note place="margin">Rot. parl. 7 E. 1.</note> part of the Honourable House of Peers, to be Receivers and Tryers of Petitions of the Members of the House of Commons themselves and others, directed to the King to admit what they found could have no Remedy in the ordinary Courts of Justice, and reject such as were, properly elsewhere to be determined, with an Indorse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>non est Petitio Parliamenti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which may well be believed to have taken much
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:42937:267"/>
of its reason and ground from a Law made by King <hi>Canutus</hi> who began his Raign about the year of our Lord, 1016. <hi>Nemo de injuriis alterius Regi queratur</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ll. <hi>Canuti,</hi> 16</note> 
                  <hi>nisi quidem in Centuria Justitiam consequi &amp; impetrare non poterit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For certainly, if it should be otherwise, the reason and foundation of that highest Court would not be as it hath been hitherto, always understood to be with a Cognisance only <hi>de quibusdam arduis,</hi> matters of a very high nature concerning the King and the Church.</p>
               <p>But it must have silenced all other Courts and Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and have been a continual Parliament, a <hi>Goal-delivery</hi> or an intermedler in matters as low as Court <hi>Leets,</hi> or Baron and County Courts, and a <hi>Pye-Powder Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the words of any Crime whatsoever do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly signifie great Offences, and that all great Offences do concern the Parliament, is without a Key to unlock the Secret not at all intelligible, when it was never instituted or made to be a Court for common or ordinary Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.</p>
               <p>For the House of Commons were never wont to take more upon them than to be Petitioners and Assenters unto such things as the King by the advice of His Lords Spiritual and Temporal should ordain, and obey, and endeavour to perform them.</p>
               <p>And an Impeachment of the House of Commons cannot be said to be in the Name or on the behalf of all the People of <hi>England,</hi> for that they never did or can represent the one half of them, and if they will be pleased to exaimine the Writs and Commissions granted by our Kings for their Election, and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the Peoples Election, of them to be their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives, Substitutes or Procurators, it will not extend to accuse Criminals, for that appertained to the King himself and His Laws, care of Justice and the Publick; for the Common People had their Inferiour Courts and Grand Juries, Assises and Goal-Deliveries to dispatch such Affairs without immediately troubling Him or His Parliament, and the tenour and purpose of their Commissions and Elections to Parliament, is no more than <hi>ad faciendum &amp; consentiendum iis,</hi> to obey and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form such things as the King, by the advice of His
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:42937:268"/>
Lords Spiritual and Temporal, should in Parliament ordain.</p>
               <p>For although where the Wife or Children of a Man murdered shall bring an Appeal, the King is debarred from giving a Pardon, because by our <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Laws of God, they are not to be distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed <note place="margin">Ll.

               <p>Yet the publick Justice will not be satisfied without the party offending be Arraigned and brought to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for it, if the party that hath right to Appeal should surcease or be bought off, so as an Appeal may be brought after or before the King hath Indicted, and an <hi>auter foitz acquit</hi> in the one case will not prejudice in the other, and where the Matter of Fact comes to be afterwards fully proved, and the Appeal of a Wife or Child of a Bastard called <hi>filius populi, quia nullius filius,</hi> where only the King is Heir, cannot vacate or supersede an Indictment of the Kings.</p>
               <p>Neither is an Appeal upon a Crime or in criminal Matters in the first instance to be at all pursued in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, by the Statute made in the First year of the Raign of King <hi>H.</hi> 4. the words whereof are, <hi>Item for</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 H. 4. cap. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>many great inconveniences and mischiefs that often have happened by many Appeals made within the Realm of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land (to the great afflictions and calamites of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it afterwards happened by the <hi>Lancastrian</hi> Plots and Desings in that mischievous Appeal in <hi>Anno</hi> 11. of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second) <hi>before this time;</hi> It is ordained and stablished from henceforth, <hi>That all the Appeals to be made of things done out of the Realm, shall be tryed and determined before the Constable and Marshal of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>for the time being; And moreover it is accorded and assented, That no Appeals be from henceforth made, or in any wise pursued in Parliament in any time to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore that allegation that the House of Peers cannot reject the Impeachment of the Commons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that Suit or Complaint of the Commons can be determined no where else, will want a better founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (an Impeachment of the House of Commons, in the Name of all the People being no other than an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the King in Parliament.)</p>
               <p>And the Suit of such as might be Appellants in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:42937:268"/>
place (being there expresly prohibited) cannot be supposed to be the concern or interest of all the People deserving or requiring satisfaction, or especially provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for by Law to have satisfaction, unless it could by any probability or soundness of Judgment be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that all the People of <hi>England</hi> besides Wives, Children or near Kindred and Relations (the necessity of publick Justice and deterring Examples) are or should be concerned in such a never to be fancied Appeal of the People. And it will be very hard to prove that one or a few are all the People of <hi>England,</hi> or if they could be so imagined, are to be more concerned than the King, who is sworn to do Justice, unless they would claim and prove a Soveraignty, and to be sworn to do Justice, which though they had once by a villanous Rebellion attacked, until <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> their <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> cheated them of it; for God would never allow them any such power or priviledge, or any Title to the Jesuits Doctrine which some of our Protestant Dissenters, their modern Proselites, have learned of them, that the King, although he be <hi>singulis major,</hi> is <hi>minor universis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is no denial of Justice in the House of Peers to deny the receiving of an Impeachment from the House of Commons, when they cannot understand any just cause or reason to receive it, and the Records, Rolls, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions and Orders of Parliament will inform those that will be at the pains to be rightly and truly directed by them, that Petitions in Parliament have been adjourned modified or denied; and that in the Common or Inferior Courts of Justice, Writs and Process may sometimes be denied, superseded or altered according to the Rules of Justice, or the circumstances thereof. And our Records can witness, that Plaintiffs have petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Courts of Justice <hi>recedere a brevi &amp; impetrare aliud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it cannot be said that the King doth <hi>denegare Justitiam,</hi> when he would bind them unto their ancient legal, well experimented forms of seeking it in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing their Rights and Remedies, &amp; hinders them in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but seeking to hurt others and destroy themselves.</p>
               <p>For Justice no otherwise denied should not be termed Arbitrary, until there can be some solid reason, proof or evidence for it,</p>
               <p>When it is rather to be believed, that if the Factious
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:42937:269"/>
Vulgar Rabble might have their Wills, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be content or leave their <hi>fooling</hi> until they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an unbounded liberty of tumbling and tossing the Government into as many several Forms and Methods, as there be days in the year, and no smaller variety of Religions.</p>
               <p>And by the Feudal Laws, which are the only Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Laws of our Government and English Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, those many parts of the Tenants that held of their Mesne Lords <hi>in Capite,</hi> could not with any safety to their Oaths and Estates Authorise any of their Elected Members of the House of Commons in Parliament, to accuse or charge any of the Baronage of <hi>England,</hi> in the House of Peers in Parliament, although every Tenant in his Oath of Vassalage to his Mesne Lord, doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his Allegiance to the King, and would be guilty of Misprision of Treason, if he should conceal it by the space of twenty and four hours, and if any of the Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed would or should avoid such Misprision of Treason in the not performance of his Duty and Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, it would require a particular Commission to his own Elected Members, and is not to have it done by way of a general Representation when there is not to be discerned in the Kings Writ, or in the Sureties, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nucaptors matters, or things to be performed, or in the Indentures betwixt the Sheriff and the Electors, and Elected any word of Representation, or any thing more than <hi>ad faciendum &amp; consentiendum iis,</hi> to assent and obey, do and perform such things as the King by the Advice of the Lords in Parliament shall ordain, and if they would make themselves to be such Representers, were to have a particular and express Commission, to charge or impeach any one of themselves or of the House of Peers with Treason, or any other high Misdemeanours.</p>
               <p>And they must be little conversant with our Records, that have not understood that the Commons have many times received just denials to their Petitions, and that some have not seldom wanted the foundations of Reason or Justice.</p>
               <p>That many of their Petitions have adopted the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns and Interests of others, that were either Strangers unto them, or were the Designs of some of the grand Nobility who thought them as necessary to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:42937:269"/>
as Wind, Tide, and Sails are to the speed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Ship into the Port or Landing-places of their Designs.</p>
               <p>For upon their exhibiting in a Parliament in the 28 <note place="margin">Rot. Parl. 28. H. 6. n. 16, 17.</note> year of the Raign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, abundance of Articles of High Treason, and Misdemeanours, against <hi>William de la Poole,</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> one whereof was that he had sold the Realm of <hi>England</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> King, who was preparing to invade it.</p>
               <p>When they did require the King and House of Lords that the Duke (whom not long before they had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the King to be rewarded for special services) might be committed Prisoner to the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> the Lords and Justices upon consultation, thought it not reasonable unless some special Matter was objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the said Duke not putting himself upon his Peerage, but with protestation of his innocency, only submitting himself to the Kings mercy, who acquitting him from the Treason and many of the Misdemeanours, and for some of them by the advice of the Lords, only banished him for five years. And that thereupon when the Viscount <hi>Beaumont</hi> in the behalf of the Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Temporal required that it might be Inrolled that the Judgment was by the Kings own Rule, &amp; not by their Assent, and that neither they nor their Heirs should by this Example be barred of their Peerage.</p>
               <p>No Protestation appears to have been made by any of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal for or on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Commons.</p>
               <p>Or by the Commons for themselves.</p>
               <p>So as a different manner of doing Justice can neither truly or rationally be said to be an absolute denial of Justice, and was never believed to be so by the Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors of the House of Commons in Parliament in our former Kings Raigns, when some hundreds of their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions in Parliament have been answered. There is a Law already provided, or let the old Law stand, or the King will provide a covenable or fitting remedy.</p>
               <p>And is not likely if it were, as it is not to be, any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power, or any temptation or inducement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, to produce any Rule or incouragement to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of an Arbitrary Power in the Inferiour Courts,
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:42937:270" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when there is none so weak in his Intellect, but may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that different Courts have several Boundaries, Methods and Forms of Proceedings, and that the Kings extraordinary great Court and Councel in His House of Peers, although very just and unarbitrary in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedures, is so always ready to succour the Complaints of People, as it never willingly makes it self to be the cause of it.</p>
               <p>And cannot misrepresent the House of Peers to the King and his People, in the Case of Mr. <hi>Fitz Harris,</hi> or any others, when that honourable Assembly takes so much care as it doth to repress Arbitrary Power, and doth all it can to protect the whole Nation from it, and many of the House of Commons Impeachments have been disallowed by the King and his House of Peers in Parliament without any ground or cause of fear of Arbitrary Power, which can no where be so mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously placed, as in the <hi>giddy multitude</hi> whose Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would be worse than the <hi>Ostracisme</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> and so often overturn and tire all the wise men and good men in the Nation, as there would be none but such as deserve not to be so stiled, to manage the Affairs of the Government, subordinate to their King and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.</p>
               <p>To all which may be added, if the former Presidents cited to assert the Kings Power of Pardoning as well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an Impeachment made by the Commons in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as before, and after an Impeachment made by the Commons, and received by the Lords in Parliament, or made both by the Lords and Commons in Parliament, be not not sufficient that of <hi>Hugh le Despenser,</hi> Son of <hi>Hugh le Despenser,</hi> the younger, a Lord of a great Estate, which is thus entred in the Parliament Roll of the fifth year of the Raign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, ought surely to satisfie, that the Laws and reasonable Customs of <hi>England</hi> will warrant it.</p>

At which the Company standing amazed, and Sir <hi>Nicholas Strode</hi> said, that <hi>he should never have fought for</hi> the late <hi>blessed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, or come to his setting up his Standard</hi> at <hi>Nottingham</hi> if he could have foreseen it, the most of the Nation at that time, and almost ever since, verily believing that it had been the folly and evil doing of Sir <hi>Edward Hyde</hi> the late Lord <hi>Chancellor,</hi> afterwards Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> and therefore was sufficiently railed upon, Cursed and Banned for it, and yet he was so Faultless and Innocent therein, as it can be witnessed by the now Earl of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon</hi> his Son Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland</hi> and Lord pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Seal in the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> that this overbold &amp; presumptuous motion of a Servant and Councel at Law of that unfortunate weather-beaten Prince, not being at all informed how or by whom the project came to be first hatched or moved, his late Majesty calling together his privy Councel, and advising upon that most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy proposition, wherein the Rebel Parliament in <hi>February</hi> 1647. had made some Vote, Act or Ordinance against the aforesaid Tenures under the notion of the Court of <hi>Wards,</hi> being but two years before his Royal Fathers Murther, and <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> had made some Act of his Worships miscalled Parliament some few years after, as it behoved for the destruction of those Tenures <hi>in Capite,</hi> when he intended as much as he could to take away the Kingship and Monarchy, until he could make himself fit to govern a foolish, besotted, rebellious people, they having before not at all made any mention or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest to have the said Court of <hi>Wards</hi> put down, or the <hi>Tenures in Capite</hi> by their High and mighty 19 Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,

The Earl of <hi>Radnor</hi> was much against their dissolution, alledging that the constitution it self was good, and was not in it self to be cast away by any Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>administration: Sir <hi>Geffery Palmer</hi> was very much for the preservation of the Tenures, and so were many other, and the Lord Chancellor <hi>Clarendon</hi> very much, and so greatly, as he called to the said Sollicitor General, and said, will you also put down the Pourveyances? saying with some passion, <hi>by God</hi> we seem to be against the late Commonwealth, and yet are acting for it.</p>
               <p>And his late Majesty was so unwillingly drawn to be in Love with that ever to be deplored Parliament contrivance to decapitate the Monarchy, and not only that, but <hi>Ireland,</hi> and render all the Inferiour part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to be in a paralitique or dead palsical over-benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in its Members, as before that Act passed, he sent for one Mr. <hi>Darnel,</hi> an ancient and experienced Clerk and Attorney in the Court of Wards and Liveries, to propose some expedient for the Regulation of any thing that had been Acted amiss in that Court, who bringing it unto him in writing, he so much approved thereof, as he took him by the hand, and gave him great thanks, but the fatality of that lamentable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted alteration of our ancient Monarchy, into an Anarchy or Poliarchy, with, by their good will, a

                  <hi>nudum nomen</hi> of a metamorphosed Monarchy, and that unhappy as aforesaid proposer of it, cannot if he were now amongst the living but remember that after I had Written a Book to Justify the Tenures <hi>in Capite</hi> enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled <hi>Tenenda non Tollenda,</hi> dedicated to the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, but delivered it unto him before the Act had passed against them, and not at all imagining that Mr. <hi>Solicitor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> General had been so over-active in destroying them, desired him that he would be a means to procure the military Services to be reserved, was answered, it could not be done, and yet notwithstanding about a year or two after attending him about some other affairs, he was pleased to say unto me, Mr. <hi>Philipps,</hi> do you ever think to write in the <hi>Tenures in Capite</hi> again? unto which I answering, no Sir, but I think the Child that is yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born may rue it, unto which he replyed, so do I also think, or I am of that opinion, which shews, that though he did it without the Kings knowledge, and as a special Service to be done unto him, did him that great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief he never intended, and was sorry for it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>But when it was the wisdom of former ages to know what to contend for before they quarrelled, therefore it may be necessary to let the Cavalling party understand that there are multitudes of Priviledges which are not Priviledges of Parliament, but truly and properly are the Priviledges and Properties in their own Estates, and they may be kinder to themselves if they will but take a view of such Priviledges and Properties, as they can call their own.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Finis,</hi> end or motives whereof was primarily and principally the Kings important occasions of summon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Parliament, and causing them to come thither, and he only was the <hi>Efficient cause,</hi> or <hi>causa sine qua non,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to protect and keep them from disturbances, whilst they were busy and employed in his service, either in their coming, tarrying or returning.</p>
               <p>And therefore the Members of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, were so sensible and willing to have those pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges to be granted unto them, as might be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the affairs wherewith he had intrusted them, as they not dceming any other to be requisite or belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto them.</p>

               <p>And the House of Commons themselves did in a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in the 21 year of the raign of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second certainly so understand and believe it, when they recommended to posterity their dutiful protestation to their King and Soveraign, and request to have it specially Inrolled in these words, <hi>Item les ditz Comes fierent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation devant le Roi en plein Parlement &amp; ils vurroient monstrer &amp; declarer mesme le Jour en plein Parlement cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine matieres &amp; Articles deus queux ils fierent alors aviser &amp; entre eux accorder nient majus il fust &amp; est leur entent &amp; volunte percongie de nostre Seigneur le Roy de accuser &amp; empesther persone ou persones a tantes de foiz come leur sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleroit affaire durant le temps de cest present Parlement &amp; prierent au Roy &amp; lui pleiroit accepter leur dite protestation &amp; quil soit entrer en rolle de Parlement de record la quele chose nostre Seigneur le Roi leur ad ottroie &amp; commanda a destre fait,</hi> and did think it not to be unbecoming their duty to require license of the King to charge or accuse any person or persons in that tempestuous Parliament nor did beleive that their accusations or impeachments should or ought to be so fatally mortal when in the first year of the Raign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th, by a patch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed contrivance of the Parliament in the Raign of King <hi>H.</hi> 4. the same Commons in Parliament desired that the Judgment given against the said Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> whose Pardon but a little before had been rejected, might be reversed, and a restoration made of all his Lands, Estate and Evidences.</p>
               <p>And those their Priviledges being but personal and temporary, and after they were allowed by our Kings a Speaker, which was about the Raign of King <hi>R.</hi> 2. the House of Commons well knowing who was the only donor of them, never fail'd, at the Change &amp; Allowance of every of their Speakers to give him in charge to Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their behalf unto the King for the same, no other Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, being necessary for the aforesaid Imployment.
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:42937:279"/>
Upon the violation of any whereof by any of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Subjects they did so well understand the extent of those their Temporary Peculiar and Limited Priviledges with the obligations of their Oaths of Allegiance and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, and that it neither appertained unto them, nor was or could be in their power to cause or enforce a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter observation thereof, but it was only in the King that granted them, and was to be vouched to warranty, which was in common and ordinary matters very usual in our Laws and reasonable Customs, and therefore to him only as the Grantor and Protector of their Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Priviledges and not to themselves the gratitude and acknowledment was only due.</p>
               <p>And the House of Commons until this our present un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Age or Century did not adventure to take upon themselves, or endeavour by any pretended Authority of their own to punish any the violators of their aforesaid Priviledges, but supplicated Aid of their Kings and Princes that were the donors and granters of them.</p>
               <p>And therefore in the Raign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, it was adjudged, that as the Record witnesseth, <hi>Videtur Cur. quod non.</hi>

               <p>And it was no bad Answer also, that that great and victorious King <hi>Edward</hi> the third (as sick as he was) made likewise unto that other part of their Petition, that Impositions be not laid upon their Woolls without As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Prelates, Dukes, Earls, Barons, and other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Commons of his Realm, That there was a Statute already made which he wills that it shall stand in its force.</p>

<pb n="625" facs="tcp:42937:285"/>
their own protestation, that they neither mean nor can hurt his Praerogative.</hi> And he assured them, <hi>that his maxim was, that the Peoples Liberties strengthen the Kings Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, and that the Kings Praerogative is to defend the Peoples Liberties; they might see how ready he had shewed himself to satisfie their demands, so as he hath done his part, and therefore if that Parliament hath not a happy Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the fault will be theirs he was sure of it.</hi>

               <p>And on the last day of that Session, his Majesty before any Bill signed, spake unto both the Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and told them, <hi>that he owed an accompt of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to none but God alone, that it was well known unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that a while ago the House of Commons gave him a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance how acceptable every man might judge, and for the merit he would not call it in question, for he was sure no wise man could justifie it.</hi>

               <p>For amongst the too many claimed Priviledges to be appertaining to the Members of the House of Commons when they are assembled in Paliament, by vertue only of their Kings and Princes Writs, as hath been before mentioned, there are only these which their Speaker petitioned for, for since the Dream of the men of St. <hi>Albans</hi> in <hi>Anno 8. E.</hi> 2. expounded and managed, as Mr. <hi>William Petitt</hi> could think or imagine for his best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, not knowing where it was run away from him, and not finding it, and the bold Petitions of some of the House of Commons in Parliament, in the second year of the Raign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 5th perceiving that he could get no assurance or confirmation of it, by the Kings Answer thereunto, as their Champion hoped that his Argument might prove as good as that of the good men of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> and smite the Nail on the Head, therefore was enforced when he saw the Kings answer in the same Record to silence it rather than his admirers
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:42937:288"/>
should understand it, and these claims of fancied Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, were so little believed to accord to those their unhappy designs, as there was no more demand or news afterward of them, in all our Kings and Princes Raigns, until the Parliament in the Scottish League and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, with a factious party of our <hi>English</hi> in the years of our Lord 1637, 1638, and 1639. when <hi>Philip Nye</hi> a busy factious Minister and Arch contriver and propagator of Rebellion, and some other special Commissioners were secretly sent from <hi>England,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the intended united Rebellion of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and put the management thereof into a Method, most agreeable to the vizard of their counterfeit Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and at the first a kind of supplicating Rebellion with Petitions and Remonstrances, in their hands, as well as Arms, Amunition, and all other Warlike Offensive and Defensive Provisions.</p>
               <p>And if our English Parliaments had any such Stock of Liberties or Priviledges proper for Members of an House of Commons to demand, it can be no less than a wonder extraordinary, where those invisible Liberties or Priviledges have lurked or lain hid for more than 1000 years ever since Parliaments or Great Councels have been holden or kept in <hi>England,</hi> under our <hi>Brittish, Saxon, Danish</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> Kings, and the long succession of our many Kings and Princes until that horrid long lasting Rebellion that had its rise in the years aforesaid, and with great store of miseries and desolations continued until now, being about 49 years, and that none of the many Speakers (other than Sir <hi>John Tibetot</hi> in the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> 4. which gave occasion to all the Speakers afterwards to crave pardon of the King if they should demand any thing more than was befitting them) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by our Kings, and entrusted by the House of Commons in Parliament in matters of so great weight and concernment as is pretended for the publick good, should so much neglect it since the 21 <hi>E.</hi> 1. or the times since succeeding, as at their admission by our Kings and Princes to demand but two Priviledges, when they ought to have asked very many as their well-willers, but no friends unto either Loyalty or true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, do without any grounds of Reason and Truth desire to have allowed who could hear Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>

give a charge to some of the Speakers to inform the Members of the House of Commons that she would not have them intermedle with matters of Church, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Speakers not to receive any such Bills if they should be offered, and their then learned Speaker Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Coke</hi> durst not adventure to object unto her, his too much at other times adored Fictions and Fables of the <hi>modus tenendi Parliamenta,</hi> and the mirrour of Justice, and a very great misfortune it must needs be to our Kings and Princes especially, that ever since <hi>Jack Cades</hi> Rebellion in the later end of the Raign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth, they should be only troubled with the discords and troubles in their Councels which should be most helpful unto them, which their neighbour Kings and Princes have not met withal in their like Methods and Rules of Government.</p>
               <p>The Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> were commanded to read the Law, which was not then <hi>non-scripta,</hi> often References were made to the Book of the Chronicles.

<pb n="696" facs="tcp:42937:321"/>
was practised in the World, upon the pretence of setting Christ upon his Throne.</p>
               <p>And could not be content, until they had without any cause raised a Rebellion against their pious Prince, and murdered him, forced from the People to maintain those their ungodly doings by Taxes, as much as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted unto 48 Millions of Sterling Money, besides the vast sums of Money and Riches gained by the extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Fines and Compositions from the Kings Loyal Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at Goldsmiths and Haberdasher's Halls in <hi>London,</hi> the one for the 20th part of their Estates, and the other for compounding for their supposed forfeiture for fighting to defend their King against his Rebels, and their Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings, Sequestrations, and Decimations of those with whom they had before compounded besides a Tax for six Months of every House-keeper in <hi>London,</hi> and its vast Lines of Communication for as much as their weekly Diet amounted unto, with Money borrowed upon that which they would call the Publick Faith, which cheat brought that Godless Party into their Repository of the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> in <hi>London</hi> abundance of Money, Plate, Rings, Jewels, Silver Bodkins and Thimbles, many of whom after those villainous Wars and Rebellions something appeased being in Poverty, have been the constant At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders at the House of Commons doors in Parliament, to enquire for <hi>Madam Publick Faith</hi>'s Habitation, but could never be able to find it, and besides all these wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesses, could not think they had done enough, until they had added unto their many sins, that no small sin of Sacriledge, by Sequestring the Orthodox Ministers, Imprisoning of the Bishops, and sale of their and the Deans and Chapters, Prebends and Cannons Lands, and their Woods and Possessions, Banishing and every way Impoverishing them, shutting up all or many of the Church doors in <hi>Wales,</hi> upon pretence of Reforming or Propagating Religion, but gathering the Tithes into their own Purses, sale of the King, Queen and Princes Houses, and Rich Moveables, and of all their Lands and Revenues, the Coats of their Yeomen of the Guard, and the Plate in their Royal Chappels; <hi>Allen</hi> a Goldsmith, and Member of that House of Commons, picking out and exchanging the Jewels out of the Kings Crown, and putting in counterfeit, plundered and sold much of the

Lands and Goods of the Nobility, displaced the Masters of Colledges and Halls in both the Universities, without shewing any cause more than that they would put in another of their own Party, and began to gape, and lick their Lips after a like Reformation of their Lands and Revenues, tore up the Brass upon Monuments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, and made Money of them, because there was inscribed upon them <hi>Orate pro nobis,</hi> and broke those Glass windows that had any Pictures or Images in them, for fear of Superstition, made a Stable for Horses in the Cathedral of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> where heaps of dung might be as high as the Roof, and Sawyers seen sawing in the Grave where the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> was buried that obtained the City of <hi>Londons</hi> Charter of their Liberties from <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror for which their more grateful Successive Mayors and Aldermen, at great solemnities never failed at their coming to that Cathedral in a kind of Procession to walk about it.</p>
               <p>And the Othodox Clergy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> calumniated by Mr. <hi>John White</hi> a Lawyer of the late se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Edition, who being a Chairman appointed by a Committee of Parliament, to relieve those that they would call plundered Ministers, being the Factious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichurch party, did so order the matter, as to put out all the Orthodox Ministers, and taking his Notes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations in Characters, was able to interpret them how he pleased, and upon the Accusation of a Cobler at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> that the Learned Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> had Preached false Doctrine, he must be turned out of his Benefice, and imprisoned at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> wherein besides many other, if not all, he or his Notes were shrewdly mistaken, when one Mr. <hi>Clopham</hi> a Minister was for Adultery Ejected, when it was proved that by a fall from his Horse, he was so disabled in his Genitals as he could not be guilty of it.</p>
               <p>And the Ecclesiastical plunder Masters were to take a more than ordinary care, that when their small com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassion had been pleased to allow the Sequestred Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters Wives and Children a 5th part of their Husbands Benefices, that they should have as little, and as hardly as could be of it, when after they had tired themselves with their Petitions to the upper and lower Committees, they had obtained an Order for that their small pittance
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:42937:322" rendition="simple:additions"/>
found no other comfort, after that they had travelled forty or fifty, or more miles unto one that should pay it, then one who being more merciful and candid than the rest was pleased to shew a small common or private almost invisible note or mark in the Order that they should not obey it.</p>
               <p>Mean while about 100 of Sequestred Ministers of the West parts of <hi>England</hi> could have no better a place pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them than to be imprisoned at <hi>Lambeth</hi> House, but a little before notoriously infected with the Plague, and ordered an Alderman of <hi>London,</hi> whose Son is yet living to attend them with two Culverings or small pieces of Cannon ready charged to fire upon them, as they were in the Chappel serving God, and hearing Doctor <hi>Featly</hi> preach unto them, where they had perished if God had not in mercy provided an escape for them.</p>
               <p>And if this were or could be proved or justified to be a work for such a third Estate, as that <hi>modus tenendi Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentum</hi> was so willing to provide for our Laws, having in their Subordination to Gods Laws, and not opposite unto them been truly believed, and said to have been derived from Right Reason, yet that is always to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to be so, when it hath received the Sanction of the King, and are not agitated by the various wills, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest and fancies of the People next unto madness.</p>
               <p>And it might amuse and amaze all the men of Law and Learning in the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> how Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Coke</hi> that hath been attempted to be a man of so great knowledge and experience in the Law, and entrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with so many weighty Charges and Offices in our Laws, as Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, and afterwards of the Court of Kings Bench, and so great a Collector and Remembrancer of the cases and judgments in the Law, with their various forms and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries should have so often read in his so greatly beloved Book of <hi>Littleton,</hi> the Chapters of <hi>Homage,</hi> and <hi>Homage Auncestrel,</hi> and <hi>Escuage</hi> assessed in our Parliaments, could think it to be the Common Law of <hi>England,</hi> and that by which it had for many Centuries past been Governed, and not to be by its true and original Name and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well here as in all the other parts of the Christian World the Feudal Law, and what else where those Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal Laws used in <hi>England,</hi> which our Learned Sir <hi>Henry

And if those premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses cannot be enough to satisfy us, Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> if he were alive, might do well to instruct us what Law that Homage and Escuage appertained unto. And if there were any other Laws that this Kingdom was governed by when and by whom they were introduced, and of how long continuance, for it may be hoped that our Sons of Novelty will not be so impudent as to offer to obtrude upon the World the Follies and Villanies of <hi>Wat Tiler</hi> and <hi>Jack Cade,</hi> our late pretended <hi>Rebuplicans</hi> or their cheating Instrument maker <hi>Oliver Cromwel.</hi> Or upon what other Laws than Feudal are our <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and <hi>Charta de Foresta</hi> supported, and as often as thirty times in several of our Parliaments confirmed, when all our many English Rebellions, troubles of State and Commotions either at home at abroad have left it as a <hi>quiddam Sacrum</hi> more than the safe guarded <hi>vestal fire</hi> amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> or can shew us in any of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, Annals or holy Writ, wrested or misinterpreted, that the <hi>Dernier Resort</hi> or Appeal hath been or ought to be in the people, unless they can make themselves or any others believe that there was something or more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to them than was in the <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> for there was no third <hi>Estate</hi> under our Kings to assist their Councels in Parliaments subordinate unto them put upon them, nor intended to be by the 25 <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servators</hi> enforced upon King <hi>John</hi> in the Rebellious Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and Battle at <hi>Running Mede,</hi> afterwards reduced to four, or when their Captain General <hi>Robert Fitz-Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was stiled <hi>Mariscallus Exercitus dei &amp; Ecclesiae Angli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canae,</hi> neither in <hi>Anno 42.

                  <pb n="700" facs="tcp:42937:323"/>
or in that after Rebellion and detaining King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3 and prince <hi>Edward</hi> his Son about a year and a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they would not adventure to form or imitate a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councel in that captive Kings name, those few that came were not called or intended to be a 3 <hi>Estate</hi> in an House of Commons nor in any of the many Rescripts or <hi>Mandates</hi> which <hi>Symon Montfort</hi> and his partner Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels made in their Captive Kings name nor in any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament after his Release or in the Parliament of King <hi>Edward</hi> the first when he was pleased to suffer some of the Commons Elected by his Writs to attend in the House of Commons in Parliament, neither had they the boldness in all his long Raign of 35 years, or in the 17, or 18 years of King <hi>Edward</hi> the second, or the fifty one years of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, or in the Raign of King <hi>Richard</hi> the 2 until the Title of Estates crept in as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, and Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> made himself after the Creator of them in his misused rectifying.</p>
               <p>And having as they thought turned the Tables the wrong way in calling our Feudal Laws the Common Laws, which indeed they are, should be, and a long time have been have so far put them out of their Right place, Order and Station, as they think they have changed our Feudal Laws which are &amp; should be the only Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom and Government thereof into a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and too many of our Lawyers have been so willing to forget them, as they had rather now of late make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve if they could the tricks of Attorneys to be our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Laws, than our more Ancient, Legal, Rational and Fundamental Feudal Laws; Insomuch that one, that thinks himself no small one, hath of late been pleased to say very considerately as he thought, that the Study and Knowledge of Antiquities was but like the picking up of Old Iron in the <hi>London</hi> Streets or Kennels.
