            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>
         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I would not impose ought upon thee, but lovingly advice thee, not rashly to conclude, that all such things as thou understand'st not, are falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: Let not the Calumnies that our Author is aspersed withal affrighten thee; for what man ever detected the Fallacies and destructive Cheats of imperious disdainful men, but was thus reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and yet the bitterest of his Enemies must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Cures he performed were very great, yea, on such as themselves durst not visit. But we will leave them as they are, Hurtful to themselves, and Unprofitable to the Generation they live in: The <hi>Archidoxis</hi> discovers the making of <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nums, Magisteries, Elixirs, Quintessences, Tinctures, &amp;c.</hi> the Tenth Book whereof hath been Enviously supprest till now of late, It being a Recapitulation and Explanation of the Precedent Nine; both it and all the rest following are choice Treatises, and can speak more for themselves then I am disposed to do. Thou must not think that a bare Study will render thee a Master of such no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table things as are therein contained; If thou disdained to do as the Author hath done, thou hast no great reason to expect any Benefit from his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;

                     <head>Of the mystery of the Microcosme.</head>
                     <p>IF we consider our misery, most dear Sons! and that our abode is in a grievous habitation, and obscure Cottage, subject to hunger and to a very very many various accidents, with which we are on every side Overwhelmed, as it were, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed; We find that we cannot at all flourish, no, nor scarce live, as long as we have imitated or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Medicine and Physick prescribed unto us by the Ancients; for we were often times assailed with many bitter Calamities and Conditions, and detained or imprisoned with terrible, cruel Chains, &amp; all things daily become worse &amp; worse unto us, and to exceeding many others that are in an equal ballance with us, and are our contemporaries, whom the Ancients could not hitherto assist or help by their Books, no not in the least. We forbear to reckon up in this place the various causes of this evil; Onely, we say thus much, that most of our Doctors have gotten abundance of Riches by that way of the Ancient Writers, but have neither purchaced, nor indeed deserved the smallest portion of praise and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57672:6"/>
honour thereby, but have gotten so much wealth by meere lyes; The which when I considered, I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to compose &amp; set down this work as my memorial, that so we might attain to a more prosperous &amp; nobler practise, wherein we shall meet with such mysteries of nature as are admirable, and more then ban be ever found out. It will therefore be worthy our considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how and in what manner the Art it selfe agrees with the mysteries of nature; against such as could not in the least arrive unto the Art hitherto.</p>
                     <p>The virtues of the mystery of Nature are impeaded or captivated as it were in their bodies, just as a man that is kept in prison, in bonds and setters, whose minde notwithstanding is free. For this mystery in its works, is like to a certain fire in green wood, that would sain burn, but cannot by reason of the moysture.</p>
                     <p>Since therefore the hindrance that impeads it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from those things, it seems expedient, to have it freed there-from; which being free and at liberty, this Art of Separations may then be compared to the Art of the Apothecary, just as the light may be compared to darknesse. And this we do not speak of arrogantly, but on this account, because those exceeding great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses and compositions that are made in the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries shops, and instituted by Physicians, do very much displease us. And therefore it is not causelesly that we call them by the name of darknesse, and dens of thieves and Impostours; for such onely, for the most part, as have mony are undertook to be cured by the ignorant men, whereas if they have it not, then presently even at the first dash shall they be pronounced sound; For they, <hi>viz.</hi> these Doctors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do full well'know that all their consultations produce not any helpful remedy.</p>
                     <p>Whereas therefore, that it both is and may deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly be called an Art, which reacheth the mysteries of nature, as for example, to cure a contracture by a Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57672:6"/>
and to heale that (in the space of four dayes) which would otherwise abide even untill death; Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to bring a wound to the end of its cure in xxiv. hours, which could not be accomplished by bodies in so many dayes. And now we will at length cheerfully set about the separation of the mysteries of Nature, from the Impediments and Fetters of their bodies, and this by experience.</p>
                     <p>Therefore first of all it is to be considered, what is the most profitable thing of all, and the most excellent for a man to learn. It is to know the mysteries of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the which he may exactly consider what God is, and also what man is, and how prevalent and useful the knowledge of them is, both as to the heavenly Eternity and Terrestrial infirmity. Out of which two, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Theology, Justice and Truth doth very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently spring forth. Moreover, the mysteries of Nature onely are the life of men; and such mysteries are to be imitated &amp; followed as may be known by, and obtained from God who is the eternal Good. For albeit, that there are to be found certain admirable things in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, &amp; also in the mysteries of Nature, far greater things; yet neverthelesse, as to that Eternall Mystery, after this life, concerning both of what, how and whence it is, we have no other foundation or ground thereof then what is manifested unto us by Christ himself: Hence therefore doth arise that ignorant stupidity and sottish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of those Theologists and Divines that attempt to draw out as it were and demonstrate the interpretations of the mysteries of God, whenas they understand not the least tittle thereof; for we men cannot at all finde out what the will and pleasure of him is that gave it, or declared it. But verily they wrest his Word for pride and covetousnesse sake, from whence do proceed so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny seductions, and do daily prevail more &amp; more, as we have demonstrated in our <hi>Monarchiâ.</hi> On this account
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57672:7"/>
therefore we do disesteem, yea not at all value that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or phantasie that hath not the least foundation in the mysteries visibly. In like manner the Jurists, or Lawyers do patch up Laws according to their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, yet so, that though the benefit of the Common-Wealth be wholly tossed as it were in danger, they'l be sure that themselves will lose nothing.</p>
                     <p>Seeing therefore that in these faculties and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, there are so many vain transactions practised, without the Rule of equity, we shall leave them till their proper time. Nor will we at all heed the foolish pratings of such as talk more things concerning God, then he hath made known unto them, and would sain understand him, just as if they had been of his Counsel; and (in the mean time) do vilifie us, and detract from the mysteries of Nature and of Phylosophy, when as they are wholly ignorant of them all. The chiefest knowledge that these men have, is a wicked impudent noise and roaring, whereby they presume that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are the men upon whom faith intirely depends, and that were it not for them, the Heaven and the earth would perish. O! the sury and madnesse of men, and their most great cheating and deceiving! whom it would much better become to account themselves as unprofitable servants, and as none at all. Now albeit that even we our selves may by use, in our imitating of these men, easily learn together with them to wrest the word of our Teacher &amp; only Creator unto our own pride, yet notwithstanding, seeing that we have not an exact knowledge of the Word, but it is to be laid hold on by faith onely, and is not established by any earthly reason how specious soever it be; Let us cast off this burthen or rather yoke of their reasoning, and search after the mysteries of Nature, in which mysteries the end or issue proves and confirms the foundation or way of truth, let us seek after not onely those mystries, but such also
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57672:7"/>
as teach us to accomplish the highest Charity. And this is that treasure of the chiefest good, <hi>viz.</hi> the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial part, which we do understand and mean in the writing of our <hi>Archidoxis,</hi> and as for the spirituall part, we will refer that to our <hi>Monarchiâ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How out of the aforesaid bassis and foundation have we experimentally drawn our Medicine, whereby wee are made certain, and do occularly behold that the thing is truly so. To come therefore to the Practick part, we will divide this our Book of <hi>Archidoxis</hi> into ten parts; that it may be a kind of assistance for our memory, that we may not forget it; and withall we will speak so openly, that we may be understood by our Sons, but not by the vulgar; for we will not at all thrust the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of these things upon such, so easily. We will not disclose our minde, thoughts and heart to those deaf ears, nor to wicked men, but will studiously en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to shut up our <hi>Arcanums</hi> from those with a strong wall and key. And for fear least this our labour should not be secure enough from those Ideots that are enemies to all true Arts, we shall wholly refrain from writing the tenth Book concerning the use and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the things preceding it. that so we may not cast the childrens bread to dogges. Yet neverthelesse such as are our Sons will abundantly enough understand the other nine.</p>
                     <p>And that we may speak more openly of these Arts, you are to know in this Treatise of the <hi>Microcosme,</hi> that therein is an approved demonstration of each things, both of such as it contains, and such as receive or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Medicine, &amp; also of such things as be permixed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Likewise it viz. the <hi>Microcosm</hi> is conquered and governed by Medicine and so follows it, just as an horse bridled follows him that leads him; Or like a mad dog tyed with chains. Thus on this wise do I understand Medicine to attract and draw on nature and every living
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57672:8"/>
thing. Now in this we do meet with three things, which demonstrate unto us the virtues and powers whereby such things are to be compleatly done. As</p>
                     <p>First of all, by what means the five Senses shall bee helped by the mysteries of Nature, when as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not from Nature, nor have a natural rise or birth, as any herb hath out of its own seed: but there's no matter which may produce them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The mobility of the body must be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered also, as from whence it proceeds, and by what it is moved and stirred, and by what means it is to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. Thirdly, There must be a knowledge of the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of all the powers in the body, and what things they are that have an agreement with each member, and are to be transmuted according to the nature of those members, whereas notwithstanding they are at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning one onely nature.</p>
                     <p>First of all therefore we will speak of these; of See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Hearing, Touching, Tasting and Smelling: You may take this teaching example. The Eyes have a matter of which they consist, as is mentioned in the composition of the body, so also have the other Senses. But now the sight it self is not out of that seed of which the eye proceeds, nor the hearing or tone out of that of which the Ears are made, nor proceeds the Touch from the flesh, nor the Taste out of the Tongue, nor the Smell from the nostrills, no more then Reason proceeds from the brain, but these are bodily Organs or rather coffers in which the senses are generated. Neither are we to understand that these Senses have their dependance upon the grace and pleasure of the Creator, in such wise as not to be of the nature of man, but only infused by the grace of God supernaturally, to this end that the great wonders of God may (if at any time a man be born blind) be made known unto us. We are not to conceive of it thus in this place; for the aforesaid senses have their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57672:8"/>
proper insensible and impalpable body, even as on the contrary the other part of the body is tangible, for every man is composed of two, <hi>viz.</hi> of a materiall, and of a spirituall body. The materiality gives body, bloud and flesh; But the spirituality gives hearing, seeing smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, touching and tasting. So then, if one be born deaf, it proceeds from the defect of that mansion place in which the hearing is to abide. For the spirituall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy doth not perfect its operation in an ill disposed place; the cause of which we set down in the book of the generations of men. In this therefore are the great wonders of God to be known, that there are two bodies, <hi>viz.</hi> an Eternall and a Corporal, couched and concluded in one, as is also manifested in the book of the Generation of man. Now Medicine works upon the house and cleanseth it, whereby the spirituall body is able to perfect its proper actions therein, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then as Civet in a clean and an undefiled case.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Now let us proceed to the motive faculty of the body, and enquire whence it is, and how it hath its Original, <hi>viz.</hi> what or how the body unites its self to the medicine, whereby the motive vertue is encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. You are to understand it thus; Every thing that lives hath its motion from nature. This is sufficiently enough proved <hi>per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>se,</hi> as concerning natural motion. But now that motion which we imagine and make thereby is to be declared, as viz, how it comes to passe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our will and intention, as for example, if I would lift up my Arm, it may be demanded, by what vertue or power I do it, for I see no Organ whereby to move it so, but that thus it is done according as was my desire to do. And so of walking, leaping, running, and such like actions, which are made contrary unto and besides the motion of nature, for nothing of such actions is a peculiar product of Nature, but is made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally. These kinde of motions have their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57672:9"/>
thus, <hi>viz.</hi> the powerful Mistresse <hi>Intention</hi> is above my motion natural, <hi>viz.</hi> on this wise. The Intention or Imagination kindleth the vegetative virtue, as fire kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles wood, &amp;c. as we have written in our Treatise pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly of Imagination. Now it is not able to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish its operations more potently in any kinde of body then in its own proper body, in which it both is and lives. Likewise in every body there is nothing more easie to be kindled then the vegetative Soul, because that She runs and walks by her self, and is disposed hereunto; for even as a fire that is covered over and buried, doth, as soon as it is made bare and hath an accesse of ayre, burn up; even so likewise doth my phantasie apply and bend it self to the seeing of any thing. I cannot direct my eyes with my hands whether I please and would, but my Imagination converts them to whatsoever it likes me to behold. So also is it as to my journeying; for, if I have a desire of going any where, and do thus propose to my self according as seemeth me good, then is my body directed to this or that place thus intended by me. And by how much the more it shall have been imprinted in my Imagination and thoughts, so much the speedier do I run. So then its evident that Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination is the mover of my course. Even after the same manner is it, that medicine doth mundifie bodies, in whom is a spirituality, from whence it comes to pass that that motion is performed the more easily.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Is to be understood, the distribution that is made in the body unto all the members, out of all such things as are presented unto it either without or within. In that distribution is made a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, whereby the things are so changed, that one part serves for the complexion of the heart, another part is accommodated to the nature of the brain: and so likewise is it with the rest. Now, the body attracts unto its self two manner of wayes, viz. internally and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57672:9"/>
externally; Internally, it attracts whatsoever is taken in by the mouth. Externally, it attracteth the air, earth, water and fire; Thus therefore is the businesse to be constituted and defined, viz. Those things that are received inwardly, are not so necessary to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; for that they are to be known by the foundation of nature, (viz. these) which are distributed thus, as we shall speak anon concerning the division. But out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly you are to understand it thus, that the body doth attract through the whole skin from the four ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal elements, what is necessary for it; which if it should not do, the internal nutriment would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for a mans support; and because that moisture is so very existent in the body by custome, the same body extracts it out of the Element water, and so it comes to passe, that as long as one shall sit or stand therein, he needs not any other quenching of his thirst. Now this proceeds not from the waters extinguishing the heat as it quencheth fire, but the internal heat attracts the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal moisture to it self, &amp; drinks it just as if it were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken inwardly; hence tis that the Cows are able to abide in the Alps without drink an whole Summer, for the air is as a drink to them and supplies the place and office thereof; The same may be concluded of as to a man.</p>
                     <p>Moreover the nature of a man may be sustained also without food, if he be set or planted with his feet in the earth. So have we seen a man that lived six moneths without food, and was sustained onely by wearing a piece, or clod of earth upon his' stomack; the which being dry, he now and then took a new fresh clod; he affirmed that during all that time he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hungry: the cause of which thing we shew in the book of the Appetite of Nature.</p>
                     <p>So likewise have we seen a man that sustained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for many years by a medicine, viz. by the quinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of gold, and scarce took half a scruple thereof
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57672:10"/>
each day, Hence likewise or after this manner, have there been many others that have eaten nothing for many years, viz. xx years, such I remember I have seen in my time. Some do attribute this kind of living to the goodness and piety of the persons, and some also im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to God, the which we do not in the least desire to gainsay or judg of; yet however this thing is even na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for sadness, melancholy and fainting, or grief of the mind do take away both hunger and thurst; so that by the attraction of the body, to wit, self, it is able to sustain it for many years; for as much as food and drink are not so ordained or appointed, as that we must of necessity eat flesh or bread, and drink wine or water, but also we may sustain our life with the air and with clods of earth; and we are to believe that whatsoever is ordained for food was made that we might try and taste it, the which we shall declare more at large in our book of the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of God; Albeit we grant thus much, that because of our labours and such like, we cannot want temporal and corporal food, and that for very many causes, and therefore food was ordained for this body, as medicine was against diseases; Now therefore as to the distinction of things which enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the body, observe it thus, that they are distributed throughout all the parts of the body, no otherwise then as if <hi>vinum ardens</hi> or burning spirit were poured into water, thereby making it all of the same odour, because it is defused throughout the whole body thereof; In like manner if ink be put into wine, all of it will be rendred black thereby. Even thus is it in the body of man, the humidity and moisture of life doth presently defuse such things as are received in, and that sooner and speedier then what we have proposed unto you by these examples; but as to the form that the substance thus took in, is transmuted into, the nature of this consisteth onely in the members which receive it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57672:10"/>
and digest it into their own likenesse, no otherwise then as when bread, if conveyed into a man, is made mans-flesh, and if into a fish tis made fish, &amp;c. Thus in like manner is it to be understood of the things that are taken in, they are transmuted by the virtues of the nature of the members, and become appropriated to the nature of the parts receiving them. The same is likewise to be understood of medicines, viz. that they are transmuted into the members according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties of them members, for they receive their strength and virtues from the proper substances of the medicines according to either the good or evil, the subtile or gross dispersing thereof, according as the quality of the medicine shall be, as for example; if it be of a quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence, the transmutation of it will be more strong and potent; but if it be a grosse medicine, such also it remains, even as an Image or picture that hath its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament from the colours as to fairnesse and deformity, the which colours if noble, such also will the picture be; So therefore that we may collect our experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in those like things which we have met withall, and may as it were, heap them up together for our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy and better remembrance, that so we may have them in a readinesse when wee need them; we will write down these nine Books, but as for the tenth, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that close in my brain, because of the ungrateful Ideots; but yet notwithstanding in these 9 is enough declared to our Sons; and let no body admire and so much wonder at the teaching of my Doctrine, for though it be contrary to the courses and methods of the Ancients; yet notwithstanding, it is most firmly founded upon experience which is the mistresse of all things, and by which also ought all arts to be proved.</p>

                     <head>Of the Separation of the Elements.</head>
                     <p>BEfore we set about the Declaration of the Separation of Elements, there are some things which we shall explain (seeing that the things written of the Generation of things are not so very consonant with the Separations of the Elements) for the better and clearer understanding of that same Separation; for every thing is brought to its end and issue, the more conveniently, where a mature intelligent consideration, as to what the event will be, precedes; For verily, thereby the practick becomes the clearer. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore say that the four Elements exist together in all things, out of which doth arise to every one its Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinated state.</p>
                     <p>But now by what means those four Elements, so mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually contrary among themselves, are able to agree and abide together, without the destruction of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: you are to understand it thus, Whereas the mixion of the Elements is in and by predestination, so united and corroborated, the case stands thus; there is no weight to be accounted in them, but the ruling power of one of them is greater in things then anothers
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57672:12"/>
power is, by which is to be understood that in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesting or disposition and ferment of the predestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the strongest element will bear rule, and overcome and subject the others. By which means the other three elements cannot in the least attain their perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but are in relation to that perfect element, as the light or sappy matter in wood is to the firm timber; therefore also they are not to be called Elements, for as much as they are not all of them perfect, but one onely is so; when we speak therefore of the four elements wch finally are in all things, we are not to understand it so precisely, that in them the four Elements are perfect; but there is but one onely finished or accomplished e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement in things; the other Elements remaining imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, by reason of the virtues and puissance of the chief excelling element; hence it comes to passe, that they can thus accord and consist together, because that there is no perfection in three of them, upon which account also neither can there be any corruption by the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties to bear rule. Moreover, that an element is predominant in one kind, tis because tis hereunto pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated, and therefore no corruption nor permixion can adhere to them, as we mention it in the book of Generations; whereas therefore there is onely one ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in every thing particularly, it is needlesse to seek for four elements in things, there being three of them not posited in perfection briefly and finally; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must understand that the four elements are in all things, but not four complexions actually, the case stands thus; a substance or matter contains the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment water, and then it is nenusar or water lilly; there is not in it besides this element, neither earth, nor air, nor fire; likewise, there is not in it any likenesse of heat, or drynesse, for it hath no peculiar operation, but the predestination thereof is water, and is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly element of water, under which is neither drynesse
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57672:12"/>
nor heat, according to its affianced nature. But yet although all these things are thus, yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other three elements are in it, but the creatures have not their rise out of those three elements which are not brought forth as it were perfect, nor have they their beginning or help and assistance from them, but out of the predestinated element which is united to, and impressed in that stock and kind.</p>
                     <p>And albeit, that this squares not with the Common Philosophy, viz. that the one predestinated element hath of its own nature the other three elements adhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto it self, yet notwithstanding it is to be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the element, and substance, or matter, are different from each other. The which is to be thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood. The substance or matter is not from that element which tingeth and elementateth the substance; neither also are these elements from the substance, but they have an equal like agreement as the body and soul have. But now each body, as for example, The body of some growing thing hath its Complexion, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise its element. Although the element it self is not visible in the growing body, nor is it tangible or demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strable, and that for this reason, because this element is by reason of its subtilty more strong, and subjects the other elements of the growing body. And yet all of them are in the body, but imperceptibly, like as when water is permixed with vinegar, it becomes like unto it; and although the vinegar shall have changed all in the essence thereof, yet neverthelesse the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of the water remains incorrupt; nor is it vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, for that cause, but is as much water as afore: And although it puts not forth the virtues of water as afore; yet it doth not therefore follow, but that it hath them still.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore, by these propositions we are willing to declare by what way the Separations of the Elements
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57672:13"/>
are to be made; and here shall we meet with two Practicks that require our understanding. One is that which the Separation of the Predestinated Element a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth unto, and this we will declare in the book of the <hi>Quintessence.</hi> The other is that which the four Substantial Elements that exist in growing things, apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto. By this we are to understand, that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated Element is the Quintessence, nor is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make a separation of the one from the other, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it may be made from the other three Elements, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes hereunder, concerning the Quintessence. But where we speak of the Separations of the four Elements, we mean those four which are essentially in a body, from hence hath risen so many various errours, because that men have sought after the four Elements, and also the Quintessence in the Predestinated Element, the which cannot possibly be.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, you must also know, that when the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of bodies are not to be separated, so that one may be Fire, another Water, and another like to Ayre, and the fourth to Earth, according to their Complexions. That sometimes the Elements appear with their forms, sometimes with their Complexions, as the water like water, the ayre like ayre, the earth like earth, and the fire like fire. These are to be subtilly understood, and may then at length well be done by a similitude, if they are taken for the union of the Elements, not visibly or actually, neither according to the nature of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of fire, but as an hot and dry Complexion, like fire. On this manner hath every Element its nature, essence and condition attributed to it; the propriety remaining incorrupt; for it is not to be supposed, that because some hearb is most hot, as a nettle, it doth therefore contain in it self the more fire; no, but it is rather to be accounted thus, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Quintessence of it is more hot, then the Quintessence of Chamomill,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57672:13"/>
the which latter hath a lesser heat. But the Elements of the body do receive either lesse or more, from their own substance or matter; even as wood contains in it self more fire then hearbs do. Likewise stones have in them more of dryness and earth than Rozins have.</p>
                     <p>In like manner also note, that the mulittude and quantity of the degree in the Quintessence, doth arise from the Predestinated Element, and the intension or exaltation of the degree of the Corporal Elements, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth from the Species, or shape of the substance, which is unlike.</p>
                     <p>But as to the Practick of the Separation of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Elements from all the other things, Observe that it is twofold; One way teacheth to extract the Three Elements from the Pure Elements, as from the <hi>burning</hi> Fire, from the <hi>invisible</hi> Air, from the <hi>true</hi> Earth, and likewise from the <hi>natural</hi> Water; the which Elements have not such a like Original as the precedent Elements have: The other way is of them, of <hi>(alias</hi> in) which those Four do exist, as we said afore, but yet with this difference, <hi>viz.</hi> That this exhibits more of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Fire, Water, Earth, or Air, with the similitude of the Form of the essential Elements. When they shall be separated after this manner, they can never be any more dissolved, <hi>viz.</hi> So as for the Complexions to be corrupted or altered any further; <hi>(alias, So as to be eradicated out of their Complexions.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis also to be considered, That the Elements by Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, are found to be, formally, of the likeness of essential Elements: for the Air appears like Air, that cannot at all be shut in, (which some falsly think) and that for this cause, because it presently exalts it self in the moment of Separation, and the Wind doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time break forth, and ascends upward with the Water, sometimes with the Earth, and other while with the Fire: For verily the exaltation, or elevation in the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57672:14"/>
Air, is very much wonderful, like as if the Air were to be separated from the essential Element of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is to be done by boyling; the which beginning to boyl, the Air is forthwith separated from the Water, and carries with it the most light substance of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and by how much the Water is lessened, so much also is the Air diminished according to its proportion and quantity.</p>
                     <p>There ore it is to be be noted here, That no Element can be conceived or had without Air, although any of them may be had without another; wherefore we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake not the burden of Separating the Air apart, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is in the other three, as the life is in the body; for when it is separated from the body, they all perish: as we clearly teach in the following Practick of <hi>Separations.</hi> In this place, there are Four wayes must be considered; One way, is in Watery bodies, that is, in Herbs, which have more of Water, than of any of the other Elements. The Second is in fiery bodies; such are Woods, Rozins, Oyls, Roots, &amp;c. which contain in themselves more of the fiery substance, than of the others. The Third is to be understood of Earthy bodies, such as are Stones, Clayes, and Earths; but the Fourth is of Aierial: and this is in all the other three, as we mentioned above. In like manner also are there so many Wayes to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of, as to the pure Elements, after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as is said afore, of the Four fore-going.</p>
                     <p>Hence then is it easie to be known what the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are, and how to be separated; amongst which, the separations of the Elements from Metals come first, to be considered of; in which <hi>Elements</hi> there are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Predestinated virtues, which are lacking in the other Elements, <hi>(alias, which are forced out of the other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;)</hi> for although all the Elements are alike in the form, <hi>viz.</hi> in Heat, Coldness, Moisture, and Dryness; yet notwithstanding the Drynesse or Moisture, &amp;c. the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57672:14"/>
Heat and Coldnesse are not the same in one thing as in another; for in some it is Appropriative; but in other-some it is Specifick; by various wayes after this manner, according as in every kind they are each of them natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated peculiarly and essentially, for there's no kind of the Elements like to another in virtues</p>
                     <p>Thus also are we to conceive concerning the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Marcasites,</hi> the which do likewise differ from the others in the Practick, and Elemental Nature; for every kind, or Lineage, is posited in a peculiar Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and must be practised with, in a particular way; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards we will speak of Gems, and Stones, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate their Elements, for they appear not at all like the others.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, <hi>Salts</hi> are of a peculiar and most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent nature, and of more properties then are perceived to be in the others: There is also a diverse essence in Herbs, which have no manner of agreement with the Minerals themselves; nor indeed can they be alike, as to what belongs unto their nature Likewise, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of Woods, Fruits, Barks, and such-like is singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; also the property of Flesh, Drink, and all <hi>edible</hi> Food, and of things not good and clean, but evil and impure, which are to be separated into Elements.</p>
                     <p>There are Two wayes found to be, of that Separation which we mean; One whereof is, the Separation of each Element shut-in by it self, into a peculiar Vessel without the corrupting, or losing of its virtues, the Air excepted. The other way is of the Separation of the pure from the impure, in the Four Elements, <hi>viz.</hi> after this manner: After that the Elements are separated <hi>viz.</hi> the one from the other, they have as yet a grosse substance; for which cause there follows another sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of those same Separated Elements; we will therefore declare the Practick of them all, for 'tis to be known in the first place, that the Quintessence of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57672:15"/>
things is to be separated &amp; extracted this way, because truly the Elements drawn out of bodies, in the nature of Quintessence, are not subjected, but are left with it. Therefore it is able to tinge the Elements, either stronger or weaker; which is to be understood thus, That the vigorousness do not (because of this) perish from the Elements when the Predestinated Element, that is, the Quintessence, is extracted; for it is it self likewise Elemental and Separable, as to the Elemental form, but not as to the differing natures, as is evident in the Discourse of the <hi>Quintessence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By these like Separations, all Elemental Infirmities may be cured, by one simple Quintessence, <hi>viz,</hi> after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; If those Predestinations fight against these infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as we set down more largely in the Discourse of <hi>Predestinations.</hi> By these things therefore thus spoken, we have sufficiently enough disclosed the beginning of the Separations, and therefore let us now hasten on to the Practick part of them; the variety whereof is <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold:</hi> One is of <hi>Metals,</hi> a Second of <hi>Marcasites,</hi> a Third of <hi>Stones,</hi> a Fourth of <hi>Oleaginous things,</hi> a Fifth of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zins,</hi> a Sixth of <hi>Herbs,</hi> a Seventh of <hi>Flesh,</hi> an Eighth of <hi>Juyces,</hi> a Ninth of <hi>Vitrified things,</hi> and the Tenth of <hi>Fix things:</hi> And now, as to those Separations of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments there are three wayes thereof, One by <hi>Distillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> a Second by <hi>Calcinations,</hi> and the Third by <hi>Sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> To this do belong all the exercises, as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of the hands to the Fire, and Labouring, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther necessaries, which shall be set down in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Separations.</p>

                        <p>But yet note, that, not all the Metals are thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into an Oyl, but such as have been afore prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: as for example, <hi>Mercury</hi> is to be sublimed; <hi>Saturn</hi> to be calcined; <hi>Venus</hi> to be florified, or reduced into <hi>

Afterwards ad to one part of this Oyl two parts of new Aquafortis, and being well shut in together in the best glasse, set it in horse dung for a moneth, then destil it wholly off with a gentle fire, that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be coagulated in the bottom.

but is adherent and concurrent with the others, and is inseparable from them.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, 'tis to be noted, that, that remainder, that is, the corporeal Element, which remained in the bottom, must be reduced by a <hi>B</hi> into an Oyl, with fresh <hi>Aquafortis;</hi> and so this Element will be perfected, the which thou shalt keep for one Part The rest thou shalt Separate by a <hi>B.</hi> on this wise; Put them in Sand, and Urge them gently; then first of all, the Water will be elevated, and will come forth; then after that the Fire, for you will know by the Colour where those two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.

But if it be the Earth and Fire, then the Earth is elevated first, and the Fire afterward. But if the Water, Fire, and Earth should be together, then the Water will ascend first, the Fire next, and last of all the Earth. These Elements may be so kept in peculiar Glasses, each of them according to its nature: as for example, in <hi>Sol,</hi> the Hot and Dry, without any other property.

Take Sage, and beat or bruise the leaves thereof, and afterwards set it in putrefaction, as is said afore, then destill it by an horse-belly, and the Element of fire will ascend first, So long until the Colours, and the thicknesse of the water be changed; afterwards the earth will succeed, and some part of it likewise will remain in the Bottom, the which part is indeed fix.

                     <p>THE Separation of the Elements from Fleshly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and such as live with blood, is to be thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, that the Predominant Element in them, is to be perceived more abundantly, and chiefly at the last of all; as the Principal Element in Fishes is Water, in Worms fire; likewise in Fleshly Bodies that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestible, and such as we usually eat, is Air, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our discourse in the Treatise of <hi>the Generation of Animals.</hi>

Thus the whole substance of the Fishes is Separated into the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements; Here need not any consideration of their fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and marrow, but it is to be supposed, that every thing is Separated by putrefaction, and divided into their Elements. In like manner is it to be understood of Worms, except that from them there comes not

onely Water, but more of fire, unlesse they be aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or watery Worms; as Serpents, in the destillation of which there are many things obvious, and things more wonderful then can be spoken, after the same manner is it to be understood of commestible Animals, which do also peculiarly disclose their Elements by Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>

                     <p>WE have formerly mentioned the Quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence that is in all things; now we are (here in the beginning of this Treatise) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what it is; The Quintessence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is a certain matter Corporally extracted out of all the things, which Nature hath produced; and also out of every thing that hath a life in its self, and is separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from all impurities and Mortality, is most subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mundified, and likewise Separated from all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements; from hence it is evident, that the Quintessence is as if it were the Nature, Power, Virtue and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, shut up and imprisoned heretofore in things, but is now free from its dwelling place and extraneous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation; the same Q <hi>E.</hi> is the Colour, Life, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie of things; tis a Spirit like the Spirit of life, with this difference, that the spirit of the Life of a thing is permanent, but of man mortal; from whence may be understood, that a Quintessence cannot be extracted
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57672:23"/>
from the flesh or bloud of a man; and that for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, because the Spirit of Life, which also is the Spirit of Virtues, dies, and the life exists in the <hi>Soul,</hi> which then afterwards is not in the substance. By the same reason also, even the <hi>Animals,</hi> because they lose their Spirit of Life, are therefore wholly mortal, and afford no Quintessence; for the Quintessence is the Spirit of the thing, which verily cannot be so well extracted out of things sensible, as our of in-sensible things; Now, <hi>Baume</hi> hath in it self a Spirit of Life, the which is its Virtue, Power, and Medicine; and although it be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from its <hi>Root,</hi> yet notwithstanding the Life and Virtues are therein; for this reason, because that is a fix Predestination: Therefore the Quintessence may be extracted therefrom, and be also Conserved with the life thereof, without Corruption, as a thing eternal, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its Predestination: But now, could we but extract after this manner, the life of the Heart, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out corrupting it, even as is possible for us to do, out of things insensible, without doubt we might be capable of Living perpetually! without the knowledge or feeling of Death, and Diseases; the which thing is impossible for us to do. And therefore we must expect to <hi>die.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whereas therefore, the Quintessence is the Virtue of the things; we must in the first place tell you, in what form the Virtue and Medicine is in things, and that on this wise; <hi>Wine</hi> contains in it self a great Quintessence, whereby it hath very wonderful Operations; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding there is not so much of the Operation, as of the <hi>Wine,</hi> as is evidently apparent: If <hi>Gall</hi> be cast into Water, it makes it all bitter, although the <hi>Gall</hi> be not the hundredth part of the quantity of the Water; So the smallest portion of <hi>Saffron,</hi> will tinge a great deal of Water; all which doth not therefore become <hi>Saffron.</hi> Thus in like sort is it to be understood of the Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence, its quantity is very little, and lodgeth as a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57672:23"/>
Guest in Wood, Herbs, Stones, and such like; The residue is a meere absolute body; the which we write of, in the Book of <hi>The Separation of the Elements.</hi> Nor are we to dream that the Quintessence is a certain fifth Essence, above the Elements, when as even it it self is an Element. Likewise some or other may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that the <hi>Q. E.</hi> is a Temperate Essence, <hi>viz.</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cold, nor Hot, nor Moist, nor Dry, for verily it is not such. For there is nothing that consisteth of such a temperature; for by it, it would be wholly alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the Elements; But all Quintessences, have a nature according to the Elements; as for example, the Quintessence of Gold hath a nature according to the Fire, the <hi>Q. E.</hi> of Lune, according to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of <hi>Saturn</hi> according to the Earth, and of <hi>Mercury</hi> according to the Air.</p>
                     <p>But the reason why a Quintessence cureth all deseas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, is not because of its temperature, but because of its implanted property, its great cleannesse and purity, whereby it doth in a wonderful manner, alter and change the body into cleannesse. For even as a spot or film is took off from the Eye, wherewith it was dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened afore, even so doth the Quintessence mundifie the Life in man. Neither doth it follow, that all es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences must necessarily be of one and the same nature, mutually; No, nor are all the fiery natured essences of the self same Operation, by reason of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion; as for example, should any suppose that the Quintessence of <hi>Anacardes</hi> hath the very like self-same operation, as the Quintessence of Gold hath, because both of them are of a fiery nature, he would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly mistaken, because the Predestination and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, causeth the diversitie of virtues; for even as every <hi>Animal</hi> conteins in himself the spirit of life, and yet for all that, they have not all of them the very same like virtues, because they all consist of flesh and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57672:24"/>
blood, but one differs from another, as in taste, so in virtue; even so is it with the Quintessence; the which doth not receive its virtue from the Elements simply understood, but from the propriety existing in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, according to our discourse, in the Book of <hi>the Generation of Things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thence it comes to passe that some Quintessences are <hi>Stiptick,</hi> some are <hi>Narcotick</hi> or stupifying, other some Attractive, others cause sleep, others are bitter, sweet, sower, benumming, and some are renewers of the body into youthfulness, others concerve it in health, purge it, bind it, &amp;c. the virtues of which Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessences are innumerable, nor can they be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned up here, but yet a Physitian should know them very well.</p>
                     <p>When therefore the Quintessence is Separated from the not Quintessence, as the Soul from its body, and that it be taken inwardly into the body; What infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is able to resist so noble, pure and potent a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? or to take away the life from our body, death ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, <hi>viz.</hi> the Predestinated time which Separates our Body and Soul, as we teach in our Book of <hi>Life and Death.</hi> We are also to consider in this place, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Disease requireth its Peculiar Quintessence; although we teach some that are sit for all diseases. But by what reason that comes so to passe, shall be taught in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore we testifie, that the Quintessence of Gold is as to its Quantity, exceeding small; and the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of it is a leprous body, in which there is remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither sweetnesse, nor sowernesse, nor any power or virtue besides the mixion of the four Elements. And this secret we ought not to be ignorant of, in the least<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>viz.</hi> that the Elements themselves; cannot without the Quintessence resist any disease, but are able to do onely thus much, and no more then thus, <hi>viz.</hi> to heat or to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57672:24"/>
cool, without any kind of virtues; as put case the disease be <hi>hot,</hi> it is driven out by Cold, but not by that <hi>frigiditie</hi> as is destitute or void of Cold virtues, as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and snow, the which two though sufficiently cold, yet there is no Quintessence in them, by whose power and virtue the disease may be expelled. On this account the body of Gold is, of it self, invalid; But its Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence onely, existing in that body, and in its Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yeelds those virtues therein hidden; so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise is it in all other things, tis their Quintessence one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that cures, heals, and tingeth the whole body, as Salt doth excellently season any food; The Quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence therefore, is that which gives colour, such as it is; also virtue; and if Gold be spoiled of its colour, it doth likewise loose its Quintessence. The same is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the other Mettals, that when their Colours are removed from them, they are then robed of their natural virtue.</p>
                     <p>The like is it in Stones and Gems, as the Quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Corrals is a certain fatnesse with a redness, and the body of them is white; Likewise the Quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the <hi>Smaragdine</hi> is a green juyce, and the Body of it is also white. The same is to be supposed of all the rest of the stones, <hi>viz.</hi> that they loose their nature, essence, and proprieties together with their colours, as we teach peculiarly in their <hi>Extractions.</hi> The same is to be likewise understood of Hearbs, Plants, and other growing Products. In like manner of flesh and of blood, from which there can be no Quintessence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted for the reasons afore rehearsed; but yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding there may be a certain similitude of a Quintessence extracted by us there-from; after this manner, a piece of flesh hath life in it self even yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the flesh is as yet furnished with its whole nature and virtues; and therefore there is a life in it, which although it be not the true life, is nevertheless a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57672:25"/>
life, and that so long until it putrifies. And therefore this difference is to be noted, whereby dried Herbs, and such like, are to be accompted of, as was spoken of <hi>Flesh.</hi> For, that green Spirit, that is their life, is perished from them. So then <hi>dead Things</hi> may be taken for a <hi>dead Quintessence,</hi> even as <hi>Flesh</hi> can emit from it self all its virtues, peculiarly separated (into one part) from its body: So also is it with <hi>Bloud,</hi> and dryed <hi>Herbs.</hi> Which indeed, though they be not <hi>live Quintessences,</hi> yet do they demonstrate, how even a <hi>dead Quintessence</hi> discovers some Virtues. But, <hi>Metals</hi> and <hi>Stones</hi> have in them a perpetual Life and Essence, nor do they Die; but as long as they are <hi>Metals,</hi> or <hi>Stones,</hi> so long also doth their Life endure; therefore also do they exhibite <hi>perfect Quintessence,</hi> which may in like manner be extracted from them</p>
                     <p>Moreover, we are to see by what way the Quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence is to be extracted: verily, there be many wayes, some are made by Additions, as by the Spirit of Wine; others by <hi>Balsamites;</hi> some by the Separations of the Elements; and by many more several wayes which we shall not here reckon up particularly.</p>
                     <p>But, whatsoever way 'tis done by, the Quintessence must not be extracted by the mixtion or addition of things inconvenient, and unsuitable; but the Element of the Quintessence is to be extracted alone from the Separated body: and likewise by such a Separated bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as is extracted. There are many wayes to be found by which the Quintessence may be extracted, <hi>viz.</hi> by Sublimation, Calcination, by Strong Waters, by Corrosives, by Sweet, by Sower things, &amp;c. and it may be done any kind of way: But this also is to be noted, That every thing that hath been admixed to the Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence, by reason of the necessity of the extraction, that same thing is to be extracted again therefrom, that so the Quintessence may remain alone, without being
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57672:25"/>
polluted, or permixed with any other things: for it cannot possibly be, that the Quintessence can be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from Metals, and especially from Gold, (for that cannot be overcome by it self) without the using of some fit Corrosive, that may be again Separated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from afterwards. So Salt, which was Water, is again extracted from the Water, so that this Water is void of Salt. But now this is to be considered, that 'tis not every Corrosive that is fit for this work, because they cannot all of them be separated; for if Vitriol or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum be permixt with Water, neither of them can be Separated therefrom afterwards, without detriment or corruption, but they leave behind them a sharp resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and that for this reason, because they are both Watery, and there's made a concurrency, or meeting of two likes; the which ought not so to be in this place: Therefore diligent heed is to be used, that you take not a Watery body to a Watery, or any Oyly body to an Oyly, or Resinous to a Resinous body; but verily, the Contrary ought to separate the Quintessence, and to extract it, as Waters extract the Quintessence of Olea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous bodies, (as is mentioned of the Metals) and Oleaginous things, the Quintessence of Watery bodies, as we may learn of the Quintessences of Herbs, &amp;c. So therefore, after the Separation, and extraction of the Quintessence, the Corrosives are to be again Separated, which will easily be done; for Oyl and Water are easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly separated, but Oyl from Oyl not so; nor can Water be separated from Water without permixing each with the other; the which thing being left, may bring to the Quintessence a most great losle, for the Quintessence must be clear and undefiled, and must be gathered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the permixion of any thing whatsoever, that it may have a Uniform substance, whereby it may be able to penetrate the whole body; for, the subtilty and virtues thereof; cannot be found out fundamentally; no more
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57672:26"/>
then its Original, <hi>viz.</hi> from whence it first proceeded, can be fully known. For it <hi>(viz.</hi> the Quintessence) hath many degrees; One against Feavers; as the Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence of Opiates; One against the <hi>Hyposarcha,</hi> or an <hi>Hydropical</hi> distemper, as the essence of Tartar; One against the Apoplexy, as that of Gold; One against the <hi>Epilepsy,</hi> as that of Vitriol; the number of which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven infinite and unsearchable by experience. 'Tis therefore worthy the highest Consideration and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that to every Disease, its true enemy may be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed; for so Nature will give an incredible assistance; the which we will make a better Declaration of in what follows. We cannot speak of the Degrees thereof, in such a manner as is the assignment of Degrees to simple things in Medicine; the reason is this, because there can be no Comparison of the degrees of a Quintessence, to the degrees of Simples, nor indeed may be; but when they are exalted, the excellency and virtue of one, is found to be greater, then that of another, and not the Complexion; Nor is it to be conceived, That the Quintessence of <hi>Ambos,</hi> is hotter then the Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence of Lavender; or the Quintessence of <hi>Venus,</hi> dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the Quintessence of <g ref="char:Moonround">❍</g>; but the degree of any thing is to be discerned, by the great and more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent virtues that it hath, <hi>viz.</hi> after this manner; The Quintessence of Antimony cures the Leapry, the Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence of Corrals drives away the <hi>Spasm</hi> and <hi>Torsions,</hi> or Gripings. But now to know which of these is the better and higher granduated, there can be no other judgement of it then thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Quintessence of the Antimony is higher and more excellent, and that for this reason, because the Leapry is a more grievous infirmity then the Cholick is, with all its appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; and therefore answerable to the propriety that each hath against divers Diseases, are the degrees thereof to be considered: yea, also in one and the very
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57672:26"/>
same Disease; for so in the Leprosie, one essence is more powerful to cure it then another; for the Quintessence of <hi>Juniper</hi> expels it, and the Quintessence of Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greece, and the Quintessence of Antimony, and the Quintessence of Gold: Now although that all these Four Essences will cure the Leprosie, yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they do it differently, nor do they consist (as to the Cure thereof) in one and the same degree; for the essence of Juniper expels this Disease by a most high Repurgation and cleansing, which it brings into the bloud, and consumes the Venome so, that it is not so perceptible; and therefore to be accounted in the first degree of that Cure. The Quintessence of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-grecce takes away the venome also; and doth more, for it mundifies the Lungs, Heart, and Members, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Leprosie; and therefore the Second degree is attributed thereunto. The Quintessence of Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doth go yet further then the Two aforesaid virtues, mundifies the skin, and acuates and renews the whole body, after a wonderful manner; and therefore obtains the Third degree. But the Quintessence of <hi>Sol,</hi> doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven alone accomplish all these Operations, and radical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly takes away all the signs of the Leprosie, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news the body, even as Honey and Wax are mundified and purged from their Comb; on this account it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth the Fourth degree.</p>
                     <p>By this kind of way, are the degrees of Quintessences to be known, and distinguished from one another; that is, which of them is more high, or more excellent. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Simples are to be known by their Properties; for as is their Propriety in the Simple form, such also is their Quintessence; not sluggisher, but much more powerful and excellent.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, we must likewise know the differences of the Quintessences; for some of them do very much serve for the Liver, to resist all its Diseases. Some for
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57672:27"/>
the Head, others for the Reins, some for the Lungs, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersome the Spleen, and such like; Likewise, some do operate only in the bloud, others in the Phlegm on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; some upon Melancholy only, others upon Choler; othersome have their Operations in the Humors only, some in the Spirit of Life, some in the Nutritive Spirit; some Operate in the Bones, othersome in the Flesh, some in the Marrow, others in the Gristles, some in the Arteries; some also there are, that Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate against some Diseases Only, and against none else; as, against the Palsie, Falling-evil, Contracture, against Fluxes, the Dropsie, &amp;c. Some also are found to be <hi>Narcoticks,</hi> others <hi>Anodine;</hi> some <hi>Somniferous;</hi> some <hi>Attractive, Purgative, Mandificative, Incarnative, Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, Regenerative;</hi> and some <hi>Stupefactive, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Othersome there are to be found, that <hi>Renovate,</hi> and <hi>Restore;</hi> that is, such as transmute the Body, Bloud, and Flesh; Othersome for the Conservation of the <hi>Diuturnity,</hi> or Prolongation of the Life; some for the Retaining and Preservation of Youthfulness; some of them work by Transmutation; and some by enkindl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or stirring up. Moreover, this is likewise to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood that some Quintessences have a Specifical form, others an Appropriated form, others an Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential, and others a Natural form. Briefly, there are many more virtues that they are endued with, which we are able to describe, and their Operations in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, are exceeding admirable and unsearchable, and that variously; for some Quintessences will make a man of 100. years old, like to one of but 20. years of age, and that by their own Vertues and Power. And now, What man is able to search out the Original of so great a Mysterie? Or to find out, from whence the first mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do naturally spring? It is at the pleasure of our most Supream Creator, either to make them so, or to forbear. For, who shall instruct us to know, what the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57672:27"/>
virtues of the Quintessence of Antimony are, by which the old Hair is cast off, and new springs up in its room? Likewise, why the Quintessence of <hi>Bawm</hi> roots out the Teeth, and eradicates the Nails of the Hands and Feet, and causeth new ones; and the Quintessence of <hi>Rebis,</hi> rubs or scours off the skin, and renews it? But the Quintessence of <hi>Celondine</hi> changeth the body, renewing it into good, and better; just so as fresh Colours renew a Picture. There are far more Properties then these, which we omit in this place, and reserve them to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in their proper Chapters.</p>
                     <p>And now at last, How can it be possible that we can relinquish and neglect that noble Philosophy and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, seeing that Nature affords unto us such wonderful experiments, both in, and from them; yea such, as the other Faculties are destitute wholly of, for that they are placed in a meer Cavilation. And why should not this strange Operation be very pleasing unto us, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Quintessence of the <hi>Carline Thistle</hi> takes away the Powers of one man, and bestows them upon another that useth it. Likewise, that the Quintessence of Gold inverts, or turns as 'twere, the whole Leprous body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side outwards, and so washeth it as an <hi>Intestine,</hi> or <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals</hi> are washt in the Shambles; and doth likewise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Scabby Skin &amp; make a new one, and loosneth the <hi>Organs</hi> of the Voice, and takes away the whole Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous Complexion, and produceth such a one, as if he newly came forth out of his Mother. Now therefore, wee'l apply our mind to the making of those <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessences,</hi> and direct you the Way of their Extractions or Compositions; to this purpose, we will endeavour to declare them in a just due order, together with their Appurtenances, <hi>viz.</hi> One way for <hi>Metals,</hi> another for <hi>Marcasites,</hi> another for <hi>Salts,</hi> another for <hi>Stones</hi> and <hi>Gems,</hi> another for <hi>Burning things,</hi> another for <hi>Growing things,</hi> another for <hi>Spices,</hi> another for <hi>Comestible</hi> and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57672:28"/>
                        <hi>Poteable things.</hi> But yet, you are to take notice in the Practick part of <hi>Quintessences,</hi> That the <hi>Theory,</hi> and a good knowledge of Natural things, is requisite; but yet notwithstanding <hi>Theorically,</hi> viz. of the Proprieties of things to natural Diseases; Neither are we to be Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the difference between a <hi>Quintessence,</hi> an <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Potabile, Arcanaes, Magisteries,</hi> and others of that kind, <hi>viz.</hi> thus; A <hi>Quintessence</hi> cannot be again reduced into its body; but <hi>Aurum Potabile</hi> may be again trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted very well into its <hi>Metalick</hi> body; and therefore the virtues that are in a <hi>Quintessence,</hi> are far more noble then in other things.</p>
                     <p>But now, in our thus Discoursing of the <hi>Quintessence,</hi> the difference in respect of the one and the other, is to be known; and also what that difference is: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we have sufficiently explained it afore, yet the <hi>Practick</hi> allures and calls us some other way, by which said way, the condition and nature of the Quintessence may be found out. For although they do not appear in the form of a <hi>Quintessence,</hi> nor are made after the same manner, nor consist in one Element alone, as a <hi>Quintessence</hi> ought to be; yet nevertheless 'tis to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, that as to the <hi>Quintessence</hi> of those things, it is more then so, as to be called a <hi>Quintessence;</hi> and is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be styled a certain <hi>Arcanum,</hi> and <hi>Mysterie;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, more should be written then we have written of a <hi>Quintessence.</hi> But whereas we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it in the Books of <hi>Paramyrum,</hi> we shall passe it over in this place. The number of the <hi>Arcanaes</hi> and <hi>Mysteries</hi> of this same <hi>Art</hi> is infinite and unsearchable, and many are the wayes thereof, that we meet withal, and which require the attentive heed of a mans quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est ingenuity. But yet, amongst all this number of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canaes,</hi> we will here rehearse <hi>Four.</hi> The First there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of those Secrets is, <hi>Mercurius Vitae;</hi> the Second is, the <hi>Prima Materia,</hi> or <hi>first matter;</hi> the Third is, the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers</hi>
                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:57672:28"/>
                        <hi>Stone;</hi> the Fourth is the <hi>Tincture.</hi> And although these <hi>Arcanaes</hi> are, as to their revealment, rather <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical</hi> then <hi>Humane;</hi> yet nevertheless we will not greatly fear, or doubt of them, but will rather endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to search out the wayes of Nature; and even all that which hath proceeded from Nature, may in my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, be also natureally understood. We do therefore profess concerning <hi>Mercurius vitae,</hi> that it is not a <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence,</hi> but an <hi>Arcanum;</hi> because there are in it, many virtues and powers, which preserve, restore, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate; as we write in our Book of <hi>Arcanaes.</hi> So likewise <hi>Prima Materiae</hi> doth not onely operate upon living bodies, but also on dead bodies after the same manner, more then can be imagined to be done natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally. In like manner doth the <hi>Philosophers Stone</hi> shew its efficacy, the which tinging the body, doth release it of all diseases, even as each of the Metals are mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difyed from their Impurities. So also is it with the <hi>Tincture,</hi> the which doth as well transmute the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease into health, as it doth <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> into ☉. These things, yea and others to, do <hi>Magisteries</hi> and <hi>Elixirs</hi> accomplish, and <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> each whereof are treated of in their proper books.</p>

                        <hi>Of the Extraction of the Quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence out of</hi> Metals.</head>
                     <p>NOw then we will in a few words, finish the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of Quintessences from Metals; for many men have (in our time) attempted and experienced very many things in them, and have met with many things that have as it were, even constrained them to enter upon other (and those various too) wayes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:57672:29"/>
Concerning Metals. Therefore this is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are to be devided into two parts, <hi>viz.</hi> into their Quintessence, and into their Body; both which are liquid and potable, and will not be permixed together: but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure body, turns forth the Quintessence to its super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies, even as the Colostrum, or cream is Separated from the milk. By this way are made two fatnesses, or viscous liquors out of Metals, the which liquors are to be Separated. As for the fatnesse of the Body, tis alwayes white, even of all the Metals; but their Quintessence is coloured, even as we have explained it afore; concerning the seven Metals, they likewise have all of them the same process, and is this.</p>
                     <p>The Mettal must be dissolved into a Water, then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, must this solution be destilled by a <hi>B.</hi> and be abstracted or drawn off, and putrefied so long until it be reduced into an oyl, the which oyl must be destilled out of small Glasse-Cucurbites by an <hi>Alembick,</hi> and one part of the Metal will remain in the bottom, let the which be again reduced into an oyl as before, and be destilled so long, until all the Metal shall ascend, then let it be again putrefied for a Moneth, and at length be again destilled with a gentle Fire, and the vapours will ascend first, and fall into the Receiver, the which vapours remove; Then there will ascend two obscure colours, one white, and the other answerable to the nature and condition of the Metal, and when they shall be wholly comeover, they become Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Receiver. So that the Quintessence remains in the bottom, and the white colour of the Body swims at top. Separate these two by a <hi>Separating-Glass</hi> and put your Quintessence in another Glasse, and pour thereto some Purified Burning Wine, which let re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main so long therewith, until it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Wine be plainly acuared, then let it be strained or Separated
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57672:29"/>
from the Quintessence, and more fresh be again poured on; this do so often till you perceive no more Acuity or sharpnesse. Then at last, powr on Water twice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled; where with let it be washed and brought unto its sweetness, then keep it; by this way is prepared the Quintessence of Metals. But as for the white Colour of the body if you reduce it, you shall have thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from a white Malleable and Metallick body; the which cannot be known, <hi>viz.</hi> under what species or kind it is conteined. Many other wayes are to be found for the Extraction of a Quintessence, which we shall be silent in, because we account them not for true extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Quintessences, but onely as transmutations, in which there is no Extraction made or used.</p>

                     <p>THere are also to be sound, various ways as to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the Quintessence out of <hi>Marcasites,</hi> but yet we cannot in the least account them for true Quintessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

                           </gap>ne Marcasites,</hi> is like to the true extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Metals. And whereas we said before, that the Quintessence is the most supream virtue of things, and do yet for all that aver the contrary in <hi>Arcanaes, viz.</hi> that they are greater then the Quintessences them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are; the reason is this, because all <hi>Arcanaes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in them the Quintessences, and are reduced fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to such an acuity and subtilty, that they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57672:30"/>
thereby a far greater virtue then the <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessence.</hi>

                     <p>The same comes also to be, by reason of their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate and Specisick faculty. The processe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the Extraction of the <hi>Quintessence</hi> out of <hi>Marca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites</hi> is thus.</p>
                     <p>Take of a <hi>Marcasite</hi> ground most exceeding small, <hi>one pound;</hi> of the eating Water, <hi>two pound;</hi> being permixt together in a <hi>Pellican,</hi> let them remain in digestion two or three moneths, and they will be reduced into a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor; distil this liquor by the Fire, wholly, and it will come over in an oyl, the which thou shalt putresie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a Belly or Dung, sor a moneth, then distil it as you did the Metals, and there will likewise two colours ascend, as did from the Metals, one colour white, the other the true colour of the <hi>Quintessence;</hi> leave the white, except it be of <hi>Bismute,</hi> or a white <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casite,</hi> and then you shall know them from each other by the thicknesse. Take the undermost and reduce it to its sweetnesse, as was afore spoken of the Metals. On this wise then hast thou Extracted the <hi>Quintessence</hi> out of <hi>Marcasites,</hi> without any corrupting of their powers and virtues.</p>

                     <p>THe manner of Extracting the tho <hi>Quintessence</hi> out of <hi>Salts</hi> is done by a peculiar way, that so their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues may not be diminished, <hi>viz.</hi> on this wise.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take Salts,</hi> The which you must Calcine excellently well; but if they be volatile <hi>Salts,</hi> burn them; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards let them he resolved into a Tenuity or thinness, and be destilled into a Water, put this Water in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresaction for a moneth, and destil it by a <hi>B.</hi> and there will ascend a sweet water, the which throw away.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57672:30"/>
That which will not ascend, set again in Digestion for another moneth, and distil it as before; and do thus so often, till there be no more sweetness perceived; for by this way, hast thou now the <hi>Quintessence</hi> of Salt in the bottom; from <hi>one pound</hi> of Burnt or Calcined Salt, thou wilt scarce have <hi>two ounces.</hi> Half an <hi>ounce</hi> of this Salt Extracted on this wise (suppose common Salt) doth season meats more then half a <hi>pound</hi> of the other, for here is onely the <hi>Quintessence</hi> present, and the Body is abstracted thence-from, by the liquid Solution.</p>
                     <p>By this way is the <hi>Quintessence</hi> of all Salts Separated. But it is to be extracted from <hi>Allum</hi> and <hi>Vitriol,</hi> by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; thus, They do not admit of a Calcination, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to fusion, as Salts do; and therefore it is Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that after their Calcination, you burn them, and resolve them according to the Rule of Practise; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that they be resolved, power on again the Waters that proceeded from them, and proceed on, according to the Process given of Salts; for much of the Essence ascends with the moisture, the which doth again thus reside at the bottome in the Composition and Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and so come together into one.</p>

                     <p>THE manner of extracting the <hi>Quintessence</hi> out of <hi>Stones, Gems</hi> and <hi>Pearls,</hi> (the Process of all which is one and the same) is the most excellent of all, and is as to the Operation thereof, very Subtile and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious; very, very little is the quantity of that <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence,</hi> which is to be had out of <hi>Gems,</hi> and by now much the subtiler and purer the <hi>Gem</hi> is, so much the lesser is the <hi>Quintessence</hi> thereof; tis scarce worth while to Extract the Quintessence from gross, great &amp; vile or base Stones, for they have but little virtue in them, and therefore also have but very little <hi>Quint.</hi> to come forth
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57672:31"/>
or proceed from them. The Processe thereof is this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take Gems</hi> or <hi>Margarites,</hi> or <hi>Pearls,</hi> beat them into pretty big pieces, not into a Powder, and put them in a Glasse, and pour thereto the <hi>Acetum</hi> of the Roote, or Radicated Vinegar, so as to overtop it the breath of four or five fingers, and let them be digested in a hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belly for a whole moneth, which being done, the whole matter will appear liquid; the which thou shalt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract with other Radicated Vinegar, and shake and mix them well together; so the Vinegar receives into it self the Colour of the Stone. The Coloured Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar must be poured out into another Glass, and powr on more Vinegar as before, so osten as there comes any Colour; now in that Colour is the Quintessence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, the residue is the Corporality. Take there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Colours, or tinged Vinegar, and boil them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gently even to dryness, then afterwards wash it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with distilled Water, until it be made sweet, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove said: Then let this powder be dissolved upon a marble; thus shalt thou have the Quintessence of <hi>Gems</hi> and <hi>Pearls;</hi> but this is to be noted in the Colours of <hi>Pearls,</hi> that they are resolved into the Colour of thick Milk, and the Body of them is Sandy and viscous; and thereby may the one be known from the other. The like is it also with Crystal, its Quintessence appears at top, a certain Viscous Body remaining, by which the sufficiency or compleatnesse of those kind of Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be known.</p>

                     <p>ALL such things we call burning, as are not used for food or drink, and do naturally burn, and feed the fire in their Bodily Substance. The Process of the Extraction of their Quintessence is this. <hi>Take</hi> the Body, cut it exceeding small, and put it into a Glazed Pot, and fill it up, and close it firmly with the Seal of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that so it breath not out, burn it in a Circulatory Fire for twenty four hours, so as to abide in an equal Heat, and the Pot to be glowing like the Coals: Then take it out of the Fire, and putrefie it in Dung for four Weeks, then distil as much as will ascend; Let this be put in a Horse-belly to distil off all the moisture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, and be set again to putrefie, until there come out no more moisture, then at length the Quintessence of that which thou hast received, and at first tookest in thy Reciver, remaines in the bottom; after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is the Quintessence to be Extracted out of all things that contain in them Oyl, or Rosin, or Pitch, or such like, as out of Turpentine, Fir-tree, Juniper, Cypress, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Likewise out of all Seeds, Fruits, and such like.</p>
                     <p>Moreover you are to note, that there are also far more waies and kinds of Extracting the Quintessence from them, by which it comes forth very Odoriferous, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and cleer; but those waies are not Extractions of the Quintessence, but certain Magisteries of those same things, by which some part of the Quintessence doth in the Permixion together, ascend upwards: But yet it is not a perfect Quintessence, for the Essence of Woods is a certain satness or Rosin, and thick substance, and is not therefore extracted in the form of Magiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; but the cause hereof is this, <hi>viz.</hi> the Quintessence
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57672:32"/>
of the Turpentine Tree healeth Wounds; but if it shall be extracted after the aforesaid manner, of other <hi>Magisteries,</hi> it doth not Cure them, because it hath not in it the <hi>basis</hi> and foundation of the Quintessence; For verily <hi>Magisteries</hi> are on this account distinguished from Quintessences, because they only concern and respect the Complexions and <hi>Four</hi> Elements, the which is not the nature of Quintessences; Likewise they receive, or have it Spiritually, and not Materially in its proper Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; as appears in the <hi>Chapters.</hi>

                     <p>SUch we call (in this place) <hi>Growing Things,</hi> that fall off and grow again, as Herbs, Leaves, and such like And for the Extraction of the Quintessences of them, there are various wayes found out, by the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other things; but they ought to be extracted without the mixture of any thing; and so, as to retain their Taste, Colour, and Odour, and that they may be encreased in them, and not diminished. So if the Quintessence be extracted out of <hi>Musk, Ambergreece,</hi> and <hi>Civet,</hi> their bodies do stink afterwards, so that they are worth nothing, either in Taste, Odour, or Nature The like is to be understood of all the rest of that kind, as to the Extraction of the Quintessences. But we will not discourse of <hi>Mask, Ambergreece,</hi> or <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit,</hi> in this Chapter, because we write peculiarly of them elsewhere; and we treat at present of <hi>Growing Things</hi> only: a the <hi>Lilly, Spike, Leaves;</hi> for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract on of the Quintessence of which, this <hi>Process</hi> is to be observed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> of <hi>Growing Things,</hi> bruise them exceeding well, and put them into some fit Vessel, the which set in a Horse-belly for four weeks; then Distil it by <hi>B</hi> put

them again into Horse-dung for eight dayes, and let them be again Distilled by <hi>B. M.</hi> So, the Quintessence will ascend by the Alembick, but the body will abide in the bottom. If there should ought of the Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence have remained in the bottom, it must be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther putrified, and he proceeded with as before. Then take this Distilled Water, and put it again to this <hi>Grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Body,</hi> and so let them be digested together in a Pelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can for six dayes; then the Colour will be thick, the which abstract by <hi>B.

                     <p>WE will now teach the manner of Extracting the Quintessence out of <hi>Spices;</hi> as <hi>Musk, Civet, Camphire,</hi> and such like; First of all, the Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence must be reduced into another form, and then at length be separated therefrom; and in that same se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is the Quintessence found, as follows,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> the Oyl of <hi>Almonds.</hi> with which mix an <hi>Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> body, and let them be digested together in a Glass at the Sun, their proper time, until they are reduced into a Paste; afterwards, let them be press'd our from their <hi>feces;</hi> after this manner is the body Separated from the Quintessence, which Quintessence is thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with the Oyl; and is to be Separated therefrom on this wise.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> rectified <hi>burning Wine,</hi> wherewith mingle the aforesaid Oyl, and leave them in digestion for six dayes;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57672:33"/>
afterwards let them be distilled by Ashes, and there will ascend the <hi>burning Wine,</hi> and with it the <hi>Quintessence;</hi> and the Oyl will remain in the bottom, without any remaining of the <hi>Quintessence.</hi> Last of all, let this <hi>Wine</hi> be Distilled by <hi>B.

                     <head>Of the Extraction of the Quintessence from Comestible and Potable Things.</head>
                     <p>THe <hi>Quintessence</hi> of things <hi>Comestible,</hi> is to be no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, then in a like form with that wherewith we are fed; as with Flesh: for the <hi>Quintessence</hi> of <hi>Comestible Things</hi> is the best nourishment. And although no <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence</hi> can be drawn from Flesh, (as we said afore) yet nevertheless we are well able to Extract there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, as to its own being or essentiality, that which may be equivalent to a <hi>Quintessence;</hi> as follows.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> a <hi>Comestible Thing,</hi> cut it in pieces, and put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Vessel, or great Jugg, very well luted, and let it boyl for three dayes; then afterwards strain out that which shall be in the Pot, and distil it by a <hi>B.</hi> So there will first of all ascend a certain wateriness, the which when it shall be all come over, the <hi>Quintessence</hi> will be left in the bottom. This is the highest Nutriment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all the others that we can set down, or declare: And in respect of nourishing, it is like to a <hi>Quintessence.</hi> Likewise, the <hi>Quintessence</hi> may be Extracted out of <hi>Potable</hi> things sundry wayes; but this is the true <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess</hi> which we account as the chiefest, fittest, and most profitable for this Work.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tale</hi> any <hi>Potable</hi> thing, shut it up in a Pellican, as it is, with its whole substance, and digest it for a Month in Horse-dung, but 'twill be the better to leave it so for a year or more, and you shall find in the Pellican a

certain digested <hi>somewhat;</hi> Separate this same by a <hi>B;</hi> afterwards by Ashes; and lastly, by Fire. By this means shalt thou have <hi>Three Quintessences,</hi> which are in like manner in all <hi>Poteable</hi> things, and that for many causes, as we set down more at large in the Treatise of their <hi>Generations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These <hi>Three Quintessences</hi> thus extracted, and each of them put into its peculiar Vessel, the <hi>two</hi> latter are to be further digested, and then put into a <hi>B. M.</hi> and there will ascend more of the former <hi>Quintessence;</hi> this do so often until no more of the former doth ascend, and by this means are they very excellently well separated.</p>
                     <p>And whereas I have so briefly taught the <hi>Quintessence</hi> of all things, and the so short way of their Extraction, there's no cause for any to wonder at the hasty running of my Hand, or Quill. Because they are each of them well and sufficiently delivered so; nor are the <hi>Quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences</hi> so succinctly, or briefly written of by us, but that the Work and Labour necessary thereunto is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently demonstrated: What need is there of many Writings to stir up a <hi>nauseate,</hi> both to our selves and <hi>Readers.</hi> For tis to be confidered that <hi>exercise</hi> and <hi>use</hi> teacheth all things. But now, as to the wonderful vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and faculties of the <hi>Quintessence,</hi> thus extracted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the aforesaid way, we have partly taught already, and shall more cleerly manifest (in the last Books) that which belongs to this Part of the <hi>Archidoxis:</hi> and so shall have abundantly enough discovered the <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence</hi> of all things. And although that many men afore us, have in various instructions and documents written some great matters of <hi>Quintessences,</hi> yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless we do not account of what they have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as for a <hi>Quintessence;</hi> the cause whereof we have sufficiently disclosed afore. We perceive also by their Writings, that Verdigreece, or greenness of Brass, was accounted by them the <hi>Quintessence</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> which is
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57672:34"/>
not so; but the <hi>Crocus</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> is the <hi>quintessence</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> which is to be thus understood; <hi>Flos Aeris,</hi> or the flower of Brass, is a transmutation with, and partaking of the substance, is gross and subtile together, and is extracted out of all the <hi>Venerean</hi> Complexion, or our of the whole Complexion of <hi>Venus,</hi> and therefore it cannot be a <hi>Quintessence;</hi> but the <hi>Crocus</hi> of <hi>Venus</hi> is (as we have taught) the true <hi>Quintessence,</hi> for it is a <hi>Poetable</hi> thing, divided from the body without <hi>Corrosion</hi> and permixti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, tis very subtile; yea, more then I am willing to write down here, because I would shun prolixity. So likewise the <hi>Crocus</hi> of <hi>Mars,</hi> and the <hi>Rust</hi> thereof, hath been hither to accounted for a <hi>Quintessence,</hi> but it is not so; But the <hi>Crocus</hi> of <hi>Mars,</hi> is the Oyl of <hi>Mars.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning these things, we set down more of them about <hi>Transmutations,</hi> in our <hi>Philosophy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A <hi>Quintessence</hi> therefore is to be thus understood, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is no other thing but a certain Separation of the virtues from the body, wherein the whole Medicinal Virtue and Essence is; But as for the <hi>Flos Aeris,</hi> and <hi>Flos</hi> of <hi>Mars,</hi> and many more such like, <hi>viz.</hi> What they are, shall be delivered in the place of <hi>Magisteries.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The like judgement must be had of the Vegitables, and Herbs, and such like, as of the Metals. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we have set down very noble, and many virtues of the <hi>Quintessence;</hi> yet nevertheless we have recited but the smallest part of their Virtues and Qualities; but we have chiefly declared thus much, that these things may be somewhat understood: but as to the quality and quantity of all their Virtues and excellency, that is not done by us in the least. Hereby may be hinted unto us, the greatness of that power which is in our hands, did we but know how to use it well. Hence also is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest the cause why man was Created, and all things in Earth made subject to him; Likewise why nothing, be it good or be it had, proceedeth forth without a cause;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57672:34"/>
the which we declare more clearly in the Book of the <hi>Nature of Things;</hi> for that fundamental, and <hi>basts,</hi> brings with it a faith strongly bent upon the Creator, and an hope of his Love towards us, as of a Loving Father to his Children; and therefore we must not snatch at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very shadowy and vain Faith, but ought to behold God only, and Nature, and the Art of Nature. Wherefore good reason have we to in voak him only in this life, and for ever; and believe that only which we see so to be; and neither Receive, or Approve of any thing that doth not agree with Nature, but is besides the way thereof.</p>

Therefore <hi>Arcanaes</hi> being compared to our Corporeal bodies, are to be accounted of as incorporeal, and of a far more excellent Essence then ours, and of as much difference as is betwixt black and white; for they have a power of Transmuting, Altering, and Restoring <hi>us,</hi> as the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canaes</hi> of God, according to their proper induction, and Order.</p>
                     <p>And although there is not in our <hi>Arcanaes,</hi> an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or that Coelestial harmony, yet ne vertheless they are (in comparison of us) to be adjudged as Coelesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; for as much as they conserve our bodies more then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will we be afraid to write that these <hi>Arcanaes</hi> are higher and greater then we ourselves, and have a most great power of furnishing us with life, as shall be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed by those <hi>Four</hi> which we shall set down.

Consumption, as we declare in our Treatise of <hi>Life and Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And although that we have already declared their virtues in Generall, and their Nature; neverthelesse they are very greatly and particularly different amongst themselves, in so much that they neither of them have an Operation alike, or do accomplish their Virtues e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually, but are different both in manner and form, each of them having their proper and peculiar wayes; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the first <hi>Arcanum</hi> is the <hi>Prima Materia;</hi> the second is the <hi>Stone</hi> of the <hi>Philosophers;</hi> the third is a <hi>Mercurius vitae;</hi> and the fourth is the <hi>Tincture;</hi> for even thus in this Order we let down the Practise of them, after that we have expounded the manner of their Operation as followeth.</p>
                     <p>First of all therefore tis to be noted, concerning the First Matter, that it shews and gives forth its Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (to which it is ordained) whole and intire, and such as is described, assigned or exemplified, from the first Original, even to the end. As for example, a seed gives out of it self, the whole Hearb with a Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all its Virtues, and a consuming of the Old Essence. So that the Old Substance, Nature and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence hath no more Operation; So therefore do we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven speak of the First Matter, that we are born from. One Seed as the growing Hearb in the Field, according to its growing Nature. According to the aforesaid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, doth the First Matter introduce a new youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness into a man, and absumes the Old no otherwise, then as a new Hearb ariseth from a new Seed, in a new Summer and Year.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Stone</hi> of the <hi>Philosophers,</hi> wch is the second <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> perfecteth its Operations in another form, <hi>viz.</hi> after this manner, Even as the extrinsical Fire doth, by burning of the spotted and defiled Skin of the <hi>Salaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> make it so clean as if it were newly born; So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57672:37"/>
this <hi>Stone</hi> of the <hi>Philosophers</hi> doth purge the whole Humane Body, and cleanse it from all its defilements, by the introducing of new and younger Youth-like vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, the which it adjoyneth to the Nature of a Man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mercurius vitae,</hi> which is the third <hi>Arcanum,</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit and shew its Oparations to be such like as the <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> or <hi>King-Fisher</hi> doth manifest, the which Bird is in its <hi>Anual</hi> season renewed, and clad with new Feathers. Even so doth this <hi>Arcanum</hi> cast off from a man, the Nails of his Hands and Feet, also his Hairs, Skin, &amp; every thing that is there to subject, and causeth them to grow up again, and renovates the whole body, as we spake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the <hi>King-Fisher.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Tincture,</hi> which we set down as the fourth <hi>Arcanum,</hi> doth manifest its Oparations after the manner of <hi>Rebis,</hi> because it makes Gold out of Lune, and the other Metals; for after the same manner doth the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture tinge the Body of Man, and takes away from him his Corruption, and Impediments, and transmutes all his parts into the highest Puritie, Nobility, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manencie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How therfore can it be possible for us to depart from the Noble Medicinal Art, or from <hi>Philosophy</hi> it self, when as we may evidently see their powerful Virtues, the which alone are the things that so confirm us, as to give unto them the greatest belief, and that deserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for we never inclined our miude to believe, Learn and imitate such Things as cannot be proved and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by most true and most certain reasons, conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with both Experience and Practise. If at that time wherein Christ did hang upon the Crosse, the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> had not been affected with a kind of compassion, in so much thàt they were deprived of their light and obscured; and had not the Earth it self been also shook with a terrible trembling; and had not those other signes been manifested as to his birth, veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57672:37"/>
no body would now have believed in him; They now naturally teach us to See and Know him, that Jesus Christ is God, and that he assumed the Humanity. The like may be said of these <hi>Arcanaes,</hi> that they Make, and even Compel us to believe them, so as not to recede from them even till death; but rather strictly and day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to give thanks unto God with many liftings up of our Hearts. So, neither the <hi>Eclips,</hi> nor the <g ref="char:Moonround">❍</g>, will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw ought from us.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore lets come to the <hi>Practise</hi> and <hi>Work</hi> of those <hi>Four Arcanaes,</hi> by which we may be able to drive away the Accidents and Corruptions of our Youth, and rejoyce in them, even as our Eternal <hi>Arcanum</hi> rejoyceth in the Life Eternal, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>HAving sufficiently spoken of the <hi>First Matter,</hi> whence in comes, and what it is; you are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that it is founded not only upon Men, but also all bodily Creatures; that is, upon every thing that is born of any <hi>Seed;</hi> From whence it may be Concluded, That (if it hath its Operation in any Created body, and perfects it) tis able to preserve the Trees from perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by corruption, the Herbs from drying up, and also the Metals from Rust; the which is to be here in this place understood of Men and Beasts after the same manner. Therefore a Tree being now almost Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed by Age, and daily tending more and more to its Corruption, not by the Roots defect, nor by defect of Nourishment, but by the lack of its proper Virtue, may be renewed by its own <hi>Prima Materia,</hi> (even as we
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57672:38"/>
have spoken of the Skin of the <hi>Salamander)</hi> and may o attain even to another Age according to its Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snation; yea, even to a Third, to a Fourth, and more; For this reason are the virtues to be bestowed thereon, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Corruption and Destruction thereof hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening in long success of time, may be now and then renewed. The same is to be understood of Herbs, which endure and last but one year only, because their Predestination is no longer; for even they, yea when they begin to be dried up, are renewed by their <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Materia,</hi> so as to remain green and fresh for another <hi>Annual</hi> Age, and a <hi>third,</hi> and a <hi>fourth,</hi> and further. The like do I also mean concerning bruit <hi>Animals,</hi> as old Sheep. &amp;c. the which may be Renovated, even to a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond age, and so receive Strength, Milk, and Wooll, like young Sheep. In like manner may a Man be brought out of one Age into another, as we said afore; Now, tis to be noted from these things, what the <hi>first Matter</hi> is, as concerning its first Essence. In Created Insensible bodies, it is the Seed of every thing. In Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sensible bodies, it is their <hi>Sperm;</hi> You must also know that the <hi>first Matter</hi> is not to be taken from that thing which this Created body is produced out of, but from the producted and Generated matter: For the <hi>first matter</hi> hath such Virtues, as not-to-permit the body that is born of it, to go into a Consumption; but doth abundantly administer what is sufficient for the supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of every necessity. For verily death only riseth from the destruction or infection of the living Spirit. Now, that Spirit grow: out of the <hi>Sperm</hi> or <hi>Seed,</hi> and is verily a <hi>Spermatick</hi> matter, and therefore may it be helped with its like. For where a like-help is administred there's introduced a new age, for many causes, which we shall not at all set down in this place, but declare them in our <hi>Philosophy.</hi> Moreover, although we did not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to write any thing of the <hi>Sustentation</hi> and <hi>Renovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:57672:38"/>
of Trees in this Book; Seeing our intent was to discourse of the Medicins and Physick of Mans body on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; yet are those Inductions of the Trees, and other such like Transmutations set down, that thereby we may <hi>Parabolically,</hi> and by those examples, render our intention the more easie to be understood: As the Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testence of Nettle, <hi>(alias</hi> Lavender) if it shall be poured on to the Root of its own Herb, that so it may receive its Tincture and be tinged therewith, it will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide another year like as in the former year, and not putrifie till the other year be ended.</p>
                     <p>Likewise the Quintessence of the Seed of Quinces, if poured to the Root of the Quince-tree, the Tree abides green and flourishing even to the end of another year, and also produceth Flowers and Fruit. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Quintessence of Cheries causeth the Trees of them to bring forth their Fruits twice in the year, like two Summers; for one is the half-Summer of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-Cherry-trees, the other half is made a second Summer, like the former.</p>
                     <p>We also suppose it expedient, not only to speak of the Quintessence of the <hi>Sperm,</hi> but also of the <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> of the <hi>Sperm;</hi> out of the which do proceed far more Wonderful Things, as we have already told you.</p>
                     <p>First of all therefore we will declare the Process of this <hi>Practise;</hi> First, 'Tis alike both in Men and Beasts: Secondly, 'Tis made out of the <hi>first Matter</hi> only, after this manner, as now follows.</p>

                     <p>I Am not an Author or Teacher of that <hi>Philosophers stone</hi> that is so diversly described by others; nor am a Practitioner thereof, much lesse a Searcher therein, and so should as it were speak thereof from Hear-say, or Writing; Whereas therefore I have no certainty thereof, I will leave that <hi>Process,</hi> and prosecute my own, as being such as my self hath found out both by Use and Practise: And I call it the <hi>Stone of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> because it so tingeth the bodies of men in such a manner, as they write of theirs. But mine is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared according to their Process; for we mean not that same here in this place, nor indeed do we know it; We do not at all set down in this our <hi>Practick,</hi> the Process of the Operation, for we mentioned that afore in the beginning of the Book, where we wrote of its <hi>Virtues</hi> and <hi>Operations</hi> which it hath by the <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But verily you shall further observe the Ingress of the Penetration, whereby it penetrates the whole body, and whatsoever is therein; for by its penetration it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stores and renews it, not that it wholly removes it, and introduceth a new body in its stead; or, that it doth (like the <hi>Prima Materia)</hi> infuse its Spermatical <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num:</hi> but thus, It doth so purge the old, as the <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders</hi> Skin is cleansed, without any hurt or defect; and yet nevertheless the old Skin abides both in its Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and Form; even so in like sort doth this <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers stone</hi> purge the Heart, and all the capital Members, and the Intestines, the Marrow, and whatever else is contained in the body it self. It permits not the bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57672:39"/>
forth of any Disease in the body; but the Gout, the Dropsie, the yellow Jaundice, the Collick-Passion, and all the Sicknesses proceeding from the Four Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, it turns them all out, it also purgeth the bodies, and renders them in such wise, as if they were but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly born; it bannisheth every thing that endeavours to destroy Nature, no otherwise then as Fire doth to Worms and Vermine, even so do all infirmities what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever shun this <hi>Renovation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These are the Virtues that this <hi>Philosophers stone</hi> hath, whereby it expels such, and so many wonderful Diseases, not by reason of its Complexion, or Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick form, or its Propriety, or by any accidental Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but from the powers of the subtility of the <hi>Practise,</hi> with which tis indued by the Preparations, Reverbera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Sublimations, Digestions, Distillations, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by its various Reductions and Resolutions, all which kind of Operations do bring the <hi>stone</hi> to such a virtuous subtility and acuity, that 'tis even wonderful: Not that it had those Virtues at the beginning, but that they are at length attributed thereunto. The like may be apprehended as to Honey, the which is by its Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation rendred far more acute then any <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and any Corrosive, and more penetrative then any kind of Sublimate. Now it hath not naturally such a property of Sharpness; but it meerly proceeds from the Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which changeth all this Honey into a Corrosive: This also is to be observed in those efficacious <hi>Arcanaes</hi> that such as use them, (and likewise the Children that are born from them) will live so healthfully afterwards, that there can be no Sickness or contrariety, or any such like Corruption happen in their bodies; But they will be wholly adorned with such a subtile and clean Complexion of Nature and such a Condition, as 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to induce a more noble Complexionated state; for that most choise and most excellent Medicine doth
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57672:40"/>
very much amend and cleanse, and doth introduce a Life incorruptible, such as cannot be contaminated or defiled with any life; for it suffers not any thing to wither, but causeth men to live in the highest nobility of Nature, and promotes or gives vigour unto their Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring, even unto the tenth Generation.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Philosophers stone</hi> doth not only transmute one weight, but that weight doth again transmute Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and this likewise another, &amp;c. insomuch that those mutations may be almost extended even to Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; even as one light enkindles another, and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a third, &amp;c. The like may be understood of this <hi>Philosophers stone,</hi> in relation to health, even as out of a Good Tree proceeds a good Seed and good Succours, and Cions, out of which good Trees may again be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. The virtue and power of the <hi>Philosophick stone</hi> is exalted in a wonderful manner, that it is even im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be found out how that can be naturally so brought to passe. And were it not for those most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent signes that are visible to our Eyes, it woule be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven incredible, that men could perfect and accomplish such wonderful things; for the virtue of that Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion passeth from one Generation to another without Corruption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Likewise it consists, by the mercy of God, in one body, and is denyed to others, or of meer grace vouchsafed unto them, according as their deserving is.</p>
                     <p>Now we will set down the <hi>Process</hi> of this <hi>Philosophick stone</hi> after this manner;</p>

Those bodies which it penetrates are permanent in the <hi>Cineritium,</hi> or <hi>Cupel,</hi> and cannot in the least be reduced unto nothing, or be altered; but the <hi>stone</hi> takes away every superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Quality from Sensible and Insensible things, as we have afore declared. And albeit we have set down a very short way, yet notwithstanding it requires a <hi>proliae</hi> labour, difficult and hard by reason of the many Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances that attend it, and it needs such an Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour as is not affected with any <hi>nauseate</hi> or wearisome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but is highly diligent and expert.</p>

                     <head>Of Mercurius Vitae.</head>
                     <p>NOw wee'l write of <hi>Mercurius Vitae,</hi> the virtue of which doth far excel the virtues of the two prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents <hi>Arcanaes;</hi> for its virtue Consists not in the Art, nor in the Operation, but in the <hi>Mercurius Vitae</hi> it self; nor have we ever known any Simple thing that's like unto it; for as much as that Nature and property is as it were innate therein; nor is it from the virtues of the Quintessence, nor of the Elements, but from the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Quality of its Predestination; Neither hath it only the virtues of Transmuting persons, and other Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentials, but also of renewing every Growing Thing, and such like, out of the old Quality into a new, <hi>viz.</hi> on this wise; The <hi>Mercurius Vitae</hi> reduceth <hi>Mars</hi> into its First Matter, and doth again so Transmute it into its perfect Matter, that Iron is again made thereof; After the same manner it reneweth Gold likewise, the which it reduceth into its proper Mercury and Tincture, and again digesteth it into Gold, so as to become a Metal like the former.</p>
                     <p>Nor doth it Operate thus in Metals only, but also in other things, as Herbs, &amp;c. When their Roots are
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57672:41"/>
perfused or moistened therewithal, they will bring forth Flowers and Fruits a second time; If when the first seed shall fall off, they be at that time moistened with the same as above, they will produce second Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Fruits without any respect of Time.</p>
                     <p>The same is to be understood of Men, and Beasts, &amp;c. to whom if this Mercury be Applyed or administred, it Renovates all their Old and Consumed Members, and restoreth the deficient and lost Virtues, into the Youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful-like Body or Habitation; insomuch, that the Months and Blood do as Naturally slow in old Women, as in the Younger. It doth likewise reduce the Aged Wise into the like perfection of Nature, as the Younger sort are in.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore this also is to be observed concerning the <hi>Arcanum vitae,</hi> or this secret of life, that its so po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Virtues exist in its Specifick Form, by which it Separates the Old from the New, or Age from Youth, the Latter of which two, <hi>viz.</hi> youth is encreased thereby, and so the Age renewed. From hence it may be gathered, that that Youthfulness and the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour thereof, is not at all defective and lacking to Old Age, but is as well and equally in the Old as in the Young; But the Corruption that grows up with, and encreaseth in youth, becomes so fortified and strong, that it takes away the Vigour therefrom, from whence Antientnesse is known.</p>
                     <p>And therefore when that same Corruption is Separated from the Youthfulness, this Juvenility doth again ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest it self, without Controversy and Impediment. The which is to be thus understood, <hi>viz.</hi> When any Body (or Carcase) putrefies, the Quintessence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth not become Rotten, but is alwayes fresh and unconsumed, and is Separated from the Carcase into the Air, or sometimes is scattered and dispersed into the Earth, or into the Water, and goes unto its place.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57672:41"/>
For there can be no destruction made of the Quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, the which is most worthy noting, and highly to be admired, as we teach concerning Corruption and Generation; So also a <hi>Rose</hi> putrefied in <hi>Dung,</hi> retains its Quintessence in it self, yea even in the Dung. And although all of it stink and are putrid, yet nevertheless in the Separation of the Pure from the Impure, the Quintessence lives without defect or blemish, and the Bodies are stinking Carcases. Thus therefore say we of <hi>Mercurius vitae</hi> that it Separates Corruption, even as Rotten Wood is Separated from the Sound Timber. Tis also so powerful in man, that after the corruption shall be Separated from him, the Quintessence is again stirred and liveth, as in its Youth. But you are to understand me thus; not that the <hi>Mercurius vitae,</hi> excites a New Essence, as some may maliciously inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret our meaning and experience, but that the Essence, and youthful Spirit, which the juvenile Virtues proceed and go forth, do remain unconsumed although by being oppressed it may be accounted for dead; therefore <hi>M. V.</hi> Separates the Impuritie, whereby it comes to pass, that the Old Life doth most efficaciously recover its virtues, as afore; even as in our formentioned Example of the <hi>King-Fisher,</hi> we have declared, that that Bird is renewed after death; the Reason is this, because its Quintessence doth not withdraw from its house and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding place; but if that lodging be dissolved by Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, then is the Quintessence received into that thing which it lies or is cast upon; Therefore there are oft-times found wonderful Conditions of Nature in growing Things, the which are not of their Nature, but of a like Accident, as we set down in our Book of <hi>Generations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This therefore is to be this way understood. In <hi>Dung</hi> there is a Concurrency and an Accumulation of Various Corruptions, <hi>viz.</hi> of Hearbs, Roots, Fruits, Waters,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57672:42"/>
and other such like Things; from whence it so comes to pass, that the Ground is not made Fat and Fertile because of the Corruption; but because of the Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence that is in the said <hi>Dung,</hi> the which be taking it Self into the Roots, Exhibits Virtues to Growing Things, but the Body it self vanisheth, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Dung,</hi> and is reduced into nothing, and is consumed in its sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. And therefore <hi>Mans-dung</hi> or Excrements hath very great Virtues, because it contains in it the Noble Essences, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Food and Drink, concerning which Wonderful Things might be Written; for the Body receives not any thing there-from, save nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but it receives not the Essence, even as we write of <hi>Nourishments.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to come nearer to the <hi>Praxis</hi> of <hi>Mercurius vitae,</hi> which doth (as we said afore) perfect its Operations af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a wonderful manner, <hi>viz.</hi> in casting off the Nailes of the Hands and Feet, and by Rooting out gray Hairs, it strengthens Youth, in so much that Corruption cannot come to that height as to discover old-age, by those signes attending it, except a following or second Age be again arived unto, or setting about the Practise; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will tell it the <hi>Alchymists</hi> in a very few words, for tis needless to write much, and to Preach <hi>Prolixly</hi> of these things; but as for such as are Foolish preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, we will Exclude them wholly. This then is the way of its <hi>Practick,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take Mercurie Essentificated,</hi> the which Separate from all its Supersluities, as the Pure from the Impure; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Sublime it with <hi>Antimony,</hi> so that they may both of them ascend and be made <hi>one;</hi> then let them be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved upon a Marble and be Coagulated, and do thus even four times. Which being finished, thou shalt have the <hi>Mercurius vitae</hi> which we have so much men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned afore, and with which we shall comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh our old Age, as with an <hi>Arcanum.</hi>

                     <p>AFter the same ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner is the <hi>Arcanum</hi> of the <hi>Tincture</hi> to be understood, <hi>viz.</hi> that it takes away all the unwildinesse of Old Age, and every disease, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever corrupts the health, and that hath an inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on contrary thereunto. This <hi>Arcanum</hi> is a certain <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi> of such like properties and Conditions as to Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and introduce Health; not after that same way as the three former do, but according to its Name, for the <hi>Tincture</hi> tingeth the Good and the Evil, the Gross and the Subtile. Nor doth it otherwise then so, perfect its Oparations in the Body likewise, so as to transmute the Corrupt and Disorderly complexions into sound and healthy, like that <hi>Tincture</hi> that makes <hi>Luna</hi> of <hi>Mercury;</hi> it Separates not the evil there from, but tingeth both the Good &amp; the evil that they finally become together most excellent. So likewise doth this Tincture tinge the Hydropical and scteritial Body into a sound State; not that the Dropsie is took away, the Original driven out or Separated from the Good, but is transmuted into Good, even as is behooveful &amp; is constituted in its high, yea best degree, even as the Corrupted Dung or Mud, may by the Subtile Corruption of <hi>Art,</hi> be brought into an <hi>Elixir,</hi> able to drive forth every Corruption; and that Corruption is not Separated, but the whole Substance is transmuted into another Qualitie and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>The self-same is to be supposed of this <hi>Tincture,</hi> that it tingeth the Body without any Separation of the evil from the good or expulsion of Mans first Essence, but by the renovation thereof.</p>
                     <p>But yet this is to be known, that that tinged body lives no more in the Old Form, but is after the manner of Metal, transmuted into into another; as Copper or
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57672:43"/>
any other may. Likewise <hi>Saturn</hi> hath not in it self its Old Quality, but the Qualitie of the <hi>Tincture</hi> it self; The very same is to be understood of tinged Bodies, such as have received the tinging of the <hi>Tincture,</hi> that they exist no more in the former life from which they were transmuted by the <hi>Tincture,</hi> but the condition of the Body, and Form, or Beauty, is far Nobler, better, and more Healthful then its Native Original was, and is like to Gold in Nature, made by the <hi>Tincture</hi> out of Iron, as we have likewise written concerning <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If therefore this <hi>Tincture</hi> is a Transmutress of Bodies to a better State, as that of Metals (which so few have the Knowledg and Experience of) is; there shall be so many such like Various Corporeal <hi>Tinctures,</hi> as there are Metaline Tinctures; of which as one is alwayes better then another, so are the Corporal. Tis to be observed, that some are naturally <hi>Tinctures,</hi> as <hi>Saffron,</hi> a Flower and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> some are so made by Art, as the Stone, <hi>Realgar,</hi> &amp;c. These Things are most heedfully to be observed, because the beginning and entrance that they exhibit to those Tinctures is not small.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore tis to be considered, that those <hi>Tinctures</hi> ought to be made for the Seven Principal members, and their propertie to be attributed and given to each of them, as those that serve the Heart to the heart; to the brain such things as are sutable unto it; and those <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures</hi> must be prepared from Metals, Hearbs, and such like things as are proper. Hence will it come to pass, that by them the whole Body may be Tinged. Nor will it be sufficient that it be tinged by one <hi>Tincture</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but even as one <hi>Tincture</hi> doth onely Tinge one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, the like is to be supposed of these. The Practise therefore of the <hi>Tincture</hi> is this;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take the Essence of the Members,</hi> from which Essence you must Separate the Elements; afterwards put their

Fire in Digestion, and leave it so long until there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides nothing more in the bottom, and that there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not at all any thing of the Matter, Substantially. Then take the Matter and the Glass well Luted after this manner with the Lute of Hermes, and set it in a Moist and Cold place, in which place they will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain resolved into a Visible <hi>Matter;</hi> that Visible <hi>Matter</hi> is that <hi>Tincture</hi> whereof we wrote; and thus with these few we will conclude; For should we write more of this, the <hi>Stoicks</hi> would deride it, and therefore we will free our selves from their scoffing, and speak onely to the <hi>Alchimists.</hi>

                     <p>HAving thus finished the Precedent Books of the most excellent Medicaments; we have intended to adjoyn this Book of <hi>Magiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi> And first of all to declare what a <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi> is; This therefore is a <hi>Magistery, viz.</hi> that which can be Extracted out of things, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Separation or Preparation of the Elements; and yet notwithstanding, the Powers and Virtues of the things, are by the addition of some thing, Attracted into that matter, and conserved there.</p>
                     <p>Those Virtues do not at all proceed from the nature of the things, as in reference to the operation, nor do they proceed from a <hi>Specifick</hi> Virtue, but from the Permixion, by which those same virtues are extracted; If Vinegar be poured into Wine, it makes it all Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, this now is a Magistery. But if Wine be poured upon Hony, that is not wholly transmuted hereinto, wherefore it is not a Magistery.</p>
                     <p>Those things therefore are to be considered that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to a <hi>Migistery,</hi> even as, What Wines do to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57672:44"/>
Acetum; for such as are perfect, and are, as is fit they should be, they are not in the least apt hereunto, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they make a <hi>Magistery.</hi> Therefore the Natures of things are to be considered; likewise the difference of the Extractions of Magisteries is to be heeded, as out of Metals, Marcasites, Stones, Hearbs, and such like Matters, by those things which are not Metalick, and are yet nevertheless made like to Metals, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then as Wine is made like to Vinegar, both in Powers, Virtues, and Sapour. And that the Wine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears nor different from the Acetum, the cause there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, because there is also a Nature like Acetum, in it, whence it comes to passe that their Natures have one and the same appearance. So likewise i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Moreover as concerning the Additions, this is to be noted, <hi>viz.</hi> those Things that are assumed to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and purpose, although they are not of one and the same Complexion, Power, or Act, yet nevertheless they agree and accord in the preparation; For that which results from the Virtues thereof, is an appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and not complexionated product. By those <hi>Mediums</hi> do the Metals themselves afford their <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,</hi> the which indeed may be accounted no lesse then Quintessences, as to their Virtues. Gold doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posit and lay down in its <hi>Magistery</hi> all its Quality and Complexion in one essence; And it is not to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore supposed, that because the Body is of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Value, that therefore the rest will be infected therewith; No, for the Leprosie thereof doth not at all hurt in this place, but the whole is good Sugar is intirely sweet, whilest tis yet in its Body and not Separated, and it also may be so prepared (with an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57672:45"/>
in its sweetnesse) that it may become far more sweet and efficacious then it was afore; but the abstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Quintessence is not sweeter then in or with i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> own Body. Wherefore this Body doth not at all bring any dammage thereunto. But yet notwithstanding the Virtue thereof Separated from the Body, is more Noble, then being prepared in or with it. But the <hi>Magisterie</hi> doth amend it more then Nature could.</p>
                     <p>The very same also is to be understood of those Stones that enter into the number of Magisteries, and likewise of their Bodies, <hi>viz.</hi> that that which is assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med about the use of them, is not defective in its Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but is a <hi>Magistery</hi> sufficiently strong. This you are to understand on this wise, even as when <hi>Sulphur</hi> is kindled and wholly burnt up, that which burns it is the very least portion thereof; so likewise the stones; as for Example, Chrystal, when tis reduced into a <hi>Magisterie,</hi> it brings all Stones into their <hi>First Matter,</hi> and grinds them after a wonderful manner no otherwise then the Essence thereof; and that s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> this Reason, because the Body may be, or is tinged by the Quintessence, and may be accounted for an Essence no otherwise then as Vinegar and Wine is; One where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doth make the other like it self without any defect In like manner, tis not onely so in <hi>Stones,</hi> that the <hi>Tincture</hi> is thus made, but also in such like Metals a the Quintessence of Gold Tingeth all its Body into a pure Quintessence, the which light we account of a great, yea too too great, <hi>viz.</hi> the light of all the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of our <hi>Archidoxis;</hi> and therefore we kindle Coals with a cheerful mind, that so we may find the final con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of those Noble <hi>Mysteries</hi> of <hi>Nature;</hi> We draw our Instructions from Examples, proved experimenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by us, as in <hi>Magisteries,</hi> and chiefly in that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Gold, the which contains both the Body, and the Quintessence equally as well as the Quintessence
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57672:45"/>
it self is, that is drawn therefrom. And therefore <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisteries</hi> are known to us to be gifted with peculiar Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and we write them down, to our praise, even to death.</p>
                     <p>We speak in like manner of the <hi>Magisteries</hi> of <hi>Hearbs,</hi> the which are so effectual, that half an <hi>ounce</hi> of them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates more then an hundred <hi>ounces</hi> of their Body, and the reason is, because that scarce the hundredth part is the Quintessence. Wherefore the quantitie of it being so very little, the greater heap thereof is to be used and administred, which is not required in <hi>Magisteries;</hi> for in those the whole quantitie of the Hearbs is reduced into a <hi>Magisterie,</hi> the which is not then to be esteemed inferiour (by reason of its Artifice) to the true extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Natural <hi>Quintessence</hi> it self; one part of this being administred, is more profitable then an hundred parts of the like Body, and that for this reason; because the <hi>Magisteries</hi> are prepared, and are rendred accute to the highest degree, and are brought to a qualitie, equal to a <hi>Quintessence,</hi> in the which <hi>Magisteries</hi> all the Virtues and Powers of the whole Body are present, and from them Virtues, doth its help and succor arise unto it. For in them doth the Penetrabilitie and Power of the whole Body exist, from the permixion that is made therewith; for the Body doth not receive any of these with desire or affection, but such things onely as are spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual to it self; whereby it comes to pass, that it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts that <hi>Magisterie,</hi> and permixeth itself therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, no otherwise then as even Gold draws to it self the <hi>Mercurie</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> and is commixed therewith (the which thing Iron doth not do, and the reason is this, because they are not so agreeable betwixt themselves in the Composition) and so, both the Body of it, and this <hi>Magistery</hi> are <hi>Amalgamated</hi> together and made <hi>one;</hi> concerning which product many Examples are to be found, which we shall not mention in this Place. Some
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57672:46"/>
of the <hi>Marcasites</hi> do after the same manner perfect the Operation of their Medicinal properties; but yet with this difference, <hi>viz.</hi> they leave their Body and the best part of them onely (as the juyce) is extracted, and is neverthelesse a Magistery, albeit the Body be Separated therefrom; But yet this is to be understood, that that is not the Body of the <hi>Marcasite,</hi> but rather of the Earth or Mineral, in which the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casite</hi> doth lie; for it hath not such an efficacious Virtue of it self, whereby to be Separated from the Earth, or <hi>Minera,</hi> but abides therein, as a <hi>Marcasite,</hi> and is so accounted of. And therefore to declare a <hi>Magisterie</hi> what it is, of what it is made, and what Virtues it is endued withal, we will in what follows, set down the Practise thereof, and likewise describe the Artifice of its Preparation; but yet this Process cannot be couched in one General Explication, but there must be a particular treating of each, as of the Metals by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, also of the <hi>Marcasites</hi> by themselves, and so of the Stones and Hearbs.</p>
                     <p>Likewise there is to be had a Singular <hi>Magistery</hi> of <hi>Blood,</hi> and this is also taught by a Peculiar way and manner. In it is to be considered, what the Virtues and Powers of a man are, and that the Nature of it contains in it self, in what things there is a defect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but yet without the diminution of the Natural Creation it self, but is to be considered as a work perfect &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat with its parts, even as a bird with all its Feathers.</p>

                     <p>And whereas a great regard is to be had of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement and affinitie, therefore the Temperate alone will be suitable thereunto; but now you are to know what that Temperate Thing is; a Temperate Thing, a Complexionated somewhat or Body, for this doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the other into it self, and is incorporated with that whereto it shall be adjoyned, so that it doth not any more discover the old, and its own complexion, but the Virtues of that Body onely which shall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto it; Thus indeed <hi>Vinum ardens,</hi> or burning Wine hath in it self a full and perfect complexion, but yet it doth (as I may so speak) Complexionate that which is put into it, much more abundantly, and doth so perfect its oparation, according to the Virtues of that Body which was put therein.</p>
                     <p>And therefore seeing it doth thus Attract the Virtues of another and tame its own, it is for this reason said to be Temperate, and is deservedly called so. But here are some destinctions to be noted, for we mean the Elements onely, and we may speak so of oyl, the which draws to itself the Natures of others, and hides its own Element. Out of any thing that is like to these may be made a <hi>Magisterie;</hi> so that the Virtues of the <hi>metals</hi> may pass into that same temperate thing, and may be mundified and purified therewith, and be destil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led even to their limit or end, such a like <hi>Magistery</hi> after it shal be perfected, shal be called <hi>Potable,</hi> and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it may be taken in drink, whence it comes to passe, that the <hi>Magistery</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> is called <hi>Aurum Pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile,</hi>

                        <p>THE <hi>Magistery</hi> out of precious <hi>Stones,</hi> is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood after the same manner, as that out of Metals, as to the Virtues, which each Stone hath according to its Nature; But this is to be noted, that for Stones there needs no <hi>Temperatum,</hi> nor any kind of Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because their solution is not the same with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of the Metals, but the <hi>Magistery</hi> of them is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by another way; in the practise of which there are three Processes to be understood, one for <hi>Gems,</hi> a second for <hi>Marcasites,</hi> and a third for <hi>Corrals;</hi> by which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57672:47"/>
three all stony growing Things may be brought into their proper Magisterie. As for the process of Stones, their Colours are not to be observed, neither their brightnesse and claritie to be heeded, for that all the Magisteries of them have a white Colour. So likewise <hi>Pearls, Corral</hi> excepted, for they hold their Colour singularly above the others in the Magistery; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Colour in them is to be chiefly noted; for the Magisterie of them, together with the Body and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and whole Essence is Extracted (by additions) without corrupting them, and may neverthelesse be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain restored into their perfection; and therefore as to their Generation and Nature, they cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Stones, and yet have they a Stony condition. This also may be done, <hi>viz.</hi> the whole Colour may be Extracted out of the Body of the <hi>Corrals,</hi> into another <hi>medium,</hi> and there may afterwards be made an image or frame of their Bodies, as of Clay; and after this frame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may the Colours be again infused, and be made as good <hi>Corral</hi> as afore. But now this cannot possibly be done so with <hi>Pearls,</hi> not with <hi>Gems,</hi> for they cannot by the same Rule be any more reduced into their perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but they remain in a Magistery, their essence not being corrupted. We have likewise perceived it to have pierced the Glasses, and the Instruments, and to have informed and stamped them according to its own Nature. As thus, The Magisterie of the <hi>Magnet,</hi> it hath drawn unto it self, in the form and manner of the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Magnet,</hi> and hath afterwards fixt it into the Glass, and hath tinged it, so that even this also hath attracted Needles and Straws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The same is to be understood of the rest, and therefore are they to be kept in Gold onely; we have met with more such things as these then is credible, of the which sort we make here a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial onely, that so by this guiding, more thin as may be searched out in Arts and Magisteries; Whereas
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57672:48"/>
therefore they require a peculiar demonstration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, or different from the other Extractions. We will now Teach their <hi>Practise</hi> on this wise; And first of <hi>Gems</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Gems,</hi> (and first of all grind or beat them, and Calcine them according to a Reverberatory condition) and Common <hi>Saltnitre,</hi> in equal weight, <hi>viz.</hi> a pound; the which burn together excellently well into a Calx, and after let them be washed with <hi>burning Wine,</hi> so long, until there be found no more superflous Matter; After the Washing, Calcine this matter again, and proceed in all respects as afore, and so the whole will passe into the <hi>burning Wine.</hi> Evaporate this by <hi>Ebullition,</hi> so shalt thou have an <hi>Alkali,</hi> the which being Resolved into a Water, keep. There's no reason that thou shouldst abhor the use of the administration hereof, how acute or Calcineous soever it be; for 'tis by that acuïty alone that it Operates upon that which resists it; and it is so Subtile, that one only drop tingeth the Whole body into a singular Virtue.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Likewise Pearles</hi> are to be reduced into a Water on this wise, <hi>viz Take</hi> Corrected Vinegar, whereto put the Pearles being bruised, and let them digest therein for a Month, and so will they be Resolved into a Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; then Distil it and Separate the <hi>Acetum</hi> therefrom by a <hi>B;</hi> this done, thou shalt find the Pearls in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom Resolved into a Water: this is the <hi>Magistery of Pearls or Unions.</hi> And although the <hi>process</hi> of this <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick</hi> be an easie and short way, yet nevertheless (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him that hath Experienced it, for) Wonderful is the Operation of them; but yet this activity of their virtues is not made by Art, but is placed even in the Nature of them, and is hidden in their grosse sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, by reason of which they cannot Operate no more then a dead body, but a Resolution being made, their body will be vivified; but of this enough.</p>

But now <hi>Corrals</hi> are to be ground and Calcined (at the beginning) with <hi>Salt nitre,</hi> then afterwards to be prepared as the <hi>Gems</hi> are, and to be also Resolved; So hast thou the <hi>Magistery of Corrals,</hi> the virtues of which I do most highly and peculiarly admire, which God hath bestowed on this Growing Thing, and which are of such a powerful and wonderful Operation, according to the admirableness of their Growth,</p>

                     <head>Of the Extraction of the Magistery out of Marcasites.</head>
                     <p>AS concerning the <hi>Magisteries of Marcasites,</hi> this is necessary to be known, That they onely are Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals; and therefore the Mineral is not adduced into its <hi>Magistry,</hi> but the true <hi>Marchasite</hi> only, as is also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent in Metals, the which do not passe into their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistery</hi> unlesse they be first Separted from their Mineral: And although that <hi>Marcasites</hi> cannot well be Separated therefrom, yet neverthelesse it may be done in the <hi>Magisteries.</hi> There are indeed various kinds of <hi>Marca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites,</hi> as the Golden, Silverish, the Golden Talk, the White, and the Purple, the Tinny or Bismutey; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, Granate, and other such like; to all which, notwithstanding, there's one only Extraction is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Likewise the Virtues and Powers of them do in in Medicine shew and discover themselves according to the Conditions of the Metalick Operations. And though they be not in Metals, yet notwithstanding have they the Properties of them, Therefore wee'l now set down a few things thereabouts, because we mention them more at large in our <hi>Book of Extrinsecals.</hi> There is a difference, or distinction to be observed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as is their particular Affinity and Agreement; as Gold and the Marcasite, Antimony and Lead, the which in their framing and Constelation, may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57672:49"/>
to each other mutually, but are neverthelesse Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated in Virtue; For in some <hi>Marcasites</hi> there is more virtues then in the <hi>Cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>milar,</hi> or like Metals. This we see happens in Lead and Antimony; of which two, this latter Cures the Leaprous, the Morphew, the <hi>Alopecia,</hi> &amp; the like, and all Scabs, &amp; Scars, or Chops, the <hi>Leonine, Elephantiack,</hi> and <hi>Tyrian, &amp;c.</hi> which the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistery</hi> of <hi>Lead</hi> or <hi>Saturne</hi> doth not do; Therefore the Properties of this kind are to be noted, the which do sometimes lie hid, not only in great but even in lesser thing, and that more abundantly. Therefore lets pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the searching out this Reason, Why Antimony possesseth more virtues then its Metal doth? You must note, that the body thereof is not fix, nor sufficiently digested into its own Perfection as <hi>Saturne</hi> is; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it assumes a <hi>volatile Property.</hi> But the Matter it self out of which tis born, is Beereavative (or capable of divesting) and Mundificative of its own natural Property, which so remained uncorrupt, as we set down in the <hi>Book of Generations.</hi> Hence tis, That it purgeth Gold and Silver more then the fire or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Element doth; thereupon also it Mundifies and purgeth the body, even as Gold and Silver are freed by it of all their Impurities; The <hi>Magistery</hi> of Antimony expels the Leaprosie more then is Credible. The like is to be understood of the rest.</p>
                     <p>Now lets proceed to the <hi>Practise,</hi> whereby we teach the preparations of the <hi>Magistery</hi> from them all, on this wise;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take</hi> a <hi>Marcasite,</hi> grind it most subtilly, and put to it so much dissolving Water as may over-top it the breadth of six fingers; Let it be dissolved, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be putrified for a Month, then let it be Distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and be Separated, as we teach of Metals. This done, thou shalt have the <hi>Magistery</hi> of that <hi>Marcasite</hi> thou tookest.</p>

                        <p>NOr is it to be otherwise conceived of about the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the <hi>Magistery of Fatty Substances;</hi> as the at of Amber, of Rozins, Oyls, and others, as they appear in the like Material Substances; concerning which, there are Three waves of Extracting of their <hi>Magisteries;</hi> one peculiar way is of Amber, another of Rozins, and the other of Fatty Things; as Oyls, Fats, Butter, and such like. For Amber cannot at all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the <hi>Process</hi> of the Extraction of Fatty Things, because, thereby its virtues would be lost. Likewise Resinous Things cannot undergo the practise upon Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, for it would be destructive to them; Therefore we will teach the preparations of those Magisteries in Three wayes; Seeing that there appears such excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent virtues in Fats, and that variously; There, where Essences can Operate nothing at all, do the Fatty Things help; for they have that property by reason of their Specifick and Appropriate Virtue, which is not found to be so perfect in other things, nor indeed is it; and as the difference is betwixt <hi>Corrals</hi> &amp; <hi>Gems,</hi> so also is it to be understood of these; The <hi>Practise</hi> of them is this, and first of the <hi>Amber.</hi>

May it so remain.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Resinous</hi> bodies are reduced unto their <hi>Magiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> on this wise;</p>

please, put it into a Glasse luted, and let it be digested for a Month <hi>per se</hi> in a hot digestion; then being mixt with the dissolving Water, let it be boyled in <hi>burning Wine,</hi> for half an hour only.

Therefore tis no wayes convenient to do this same thing. So by how much the oftner the best Vinegar is Distilled, so much the remoter doth it recede from the Spirit of <hi>Wine:</hi> Upon which account 'tis to be considered with the highest diligence, that the Quintessence be not by any means Corrupted in the <hi>Magisteries,</hi> but rather that it be augmented and fortified in its Virtues: Likewise, when it is Separated without Fire, it cannot by any means be a <hi>Magistery,</hi> because there is the Substantiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wanting. You are therefore to know that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the <hi>Wine</hi> is to be conserved together with its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and not with its Phlegm: For there are Two Substances to be found in Wine; the one is Winey, in which the Spirit of the Wine is, and from which it cannot be Separated; the other is Phlegmatick, which
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57672:51"/>
is permixed with the <hi>feces,</hi> and the sweet, or <hi>insipid</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, both which are to be Separated from the true Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, as a Metal from its Mineral, or Earth.</p>

Therefore wee'l set down the <hi>Practise</hi> for a remembrance, that so we may not forget it: and 'tis thus;</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Take</hi> the oldest <hi>Wine;</hi> and the best that you can get, both as to Colour and Taste, what you please; put it into a Glasse Vessel, so that a Third part thereof may be full; and shut it with the Seal of <hi>Hermes,</hi> and keep it in Horse dung, and in a continued Heat for four months; let it not be defective, <hi>viz.</hi> your Heat. This being done, then in the Winter-time, when the Cold and Frost are extreamly sharp, set it abroad in the cold for a month that it may be Congealed; After this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Cold doth thrust the Spirit of the Wine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with its Substance into the Centre of the Wine and Separate it from the Phlegm: That which is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed or Frozen, cast away; but that which is not Congealed, you may account to be the Spirit with the Substance; Put this in a <hi>Pellican</hi> in a digestion of Sand, but not too hot, and there let it abide for some time; Afterwards take forth the <hi>Magistery</hi> of the <hi>Wine,</hi> of which we have now spoken.

                     <p>IT now remains that we speak of <hi>Specificks,</hi> in the which there are exceeding, admirable, and great Virtues, which do not derive or take their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal from Nature, as in reference to Heat, and Cold; but they have besides those Qualities, one only Nature and Essence, as we have hinted in many places. That same <hi>Specificality</hi> taketh its Original and Rise from External Things; as, when you throw some Wood into the fire, and it burns, that now is not an Action of its proper Nature, but is Wood, or a Wood. Essence; Therefore also <hi>Specificks</hi> are generated from a Conjunction; as, when <hi>Mastich</hi> and <hi>Colophony</hi> are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med together, an Attractive is produced, the which neither of them is <hi>per se,</hi> or <hi>simple;</hi> Or when <hi>Turpentine</hi> is Coagulated, there is made a Stone thence-from, which attracteth Iron to itself like the Magnet. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more such like Things there are which have such Virtues, but yet 'tis from their Compositions, and from without. <hi>Ellebor</hi> also is Composed of the Liquor of Stone and Earth; by the Composition of those Two
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57672:53"/>
doth arise the <hi>Specificality,</hi> So the Oyl of Cherries with Vinegar, do (after their digestion) become a Laxative, and yet neither of them doth of its own Nature loosen; Wherefore those kind of <hi>Specificks</hi> are born of their own proper nature, by the Composition of their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and a proper matter, no otherwise then as Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture or Colour, the which doth not arise from Cold and Heat, but from the Composition; as Galls with Vitriol produce Ink, whereas neither of them is black; So likwise <hi>Sal armoniack</hi> and <hi>Urine</hi> do make a black Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and yet are both of them white: The same is to be understood of <hi>Specificks, viz.</hi> That they do in-like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manner receive their Original; but some things which assume those same Virtue from without may be in any Herb, but yet not in <hi>One</hi> kind or property, the which is to be thus understood, <hi>viz.</hi> Wheresoever the Magnet grows, there is a certain Attractive; as <hi>Colocynthis</hi> is a Purgative, and <hi>Poppy</hi> an Anodine: This now procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the Composition existing in them; from whence it comes to passe that every Magnet is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive, and every <hi>Colocynthis</hi> purgative; But the Case stands not thus with the <hi>Specificks</hi> from without, the Condition of them is thus, <hi>viz.</hi> If one Flint should have the Virtues of the Magnet, and another like it should have none, now this <hi>Specificality</hi> shall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, or from without; but yet tis rare to find a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Condition or Quality to be in <hi>One</hi> Herb, and yet not as well in <hi>Another</hi> that is like it. Furthermore, although many such like <hi>Specificks</hi> do arise from Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, yet neverthelesse we will not much dispute (in this place) concerning their proceeding, or not-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding therefrom but will reserve that for its proper place in <hi>Physick,</hi> and rather forbear here.</p>
                     <p>Besides, There are to be found many <hi>Specificks,</hi> as <hi>Odoriferous Specificks,</hi> which have their Original from Composition and Digestion, as the Water of <hi>Vitriol</hi>
                        <pb n="98" facs="tcp:57672:54"/>
Distilled with <hi>Sal armoniack</hi> resembles the Odour of <hi>Musk;</hi> and yet neither of them have such a smell, <hi>per se.</hi> Many more such things there are that become Odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and were not so afore, and do got a noble Odour; as a <hi>Rose,</hi> or <hi>Lilly,</hi> in whom there's no Odour at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but tis at last stirred up by Labour, Digestion, and Separation.</p>
                     <p>In like manner <hi>Cow-dung</hi> is a stinking Excrement; but if it be but Elevated or Distilled it gets an Odour of <hi>Ambergreece;</hi> but the residue of the matter that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides in the bottom, stinks more loathsome then mans Ordure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Some Specificks</hi> are <hi>Diaphoretick,</hi> and provoke Sweat, which receive such a Virtue from a Composition; as a burning <hi>Coal</hi> put at top of a fat Earth, emits a Vapour; So likewise <hi>Ginger</hi> thrust into, or conveyed into the body, burns; and is to be extinguished as Calx or Lime, with the pouring on of Water. This Heat hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to the <hi>Ginger</hi> by reason of that acuity or sharpness which it contains in it self, and is Coagulated with an hot Element, as a Lime-stone, which is brought to such an heat by the fire. For every <hi>Diaphoretick</hi> is the Calx of the Liquour of the Earth, even as we mention it in the <hi>Book of Generations.</hi> In like manner do even <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives</hi> proceed from a Composition; as <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> the which also is the Calx of a Liquour, but yet with a certain difference and distinction interveening; For as <hi>Tartar</hi> being burnt is Resolved into a Water, and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with it all its Liquidity, if it shall be laid up in a moist place. So is it also with <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> and so may you judge of other <hi>Purges,</hi> which have their Original many waves, as the Calx of the Earth is; for some of them do <hi>Purge</hi> or <hi>Dissolve</hi> Choler, as <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> the which is like to Calcined <hi>Tartar;</hi> Some loosen <hi>Phlegm,</hi> as <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bith, (This seems to have been inserted Suppositiously because that a</hi> WORD <hi>was wanting in the Authors own</hi>

Others <hi>Purge</hi> Melancholy, as <hi>Sena;</hi> the which you are to understand thus, <hi>viz.</hi> 'Tis after the manner of <hi>Nitre,</hi> which Resolveth Stones with its power, and not any other thing. Some <hi>purge</hi> the <hi>Bloud,</hi> as <hi>Manna;</hi> like to in the manner of <hi>Arsenick</hi> which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves <hi>Sublimates.</hi> On this wise are you to determine of the difference of those things, even as they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in themselves, and as we have now minded you of. Likewise some <hi>Comfortatives</hi> do arise from a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, as a <hi>Sperm</hi> destitute of virtues, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing out of it a <hi>Glandule</hi> or <hi>Kernel</hi> is Generated by Nature, by reason of its Predestination: So therefore a <hi>Comfortative</hi> it self, is a certain Predestinated Thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising from the Predestination of the Composition. But the <hi>Carline,</hi> which is not born after this manner, draws the virtues of other Herbs unto it self, and takes their powers from them, (and doth then alone possesse those virtues) even as the <hi>Sun</hi> draws the moisture out of <hi>Wood;</hi> This we declare more at large in our <hi>Book of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In like manner also, some <hi>Mundificatives</hi> do acquire by their Composition such a like virtue as to <hi>Mundifie;</hi> even as when a Calx of Earth is Transmuted into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Form by a Liquid Thing, as <hi>Rozin, Honey, Gum, Pitch, &amp;c.</hi> Those Alterations are like to the <hi>Flores</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> the which are at first a <hi>Purgative,</hi> as it becomes a Calx to be; then afterwards, they are reduced by the fire into a <hi>Stiptick</hi> Property, so that they lose their purging faculty, and do then <hi>mundifie.</hi>

                     <p>HAving written of many most secret Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Nature, we are now also willing briefly to treat of <hi>Elixirs,</hi> and that not in Vain, for we perceive that there lies in them the greatest conservation, and this doth even constrain us to bend our mind thereto, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out resting, for every <hi>Elixir</hi> is an Internal preservative of that Body, in its essence that takes it; even as the Extrinsecal <hi>Balsome,</hi> is the External preservative of all Bodies from putrefaction and corruption; the which thing is sufficiently evident in <hi>Balsome, viz.</hi> that it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth Bodies so, that they abide many hundreds, yea thousands of years without corruption or muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>And therefore seeing such a like gift or faculty is in <hi>Balsome,</hi> as to preserve dead Bodies and to conserve them incorruptible; you may well conceive that in and by this same gift and Mystery, a sound and living Body may be far better and more commodiously pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served; But now we have not this according to Na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57672:62"/>
                        <hi>viz.</hi> that these Mysteries of Nature, yea, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted above Nature (by which we may conserve the Body inwardly and outwardly from all contrarietie) become manifested and known unto us; but in them we meet with many Mysteries as are most occult and hid from others.</p>
                     <p>Verily as concerning <hi>Elixirs</hi> this is to be known, that they have not their operations from their Nature, not from their complexion, but are <hi>Mysteries</hi> rather then <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificks</hi> leading us to a most high admiration of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, by many demonstrations. Yet they are plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Nature her self, so that they are in her, even as may be seen in <hi>Balsome;</hi> if therefore it be possible to preserve dead bodies, tis much more possible to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve living Bodies. Nor makes it much to heed the Words or Arguments of our Adversaries, but we will disclose our own Arguments, and hereby shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to direct and guide, to the true foundation of the Intrinsecal <hi>Balsome,</hi> not regarding the trifling unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable sayings of those that talk of a Term or limit of death, and its Predestination, and conclude or stint it in its determinate points; for God our Father gave life unto us, and together therewith Medicaments, by which we may be able to defend and sustain it; if therefore the tearm of death were precisely set and limited, it would necessarily follow that the other be false, which is not so. But as long as we have abilitie and knowledge, we have power of sustaining our Life, for <hi>Adam</hi> attained to such an Age, not from the proper Nature or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own propriety, but meerly on this account, because he was so learned and wise a Physitian, and knew all things that were in Nature her self, with the which he also sustained himself so long a time. So likewise many other were there, that used such like remedies.</p>
                     <p>Many there were that dyed in the dayes of <hi>Adam,</hi>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:57672:62"/>
that attained not to his Age, and some attained not to our Age, (as we are now constituted and ordained since the flood) but dyed even as we, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were ignorant of these Arts, which <hi>Adam</hi> and the rest understood, and hereby it came to past that they dyed afore their time, nor did their Food or Drink help them.</p>
                     <p>Whereas therefore we are able from such like exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Naturally to find out, that an old or long life pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Nature, we will enquire what Nature and the gift of God is; some things do conserve a dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy from putrefaction onely one year, as <hi>Oleum Lateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> or Oyl of Bricks. Others ten, as the <hi>Corrected Oyl of the Philosophers;</hi> some twenty, as the Water of <hi>Hony;</hi> othersome fifty, as a Destilled <hi>Preservative;</hi> but others preserve it perpetually without end, as <hi>Balsome;</hi> Some onely eight dayes, as <hi>Salt;</hi> others for a night, as <hi>Destilled Water;</hi> some longer, as <hi>Vinum Ardens;</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some also there are that preserve the Body from Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, in a new and strong essence and Nature, when a man is confirmed and strengthened by them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his complexion, as <hi>Cittine, Aloes,</hi> and <hi>Myrrh;</hi> some Bodies are defended from Putrefaction, by reason of their most great <hi>Tincture</hi> onely, which is so potent, that it admits of no evil, nor suffers any to grow or to enter therein, as <hi>Gold,</hi> the <hi>Saphir, Pearls, Arcanaes, Magisteries,</hi> and such like as we have afore written hereof.</p>
                     <p>We will therefore write down a Preservative against all the Corruptions of the Live Body and the Dead; But it is to be considered that the preservative of the Live Body is to be taken by the mouth, and ought to penetrate the whole bodie, so that here may be no member in the Body, but may perceive and admit of that preservation, and may (by the Attraction of the benefit thereof) be informed and impressed thereby;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57672:63"/>
Moreover tis to be noted that the Spirits of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements in the bowels are sufficiently vehement and strong to fight against the Preservative, and that for this reason, because no putrefied thing can be Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balmed or preserved; for it hath not in it self any es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, as newly dead flesh, which is embalmed hath. And that doth as much sute with a Preservative, as Vermine with the best hearbs, and as a putrefied thing doth with an incorruptible; for a thing that is putrid, cannot be corrupted more, nor be altered, for it is of no value; contrariwise, a preservative cannot in the least be putrefied, for it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> like to Gold that never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes rusty. They mutually are Separated from each other, so that each of them fulfills and performs what is proper to it; But thus much we have thought fit to mention, because the Dung or Excrements are able in time to overcome the preservatives, which thing cannot so come to pass in dead bodies, and because they are unbowelled, or if they are not as yet unbowelled, they are indeed coagulated by death, even as the blood Separated from the Vains congeals.</p>
                     <p>We call this Preservative <hi>Elixir,</hi> as if it were Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with which bread is fermented and is digested by the Body. Its Virtue is a Preservative of the Body in that same state wherein it findes it, and in that same Vigour and Essence; for this is the Nature of Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatives, <hi>viz.</hi> that they defend from corruption, yet not by mending or bettering, but by preserving onely. But whereas they also take away Diseases, this is done by the subtilty that they possess; Likewise they do not onely preserve, but also conserve; for they have a two fold Labour and Office, <hi>viz.</hi> to prevent Diseases, and to conserve the Essence it self in its own State.</p>
                     <p>Nor do they thus onely in humane Bodies, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in all sensible Bodies. Thus also dead Wood
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57672:63"/>
may equally as well be preserved from corruption, as a Body that is seasoned with <hi>Balsome;</hi> nor is the conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Hearbs in their Essence any otherwise then a certain live Body is; for those conservations that are done to Hearbs, do conserve them in the same Essence that they find them in, so that they are still green, and remain equally as fresh as in the Fields or Gardens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> even to the fifth or sixth Age. If they be taken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their Flowers, they also conserve them, and so if with their fruits, they conserve them. Neither is there so great reason of wondering thereat, for tis a thing possible for dead Wood to live again, and for I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron to be fixt so, as never more to contract Rust; so likewise for Sulphur to be made incombustible, all wch are very contrary to the understanding of a simple man. The cause of all these we set down more at large and more sundamentally in the Book of Conservations. Nor are they to be judged of as impossible, for many more things that are esteemed impossible, may be most assuredly accomplished. We will therefore speak of the conservation with <hi>Balsome,</hi> by the destinctions of Ages as followeth.</p>

                     <p>WE will not write of the first <hi>Elixir,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth the Body in that Essence as it finds it in; suffers it not to putrefie, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> to be infirm; but conserves it in the spirit of life, so that no accident can befall it. Likewise it brings it unto the third Age or more. As concerning its use, the operation upon dead bodies is different from that upon living, for those must lie in the <hi>Balsome</hi> night and day, whereas the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and sound bodies neither may nor can at all do so.</p>
                     <p>And therefore this <hi>Elixir</hi> is to be lookt on as being
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57672:64"/>
useful only for life; as for the <hi>Heart</hi> and those place chiefly in which the life is most vigourous and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, for it is ordained for the Spirit of Life that dispersed through out the whole body, and it preserve the Spirit of Life by that Virtue by which the dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Body or Carkase is kept from putrefaction; for, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Wound or Ulcer may be outwardly preserved from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefying, and from evil, so likewise the Intrinsecal body is disposed, and capable of being preserved from all adversity. We do therefore so frame the <hi>Elixir,</hi> that it may Operate upon the Spirit of Life, like as <hi>Ferment</hi> Operates in Paste or Dough; and upon the body, even as when a Tree is tinged in the Root, in such wise as its Colour may never depart therefrom. After this manner is the whole body preserved; for the Tincture is either more or lesse dispersed, and penetrates into all the Members, even as the whole Metal is tinged into Gold, and is so made Gold, or is preserved from Rusting. Thus is it in the Conserved Body, there's no Member but it full of the <hi>Elixir.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now then, when the Virtue is thus dispersed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived throughout the whole body, and doth thereby exercise its Operative power, there cannot happen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Corruption by putting any thing thereto, for the Life of every member is full of <hi>Elixir,</hi> even as the tinged body is full of the <hi>Balsam.</hi> But you are to understand that tis not necessary that the whole body be balsamed by taking he <hi>Elixir;</hi> for where the Spirit of Life is only environed there with in its root, tis sufficient as to the Conservation of the body.</p>
                     <p>Now come we to the <hi>Practick part;</hi> and first of all to Treat of the <hi>Elixir</hi> that doth Conserve the whole body from putrefaction by the Conditions and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Virtues of <hi>Balsam.</hi> Then wee'l speak of that <hi>Elixir</hi> which preserves the body by the potential Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of <hi>Salt.</hi> And Thirdly, of the <hi>Elixir</hi> of <hi>Sweetness</hi>
                        <pb n="119" facs="tcp:57672:64"/>
that supports and sustains the body in its Conservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Wee'l Teach that <hi>Elixir</hi> which enters mans body with the virtues of a Quintessence. Fifthly, There shall be another <hi>Elixir</hi> added that is truly noble by reason of the Virtues of its most great Subtilty; for it resisteth all the enemies of Nature, by which resisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy it permits not the body by any means to slide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Diseases. And then for a <hi>Conclusion,</hi> wee'l adjoyn that <hi>Elixir</hi> which (by the Virtues of its own proper nature) is endowed with such like Conservative Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>

                        <hi>TAke</hi> of true and the very best <hi>Balsame,</hi> (well known to us) one pound; Let it be put into a Glasse, which cover with a blind Head, and pour in together there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with two ounces of the Quintessence of Gold, and one ounce and an half of the Essence of the greater <hi>Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum;</hi> all which, let be digested together at a gentle fire, so as the Vapours may ascend day and night. Then afterwards encrease the fire, that some drops may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here and stick, and may fall down drop-by-drop for two months; then let them remain in Horse-dung for four months, that so they may have their digestion without intermission. This done, the <hi>Elixir</hi> is compleated.

Even as <hi>Arsenick</hi> overcomes Nature for <hi>evil,</hi> so contrarily this <hi>Elixir</hi> overcomes it for <hi>good,</hi> by defending the body.

                     <p>THere is no lesse power and virtue in <hi>Salt,</hi> then in <hi>Balsame,</hi> whereof we have spoken; and that for this reason, because <hi>Flesh</hi> is preserved by <hi>Salt</hi> from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction for many dayes, years, and a long time. And that, sundry wayes, and by one way more then by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. By the same <hi>Basis</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> will it be possible to Conserve and Preserve the body; Not that we advise the Use of <hi>Salt</hi> in such a manner as tis used in dead <hi>flesh</hi> but tis necessary to make thence-from the <hi>Elixir</hi> of <hi>Salt,</hi> which doth materially penetrate the Spirit of Life, so, that it lives by the Salt, even as salted Flesh; for this <hi>Elixir</hi> is so subtile, that it may be compared to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Life. They two do so straitly and closely agree in <hi>One</hi> Conjunction, insomuch that the One is tempered or seasoned with the Other unto perfection; (even as Salt makes some Food favoury) without which it could not possibly be brought to perfection in Unity. This therefore is to be noted, That the <hi>Elixir</hi> of <hi>Salt</hi> is a ferment, in which there is a certain Tincture whereby the whole body is penetrated. Tis also an inconsume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing, and is not in the least absumed (with natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Things) in the body by the digestion; but is fix, like to Glasse in the fire, which doth not at all perish by boyling or fusing. This fix <hi>Elixir</hi> doth so fix the body, that it becomes permanent in Life, no otherwise then as when a metal is fixt, which, no moisture, no Corrosivity, or such like can hurt afterwards, or bring to be rusty: So therefore, it may be gathered from hence, That the <hi>Elixir</hi> hereof is as fix a body as Gold, whereinto no unclean thing can penetrate, so as to hurt
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57672:65"/>
it; We will therefore describe the <hi>Practick</hi> of the <hi>Elixir</hi> of <hi>Salt,</hi> after this manner;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take Salt</hi> excellently well prepared, the whitest and cleanest, put it in a <hi>Pellican</hi> with so much quantity of <hi>Aqua Solvens,</hi> or the dissolving Water, as may be six times its weight; let them be digested together in Horse-dung for a month; then afterwards let the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving Water be Separated by distillation, and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain poured on, and be Separated as before, this let be done so often until the Salt be converted into an Oyl, whereto let be added an eighth part of the Quintessence of Gold, and let them be digested together in a <hi>Pellican</hi> and in Horse-dung for four months, and let them be Circulated for a month after; then adde another part of Circulated Wine, and let them so remain in <hi>Ascensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> yet a month longer. This time being over, thou shalt have the <hi>Elixir</hi> of <hi>Salt,</hi> of the which we have made for ourselves a memorial as a pattern, for the succouring and lightning of our Ancient dayes.</p>

                     <p>WE are certain, That bodies may be preserved from Corruption by <hi>Sweetnesse;</hi> but as to the Virtues that it is to be done by, we deliver them in the <hi>Treatises of the Generations of Honey, Sugar, Manna, Tronus,</hi> (the sweetest kind of dew) and such like, which we won't Repeat in this place because of the Writings of the Antients.

                           <hi>The Fifth is called the</hi> Elixir <hi>of</hi> Subtilty.</head>
                        <p>NOw we accompt it expedient to set down the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixir</hi> of <hi>Purity</hi> or <hi>Subtilty;</hi> for it Conserves by the power of its great Purity and Cleannesse, such as is the <hi>Corrected Oyl of the Philosophers;</hi> this suffers no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that shall be anointed therewith, to putrifie:
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57672:67"/>
The like doth the <hi>Corrected Oyl of Bricks</hi> (or <hi>Oleanum Laterinum)</hi> effect, and many others; and yet tis not their property to preserve from putrifaction, but they acquire this thing, and get such a property from the Preparation and Labour: So likewise Distilled or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected <hi>Wine</hi> permits not to putrefie, nor doth Digested <hi>Wine;</hi> nor is it at all changed by the fire. The Water of <hi>Honey</hi> doth (by its preparation) resist putrefaction, as to what appertains to sensible bodies; but the <hi>Crude</hi> Substance thereof doth not do so, but is subject to all putrefaction; We therefore set down an <hi>Elixir of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility,</hi> forasmuch as mans body is (just like as <hi>Mercury</hi> it self which is <hi>volatile,</hi> is fixed with its own Water, and made permanent) also fixed into a Constancy and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manency; Now although that this same thing may be done by many other things then what we here describe, Yet neverthelesse we will mention such only as are known unto us by Experience; Nor will we for this Cause detract any thing from the others, but only we say thus much, That as yet all of them have not been known unto us, nor been Experienced by us. The processe of this <hi>Elixir</hi> is thus;</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Oyl Olive, Honey, and Vinum Ardens,</hi> or <hi>burning Wine, of each one pound:</hi> Destil them altogether accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Chymical manner, and that thrice. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Separate all the Phlegm from the Oyls, which are distinguishable by the many Colours; put all these Oyls into a <hi>Pellican,</hi> and adde to them of the Quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of <hi>Bawme,</hi> and of <hi>Celondine,</hi> a Third part; digest them for a Month, Then keep it for your use: There is no Sensible body is able to resist it, no nor Insensible, and that for many Causes and properties which we will not at all set down in this place.</p>

                        <p>IN like sort may a perfect <hi>Elixir</hi> be extracted out of Natural Things, as out of <hi>Myrrh, Saffron,</hi> and <hi>Aloë<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patick;</hi> but as for those Vittues that it proceeds from, we describe in their <hi>Generations;</hi> We only mention the process here, omitting their Original, which we else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where do often Treat of.</p>

                           <hi>Take of Myrrh, Aloëpatick, and Saffron,</hi> of each one quarter of a pound; the which being put together in a <hi>Pellican</hi> and placed in Sand, let them ascend most gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for two Months, then at length Separate the Oyl from the <hi>feces</hi> by an Alembick without Adustion or burning. This Oyl must be digested for a Month together with <hi>Circulatum</hi> in equal weight, then (after) keep it: In this Elixir are all the Virtues of the Natural Balsame, yea, and such a Conservative Virtue for old Folk, more then is fit to ascribe unto it, because there doth not only proceed one Age therefrom, but Four, Seven, or Ten, &amp;c. Tis scarce possible to expresse its force and natures; but tis in my Judgment sufficiently enough Dilucidated, nor do we think it need any more ample Interpretation.</p>

                     <p>HAving in the Precedent Books, treated of <hi>Intrinsecal Diseases;</hi> 'tis expedient now for us to write of those Diseases as proceed from without, and to set down some remedies for them. And although we insert nothing (in these Books) of the Origenal of those Internal and also Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Diseases, yet notwithstanding we will set down the Originals of those Medicaments, and then afterwards the composition of such like reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for external Diseases. Some remedies are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Wounds, with which a Wound may be cured in twenty four hours; which you are to understand thus;</p>
                     <p>When there is a Wound made, it needs nothing else but that it be again knit together, or conjoyned on such wise, as two pieces of board are knit together with Glew. Do not at any rate let Wounds lie open, but endeavour to replenish them with flesh, for tis rather a thing Rustical then Medical. Consider that when the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57672:68"/>
lips of a wound are joyned together as two pieces of Boards stick together with glew, they are even more then half whole already; the which is to be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily done by a certain Medicament, so contracting both sides of the Wound together, that it cannot be better and more fitly done; Thence it follows that where the lips touch each other by the compression of the Medicament helping Nature, there is the healing compleated; insomuch that there is no Wound wherein the Bone is not broken) is so evil, but will easily be healed in twenty four hours. But the Bones do not permit themselves to be knit so together as the flesh doth; therefore we speak not at all of them! in this place. For example understand us thus, <hi>viz.</hi> when any Member is plainly cut off, then (before that the Vains be dead, but whilest they are yet warm and fresh) let them be presently moistened with that Medicament, and let the wound be conjoyned, and so the sides there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will be so knit together (as two Sticks are conglu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinated with Glew) and be healed and united. Thus is the operation of this Medicament, and herewith dot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Nature cure so soon because of the great resiccati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or drying up of such like Medicines, and tis by that Virtue (which we have afore spoken of) that it heals. Moreover you are to know, that an <hi>Incarnative Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is not at all to be used for Wound, nor any mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dificative, or Attractive, because that those extract, and are to draw out all Putrid Fluxes into much <hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>Furthermore the gaping or caveity of a Wound is to be filled with flesh; now that is a long time doing, and consequently very dangerously and without any Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. The same is also to be conceived of in old <hi>Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> which are a long time loaden (as it were) and burdened with fluxes, whereby it comes to pass, that they cannot be cured without many accidents, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57672:69"/>
great difficulty, and sometimes never. So then it is most necessarily expedient that the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, be made of those things which we have spoken of, and which do likewise by a certain force compress and cling together the Skin and widenesses Likewise in the curing of <hi>Ulcers,</hi> you are to consider, that the Generation of Flesh is necessary, but that cannot possibly be done by compression, or closing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether (as we mentioned in Wounds) in <hi>Ulcers,</hi> as it <hi>Eistulaes</hi> and such like; all which are to be cured by the Virtue of such like Medicaments, as anon. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we describe and set down two Fundamentals, for such an opening or gaping of the Skin, the one is an Incarnative, the other is an Exiccative or dryer up.</p>
                     <p>Now let us speak also of the other deformities of the Skin, as <hi>Scars, Morphews, Serpigees,</hi> the <hi>Pannus or Birth-mark,</hi> the <hi>Stains</hi> and <hi>Leapry,</hi> and such like Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cases proceeding from the Skin, the which we advise the cure of after this manner. First of all we ordai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and appoint the Skin to be pulled off, even as the Skin of a Beast is stript off, then (afterwards) to be clad with new by a convenient Medicament. For it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, that the Skin must be took away by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Medicament, and a new Skin pure and unspotted be generated of another Colour; as with that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament that follows hereafter, whereby much of Flesh and moisture is not to be attracted; thus are all Spots to be removed, by the way thus described. As to the taking away of their Original, we make no mention in this place, nor as to their entrance or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, for it is elsewhere Treated of, nor doth it bring either benefit or dammage to our present intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Doctrine. There are many other Distempers, as the <hi>Cancer, Buboes</hi> and such like, which require their Peculiar Medicament for the drawing out of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57672:69"/>
their defilements, the which is exceedingly well performed by the <hi>Specifical Attractive;</hi> then afterwards there is need of Consolidation, the which we have set down in our Discourse of <hi>Fistula's</hi> and such like.</p>
                     <p>But now the Ruptures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> breaking of Bones and the like are to be consolidated with a <hi>Stiptical Attractive</hi> onely, the which Medicament we shall not here repeat as having spoken there of elsewhere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In like manner there are found to be many superfluous Crescences, as <hi>Strumaes</hi> or the <hi>Kings-Evil, Kernels, &amp;c.</hi> the which must first be evacuated or emptyed, and then be cured afterwards.</p>
                     <p>We will therefore divide <hi>Chirurgery</hi> into three Parts or Cures, and refer one part to <hi>Wounds,</hi> the second to <hi>Ulcers,</hi> and the third to <hi>Spots</hi> or <hi>Blemishes;</hi> as for the <hi>Cancer,</hi> we shall Cure it with a <hi>Specifical Attractive</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and afterwards with these <hi>Medicaments</hi> which we shall Teach here following.</p>

                     <p>For Example: In some things the Element of <hi>Water</hi> bears rule, in other bodies the <hi>Fire</hi> is chief, in others the <hi>Earth,</hi> and in othersome the <hi>Air,</hi> So then, if you would have the fix Predestinated Element Separated, tis expedient that the House thereof be broken open; But now this breaking up the House, or dissolution, is performed by several wayes, as is cleerly spoken of in my <hi>Metamorphosis,</hi> in the Book of the <hi>Death of Things:</hi> If the House be dissolved by <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> or <hi>Strong-Waters, Calcinations,</hi> and such like; this alwayes it to be observed, that the dissolved be separated from the fix by vulgar distillations, for then the body of the Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence comes over in the manner of <hi>Phlegme,</hi> but the fix Element abides in the bottom; But whereas we take no great Care about the House or Habitation, but diligendy Enquire for the Inhabitant only, tis needful that we find him in the fix Predestinate Element, and from thence extract him according to the manner of a Quintessence; and so consequently that fix Element is to be dissolved by other more powerful Artifices then by <hi>Calcinations, Sublimations, &amp;c.</hi> and the <hi>Pure</hi> be Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the <hi>Impure.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Pure</hi> is the Quintessence, but the <hi>Impure</hi> is the <hi>Tartareous</hi> Superfluity which is permixt in every Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;

                     <p>MAgisteries do well deserve to be called Mysteries because of the great <hi>Tinctures</hi> they shew in an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated <hi>Menstruum, viz.</hi> in <hi>Acetum,</hi> in <hi>Wine,</hi> and as we there mentioned, so likewise do we here enjoyn, that respect is to be had onely to such concordances or uniformities as are commodious for the extraction of the Magisteries, for if you take Destilled Vinegar, you shall not tinge Water, but wine into <hi>Acetum,</hi> because the <hi>Tincture</hi> or <hi>Vinegar</hi> was made of Wine. Didst thou but well and rightly know the <hi>Magistery</hi> of <hi>Acetum,</hi> thou wouldst likewise well enough understand the Book of <hi>Magisteries.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="145" facs="tcp:57672:77"/>
In the Magistery of <hi>Vinegar</hi> this is to be considered, That first of all you make the <hi>Tincture,</hi> that is, the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar out of Corrupted Wine by that serment that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed or a kin thereto naturally; as for Example, by <hi>Tartar;</hi> then with a small Quantity of that same <hi>Acetum</hi> may you tinge a most great Quantity of <hi>Wine,</hi> (first cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and putrefied) into the best Vinegar in a short time. If therefore you intend to convert Merals into a Magistery, and plainly to tinge the whole body into an Essence, tis expedient that you take a chief and Open Metal, to which all the other Metals are by Nature al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed; the which you must corrupt or break in its own Matrix which is placed in Water, and is termed the Mother of all Metals, and you must purge it from the superfluous Elements, and reduce it into its first liquid <hi>Ens,</hi> that is, into a most sharp Metaline <hi>Acetum;</hi> as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as all the Metals are digested therein, they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily Transmuted thereby into <hi>Acetum,</hi> that is, into a Quintessence. But now, even as <hi>Wine</hi> must be in some sort afore corrupted, if you would have good Vinegar quickly prepared thence-from; even so in like manner must the Metaline bodies be afore corrupted, or putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and mortified, as is spoken of in the <hi>Metamorphosis</hi> in the <hi>Book of the Death of Things;</hi> and then are they truly called <hi>Potable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this same manner also are the Magisteries of <hi>Marcasites</hi> to be prepared even as the other Magisteries are in which said <hi>Marcasites</hi> is (in a manner) more Virtue to be found then is in Metals; and by our dissolving Water is to be understood the Water of <hi>Salt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Magistery of <hi>Gems</hi> is this, <hi>viz.</hi> You must first Calcine them with Sulphur for four Hours, then Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate them, and afterwards burn them with <hi>Nitre,</hi> then boyl them with Simple Water eight Hours, Filtre, and Coagulate it, and Extract it with Spirit of <hi>Wine.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:57672:78"/>
The <hi>Magisterie</hi> out of <hi>Gums</hi> and <hi>Rozins</hi> (as for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, out of <hi>Turpentine</hi> and <hi>Amber)</hi> is made after this manner; First, boyl them in Spirit of <hi>Wine,</hi> then Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt them in new Spirit of <hi>Wine</hi> commixt with a dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Water, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Salt;</hi> and Distil it thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.</p>
                     <p>The Magistery of <hi>Herbs</hi> likewise, as also of all <hi>Spices</hi> and <hi>Fruits</hi> is thus done; First of all, let them be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented like <hi>Must,</hi> or new <hi>Wine,</hi> then draw off from them a Spirit, as from the <hi>feces</hi> of <hi>Wine;</hi> in that Spirit digest the putrefied <hi>Herb,</hi> oftentimes renewed with new <hi>Herbs</hi> until the Spirit become four times the Quantity it was. But because there's frequent mention made in our <hi>Archidoxis</hi> of <hi>First Entities,</hi> and whereas the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Foundation is hidden in them, we will together therewith briefly adjoyn the preparation of our Water of <hi>Circulated Salt,</hi> which is thereto requisite, but was omitted.</p>

                           <hi>Take,</hi> in the first place, the true Element of <hi>Water,</hi> or instead thereof another <hi>Salt</hi> as is not yet wholly boyled to a drynesse; Or, even <hi>Sal Gem</hi> depurated; pour there to two parts of Water mixt with a little Juyce of <hi>Radish,</hi> putrefie it in an accorate Digestion, by how much the longer, so much the better; then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards let it congeal, and putrefie it again for a month, then distil it by a <hi>Retort;</hi> Urge the Residue by a strong fire, that so it may flow or melt, Reverberate it in the <hi>Retort</hi> with a continued fire, Dissolve it on a Marble, then take that water that flows from hence and pour it on again, and putrefie it; distil it again even to an Oylinesse, Conjoyn it with Spirit of Wine, and the Impure will fall to the bottom, the which Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, but the Pure will be Cristallized in the Cold; pour on again that which is distilled, and Cohobate it so often till a fix Oyl remain in the bottom, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing comes over sweet afterwards. Then farther, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest it for a month, and then distil it so long until the <hi>Arcanum</hi> of the <hi>Salt</hi> passeth over by an Alembick: Let not the length of labouring here-abouts grieve thee, for this is the Third part of all the <hi>Arcanaes</hi> that are hid in Metals and Minerals, and without it, can nothing fruitful, and nothing perfect be accomplishr.</p>
                        <p>But although there are more wayes for Extracting the first <hi>Ens</hi> of <hi>Salts,</hi> yet this is the most profitable,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57672:79"/>
and the most ready way; and next to this is that other way which we have mentioned under the Title of the <hi>Elixir of Salt,</hi> viz. That new Salt being permixt with the dissolving Water, (which Water is the Distilled Spirit of Salt) be putrefied and distilled so long, until the whole substance of the Salt be dissolved and reduced into a perpetual and during Oylinesse, the body being removed there-from in the likenesse of Phlegm.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Take Antimony,</hi> purge it from its <hi>Scoria</hi> or drosse, and <hi>Realgar</hi> in an Iron Vessel, until the Coagulated Mercury of the <hi>Antimony</hi> appear white and fair; and although it be the Element of Mercury, and hath in it self a true hidden life, yet notwithstanding all these things are in power, and not in act. But if you would bring it unto
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57672:80"/>
act, then tis expedient that you stir up that life with it own like living Fire, or with a Metaline <hi>Acetum,</hi> in or with which fire many <hi>Philosophers</hi> have proceeded many wayes. But because they have all agreed in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation or Root, they all arrived to the appointed end: For, one of them hath extracted a Quintessence out of the Coagulated Mercury, by much labour, and hath therewith brought the Mercury of the <hi>Antimony</hi> into act; but, others of them have beheld a Uniform Essence to be in other Mineral things: As for Example, in the six Sulphur of Vitriol, in the Magnetick stone, and have thence extracted a like Quintessence, and have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ripened its Mercury or Heaven, or brought it into act. And because they extracted their Quintessence out of a stony matter, they therefore called that <hi>Magistery</hi> a Stone; and indeed their Opinion is right: Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, that Fire or Corporal Life is found much more perfectly and sublimely in the Mercury of the Vulgar; and this is evidently witnessed by its Flux and Running, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is hidden in it a most chief Fire, and a Coelestial Life. And therefore whosoever desires to Graduate his metalline Heaven even to the height, and to reduce it into act, he must first of all extract out of the Corporal Life, <hi>(viz.</hi> The Mercury of the Vulgar) the first liquid <hi>Ens,</hi> (as being a Coelestial fire) the Quintessence of <hi>Sol,</hi> and a most sharp metalline <hi>Acetum</hi> by a Solution with its own Mother, that is, he must permix it with the <hi>Arcanum</hi> of <hi>Salt,</hi> and with the stomach of <hi>Anthion,</hi> that is, with the Spirit of Vitriol, and must therein dissolve the Coagulated Mercury of <hi>Antimony,</hi> digest it, and afterwards reduce it into Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stals, that it may be like to a yellowish Crystal; of the which we have made mention in our <hi>Manual.</hi>

                     <p>IN our Paramirical Writings it is clearly enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>viz</hi> to a <hi>Philosopher,</hi> or a <hi>Physitian,</hi> as much as is needful for the preservation of the whole humane Body, not onely in his Corporal and Earthly Mass, but even in the Celestial <hi>Balsamick</hi> Part, and for the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it of all <hi>Celestial</hi> and <hi>Terrestrial Diseases.</hi> For it is expedient that such a composition be in that Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament, as doth not consist in the number of Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. For example sake, should any one think that by the mixing of Water and Wine together, were made a true mixion, it would be a false conception; for one part may be Separated from the other without the hurting of either, which is far otherwise in our great Composition; for here is made a uniform, and an <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monius</hi> mixture, insomuch that two things different or distinct in Nature and properties are united, and neither of them can be Separated from the other without hurt, because of their notable Concordance; as it also comes to pass in the <hi>Masculine</hi> and <hi>Feminine Seed;</hi> if therefore such a composition be to be prepared as is in its state and form sutable and agreeable to man, in the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Celestial and Terrestial Things, it is convenient to consider of the Name of the <hi>Microcosm,</hi> and that man is a little World; And consequently if you would cure him Universally of all his diseases, it is necessary that it be done by his like. Concerning which <hi>Hermes Tris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megistus</hi>
                        <pb n="154" facs="tcp:57672:82"/>
saith, tis expedient that he who intends to make this composition, do Create a new World; And even as God created the Heaven and the Earth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> likewise must the Physitian frame a Medicinal World Separate and prepare it. And that he (the said <hi>Hermes)</hi> may faithfully shew unto his Disciples, what thing o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> matter this composition must be made out of, and how also a Concordancy of Celestial Virtues may be found with us in the vally of darknesse, he doth very wisely and truly add a little after, <hi>viz.</hi> That which is beneath is like that which is above, and the things beneath are so related to the things above as Man and wife, and for the better understanding thereof, he teacheth that the Heaven (doth of it self) agree with the Element of Water; for it had its <hi>First Spermatick matter</hi> in the Water, and that the Element of the Earth thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing coagulated or changed out of a Spirituality, into a Corporality and Earthlinesse, is like to the Plannets and the other Stars; for they also did at the begining obtain their Spermatick Matter in the Heavens, and did from thence pass, or were changed (by a Separation) out of the Celestial transparent Nature, into a thick Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated Body.</p>
                     <p>In the first Creation, the things above, and the things below, the upper and lower Heaven or Water, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Coagulated Nature or Stars, and the inferiour Terrestrial Nature were all commixt in one, and were but one thing. But God Separated the Subtile from the gross, that so of one Water might be made two, the Superiour Water was Subtile, and to be accounted of as a Masculine Sex to the inferiour, more gross, Femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine Water. But even as God did farther devide and Separate the superiour Water, that the subtile Aerial part might be ordained for Stars, so that the Celestial Bodies or Stars are so related to the Heaven, as Sons are to a Father; even so likewise by the same way, hath
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57672:82"/>
God appointed (in the more gross Feminine Bodies, <hi>viz.</hi> the Waters in the Vally of darkness) a Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on agreeing with the Superiour Separation, and hath also divided it into two Parts. The seventh more clear part, he called Water, the other six dryed parts, or <hi>Coagulum,</hi> he called Earth, the which comprehends in it self all the Specificated or particular Fruits and Planets, that had their first Original in the Water, as in their Heaven. Even as <hi>Metals, Minerals</hi> and <hi>Gems,</hi> which are to be accounted of in respect of the Water, as Daughters in respect of their Mother. So the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. Heaven hath a Nature and properties like it self in its Feminine Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Inferiour Heaven or Water; and the Superior Terrestrial Bodies or Stars, as being the Sons of a Father (that is of the Heaven) have a like concordancy and affinity with their Sisters, the Terrestrial Bodies. And by how much the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Celestial Bodies or Stars are conjoyned with their Father the Heaven; Even so by an equal kin or affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Inferiour Terrestrial Minerals and Metals are allyed to the Water (their Heaven) as being their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from thence therefore is the truth of the saying of <hi>Hermes</hi> evidenced, the which we do even commend to our Sons of learning, in these expressions, <hi>viz.</hi> that the whole <hi>Microcosm</hi> (as far forth as appertaines to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible Mass, and to the living, Moving, Corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, Generating Spirit) ought to be gathered as it were and composed of those Inferiour Elements, dark Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, their most Noble Essences; But as to the <hi>Mental Arcanaes</hi> (by which a sound mind consisteth in a sound Body) they are to be Attracted from the superiour Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Waters, and their Astral Influences (spiritually) in a Mental manner, through the mind of the Image and its <hi>Gamahea</hi> or (if they are not so pleasing to us) may be eschewed; even as we have largely and cleerly enough demonstrated these things in our books of <hi>long life.</hi>

For so it would come to passe, that we could then have power of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering our selves by a second generation, better then the first was, or as iron, which being reduced into its three first Principles, and afterwards into silver, or gold is by this same made incorruptible, or as ♄ which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain reduced unto its own <hi>Mercury,</hi> and at length chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57672:86"/>
into an incorruptible metall; Even so then should we be able to effect or create an incorruptible Creature out of our selves, the which (notwithstanding) we have no power to do; for we want that first matter, nor can we go back into the irreducibility of our appointed and ordained state, but must proceed on, as we have begun; for there is no way by which we may be able to recover, for to have this thing out of which we proceeded.</p>
                  <p>There is therefore a twofold <hi>Restauration</hi> or <hi>Renovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> One is what we have brought and declared about metals; The other is when an old Image is renewed with fresh colours, that so it appears fresh and new as it was at first; but yet we are not for this Cause to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand in this place, that there is made a new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of the old; but that the old image is palliated, and cloaked as it were, so as to appear new; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, neither may this be called a <hi>Restauration,</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the <hi>Renovation</hi> and <hi>Restauration</hi> of a man: But <hi>Renovation</hi> and <hi>Restauration</hi> are to be understood af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> That his Radicall moisture acting or governing, and exercising the Spirit of life, be not diminished or driven backward, but be rather augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and promoted in its vertues, as a tree that hath help administred unto it for the Production of its flowers and fruits, the which falling off, and being gone, there are others produced again as afore: But although that this example here made use of doth not on every side serve for the Declaration of our alledged opinion; yet neverthelesse it affords us the understanding of making an advance or promotion of the Radicall moisture of life, as we have demonstrated in the tree. And verily we would have you to apprehend of <hi>Renovation</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration</hi> after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is not to be done in the <hi>radical</hi> humidity, but in that which is born of the said humidity, and draweth, or deriveth, its Originali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, materially and corporally. For, even as a Bell made
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57672:87"/>
by fusion, doth not at all receive its sound from the <hi>To<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>

                     </hi> or note, that 'tis framed unto, but from the body; so the <hi>Restauration</hi> or <hi>Renovation</hi> doth not receive its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the spirit of life, but in that which makes, and effects it; that is, the <hi>one</hi> is <hi>Material,</hi> and the <hi>other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> Substantial,</hi> or spiritual. But, when all this, in which the <hi>radical</hi> moisture is, shall be mundified, its <hi>Tone</hi> will be also mundified: and by how much the better its <hi>Tone</hi> is, so much the better will the <hi>body</hi> be. And when we say that the <hi>radical</hi> humidity proceeds from bodies and members, we intend and mean after this manner, That the <hi>radical</hi> moisture it self, and that which proceeds thence from, are; even as the <hi>root</hi> and the <hi>tree</hi> is; <hi>one</hi> whereof cannot at all <hi>live</hi> and subsist without the <hi>other:</hi> In like manner is it to be (here) understood, that these two are so united and conjoyned, that they cannot be separated: therefore the <hi>radical</hi> humidity, and spirit of life, with the moisture of life, is in the bodies and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, even as the <hi>Tone</hi> or <hi>Note</hi> in a <hi>Metal,</hi> which is not seen, but only heard: for the spirit of life, and the <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical</hi> humidity, are truly in bodies; therefore it will be a foolish thing for us to endeavour to amend it, or to renew the body by it, but 'tis expedient and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>it, that the body and the matter, (which are born and risen, or sprung off, and with it) be renewed and restored. From thence, then, may it be collected, that <hi>Restaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Renovation</hi> is a Transmutation of those mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, nor parts, as exist in the body, superfluously; so that every such thing as proceedeth from the body and from the radical humidity, may fall off, and new may be born in the place thereof; even as we spake of <hi>trees,</hi> all the <hi>leaves</hi> of which, its <hi>flowers, fruits,</hi> and <hi>excrescences</hi> do fall off, and again spring up, and yet the <hi>Wood</hi> it self is not changed, so as to fall off, and other to be born again, but remains: even so likewise the <hi>radical</hi> humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity remains; that is, the life in the body, and (with it)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57672:87"/>
the body do cast off the <hi>hairs, nails,</hi> and <hi>teeth,</hi> and then afterwards the like of them are <hi>re-born,</hi> and grow again. This therefore is <hi>restauration,</hi> and <hi>renovation,</hi> by which this same thing as is to be renewed and restored, is <hi>so restored</hi> and <hi>renovated:</hi> for every <hi>Restauration</hi> and <hi>Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> is made in the superfluities, and in those things that rise and grow out of the substance: So then, it may be sufficiently understood what way it is that the body may be restored and renewed by: and (from the demonstrations we have made) <hi>viz.</hi> from those super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities that are not of so <hi>material</hi> a growth, as the hair, teeth, skin, and nails; for these are in the body as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain superfluous things, and do not pass into the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral matters, or substance, but remain in their own Essence, like as are the <hi>Four Complexions, alias</hi> humors, <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ne</hi> whereof proceeds from coldness and moisture, which is born and retained in the whole body, and hath no peculiar place, nor beginning from whence it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, as is proved [in our Discourse] of the <hi>Four Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions.</hi> A <hi>Second</hi> proceeds from things contrary to the former, <hi>viz.</hi> from heat and dryness, and even this also is <hi>so</hi> in the body, and hath no peculiar abiding or original, and it likewise causeth, or maketh moisture. The <hi>Third</hi> is cold and dry, and its way of birth is the same with the Others. The <hi>Fourth</hi> is hot and moist, and doth proceed even as doth the rest.</p>
                  <p>Here you are to observe that it happens that all those <hi>Four Humours</hi> are not alwayes in all bodies, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one of them only, sometimes two, sometimes three, and otherwhile four; This also is to be heeded, as concerning them, that they are consumed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled in the <hi>Renovation</hi> and <hi>Restauration,</hi> for this reason, because the nature and life of man can very well persist and abide without them, and doth not at all need them, for they are only superfluities; like as the <hi>feces</hi> are in Wine, or as the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:57672:88"/>
This likewise is to be believed concerning the <hi>Four Complexions</hi> appearing in a man, that they are not to be renovated and restored because they spring not from any either greater or lesser member: nor are they in the bloud, nor in the flesh, or such like: Neither is it true, that the <hi>sanguinc Complexion</hi> proceeds from the <hi>Liver,</hi> by reason of the very much-abounding quantity of bloud; or that <hi>Melancholly</hi> proceeds from the <hi>Spl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>n,</hi> or <hi>Choler</hi> from the <hi>Gall,</hi> and <hi>Phlegm</hi> from the <hi>Brain,</hi> and such like; for verily the aforesaid Members do not give any man his Complexion, but the Complexions happen to a man even in his Nativity, and abide even till his death. But we undertake not to dispute hereof in this place, for as much as it would be <hi>too</hi> too wide from our text of <hi>Renovation</hi> and <hi>Restauration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas therefore none of the Four Complexions hath any place or original in the said bodies, but they exist in the spirit of life, and in the <hi>radical</hi> humidity: therefore the Complexions cannot be renovated, not restored; but where the body shall be clarified, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of them is also clarified.</p>
                  <p>Moreover we also signifie this, by our text, <hi>viz.</hi> That the division, and distinction of Complexions according to Age, Country, and Regiment, is not at all to be cured, because there are no Complexions imprinted in the body, from these three: It may happen indeed that old Age may inforce a sadness in bodies, but yet that it no Complexion: So likewise the Country or Region may induce Phlegm, but yet that Complexion is not therefore Phlegmatick. So Choler may cause one to have a yellow colour, but these things have no place of discussing here, for they are declared in our treating of the <hi>Construction,</hi> or framing, <hi>of the body.</hi> There's a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar understanding requisite for Divisions (or Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions) of this sort, wherein is to be noted that they are not only Humours, but also sometimes Minerals, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57672:88"/>
Corruptions; all which are superfluities against nature and strength: The like may be said concerning the principal Members, for these resist <hi>Renovation</hi> and <hi>Restauration,</hi> thus, <hi>viz</hi> these perceive not those (quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of renewing, &amp;c.) nor receive they them unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; but every thing that passeth through them, and is prepared with, or by them; they receive and admit of it as Nutriment only, and not as a Medicament: but yet, if haply any humours or superfluities should be in them, they would be expelled. Even so then is it to be equally understood of the other Members, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>bones, marrow, brain, heart, liver, lungs, reins, milt, sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, intestines, gristles, muscles;</hi> and also as concerning the Bloud, you are to know, that corruption, or super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity, may be even in it; yet this is only accidental: And even so may it be equally-alike understood as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Flesh; and verily this accident is purged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in the <hi>Renovation</hi> and <hi>Restauration;</hi> not that there is to be made other bloud, but that the evil be removed there-from, and the good be preserved, and predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates. The same consideration is to be had concerning the flesh. But that we may briefly explain what those things are that may be restored and renewed, know, That the <hi>Leprosie, Falling-sickness, Madness, Pustules,</hi> or <hi>Pox,</hi> the <hi>Gouts</hi> of the <hi>Fact,</hi> of the <hi>Hands,</hi> and of the <hi>Joints,</hi> and many other such like, may be taken away by the <hi>Renovation</hi> and <hi>Restauration,</hi> unless there hap to be a Disease that had its Original even from the <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi> for that will not be removed.</p>
                  <p>But as concerning the Leprosie, or if there be in the body any more grievous Disease then that is, you are to know that there is to be made a Transmutation thereof in the body. not that there be made a seperation of the Pure from the Impure, but that the Leprosie be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Health, even as Copper and Iron are into Gold: Nor ought any one to admire at this same <hi>Transmutation,</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57672:89"/>
for <hi>Renovation</hi> and <hi>Restauration</hi> do consume even a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the fire consumeth all the Falsities and Impurities that are in Gold or Silver, and leaves them pure and clean: By the same way are the <hi>Falling sickness</hi> &amp; <hi>Gout</hi> removed; for so all things that are in the whole body are renewed by the flesh and blood, together with all the others therein concluded; for even as <hi>Alcali</hi> mundifies the Leprous <hi>Mercury</hi> into the best Silver, even so the <hi>Renovation</hi> and <hi>Restauration</hi> do transmute the body into a good essence, as is said before.</p>
                  <p>So then <hi>Renovation</hi> and <hi>Restauration</hi> drives forth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is superfluous in the body, and contrary to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and changeth all that which Nature doth not stand in need of, or which shall be of no moment or virtue, into good: Likewise it restores all things, and causeth them to grow again, as we said above: It reduceth the whole body into youthfulness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that for this reason, Because Nothing of those things as are in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self, is able to resist them.</p>
                  <p>But now we come to consider the way by which the body may be restored and renewed, <hi>viz.</hi> 'Tis done by that kindling (of a renewing. and restoring Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) which it hath in the spirit of Life, and in the Radical humidity; by the which kindling the aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Operations are made like to the burning vertues of a Nettle: Who is so quick-sighted as to be able rightly to search out such kind of virtues, when as they do not appear (in that action) so materially as they art sensibly known to be? After this manner also even <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation</hi> and <hi>Restauration</hi> of nature are as 'twere assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-approaches made by such virtues as we are not able to express. Now we evidently know that every visible thing is cleansed and purged by fire; for so Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that this very thing be done by fire, that is not possible to be done by any other thing. And therefore we understand a twofold fire, <hi>viz.</hi> A Material and an
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57672:89"/>
Essential Fire; the Material operates by a Flame, the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential by the Essence and Virtues like <hi>Cantharides</hi> that burn the skin, and raise blisters, like to the most violent fire; And yet notwithstanding they are not fire, (in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>east) nor are they so perceptible to the sight, like as fire is: The same likewise doth Crowfoot and Nettles do, as we have oft times said.</p>
                  <p>'Tis in like manner evident unto us that the <hi>Renovation</hi> and <hi>Restauration</hi> (when they come into the body, or are conjoined with it by union) do perfect their Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons after this way, <hi>viz.</hi> There is such an operation as is made in the <hi>Mercury</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Mars,</hi> the which are put into the fire with their Realgars; and although nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them be hot or fiery, yet are they burnt like wood, and the perfect Metal is found in the bottom, though it appeared altogether leporous before.</p>
                  <p>Likewise who is there that can search and find out what means it comes to pass by, that when <hi>Migdalio</hi> shall have been most vehemently melted with <hi>Vitriul,</hi> it becomes <hi>Copper,</hi> and in all respects like to true <hi>Copper,</hi> and yet it had not any similitude of <hi>Copper</hi> afore: even so are we to understand concerning <hi>Renovation</hi> and <hi>Restauration, viz.</hi> That they perfect their Operations like to Lime or Calx, which is extinguished or quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with water, and purifies it self, and the force and ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony thereof is taken away by the essential fire, and extinguished. The <hi>Renovation</hi> and <hi>Restauration</hi> of our Nature is much resembling that of the <hi>Halcyon,</hi> or <hi>King-fisher,</hi> the which Bird is renovated by his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nature. Hence then, there are many more such like things to be found as have a power of doing that, and of them we have made mention sundry wayes in our <hi>Archidoxis,</hi> or much rather, in our <hi>Secrets,</hi> from whence a very many might be brought, but that their digression from our present Text of <hi>Renovation</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration,</hi> would be too much; such things as we there

demonstrate, the same are to be understood in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner here in this place concerning <hi>Renovation</hi> in our rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated assertion, <hi>viz.</hi> That we cannot sufficiently or certainly know how the <hi>fire operates,</hi> although we see that it consumes the wood; for it overcomes and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes all other things by the vehemency of its heat: But omitting this, wee'l betake our selves to another thing.</p>
                  <p>So then having abundantly enough spoken hitherto concerning the beginning of <hi>Renovation</hi> and <hi>Restaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> let us now go on to discover those things which d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now wee'l set down the Compositions of them, but in the first place their process: Now when we speak of, and teach you concerning simple Medicines and <hi>Arcana'es,</hi> 'tis to be understood that the operations thereof are done diversly; for there are some things to be found which do even violently cleanse the Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and do drive away no other Disease so well as they do that; and yet nevertheless are (as to <hi>Renovation</hi> and <hi>Restauration)</hi> perfect; besides which, in the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Diseases of this kind, are the <hi>Quintessence,</hi> the <hi>Magistery,</hi> and <hi>Element</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> the which doth so cleanse the body from the Leprosie, even as it doth purge Gold and Silver melted therein, in whom it leaves no footsteps of Impurity. So likewise the Element of <hi>Sol,</hi> and its Quintessence, as also its Oile, and <hi>Aurum Potabite,</hi> do take away the Leprosie, together with all Diseases, and do <hi>renovate</hi> and <hi>restore;</hi> so likewise the Quintessence of <hi>Hellebor,</hi> of <hi>Colandine,</hi> of <hi>Bawm, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerian, Saffron, Manna,</hi> and <hi>Betony,</hi> do renew the body, those Diseases abovementioned being excepted, for they do not drive them away.</p>

                  <p>The Magisteries and Essence of <hi>Tartar,</hi> and of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cali,</hi> do also <hi>renovate</hi> the body with the perfection of, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration;</hi> they take away all Aposthumes, and amend the putrefactions and grossness of the Humors.</p>
                  <p>In like sort the Essences, Extractions, and Magisteries of the greater remedies, do <hi>renovate</hi> and <hi>restore</hi> the whole body; as for example, They remove Feavers, as <hi>Quotidian, Quartan,</hi> the <hi>Syncchus,</hi> [or continual] the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ra</hi> Feaver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Likewise the first <hi>Ens</hi> of <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi> are able to <hi>renew</hi> and <hi>restore</hi> the whole body, and to take away all Womens Diseases, together with their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, and to render both the Man and Woman fruitful; so likewise those same <hi>Arcana's</hi> do take away all long and incurable Diseases by the <hi>renewing</hi> and <hi>restoring</hi> of the body into its supreme Virtues.</p>
                  <p>Thus also doth the Quintessence drawn out of <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, renovate</hi> and <hi>restore</hi> the body, and take away Pleuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies and the Pestilence by the admirable operations and virtues of its prefecting property: There are many more such like things which shall be elsewhere repeated, and such as are of a far greater virtue then is able to be attributed unto them, and then can be mentioned. But yet as to these things, this is diligently to be heeded and considered of, as to Compositions, that although there
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57672:91"/>
are very many of them, yet none of them is sufficiently able generally to expel and cure all the Diseases (by it self) as are to be expelled by those Medicaments of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation.</hi> Wee'l therefore demonstrate the manner and Practick of our intention and meaning, even to the end; yet we will not set down all the Processes, for that is not necessary; for he that understands us, will apprehend and mark our writings, but he that doth not, will not be instructed by them; &amp; yet wee'l set down all the Proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses (as are necessary) abundantly enough: But 'twould be burdensome for us to write down such things as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have written of, or are known before; yet this whole Doctrine cannot be better delivered, or treated of, then by the first <hi>Ens,</hi> wherein there's a singular Nature of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating upon the body, and of transmuting the essence thereof; for the first <hi>Ens</hi> it self is an imperfect Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, predestinated to a certain and assured end, and corporal Matter. And because it is not perfect, it is able to alter every thing that it shall be incorporated withall; even as <hi>Mercury,</hi> which is like to the first imperfect <hi>Ens,</hi> as to imperfection: For although that it be determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and bounded, yet notwithstanding it is not changed from Imperfection, but is limited therewith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mercury</hi> hath even a power of <hi>renovating</hi> the whole body, for that there is a most wonderful <hi>Laxative,</hi> &amp; <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terative</hi> Virtue therein, which can never be sufficiently enough searched out: And yet nevertheless tis wholly imperfect and unprofitable in its <hi>Own</hi> operation, and that (forsooth) because 'tis <hi>Mercury,</hi> and the first <hi>Ens</hi> thereof must not be predestinated into anothers body; for such as it, <hi>viz.</hi> ☿ is, so is its perfection: But we speake of a first <hi>Ens</hi> that is perfect, for the <hi>renovating</hi> and <hi>resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> of the whole Body, as is the first <hi>Ens</hi> of Gold, and that for this reason, because it truly possesseth the spirit of the Gold, and the most subtile spirit, and is far more subtile then the true body it self is, <hi>viz. Gold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:57672:91"/>
Hence likewise the first <hi>Ens</hi> of <hi>Sol,</hi> or Gold is pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable, even as a <hi>Mercury</hi> in Metals; nor containeth it in it self the spirit of Salt, whereby it may be coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for the spirit of Salt coagulating the first <hi>Ens,</hi> doth take away so much virtue that the Gold is not a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth part so potent in its virtue, as its first <hi>Ens</hi> is; like to Generous Wine, which being coagulated with Frost, doth not again return to its former power and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.</p>
                  <p>But that we may perfectly speak and write concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Renovation</hi> and <hi>Restauration,</hi> you must know that the first <hi>Ens,</hi> that is, that the first composition of Gold, which is as yet a liquor, and not as yet coagulated, doth renovate &amp; restore whatsoever it layes hold on; and not man only, but also all cattel, fruits, herbs, and trees: And what we thus mention, is to be understood on this wise, <hi>viz.</hi> Like to the Mineral, or Oar, of a Metal, which is endued with far greater virtues than its Metal is: for in the Oar there's a spirit of Arsenick, and Salt, of Sulphur and Mercury, all which do go away in the purging of the metal, the said metal remaining in one essence only.</p>
                  <p>The like is to be understood of the first Entities of Marcasites, as of Antimony; the which you must note to be no less then the first <hi>Ens</hi> of Gold is; for there is such a virtue in the first <hi>Ens</hi> of Antimony, that it doth, of it self, of its own proper nature, transmute every thing that it seizeth on, even like as Antimony it self doth by the fire: for the virtue of it separates every thing from the body that is born out of the <hi>radical</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, and doth thoroughly renovate the said body from a true foundation; because its first <hi>Ens</hi> is seated is that predestination, insomuch that such an essence proceeds and goes out there-from, as the heat doth out of the fire.</p>
                  <p>The like is to be understood of the first <hi>Ens</hi> of Rosins:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57672:92"/>
The first <hi>Ens</hi> of Sulphur is an entire transmutation of the body into some <hi>Renovations</hi> and <hi>Restaurations,</hi> for it is so vehement that it tingeth all the first Entities of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals into its own essence, it takes away their operations, and reduceth them again to their first matter, and doth afterwards reduce them into a new perfect body: For, the first <hi>Ens</hi> that's produced out of Sulphur, hath such virtues upon the body of a man, that it renewes all the <hi>radical</hi> humidities in him, in all his parts and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
                  <p>In like sort may we speak of the first entities of <hi>Gems,</hi> the which do, by their first essence, most potently restore the whole body to its former powers and vigorousness, and do amend it of all its impurities, and renovate it, even as fire transmuteth Lead into a most pure Glass: for the <hi>primum Ens</hi> of the <hi>Smaragdine</hi> doth regenerate and renovate it self, for 'tis a perfect body from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning: Even as the <hi>green Marble,</hi> the which hath such a nature from its proper predestination, that it reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates it self from all uncleanness and impurities, and doth again coagulate it self until it become pure; and it doth sometimes thus renovate it self, and return into juvenility a third, and a fourth time; and by how much the oftner it doth thus <hi>regenerate</hi> itself, so much the more pure and constant doth it become: therefore as far forth as the virtues of the first Entities are known to me, they do assuredly far excel all the rest.</p>
                  <p>So likewise are you to note concerning the first Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Salts,</hi> that they are according to their spiritual virtues, far greater then in their perfection: So the first <hi>Ens</hi> of <hi>Vitriol</hi> transmutes all white Metals whatsoever into red, and those that are red into white, and over comes and subdues all the perfections that are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in them; it renovates and restores all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect bodies of the Metals, as, <hi>Yin</hi> into its own fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Ens,</hi> and into <hi>Tin</hi> again, in which is more virtues then is in the <hi>Old Tin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:57672:92"/>
After the same manner it reduceth whatsoever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds out of the <hi>radical</hi> humidities into the <hi>radical</hi> moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, and causeth the <hi>Renovation</hi> and <hi>Restauration</hi> it fell more perfect, more plentiful, and more abundant; for there's no other thing that operates so vehemently upon the <hi>radical</hi> moisture.</p>
                  <p>Nor are the first Entities of herbs and trees different from what was aforesaid, the which Entities are a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times more potent as to theirvirtues, then when they have received their body, stalk, or trunk, and are incorporated: Even as the first <hi>Ens</hi> of <hi>Bawm</hi> doth reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and restore the whole body far more powerfully then seems possible to be done in natural things; for 'its to be known that the Hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>yon, or King-fither, is not thus <hi>renovated</hi> nor <hi>restored</hi> from his own nature; but because its nature is such as to be nourished and live on first En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, on this wise, when it seeds on the bodies of herbs, or seeds, and such like, his stomach doth, by digestion, reduce them to their first <hi>Ens,</hi> and doth afterwards our of that first <hi>Ens</hi> perfect the operations of its <hi>Renovation</hi> and <hi>Restauration:</hi> for, that Birds digestion hath its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination naturally to first Entities only, whence it comes to pass that he doth first transmute all his food and drink into a first <hi>Ens;</hi> and therefore likewise doth he seed only on such bodies as do regenerate and restore, with which bodies he is even from the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning alwayes provided for, and nourished with by his Parents, or Dam: this also is his nature, <hi>viz.</hi> to be renovated and restored after death; and that for this reason, because the first Entities cannot at all have their progress, or full course, in the Bird whilest he lives, for the life of this Bird takes away all the virtues thereof by converting them into bloud and flesh; but being dead, he flourisheth according to the yearly seasons: And even as the first Entities disclose and produce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the earth, even so, in like manner do they then,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57672:93"/>
even in the Bird it self, put forth themselves and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novate and restore the dead flesh; and this is [in nature her self] a very wonderful Argument of its most great virtues and power: And now, were not these things apparent to sight, they would seem incredible, although thus described by many a one; for this cause also doth it happen that the <hi>Hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>yon's</hi> do renovate themselves at different times, <hi>viz.</hi> some of them sooner, some later or flower, according as they have either more early or more late, eaten the first Entities; for some of them are born and do come forth either sooner or later then other-some do. In like sort there are very many Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine or Worms renovated and restored, and that for this reason, Because they are fed and nourished by first Entities, while &amp; they are as yet in the Earth, imperfect. Many more wonderful things are there that are hidden, yea far more then are known, or openly manifest, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which I could write more largely, but that it would be too much wide from the Text of the Book of <hi>Renovation</hi> and <hi>Restauration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And although we cannot so very well take, or get the first Entities, as we have written of them, or have them in the same Essence as we have demonstrated before, yet nevertheless' tis a thing possible unto us; for if we know where the Mineral of Goldlyes hid, we shall even the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>IF you would (by <hi>Vulcan's</hi> Art) frame the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers Stone,</hi> which for very weighty causes we call a <hi>perpetual</hi> or <hi>perfect Bals<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>m;</hi> you are first of all to know and consider how that <hi>Stone</hi> is to be placed materially before thy Eyes, and be made visible and sensible; and likewise how the virtue or fire thereof may come forth and be known. But for the clearer setting forth of this my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, let's borrow an Example of <hi>Common Fire, viz.</hi> By what means the virtue or power thereof shews it self, and becomes visible: And that is done on this wise. First of all by the <hi>Vulcanick Art</hi> is Fire smitten out of the Flint: Now indeed this Fire can do nothing unless it hath such a matter as is friendly to it, upon which 'tis capable to operate, such as is Wood, Rosin, Oyle, or such like things, as it is naturally easily combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible; When therefore the said Fire lights upon some such a like thing, it proceeds on to an uncessant operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unless it be destroyed or impeaded by its contrary, or unless the fuel sail by which it multiplies it self; for if Wood or such like be put thereto, then doth its force become stronger and stronger, and so it alwayes operates until there be no more fuel put thereunto. Now then,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57672:105"/>
as the Fire exerciseth &amp; shews its operation in the Wood, even so is the same thing done with the <hi>Stone of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,</hi> or the <hi>perpetual Balsom in Mans Body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If that <hi>Stone</hi> be made by a prudent <hi>Phisician,</hi> out of a convenient matter, and by a philosophick manner, and (after a due consideration of all the circumstances of man) it be administred unto him, it doth then renovate and restore the Organs of Life, in such wise as if Wood were put to a Fire, by which the well-nigh dead Fire is cherished, and a shining and clear Flame procured: From hence therefore 'tis evident, that there's much placed in the matter of this Balsom, forasmuch as 'tis behoveful that it have a singular Harmony with the body of man, and may so exercise its virtue, as that the Human Body may be safe from all the accidents as might be able to happen thereunto from such a matter.</p>
                     <p>And therefore there is not onely much placed in the preparation of the Stone or Balsom, but 'tis much more behooveful to know the true matter it self, that is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sit; and furthermore, to prepare and use it as is sitting, <hi>viz.</hi> soberly and prudently, that so such a Medicine may be able to purge away all the desilements of the Blood, and other superfluities, and may induce Health in the room of the Disease. 'Tis therefore expedient for a true and honest Phisician, to have a good knowledge, and not to regard ambition and pomp, nor to appoint things doubtful or contrary, nor to trust an Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry too much, but well to know the Disease and Diseased, or otherwise ye will alwayes heal sinisterly, and will get nothing thence-from, but onely this, <hi>viz.</hi> The sick is deluded, and only deceived by the pride and ignorance of the foolish &amp; unmeet Physician But this is a great sin, and such as wil not go unpunished: For what is it else but a voluntary wickedness, <hi>viz.</hi> For any one to demand money, and a reward for that which he knows Nothing of, and yet he'le be a Master, but with infamy enough;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57672:106"/>
For many men do dis-esteem money, and not regard it, could they but be rightly advised and informed: But if this be not done, they lose both their Bodies, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes: And yet nevertheless 'tis counted a praise to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand money and fees; but believe it he that lists, for my part I'le reckon of such a Doctor after another-gess-manner: For 'tis manifest, that of such Doctors (who in their own conceits are most highly learned) there's not a tenth part that hath a right knowledge of Simples, and much less that are certain of what they command to be done, and how the Medicine is boiled by the <hi>Apothecary;</hi> so it often comes to pass, that such a Doctor orders such or such a simple to be taken in his composition, which himself never knew, and haply the <hi>Apothecary</hi> much less; and verily it frequently is so, that the <hi>Apothecary</hi> hath it not at all; and yet this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine must be called <hi>Perfect,</hi> and the sick must drink it off as a good Medicine, and pay deer enough for it, but as to the Event, that the Patient feels; for although it be no wayes profitable to him as to his health, yet 'tis profitable to the Doctor and <hi>Apothecary,</hi> as to the filling of their Purses. But if the Doctor and Apothecary themselves should be possest with the like Disease, they would not take such a like Medicine: Therefore it may well be guest, how miserably and wickedly they act, and that 'tis most highly necessary for them to order their Affairs otherwise, to amend their errors, and to follow better things: But I fear 'twill be a hard matter to tame and master old Dogs.</p>
                     <p>But to return to my purpose, (from whence a just zeal to the miserable and forlorn sick persons withdrew me) and to give satisfaction concerning it, I say, That it is not so much expedient onely to prate or boast of the <hi>Philosophers Stone,</hi> but 'tis necessary that that <hi>Stone</hi> be framed and prepared out of a convenient Matter, and be discreetly used: But know, that many of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57672:106"/>
have in their parabolical writings sufficiently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that Matter, and have, moreover, disclosed the Operation under figurate expressions, but yet have not wholly, and perfectly, manifested it; that so the foolish ones might not abuse it, and yet their sons might not have it hidden from them.</p>
                     <p>But whereas they are but a few that have followed them, and that have aptly set upon the thing, these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets have, in process of time, been, as 'twere, blotted out of remembrance, and Galenical fables have crept into the room thereof: But as the foundation thereof was at first laid, so doth it even yet stand in the same state, or rather grow daily worse and worse: This you may see in their Herbaries, how do they torment them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves therein? How do the <hi>Germanes</hi> mix <hi>Italy</hi> with <hi>Germany;</hi> when as, notwithstanding, <hi>Germany</hi> doth not need those <hi>ultramarine</hi> herbs, but hath even suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of perfect medicine in her self. And therefore lest the truth should be constreined to give place to a Lye, and least the darknesses of <hi>Galen,</hi> and his Complices, should quench or suppress the Light of nature in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, it is expedient for me <hi>Theophrastus</hi> to speak in this little book, not as an imaginary Physician, but as a knowing one, and as such an one as is not ashamed of his actions in Medicine, and who (by the grace of God assisting) have had good proof and experience in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sick persons, such as thou Galenist du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Didst thou ever cure the Gout? Didst thou ever dare to go to the Leprous? Hast thou cured the Dropsie? I believe, and that upon good reason, that thou wilt be mute, and suffer <hi>Theophrastus</hi> to be thy Master. But if thou wilt learn, learn and see what I shall here write and say; <hi>viz.</hi> That the body of man hath no need of thy Herby-chariot, especially in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57672:107"/>
Chronick and long continued diseases, the which (by reason of Ignorance) thou callest wholly incurable; for thy Herbs are too too weak for these diseases, and cannot, of their own nature, find out the Centre of the disease.</p>
                     <p>Neither wilt thou be able to do any thing with thy Pills, unless to purge the Excrements onely; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, because of their inconveniency, thou oft expellest the good with the bad; the which cannot possibly bee done, without the great dammage of the sick; and therefore well might those Pills have been omitted: Furthermore, neither do thy Syrups profit any thing, yea rather are as a thing of no value; and bring such a <hi>nauseate</hi> to him that takes them, because of their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and loath some favour, that they burthen the sick, and do afterwards induce gripings and danger, and do operate against nature.</p>
                     <p>But now I'le leave the rest of thy absurd and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per medicaments, for that they fight directly against na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor should be made use of by any means. Whereas, therefore, those things that I have spoken are true, and that ther's no true medicine to be found in <hi>Galen, Rha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi> or <hi>Mesue,</hi> that can set upon the said diseases in their root, and purge them out, (even as the fire mundisies the skin of the <hi>Salamander;)</hi> it necessarily follows, that the Cure of <hi>Theophrastus</hi> is far different from the Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenical Fantasies, and that his Curing flows forth from the fountain of Nature; otherwise <hi>Theophrastus</hi> should be as reproach-worthy as they.</p>
                     <p>If therefore we would follow Nature, and use natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral medicine, let us see what things they are, amongst all the others, that are most convenient in medicine for the body of man; <hi>viz.</hi> for the Conserving it (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their virtue and efficacie) in soundness and health, even to the term of the predestinated death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:57672:107"/>
This then, if considered of, I doubt not but that 'twill be on all hands Consest, that Metalline things have the greatest agreement with the body of man; and that the perfect Metalls, by reason of their perfection, but principally their radical humidity, are able to do much upon the body of man: for that a man is also a partaker of that Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury, which doth in some measure, though hidden, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>est in mettals, and metalline things. Now then <hi>like</hi> is to be applied to <hi>like,</hi> the which is wonderfully profitable to nature, so it be rightly done, the which is a great secret in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, yea, may be called an <hi>Arcanum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What wonder therefore, is it, if excellent, unheard of, and inseparable Cures do follow, and such as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant men accounted impossible to be done?</p>
                     <p>But that I may not digress any further, I must for brevities sake, here hint what I have determined to write in this Book; for I have a mind of treating more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here in this place concerning true medicine, then else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. But we have afore toldhow man hath his original of <hi>Sulphur, Mercury,</hi> and <hi>Salt,</hi> even as Metals have; this therefore being sufficiently declared in the book, <hi>P A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAMIRV M,</hi> 'tis needless to repeat it here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherefore I shall only shew you, how the aforesaid <hi>Stone of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers</hi> may be known, and in some measure prepared: Know therefore of a Certainty, that there's nothing so small, out of which any thing is to be made, that can stand without Form; for all things are Formed, genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, multiplied, and destroied in their Concordancy, and propet agreeableness, and do shew their Originality, whereby it may be perceived, what it was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and that, that same also must be in the Vltimate matter, and that, that which runs, or steps in between, is like to that imperfection which nature admixeth in the Generation.</p>
                     <p>But whereas such Accidents may be separated by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57672:108"/>
                        <hi>Vulcan,</hi> least they might do somewhat that may be an hindrance, Nature may in this case be amended: and this is likewise done in this Stone; for if thou wouldst make it of the right proper matter (the which may bee well enough known by the aforementioned circumstances) 'tis necessary that thou take from it its superfluities, and frame, multiply, and augment it in its Concordancy, or uniformity, like another, or third thing: for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its Concordancy it cannot be thus done, for Nature hath left it imperfect here, forasmuch as it hath not fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Stone, but the proper Matter, and is hindered by accidents, whereby 'tis uncapable of doing those things that the Stone, when prepared, is able to effect: and therefore such a Matter, without preparation, is, in respect of the Stone, but an half and imperfect thing, and stands not in any Concordancy, and Harmony, whereby it may be called perfect, or may be helpful for the health of mans body. The <hi>Microcosm</hi> affords thee an example of this thing: for behold, man as formed by the working Framer, into a man onely, is not an whole &amp; perfect work, whilst standing out of his concordancy, but is but an half-work, until the framing of the woman sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to him, and then he is a complete entire work.</p>
                     <p>But both of them are Earth; and so now these two Earths do constitute, or make up an entire man, capable of Augmentation and Growth; and this is done by the thus framed concordancy. In such wise must be done with the <hi>Philosophers Stone,</hi> if you would have it Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate as well Men as Metals: If it be unburthened of its superfluous Accidents, and placed in its Concordancy, it causeth wonderful effects in all Diseases: Except this be done, all your Attempts thereabouts are but vain.</p>
                     <p>But now if you would thus place it into its Concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy, 'tis expedient that you reduce it into its First Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that so the Male may act upon the Female, and that its outside may be turned inwards, and its inside out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57672:108"/>
and that both the seeds, <hi>viz.</hi> the Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, may be inclosed in their own concordancy, and be by <hi>Vulcan's</hi> help brought to a more then perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and be exalted in their degree, and withall, may from it self pour in all virtue, (as being a clarified, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and qualified Essence) into mans Body, &amp; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise into Metals, and may render them sound &amp; whole, driving out all the desilements by way of expulsion, and that the good in the blood of man may thereby be drawn to the due places, by the means of attraction, that <hi>so</hi> the <hi>Microcosms</hi> which is posited in the <hi>Limbus</hi> of the Earth, and framed of the Earth, may by this Medicine as being like himself, be Radically, and not imaginarily, but most assuredly restored to health, or preserved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. This therefore, is a Mystery of Nature, and such a secret as every Physician ought necessarily to know; And indeed every one that's born of the <hi>Astral</hi> Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine is capable of comprehending it: But that I may more clearly describe the Matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the preparation of a Medicine so excellent, that so an entrance may be given to the Sons of Learning, who love the truth.</p>
                     <p>You must know, that Nature hath given us a certain thing in which (as in a chest) are mysteriously conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or comprehended 1. 2. 3. the vertue and power whereof is more then enough sufficient for the conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the health of the <hi>Microcosm,</hi> insomuch that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preparation, it expels all imperfections, and is a true Defensive against old Age, and by us is called a <hi>Balsom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now you must first know what thing it is that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath placed such a number in; for I cannot describe it thee more clearly, for many reasons</p>
                     <p>But as to the preparation thereof, neither <hi>Galen, Rha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi> or <hi>Mesue,</hi> understood it, nor shall those that follow them attain it: For this Medicine hath such a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as your Pill-sellers attain not unto, and much less for an <hi>Helvetian-Calf</hi> to apprehend. Moreover it hath
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57672:109"/>
as it were celestial and singular operations; for it doth purifie and renovate by (as 'twere) a regenerating way as you may read more at large in my <hi>Archidoxis;</hi> and withall, well and advisedly take notice of the Original and the Essence, together with the vertue of Metals and Metalick things. He therefore that hath ears to heare, let him hear and see whether or no <hi>Theophrastus</hi> writeth lyes or truth, and whether or no he speaks groundlesly and from the Devil, as thou Sophister triflest and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest, who art thy self invironed with the Devil, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But notwithstanding, if thou shalt at any time hap to make use of thy Wisdom, and consider what thing the <hi>Paracelsian-</hi>Art is founded upon, and how lame thy hotch-potch-fragments are, there would not be that contrariety betwixt thee and <hi>Paracelsus:</hi> For, as concerning the things whereof I now do, and shall briefly write, whereby my <hi>Astral</hi> Disciples may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend and enjoy them, and glory of them; these things I say, may by the diligence of such an one as is not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to learn, be well understood, there being nothing so difficult but may be known, and learned by labour and study.</p>
                     <p>The practice therefore of this Work, is as follows.</p>

                     <p>For these respects therefore, it is not laudable for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Alchymist to exercise the Medicinal Art, if he bee ignorant thereof. It would be expedient that, as to this, some let and bar were here instituted, that so an inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be imposed on such putatitious, imaginary Physicians. For my part, I'le not bear their blame, not acknowledg them for disciples, seeing they follow not the truth; but account of them as notorious deceivers, and sloathful Loyterers, such as snatch the bread out of the true disciples mouths, and of set-purpose hurt men, esteeming neither Conscience, nor Art.

I my self do likewise grant that in its preparation it is a poison, and as great, or greater then that of the Tyrian Serpent, or Adder, that is put into Triacle; but that it remains poisonous after in preparation, that is as yet indemonstrable: for though to some blockish brains it be incomprehensible, yet doth nature alwaies tend unto its perfection, and it may therefore be much rather brought to that pass by conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Arts, then alone. But I'le grant yet farther, that after its preparation, it is a greater venome, and more vehement then afore; but yet 'tis onely such a venome

as is so directed, as to seek after its like, and to find out fixed and other incurable diseases, and expell them; not in such wise, as to suffer the Disease to be operative, and so hurtful, but 'tis, as it were, an enemy to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, and attracts to it self the like matter, and radical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly absumes it; and it doth so wash, even as Soap scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth off the spots in soul cloaths, and together with the said spots, doth it self also go off, and leaves the cloaths purified, unhurt, clean, and fair.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Sulphur of Metalls</hi> is an Oilyness extracted out of them, the which is endued with abundance of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues for the health of Man. One Sulphur is extracted out of Metalls afore they have endured the fire: as for example, Out of golden, or silver <hi>Marcasites,</hi> &amp;c. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nobility of the Mineral, so is the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur noble and excellent. So likewise out of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of a <hi>Marcasite,</hi> and <hi>Cobolt,</hi> each as its nature and propriety is.</p>
                     <p>The more common way of the extraction thereof is this: <hi>viz.</hi> You must take Vineger excellently well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled, such as hath stood for 24 hours upon a <hi>caput mortuum</hi> of Vitriol, Salt Nitre, and Allum distilled, and been distilled by an Alembick thence from. This, I say, must thou powr upon the pulverized metalline body, in a glass that it may overtop it seven singers, and set it to digest in a Horse-belly for nine daies: then take the coloured Vineger, and distill it in ashes, even to the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous oil, the which you must rectifie in a B. or at the ☉, so shalt thou have a most true Sulphur of the metalline body, the which thou must rightly make use of according to thy discretion. An extraction may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be made by a sharp and well-depurated <hi>Lixivium.</hi> But these other Sulphurs are not so profitable, as to the inward use of the body, because of the <hi>Alkali</hi> of the Ashes, out of which we make a clavellated gnawing
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57672:114"/>
Salt: and because of the <hi>Calx,</hi> or Limyness which such <hi>Lixiviums</hi> are made withall. The Sulphur that is thus extracted, may be washt with sweet water, and be Precipitated: but the digestion afterwards requires twice the time.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lixivium</hi> also is to be rectified by the sublimation thereof fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all terrestrial residence, lest that such Sulphurs being incorporated with it become corrosive, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the sick: the which to prevent, the said se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partion is to be made. And so much concerning the Crude Sulphurs.</p>
                     <p>But now as for the melted and depurated Metalls, you may extract their Sulphur too: There is not given a more certain, a more noble, and better way, then by the water of Salt, or its Oile prepared on such wise as I have evidently described in my books of Alchimy for such a Water doth sundamentally and radically ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract out of all Metalline bodies, their natural liquor, or Sulphur, and most excellent <hi>Crocus,</hi> as well for Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal, as for Chymical operations: it resolveth and breaketh every mettal, bringing it out of its Metalline nature into another, according to the different intention and industry of the workman.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Crocus</hi> of ☉ is to be extracted by the water of Salt, by which the Metalline nature thereof or Mallea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is broken, the residence is to be washed with hot water, and the <hi>Crocus</hi> to be extracted with spirit of Wine, the which being again separated, the <hi>Crocus</hi> will remain in the bottom; the which by elevation, by the degrees of fire, in five times sublimation, is changed into a Liquor, or the most true Quintessence of <hi>Sol.</hi> With this thou maist perform miraculous things: but hereto is required not a putatitious, but an industrious and skilful Artist.</p>

                        <p>AS there are two <hi>Hearts,</hi> so likewise two <hi>Brains:</hi> One is External, the other is Internal: The Nature of the Internal is <hi>unchangeable;</hi> that is to say, the <hi>Brain it</hi> self cannot of it self purge away the faultiness that is in it; for as it is framed, such doth it remain, nor is it changed: But if it be invaded by some external ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, or if that offending matter proceed from the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> or from the <hi>Spirit of Life,</hi> that Effect is to be wholly cast out by another <hi>Brain,</hi> which God hath implanted in the <hi>Herbs;</hi> nor do the <hi>members</hi> themselves acquire a certain power whereby to fight against the Disease, and expel it, but themselves remain quiet, and commit the wrestling and chasing it away, to the external <hi>Brain:</hi> If then this gets the victory, the <hi>Internal Brain</hi> grows wel; but if it be mastered, then the other feels the loss: You must therefore know that <hi>External Brain,</hi> that strives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all such things as may annoy the <hi>Internal Brain:</hi> Of which kind are, the <hi>Oyle</hi> of <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, the <hi>Liquor of the Saphir,</hi> of <hi>Musk,</hi> and the <hi>Liquor</hi> of <hi>Vitriol.</hi>

                        <p>THE <hi>Brain</hi> is to be conserved in its strength, so at that nothing may endamage it, and that it self may be wholly <hi>Brain:</hi> But it sometimes any infirmity be tide it, then the Hurts and Distempers are to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the <hi>External Brain,</hi> that the whole <hi>Brain</hi> may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main: Of those sorts of <hi>Brains,</hi> one is the <hi>Liquor of</hi>

Like unto this is the <hi>Arcanum</hi> extracted out of <hi>Gilla;</hi> on this wise, Distil the <hi>Gilla</hi> in an equal Weight of the <hi>Wine of Life,</hi> circulate it so long till it touch not the bottom; administer it with <hi>Falernum Wine,</hi> or <hi>Muskadine:</hi> It doth so powerfully strengthen the <hi>brain,</hi> that no <hi>Vertigo, Phrensie,</hi> or <hi>Madness</hi> can offend it.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Liquor</hi> of the <hi>Saphir,</hi> and of <hi>Musk,</hi> do the same, and is on this wise prepared; If the <hi>Saphir</hi> be reduced into an <hi>Alcoadamantine</hi> Nature, and be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved afterwards by <hi>Chybur</hi> into its own powder, and the <hi>Wine of Life</hi> be added by six dayes <hi>Cohobation</hi> to this <hi>Powder,</hi> then at length the <hi>Liquor</hi> becomes <hi>potable,</hi> and heals the <hi>Choraea viti,</hi> or <hi>laughing Disease,</hi> and the <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>Phantasie</hi> of such as incline to hang, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise destroy themselves: A like Medicine is extracted out of <hi>Musk:</hi> It is to be decocted in a Cloath by the <hi>Wine of Life,</hi> into the form of a Juyce, like to <hi>Storax:</hi> Herewith is the <hi>Vertigo,</hi> the <hi>Scotemia,</hi> or running round of the Head, and whatsoever induceth as wounding or

                        <p>But the Virtue and Industry consisteth herein, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Spleen</hi> of the Body be taken our, and an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal spleen</hi> be immitted or implanted: For the Life without the <hi>Spleen</hi> is longer then with the <hi>Spleen;</hi> the which though it cannot be so spoken as in relation to the three aforesaid Members, for their being in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is most highly necessary; yet notwithstanding it is true, as to the <hi>spleen,</hi> for we can be conveniently without that. The whole Practick therefore is to be thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That we may live by the benefit of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, and not the Internal <hi>spleen,</hi> and that we root out the Internal, and radically consume it.</p>

                        <p>EVery Generated or begotten thing, and every thing produced from its Elements, is assigned to three;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57672:125"/>
                           <hi>viz</hi> to <hi>Salt, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mercury:</hi> out of these three is a Conjunction made, which Constituteth one body and united Essence. As to what appertains here to the Body, that is not spoken of, but the Internality onely of the body.</p>
                        <p>The Operation thereof is threefold; One is of the <hi>Salt,</hi> and this acts by Purgation, by Mundisication, and by a Balsamick property, and other waies, and ruleth over that which tends to putrefaction. Another is of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and this rules over that which is the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muchness or superfluity of the other two, or is dissolved. The third is of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and this removes that which hath its tendency unto a Consumption.</p>
                        <p>As concerning these three, you must know what the form of each is; One is a Liquor, and that is the form of <hi>Mercury.</hi> Another is an Oilyness, and that is the form of <hi>Sulphur.</hi> The other is an <hi>Alkali,</hi> and this is the form of <hi>Salt. Mercury</hi> is without <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Salt: Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> is without <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Salt: Salt</hi> is without <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> and <hi>Mercury;</hi> and by this means and way every thing abideth in its Potency. But as for those Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are found in permixt diseases, you must know, that the Separation of things is not perfect, but two are conjoined in one; as in the Dropsie, and such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

So sometimes Mercury and Sulphur do take away the Palsey, because there's a concurrance also of corporal <hi>Sulphur:</hi> Or because there's some hurt in the next and neighbouring Confine. You are to consider, therefore, that every Disease may be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doubly or trebly Commixt; and that is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of the Disease. Herein the Physician is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, when he makes use of a certain Simple; what the degree thereof is in Liquor, in Oil, and in Salt, and how it squares with the Disease of the adjoining, or neighbouring hurt. According as is that degree, so must

the Liquor, Salt, and Sulphur be extracted and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred as need requires. So therefore, this short rule <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

That which proceeds from the <hi>Liver</hi> of the <hi>Archeus,</hi> comforteth the <hi>Liver</hi> of the lesser World, and so consequently, 'tis neither <hi>Mercury, sulphur,</hi> nor <hi>salt</hi> that afford this so comfortative a virtue, but the Heart of the Elements giveth it, from this it is that it flows. In the Elements is a virtue and power that brings a tree out of a seed: And from the Element it self cometh that virtue by which the tree stands, is fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and abideth; thus likewise Hey and straw is strengthened externally, as is visible to the eye: the like strength is in <hi>Animals,</hi> by the benefit whereof they go, stand, and are moved, and so is it in the other Products.</p>
                        <p>Besides, there's another strength not visible, but that is a strength it hath in it self, by which that Body abides sound and strong wherein it is: But this is the spirit of Nature, which spirit except every thing hath, it perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: that spirit abideth fix in its body, and that-same doth also comfort a man. So therefore, the virtue of the several members of the <hi>Archeus,</hi> flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down into the lesser World, and that by the means of the Vegetables.</p>

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57672:140"/>
doth lurk thereby I gather, that in the universal nature of things there is a twofold accident, an Innate, and an External; the Innate tends but little to Health, but the External onely doth, and in the fire there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of an External Accident: Wherefore I affirm it to be an imperfect work of <hi>Nature.</hi>

                        <p>BVT that you may the more clearly understand our Intention and Opinion, concerning the <hi>Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of <hi>Receipts,</hi> you are to observe, that like as I have before mentioned the <hi>Relollenm</hi> and <hi>Cherio;</hi> so in this place, 'tis expedient, that you again understand it, in reference to the <hi>Body, viz.</hi> thus, That such <hi>sicknesses,</hi> which are onely of a <hi>Cherionick</hi> nature, and lie hid in the <hi>Body,</hi> do descend into the <hi>Body</hi> without the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the three first <hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> it self; For as the <hi>

But in this place we speak of <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>hot Cherioes,</hi> and not <hi>Relolleums.</hi> As for the Rest of what may be here desired, You may read it in <hi>The Discourse of the Original of Diseases.</hi>

Congealed in like manner, in or with its own Element, even as the <hi>Iliastes</hi> hath brought it forth; wherefore the separations of <hi>Nature</hi> do again resolve that which <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> hath Congealed, and in this resolution the two aforesaid <hi>Natures</hi> are separated.</p>
                        <p>Hence 'tis evident that the <hi>Externall Elementated</hi> things of <hi>Nature,</hi> are the <hi>Relolleum-</hi>accident of <hi>Nature,</hi> and, being apart, do not partake of any Virtue: So likewise 'tis clear, that the other <hi>Nature</hi> is fully and most perfectly present, in such things as abide in their proper Innated, and in their proper Accidental <hi>Quality;</hi> both of them in their separation: From these things 'tis evident, that there's nothing, <hi>in-born,</hi> hot or cold; but that which is <hi>Innase</hi> doth neither profit, or disprofit any one</p>
                        <p>Yet besides, there is another certain <hi>Nature,</hi> which induceth an heat or cold; according to which we judge of the heat or the cold, <hi>viz.</hi> by the <hi>Cherionicall</hi> Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony or Touchstone; by the mediation of which, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sickness is to be healed; for, that same <hi>Frigidity</hi> or <hi>heat,</hi> doth, upon its ingress or entring in, incline to, or betake it self unto the sickness or distemper; the which its Innate property doth never affect. All these things are to be found in the Book <hi>Of the Conjunctions of things in the Proprieties of the two Natures,</hi> according to the three Principles; and that according to the prescription of <hi>Philosophy.</hi> Moreover, you shall see the Order of the <hi>Degrees</hi> in the following Chapters, and that, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the reason and Nature of their Elements.</p>

Thus doth the virtue lye hid in Nature: For whatsoever drives out sicknesses, is no other thing then a certain comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, even as the driving out of an Enemy by an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition of force and power. As for the nature of things,

'tis to be supposed that there is nothing amongst natural things that is <hi>(alias,</hi> but is) destitute of virtue, unless it be of a laxative nature, and that is <hi>(alias,</hi> because it is) as much as a <hi>Quintessence,</hi> for that it is an Accident with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a complexion. Although <hi>Frigidity</hi> doth sometimes loosen, and sometimes heat, yet 'tis preternatural, and is by reason of the virtue of the <hi>Relolleaceous</hi> Nature: But whatsoever operates according to Nature, is the quint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essence of that thing: For hereunto is the virtue dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, <hi>viz.</hi> that it may take the filth away from the body even as <hi>Incarnatives</hi> do (in the healing of Vlcers) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce new flesh, by this means (or, on this account) that by their interveening virtue the peccant matter may be removed: these three things are of a threefold Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, but 'ti but one virtue; which by a proper just ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, may be called a <hi>Quintessence.</hi>

                        <p>FOR the knowledge of those <hi>degrees</hi> which are of a Q. intessentiality, and especially of those things that comfort, there are in the first place requisite four observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things: First, What ever is of the earth, obtains the first <hi>degree</hi> of Health. Secondly, Whatsoever is of the Air, affects the second <hi>degree.</hi> Thirdly, What ever is of the Water, possesseth the third <hi>degree.</hi> Fourthly, Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is begotten by the fire, claims the fourth <hi>degree.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he labours in vain, whoever he be, that thinks to extract a Quintessence out of Terrestrial things, equal to that which is extracted out of the Ayre. In like sort that thing which is from the Ayre can never be compared to that which hath its rise from the VVater: And thus are you also to judge concerning the fourth Element; an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample you have in the extraction of the Quintessence out of <hi>Colondine.</hi> 'Tis in vain to endeavour by the Quint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essence of <hi>Celondine,</hi> to attain to, or match the Quint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essence
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57672:146"/>
of the <hi>Phoenix:</hi> and likewise by the Quintessence of the <hi>Phoenix</hi> to equallize the Quintessence of Gold; likewise by the Quintessence of Gold to match the Quintessence of Fire. Although that in <hi>Celendine, Bawm, Valerian,</hi> there is a greater <hi>Arcanum</hi> then it in the rest, (Herbs:) yet is there such an excelling precedency in the <hi>degrees,</hi> that that <hi>Arcanum</hi> is much transcended by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts. So in every <hi>degree</hi> one thing is of an higher state then another; therefore amongst the Earthly terrene things 'tis to be observed, whether or no <hi>Celondine</hi> outstrips <hi>Bawm</hi> and <hi>Bawm, Valerian;</hi> the like Judgement is to bé had concerning the other three Elements.</p>

                        <p>WHatever I have treated of in the former chapters, hath been onely to this end, that I might descend unto the following signs of <hi>Degrees,</hi> and that so it might be made manifest by what means or order the <hi>Degrees</hi> in the Elements consist: For I am not ignorant of the great dissention of <hi>Platearius, Dioscorides, Serapio,</hi> from this point; and of the others also, which have been followers of them, who have written many things of a <hi>Quintessence,</hi> but falsly.</p>
                        <p>But thou, whoever thou art, seek the knowledge of this <hi>Quintessence</hi> from Experience, for so shalt thou find out the <hi>Degrees</hi> in their division.

and convey away the Disease without any virtue of the <hi>Degrees, viz.</hi> in renovating and repairing the former Juvenility, or Youthfulness and Lustiness: But by what reason or cause, and by what virtue these things are done, is declared in the Book of <hi>Long Life,</hi> as some certain pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Mysteries, which (besides <hi>Arcanum's)</hi> are in the Nature of things. Wherefore I think it expedient to pass them over in this place, that so I may prosecute what I have begun, concerning the <hi>degrees</hi> of the four Elements. And although here are many and sundry vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which do overcome and conquer Diseases, some by their <hi>diaphoretick</hi> Nature, others by a <hi>Narcotick,</hi> others by other properties; yet as for these things, I refer them to those that give their mind to <hi>Theorems</hi> and <hi>Speculations.</hi>

                        <p>EVen as I have earnestly commended in my former Books, those things which concern <hi>Degrees,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the differences of them; so likewise in this place do I again commend unto thee the difference by this Rule. Those Herbs which are of a cold Nature, and of the Earth, are not universally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for all the Diseases of an hot Nature; nor on the other side, are such as be hot, for the Diseases of a cold Nature: From these things are gathered seven kinds of Diseases, and also seven kinds of Heats and Colds, of which sort (amongst the other Members) are those of the Heart.</p>
                        <p>This difference is to be even chiefly observed in the beginning of this Book, whereto is prefixed a title of the <hi>Composition of Receipes,</hi> that those things which the <hi>Liver</hi> wants, whether it be hot or cold, may be sought for from the same-like Herbs: So those things in which the <hi>Brain</hi> is defective, require their proper Herbs. Moreover, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Herbs</hi> are generally either <hi>hot</hi> or <hi>cold,</hi> yet these <hi>Herbs</hi> that are for the <hi>Spleen,</hi> do nothing at all benefit the sicknesses of the <hi>Reins:</hi> Wherefore next to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Degrees,</hi> follows the difference of the <hi>Herbs</hi> after this wise.</p>

                        <p>YOu must know the difference of <hi>Herbs,</hi> thus: First of all the <hi>Herbs</hi> are divided into seven species, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the rest of the Elements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that according to the Order and Nature of the <hi>Astrum,</hi> or Stars, the which is as well as these, put or digested into seven spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies or kinds: Besides, by the same account or reason that these receive a sevenfold division<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son doth the body receive a sevenfold partition, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them do affect their <hi>like;</hi> as those things that are under the Sun are appropriated to the <hi>Heart,</hi> &amp; are two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold: But those things that are under the Moon, to the <hi>Brain,</hi> and that in the degrees of both; those that are under <hi>Venus,</hi> heal the <hi>Reins;</hi> those things that are under <hi>Saturn,</hi> comfort the <hi>Spleen,</hi> those under <hi>Mercury</hi> defend the <hi>Liver;</hi> those under <hi>Iupuer</hi> do respect the <hi>Lungs.</hi> Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the things that are under <hi>Mars,</hi> are referred wholly to accommodate the <hi>Gall.</hi> Besides, although the <hi>Herbs,</hi> together with the <hi>Simples,</hi> are not governed by the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, not the Planets by them, yet is there existing a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain singular Dominion or Ruling in every Element, without the commixtion of another.</p>

Like as there are four Elements, so four sorts of Receits are to be prepared; thus: <hi>Viz.</hi> Some kinds of Diseases there are which affect <hi>terrene</hi> remedies; othersome desire <hi>Aereal;</hi> others require <hi>Aquaous,</hi> or <hi>Watery;</hi> and others <hi>Ignious,</hi> or <hi>Fiery.</hi> First of all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the sicknesses or distempers are to be taken notice of in the aforesaid seven Members, <hi>viz.</hi> Amongst, or to what Elements they have relation; for, thencefrom are the Simples to be taken with which you would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a compound, according to the reason and order both of the <hi>degrees,</hi> or species and kinds of them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Elementary sicknesses, (suppose in earthly ones) the Compound is not to be prepared higher then <hi>its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi> but is to be left in that self-same <hi>Degree.</hi> The like is to be understood in <hi>Aereals,</hi> that nothing of the other Elements is to be thereto admixed.

Although they may be composed of but three, so as that but one of each may be taken; yet <hi>these</hi> are more infirm and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker then those that are to be admitted and used to the order and reason of Healing. But to return to my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sayings, there are two (I say) which consist of the Planets on this account, because they unite, commend, and correct the Medicine: two of the Elements, that the <hi>Degree</hi> of the sickness may be overcome. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, two of <hi>Narcoticks,</hi> for this reason, Because the four aforesaid parts are too weak to prevent the critical day, and to expel the Disease before the <hi>Crisis.</hi> Wherefore in this place of Compositions, you are chiefly to observe that you prevent the <hi>Critical</hi> day: such Receits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as are thus prepared, are very fitly availeable in accute, very accute, and the most accute Diseases, the which Receits thou must make use of on every hand.</p>

that which attaineth to the fourth <hi>degree,</hi> it must be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the <hi>Tincture</hi> only; otherwise there is nothing that can be profitably used in this place. Besides, although I have in the former Book prescribed, that a Receit should be prepared with six parts, yet can it be done with three parts, or the former ones may be doubled, and so may be twelve in all: or it may be thus described: Take, of those things which are of the <hi>Planets,</hi> four; those of the <hi>Elements,</hi> two; of <hi>Narcoticks,</hi> one; but so, that you may withall (according to the order of this Description) dispose of the <hi>Weight</hi> on this manner: Take of those things that are of the <hi>Planets,</hi> four drachms; of <hi>Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated things,</hi> three drachms; of <hi>Narcoticks,</hi> one drachm: For thus stands the business, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Weight,</hi> and not the <hi>Number</hi> of Simples.

Last of all, In this place is requisite agreater knowledge of the Medicinal <hi>Art, viz</hi> that you set not upon the way of healing before the time, but rather handle your affairs so discreetly, that where need is of purgation, there purge; where need is of healing, there heal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where of consolidation, there consolidate, on this manner as follows.</p>

are but two Camplexions only: So also there are but two <hi>Guiftednesses</hi> onely: For whosoever shall well know, the degree of heat or cold, he also shall not at all be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that to it, not onely the dry and moist thereof are joined, but also the dry-resolved, &amp; the moist-coagulated.</p>

                        <p>In like sort, all <hi>Ice</hi> hath one <hi>degree,</hi> sufficient to make a member cold, and that is according to cold.

                        <p>MOreover, because there's but one <hi>degree</hi> onely, not is any thing (as well in heat as cold) of an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Gradation then another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'tis therefore assuredly, a chief thing to find our the Dose <hi>Equality:</hi> But in the things of Nature, and in Diseases, the <hi>degree</hi> of both of them is to be one and the same: Nor indeed is any Disease so bad, but the <hi>degree</hi> of the Medicine thereof is higher: For no Disease can be made (or chance to be) worser, unless it be in teference to the Nobility of Nature.</p>
                        <p>But now for contriving or administring the <hi>Dose</hi> in these Diseases, the power or abounding-quality is to be considered of on both sides: From hence therefore take the <hi>dose.</hi> The power or copiousness of the Disease will also abundantly shew thee the copiousness or plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulness of the <hi>Dose.</hi> 'Tis therefore behoveful for a Physician to know what, and how much <hi>Weight</hi> the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease is loaden withall; for so much <hi>Weight</hi> of Medicine doth the <hi>dose</hi> likewise require; and therefore you are to observe that the <hi>Weight</hi> is to be administred, and not the <hi>degree,</hi> for herein is placed the chief foundation or rule of finding out every <hi>Dose.</hi> This now must proceed from out of the number, and not out of the body of those things, therefore the first or chiefest thing is this, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Ares</hi> of the <hi>Microcosm</hi> cures it self, and not the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred Medicines: For as soon as ever the Disease shall be brought to equallity, it doth presently follow that Nature her self cures what is contrary unto her: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are to know, that every <hi>Dose</hi> is not to be used beyond that aforesaid number that is taken from the Disease: For there are 24. <hi>Lots</hi> contained in Nature her self, in which number the Medicine it self must like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be taken, that so it may attain and reach to each Number: The same is to be taken out of the Anatomy
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57672:162"/>
of Nature: For (as I may so say) there are herein 24. Minutes of Diseases, so are there twenty four <hi>Lots</hi> in Medicines; and therefore by those twenty four Minutes, and so many <hi>Lots,</hi> must every Physician know how to administer his Medicines, that so he may bring in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Number (on both sides) into the <hi>Microcosme;</hi> this done, the virtue of Nature is such, as to cure the sick: Therefore 'tis worthy observation, how that it very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happens, that very many (though their Disease be dead or extinct) are neverthelese, as yet, much like to those that are sickly, and that for this reason, because the virtue or power of Nature it self, agrees not as 'twere, in a universal <hi>Harmony,</hi> and therefore cannot exhibit or perform the Office of a Physician: from the defect whereof, and not from the Disease it self, doth death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall.</p>

                        <p>BVt (to speak on of the 24. Minutes) you are to note, that in these Minutes the highest or chiefest <hi>Equality</hi> as well of Nature, as of the Disease, doth consist: and here observe, that a complexionated Disease doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it self, and doth partly descend, and also partly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend from one, even to twenty four: and that not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause 'tis onely one Disease, but as many as be the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases, so many different Minutes be there; the faculty also, or power of Complexions, doth contrariwise as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend from the supreamest, even to the twenty fourth: <hi>[alias,</hi> doth descend from the supreamest, to the lowest.] Hence therefore is such, and so much ignorance risen in the Physician, that he can't know the Disease in its Minutes, save onely by the Dose: Neither do we intend, or is it our meaning that any Disease consisting in the third or fourth Minute, can advance or encrease it self; but rather, this alone must be understood, that there are
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57672:163"/>
twenty four Lors out of which the Dosis doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed: As for example, In the <hi>Caducus,</hi> or Falling sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, there are twenty four Minutes, the which do require even so many Lots; and yet notwithstanding, 'tis but one onely Disease, or species and kindes of that-same Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease, and therefore to find out the Dose, the Theorical part, can't exhibit or afford it you, but yet Experience can: For the <hi>Composed Dosis</hi> doth proceed from Nature, as 'twere Hereditarily, and must therefore be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and administred according to nature, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Dose of Experience. But now, seeing that this same thing must be referred to experience, you must in the first place understand whether or no the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomy</hi> of that <hi>Dose</hi> doth well or truly agree with the Anatomy of the disease; whence it follows, that in this <hi>24th.</hi> Number, each disease affects or requires its own proper <hi>Dose,</hi> &amp; to ascend even to an <hi>Equality:</hi> but beware that thou dost not transcend or exceed this Number; for verily 'tis the office both of the nature of the <hi>Microcosin,</hi> and also of the external Elements, (when they have an agreement, or are harmonious in the body) to assord and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cause Health: And that Conjunction is in like manner as <hi>Cinnaber,</hi> which is too too much graduated. Therefore in that kinde of Elementated exallation, they assord, or give their own exaltations to the virtue of the <hi>Microcosin:</hi> And so the first Grane, <hi>[alias,</hi> that which at first is but a Grane] passeth into a scruple, a drachm, and Lot, and some Granes amount unto a pound, some also into a greater quantity, <hi>viz.</hi> Into a <hi>Kist,</hi> and other some also, into <hi>talents.</hi>

But if the <hi>Dose</hi> in the <hi>Falling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sickness</hi> shall have been in the <hi>Arcanum.</hi> The Physician is furthermore to consider, that that <hi>Arcanum</hi> doth not exhibit any <hi>Dose,</hi> but the body it self which brings the first kind of the <hi>Siphyta</hi> doth it, but even that very body it self is anticipated or prevented by the <hi>Dose:</hi> So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise is it in the <hi>Apoplectical</hi> and <hi>Lethargycal,</hi> when the liquor of <hi>Colcothar</hi> is taken according to the <hi>Arcanum</hi> of the <hi>Dose:</hi> and yet if the Microcosmical body shall not have been considered herein, then becomes it a most present poison of a new disease, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Tartar:</hi> therefore in this Chapter we would have every <hi>Physician</hi> to be warned, that whatsoever kind of medicine he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to administer, he often set this rule before his eies, and observe it very diligently, and not step a nails bredth awry.</p>
