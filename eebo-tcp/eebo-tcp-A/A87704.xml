            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
Declaration and Profeſſion
OF THE
REVEREND
Mr. John Kettlewell,
(Who Departed this Life, <date>April 12. 1695.</date>) Made by him at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the Holy Sacrament of the Lord's Supper. <date>March 23, 1694-95.</date>
            </head>
            <p>LOoking upon my ſelf under my preſent Weakneſs, as having but little time
to continue in this World, and waiting patiently for my Change ſooner
or later, as it ſhall pleaſe Almighty God, in whoſe hands my times are,
and I deſire they ſhould be, to ſend it; I think fit to make, and leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
me, this <hi>DECLARATION</hi> and <hi>PROFESSION</hi> following.</p>
            <p>I profeſs firmly and ſteadfaſtly, to Believe the Creed whereinto I was Baptized,
the Holy Catholick Faith, in the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt. In which Bleſſed
Godhead, I humbly believe, and Religiouſly adore, both the Unity in Trinity,
and alſo the Trinity in Unity.</p>
            <p>I Profeſs to Continue Firm and ſteadfaſt, in the Unity and Communion of
Chriſt's Holy Catholick Church. Being freely and heartily ready, to joyn with
all ſound Members in the Communion thereof, in all Holy and Divine Offices, as the
Providence of God ſhould bring them to me, or me to them; to demean my ſelf
towards them in all things as my Brethren; and to be affected with what befalls
them, as one Member ought to be with the Joy or Grief of another. And as for
thoſe who are broken off from the True and Saving <hi>Faith, Worſhip</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of
this Body; I heartily pity them, and Pray for their Recovery and Re-Union.</p>
            <p>And having been not only made a Member, but, by my Bleſſed Maſter Jeſus
Chriſt's ineſtimable Vouchſafement, called to be a Miniſter of His in the <hi>Church of
England;</hi> I do Profeſs and Declare, That as I have Lived and Miniſtred hitherto,
So I do ſtill Continue Firm, in its <hi>Faith, Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for my Deprivation of my Living ſince this late <hi>Revolution,</hi> in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
with many other Excellent and Pious Perſons, for not taking the <hi>New Oath of
Allegiance</hi> to thoſe who Claim'd the ſame; As I did, ſo I ſtill do firmly believe,
That it was on many Great and dreadful Acounts, my <hi>Bonnden Duty</hi> abſolutly to
refuſe the ſame: And that ſuch Refuſal was, and is, a moſt <hi>righteous and rewarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Cauſe of Suffering</hi> I bleſs my God, who was pleaſed to Call me, and Enable
me thereby to give a Proof of the Sincerity of my Love, and Preference of him
before this World, by Willingly, and Gladly Quitting a worldly Livelihood for
his ſake. And as upon this <hi>Righteous Account,</hi> I parted with my Living, with much
more Satisfaction and Pleaſure of Mind, than I at firſt received it with; So, Bleſſed
be God's Holy Name, I take the ſame <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> therein ſtill.</p>
            <p>And as for the moſt unhappy and lamentable Breach of Church-Unity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
among Us, By ſetting up Biſhop againſt Biſhop on account of this <hi>New-Oath
of Allegiance,</hi> and for the Continuance and Confirmation of the matter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:151585:2"/>
in the Publick and Daily Offices and Miniſtrations of Religion; making both
Oaths, and Holy Offices, as much as may be in all Points ſubſervient to this <hi>New-Allegiance:</hi>
In this moſt ſorrowful Breach of Church-Society; I profeſs, That as I
have done hitherto, ſo I do ſtill heartily and firmly Embrace and Continue in the
<hi>Communion of thoſe Orthodox and Rightful Biſhops, and the Clergy and People Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hereing
unto them, who have Suffered,</hi> as I belleve for their Steadfaſtneſs to the Rules
of Righteouſneſs in the Refuſal of this <hi>New-Oath,</hi> and who keep their Divine Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
and Miniſtrations Free from all thoſe things, which my Conſcience ſticks at
in the ſame; being now about to Receive the Benefit of Abſolution, and the Bleſſed
Euchariſt, from the <hi>hands of One of them.</hi> I heartily and earneſtly Pray for the
Cure, of this moſt Great and Grievous Breach. And whenſoever the time of
Healing ſhall come, The Lord, who purchaſed his Church with his own Blood,
put the work of Healing and Re-Union into wiſe and good Hands, who, without
Paſſion, or Perſonal Prejudices, or any regard to paſt Wrongs, or private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,
ſhall faithfully, and unbyaſſedly purſue the Bleſſed work of Chriſtian-Union,
and be willing and Glad to ſee thoſe Truths which make for Unity, and will have
nothing elſe in their Eyes, but how to Re-Settle this poor Broken Church in <hi>Truth,
Purity, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi>
