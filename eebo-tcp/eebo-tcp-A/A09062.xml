            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

whoe receauinge the grownde of faithe peaceably, &amp; without quarelinge from their mother the Chuche, did attend onlye to builde vppon the same, good woorkes and Christian life, as their vocation required.

            <p>I am therfore of opinion (gentle reader) that albeit trew faithe be the grownde of Christianitie, without which nothinge of it <note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> selfe can be meritorious before God: yet that one principall meane to come to this trew <note place="margin">Good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the,</note> faithe, and right knowledge, and to ende all thes our infinite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tentions in religion, were for eche man to betake him selfe to a good &amp; vertuous life, for that God could not of his vnspeakeable mercie suffer suche a man to erre lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ge in religion.

            <p>And on the contrarie side, as loose lyfe and worldlye ambition, was the first cause of all heresye in Christian religion from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginninge:

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>L Christian diuinitie (good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,) that is, all the busines that man hath withe God in this lyfe standethe in two poyntes. The one to knowe: the other to doe. This first parte containeth <note place="margin">Tvvo partes of Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> principally our beleefe, set forth to vs in our Creede, and other declarations abowt our faith, deliuered vs by the Catholique chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che to know and beleeue onlie. The other parte containethe the ten co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>maundementes, the vses of holye Sacramentes, and the like, prescribed vnto Christians not onlye to kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we or beleeue, but allso to exercise and execute in this lyfe. The first of thes two partes is called theorike or speculatyue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">Theori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke.</note> it consisteth in speculation, that is, in vnderstandinge and discourse of the minde, wherby a man comprehendeth the thinges he hath to knowe and beleeue. The second parte is called practique or actiue, because it <note place="margin">Practike.</note> standeth not onlye in knowledge, but also in action and execution of those thinges whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che by the first parte he hath conceaued and vnderstoode.</p>
            <p>In the first parte there is lesse labour and <note place="margin">Actiue diuinitie harder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatiue.</note> difficultie a greate deale than in the seconde. Because it is easier to know, then to doe: to beleeue aright, then to lyue accordinglie: and the thinges that a man hathe to beleeue are
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:22789:10"/>
muche fewer, than the thinges he hathe to doe, and therfore Christ in the Ghospels, and the Apoostles in their writinges, spake muche more of thinges to be donne, than of thinges to be knowen: of good lyuinge, than of right <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap> And amongest Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians few are damned for lacke of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which commonlye all men baptised haue sufficient: (except in tymes of heresies,) but many thowsandes for euill life dailye. VVherfore Christ in the Ghospell tellinge the reason of suche as shoulde be damned, putteth lacke of good lyfe, as the reason of their damnation. <hi>Departe from me (saieth he</hi>) <note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> 
               <hi>into euerlastinge fire: I vvas Hungrie and you gaue me not to eate, et ce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the reason of this is, for that the thinges which a man is bounde to beleeue (as I saide before) are fewe, in respect of the thinges whiche a man hathe to doe, or the vices that he hath to auoyed. Againe, the <note place="margin">The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> more hurte tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>e the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge by the fall of Adam.</note> partes in man whiche appertaine to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standinge and knowledge, were not so hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te by the fall of Adam, as the partes apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayninge to action, whereby it commeth, that a man hath lesse difficultie, payne, and resistance in hym selfe to knowledge, than to good lyfe, where our owne corrupt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions make warre against vs, and so doe make the matter vnpleasant for a tyme, vntill they be conquered. For whiche cause we see manie greate lerned men not to be the best lyuers, for that to know muche is a pleasure to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, but to doe muche is a payne.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:22789:11"/>
            <p>For thes causes, not onlye the scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res (as I noted before) but allso the auncient holye fathers, haue made greate and longe discourses, ample volumes, &amp; manye bookes, about this second parte of Christian diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whiche consisteth in action, owt of whose worckes, thes three bookes follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winge for the most parte are gathered, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taininge a perfect and exact instruction or direction, for all the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> that meane to leade a trew Christian life, as also diuers helpes for them which haue not yet fullye that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. For what so euer is necessarie to a Christian after he hathe once receaued the faithe, is contained in this worcke. And to <note place="margin">Three thinges necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to a Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> in this lyfe.</note> speake in particuler, three thinges are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie. The first is a firme resolution to ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue God for the time to come, and to leaue vice. The second is how to begynne to doe this. The third is how to perseuer and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new vnto the ende.</p>
            <p>These three thinges whoe so euer hath, no doubt but he shall bothe lyue and dye a good Christian, and enioye euerlastinge life in the world to come. And for lacke of all or some one of thes thinges, manie thow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandes (the more is the pittie) doe perishe daylie. For some men are ether so carelesse, or so carnallie geeuen, as they neuer resolue them selues to lyue in deed well, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake wickednes: and thes are farof from the state of saluation. Other resolue them selues often, but they neuer beginne, or a least way they beginne not as they shoulde
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:22789:11"/>
doe, wherby they neuer come to any perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Other doe both resolue and begyn well, but they perseuer not vnto the ende, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap> for lacke of instruction, or helpes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to the same: and thes also can not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne to lyfe euerlastinge, but rather doe leese their labour, for that Christ hath not <note place="margin">Mat. 10 &amp; 24.</note> promised saluation, but onlie to such as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruer to the ende.</p>
            <p>For helpinge therfore Christians in thes <note place="margin">The diui sio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of this vvorcke.</note> three poyntes, this worcke is deuided into three bookes.

Luke testifieth. And to <note place="margin">Luc. 16.</note> doubt of this, were obstinacie, as S. Austen affirmeth. The other iudgement is called ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, <note place="margin">Lib. 2. de anima. chap. 4.</note> for that it shalbe of all men together in the end of the vvorld, where shall a finall sentence be pronounced, (eyther of reward, or punishment) vpon all men that euer liued, accordinge to the workes which they haue done, good or bad, in this life: and afterward neuer more question be made of alteringe <note place="margin">2.

of gods presence, the strayte examination she must abyde, and the lyke) yet for that the moste of thes thinges are to be considered also in the seconde indgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: I will passe ouer to the same: notinge onlye certaine reasons yealded by the holye fathers, why God after the first iudgement, <note place="margin">VVhy there be two iud gements appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> (wherin he had assigned to eche man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to his desertes in particuler) would appoint moreouer this second generall iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t VVherof the first is, for that the bodie of man rysinge from his sepulcher, might be <note place="margin">1</note> partaker of the eternall punishement or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the sowle, euen as it hath bene parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker with the same, eyther in vertue or vice in this lyfe.

               <p>The third is, that both the vvicked and good might receaue theire revvarde open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, <note place="margin">3</note> to more confusion and harte greefe of the one, and triumphe of the other, vvhoe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie in this vvorld haue ben ouerborne by the vvicked.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and the paines of the vvicked are for the lyke reason dailye augmented.

And that (which yet is more) he can <note place="margin">Psal. 49.</note> not abide nor permit the sinner to prayse <note place="margin">Eccl. 15.</note> him, or to name his testament with his mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the as the holye ghost testifieth: and therfore no meruaile yf he shew suche rigour to hym at the last daye whome he so greatlye hateth and abhorreth in this lyfe.</p>
               <p>There might be manye reasons alleaged of this: as the breach of godes commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metes: the ingratitude of a sinner in respecte of his benifites, and the lyke: which might iustifie sufficientlie his indignation towards <note place="margin">The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son vvhy God so hateth a synner.</note> hym. But there is one reason aboue the rest, which openeth the whole fountaine of the matter: and that is, the intollerable iniurie dome vnto God in euerie mortall finne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: whiche in deede is suche an oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious iniurie &amp; so dishonorable, as no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne potentate could beare the same at his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes handes: and much lesse God hym selfe (whoe is the God of maiestie) may abide to haue the same so often iterated against hym, as commonly it is by a wicked man.</p>
               <p>And for the vnderstandinge of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, we must note that euerie tyme we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt a mortall sinne, there dothe passe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowgh our hart (though we marcke it anot)
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:22789:40"/>
a certaine practick discourse of our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standinge, (as there doth also in euerie other election) whereby we lay before vs, on the one side, the profit of that sinne which we are to committ, that is, the pleasure that dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth vs to it: and on thother parte, the offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce of God, that is, the leesinge of his frindshippe by that sinne yf we doe it: and so hauinge as it were the balances there before vs, and <note place="margin">The iniu rie done to God by synne?</note> puttinge God in one end, and in the other the aforesayde pleasure: we sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>de in the middest deliberatinge and examininge the wayght of both partes, &amp; finallie we doe make choise of the pleasure and doe reiect God: that is, we doe chuse rather to leese the frindshipp of God, with his grace, and what soeuer he is worth besides, than to lose that pleasure and delectation of sinne. Now what thinge can be more horrible than this? what can be more spitefull to God, than to prefer a moste vile pleasure before his maiestie? is not this worse than that intollerable iniurie of the Iewes, <note place="margin">Mat. 17.</note> whoe chose Barrabas the murderer, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected <note place="margin">Mar. 15.</note> Christ their Sauyour? surelye, how haynous soeuer that sinne of the Iewes were, yet in two pointes this doth seeme to exceede it: the one, in that the Iewes knew not who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me they refused in their choise, as we doe. The other, in that they refused Christ but once, &amp; we doe it often, yea dailye &amp; hower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, when we geue confent in our hartes to mortall sinne.</p>
               <p>And is it meruaile then that God dealeth so seuerely &amp; sharplye in the worlde to come
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:22789:41"/>
with wicked men, whoe doe vse hym so op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probriouslye and contemptuouslye in this lyfe? surelye the malice of a sinner is greate towardes God, and he dothe not onlye dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour hym by comtempt of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>maun de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, <note place="margin">The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of a sinner to wardes God.</note> and by preferringe most vyle creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res before hym: but also beareth a secrete ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and grudge against his maiestie, and woulde (yf it lay in his power) pull hym out of his seate, or (at the least wise) wishe there were no God at all to punish sinne after this lyfe. Let euerie sinner examine the botome of his conscience in this point, whether he could not be content, there were no immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie of the sowle, no reckoninge after this lyfe, no iudge, no punishment, no hell, and consequentlye no God, to the ende he might the more securelie enioye his pleasures?</p>
               <p>And because God (which searcheth the <note place="margin">Sap. 1.</note> harte and reynes) seethe well this trayterous <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> affection of sinners towardes hym, lurkinge <note place="margin">Psal. 7.</note> wi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>thin their bowels, how smothe so euer their wordes are: therfore he denounceth them for his enemies in the scripture, and professeth open warre and hostilitie against <note place="margin">Rom 5.</note> them. And then suppose you, what a case thes <note place="margin">Iac. 4.</note> vnfortunate men are in, (beinge but seely <note place="margin">1, Ioh. 3.</note> wormes of the earth) when they haue suche an enemye to fight againstthem, as doth make the verie heauens to tremble at his looke. And yet that it is so: heare what he sayeth, what he threatneth, what he thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>dreth against them. After he had by the mouth of Esaye the prophet repeated many synnes abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:22789:41"/>
in his sight, as the takinge of bribes, <note place="margin">Synners enemyes to God &amp; God to them.</note> oppressinge of poore people, and the lyke He defieth the doers therof, as his open eny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, saying: <hi>This saieth the lorde of hoostes, the stronge lord of hoostes of Israell: Beholde I uvilbe reuenged vppon my enimies, and uvill comfort my selfe in their destruction.</hi> And the prophet Dauid, as he was a man in most high fauour with God, and made prceuie to his secretes aboue all other: so he (more than any other) doth vtter this seuere meaning and infinite displeasure in God against synners, calling them his enemies, vessels of his wrath, and ordayned to eternall ruyne and destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>: and complaineth that the world will not beleeue this point <hi>An unvvise ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  </hi> (saieth he) <note place="margin">Psal. 90.</note> 
                  <hi>vvill not learne this, nether uvill the foole vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it.</hi> VVhat is this? <hi>hovv synners (after they are spronge vp) and vvorkers of iniquitie (after they haue appeared to the vvorlde) doe perishe euerlastingly.</hi> And what is the reason of this? he aunswereth immediatly: <hi>because thy eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies (o lorde), behold o Lorde thy enimies shall perishe, and all those that vvorcke iniquitie shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be consumed.</hi> By this we see, that all synners be enemyes to God, and God to them, and we see also vpon what grounde and reason. But yet (for the further iustifyinge of godes seueritie) let vs consider in what measure his hatred is towardes synne: how greate: how far it proceedeth: within what boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des it is comprehended: or yf it hath any lymites or bondes at all, as in deede it hath not, but is infinit, that is, without measure or
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:22789:42"/>
limitation. And (to vtter the matter as in <note place="margin">Godes hatred in finite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sin ners.</note> trueth it standeth) if all the tongues in the vvorlde were made one tongue and all the vnderstandinges of all creatures (I meane of angels and men) were made one vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge. yet, could nether this tongue expresse nor this vnderstandinge co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ceiue, the greate hatred of gods harte towards euery mortall synne which we committ. And the reason hereof standeth in tvvo poyntes. First for that God by hovv much more he is better than we are: by so muche more he loueth goodnes and hateth synne, than we doe. And because he is infinitelie good: therfore his loue to goodnes is infinite, as also his hatred to euill, and consequentlye his rewardes to them bothe are infinite, the one in hell, the other in heauen.</p>
               <p>Secondlie we see by experience, that <note place="margin">VVhy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery syn ne deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisnen. e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t</note> how much more greate and worthie the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, against whome an offence is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mitted, so much greater the offence is: as the selfe same blow geuen to a seruant and to a prince differeth greatlye in offence, and deseruethe different hatred and punishment. And for that euerie mortall sinne which we committ, is donne directlye against the person of God hym selfe, as hath bene declared before, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se dignitie is infinite: therfore the offence or guylt of euery such sinne is infinite, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tly deserueth infinite hatred &amp; infinite punishment at gods handes. Hereof foloweth the reason of diuers thinges both sayed and donne by God in the scriptures, &amp; taught by
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:22789:42"/>
diuines towchinge matter of mortall sinne, whiche seeme straunge vnto the wisedome <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> of the worlde, and in deede scarce credible: <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> as first of all, that dreadfull punishment of eternall &amp; irreuocable damnation of so manie thowsandes, yea millions of Angels created <note place="margin">The pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of angels</note> to glorie, with almost infinite perfection, and that for one onlye sinne, once committed, &amp; that onlye in thought, as diuines doe holde.</p>
               <p>Secondlye, the rigourous punishment <note place="margin">of Adam and Eue.</note> of our first parents Adam and Eue &amp; all their posteritie, for eatinge of one seely aple: for whiche fault besides the chastysinge of the offenders them selues, and all the creatures of the earth for the same, and all their children and of spring after them, bothe before our redemption and sence (for albeit we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from the guilte of that sinne, yet tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall punishmentes remaine vpon vs for the same, as hunger thirst, cold, sicknes, death, and a thowsand miseries more,) besides also the infinite men damned for the same before the comming of Christ, by the space of fower thowsand yeres, and also synce, as infidels which are not baptized, and others: be sides this, (I say, which in mans reason maye seeme seuere enough) godes wrath &amp; iustice could not be satisfied, except his owne soone had come downe into the worlde, and taken our flesh vpon hym, and by his paines satisfied for the same. And when he was come downe &amp; had in our fleshe subiected hym selfe vnto his fathers iustice, albeit the loue his father bare hym were infinite, and euery litle paine
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:22789:43"/>
that he tooke for vs, or at leastwise euery litle dropp of bloode which he shed, had ben sufficient for the satisfiynge of the whole offences, for that his fleshe being vnited to his godhead made euerie such satisfactorie actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of his, of infinite value and merite, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently of infinite satisfaction, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitnes of Adams sinne: yet that God might shew the greatnes of his hatred and iustice against sinne, he neuer left to laye on, vpon his owne blessed deare sonne, vntill he had <note place="margin">Esa. 53.</note> left no one whole peece of skynne on his fleshe, nor droppe of bloode within his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: no not then, when he saw hym sorowfull vnto death, and bathed in a sweate of bloode <note place="margin">Mat. 26.</note> and water, and cryinge, <hi>o father myne, if it be</hi>

                  <hi>possible, let this cupp passe from me.</hi> And yet mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re <note place="margin">Luc. 22.</note> pitifully after vpon the crosse. <hi>O my God, vvhy hast thovv forsaken me.</hi> Notwith standing <note place="margin">Mat. 27.</note> all this (I say,) his, father deliuered hym not, <note place="margin">Psal. 21.</note> but layed on strype vpon stripe, paine vpon <note place="margin">Esa. 53.</note> paine, torment after torment, vntill he had rendred vp his lyfe and soule into his sayed fathers handes: which is a wounderfull and dreadfull document of godes hatred against finne.</p>
               <p>I might heere mention the sinne of Esau <note place="margin">The esinne of Esau.</note> in selling his inheritance for a litle meate: of whiche S. Paule sayeth, <hi>he founde no place of</hi>

                  <hi>repentance after, though he sought the same vvith teares.</hi> Also the sinne of Saule whoe (his sinne beinge but one synne, and that onlye of omission, in not killinge agag the kynge of Amalech and his cattell, as he was willed)
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:22789:43"/>
was vtterlie cast of by God for the same, <note place="margin">1. Re. 9. &amp; 15. &amp; 16.</note> (though he were his annointed and chosen seruant before): and could not get remission of the same, though both he and Samuell the prophet did greatly lament and bewaille the same synne.</p>
               <p>Also I might alleage the example of kinge <note place="margin">2. Re. 12. Psal. 6. 34. 68. 108. 101 29. 2. Re. 12.</note> Dauid, whose two synnes (albeit vppon his hartie repentar. ce) God forgaue: yet, besides all the weepinge, fastinge, watchinge, lyein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge on grownde, wearinge of sackeloth, and other punishement of bodye that Dauid did vse, God punished the same with maruay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous seueritie, as with the death of Dauides sonne, and other continuall afliction vnto him as longe as he liued.

               <p>Of this also doe proceede all those harde and bitter speeches in scripture tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching sinners, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ming from the mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the of the holye ghost, (and therfore beinge most trewe and certaine) may iustlye geeue all them greate cause of feare which lyue in synne as where it is saied: <hi>death, bloode, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,</hi>

               <p>Hauing declared the names of this place and thereby also in some part, the nature: yt remaineth now, that we consider, what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of paines men suffer there, For declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, we must note, that as heauen and hell are contrary, assigned to contrary <note place="margin">The pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of hell vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall.</note> persones, for contrary causes: so haue they in all respectes contrarye properties, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ditions, and effects, in suche sorte, as what soeuer is spoken of the felicitye of the one, may serue <note place="margin">1.

the felicitie of them in heauen is a perfect felicitie, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>taining <hi>omne bonum,</hi> all goodnesse: <note place="margin">Exo. 33.</note> So that no one kinde of pleasure can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined whiche they haue not: we must thinke on the contrary! part, that the miserie of the damned, must be also a perfect miserie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning all afflictions that may be, without wanting any. So that, as the happines of the good is infinite, and vniuersall: so also is the calamitie of the wicked infinite and vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall. Now in this lyfe all the miseries &amp; pains which fall vpon man, are but particular and not vniuersall. As for example: we see one man pained in his eyes, an other in his teeth, an other in his stomak, an other in his back: whiche particular pains notwithstandinge some times are so extreame, as lyfe is not able to resist them, &amp; a man wolde not suffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> long for the gayning of many worldes to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But suppose now, a man were torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ted in all the parts of his bodye at once, as in his head, his eyes his tongue, his teeth, his throo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, his stomak, his bellie, his back, his hart, his sides, his thighes, and in all the ioynts of his bodye besides: suppose (I say) he were moste cruellie tormented with extreme paines in all these parts together, without ease or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission.

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:22789:74"/>
suffering them vpon a soft bedde, or vpon a burning grydyron &amp; boyling fornace: among a mans freendes comforting hym, or among the furies of hell whipping and tormentinge hym. Consider this (I say gentle reader,) and yf thou woldest take a greate deale of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, rather than abyde the one, in this lyfe: be content to sustain a litle pain rather than to incurre the other in the lyfe to come. <note place="margin">Peculiar torments to euery parte.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But to consider these things yet further, not onelie all these partes of the body which haue bene instruments to sinne, shalbe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented together, but also euerie sense bothe externall and internall for the same cause shalbe afflicted, with this particular torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t, contrarie to the obiect wherein it delited moste, and tooke pleasure in this worlde.

               <p>An other declaration yet of this matter is layd down by diuines for opening of the greatnesse of this beatitude in heauen: and that is, the consideration of three places, whereto man by his creation is appointed. The first is his mothers wombe, the second this present world, the third <hi>is caelum Empi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reum,</hi> whiche is the place of blysse in the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe to come. Now in these three places, we must holde the proportion (by all reason) whiche we see sensiblie to be obserued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the first two. So that Looke in what proportion the socond doeth differ from the first: in like measure must the third differ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the second, or rather muche more: seing that the whole earth put together, is by all Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie, but as a pricke or small point in respect of the maruailouse greatnesse of the heauens. By this proportion then we must say, that as farre as the whole worlde do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the passe the womb of one priuate vvoman: so muche in all beautie, delites, and maiestie dothe the place of blisse passe all this whole
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:22789:89"/>
worlde. And as muche as a man liuing in the worlde dothe passe a child in his mothers bellie, in strength of bodie, beautie, witt vnderstanding, learning and knowlege: so muche and farre more, doeth a Saint in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen passe men of this worlde, in all these things, and many more besides. And as mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che horrour as a man wolde haue, to turne into his mothers wombe againe: so muche wolde a glorified soule haue, to returne into this worlde againe. The nyene moneths also of lyfe in the mothers wombe, are not so litle in respect of mans lyfe in the world, as is the longest lyfe vpon earth, in respect of the eternall lyfe in heauen. Nor the blyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denesse, ignorance, and other miseries of the childe in his mothers wombe, are any way comparable to the blyndenesse, ignorance, &amp; other miseries of this lyfe, in respect of the light, cleare knovvlege, and other felicities of the lyfe to come. So that by this also, some coniecture may be made of the matter whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che we haue in hand.</p>

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:22789:99"/>
as I haue aduertised the often, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse still, with S. Paul, that no humaine hart <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.</note> can conceaue the least parte therof, for whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che cause also it is not vnlike that S. Paul him <note place="margin">2.

               <p>To conclude then, this game and gole <note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.</note> is sett vpp for them that will runne, as S. Paul <note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> noteth: and no man is crowned in this glorie <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2</note> but suche onelie as will fight, as the same <note place="margin">1.

It is not euerie one that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeth <note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> to Christ, lord lord, shall enter into the <note place="margin">Matt. 7. 19. 25.</note> kingdome of heauen: but they onelie which shall doe the will of Christ his father in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>.

Thoughe the <note place="margin">Mat. 11.</note> kingdome of heauen be subiect to violence: yet no man can enter there by force, but he <note place="margin">Apo. 14, &amp; 20.</note> onelie whose good deedes goe with hym, to helpe open the gates: that is, except <hi>he enter vvithout spott, and hathe vvroght iustice,</hi> as the <note place="margin">Psal. 14.</note> prophet testifyeth. My meaning is, that as I haue shewed the greatnesse and woorthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this treasure (gentle reader:) so thow shouldest also conceaue the right way of gayning the same: whiche is no other, but onelie by holie and vertuouse lyfe, as God hym selfe hathe assured the. Thow art ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Matt. 7. &amp; 19.</note> to sitt downe and consider according to thy Sauiours counsaile, what thou wilt doe, <note place="margin">Ioh. 14.</note> whether thow haue so muche spirituall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney <note place="margin">Luc. 14.</note>

as is sufficient to buyld this tower, and make this warre, or no: that is, whether thou haue so muche good will and holie manhode in thee, as to bestowe the paynes of a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouse lyfe, (yf it be rather to be called pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes than pleasure) required for the gayning of this kingdome. This is the question, this is the verie whole issue of the matter, &amp; hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hath appertayned what soeuer hath bene spoken in this booke before, ether of thy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular end, or of the Maiestie, bowntie and iustice of God: and of the account he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of thee: also of the punishement or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde layd vp for thee: All this (I saye) was meant by me to this onelie end, that thou (measuring the one parte &amp; the other,) shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest finallie resolue what thou woldest doe, and not to passe ouer thy time in careles ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence as manye doe, neuer spyeing their own errour vntill it be too late to amend yt.</p>
               <p>For the loue of God then (deare brother) and for the loue thou bearest to thy owne soule, shake of this daungerouse securitie, whiche fleshe and bloode is wonte to lulle men in: and make some earnest resolution, for looking to thy soule for the lyfe to come.

For that all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures vnder heauen, yea and in heauen it sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, as also, in hell: all (I saye) from the first to the last, are argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tes and motiues vnto this poynt: all are bookes and sermons, all doe preache and crye, (some by their punishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, some by their glorie, some by their beautie, and all by their creation,) that we ought without delay, to make this resolutio, and that all is vanitie, all is folye, all is ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, all is miserie, beside the onelie ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of our maker and redymer. But yet not withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ding (as I haue sayed) I thought good onelie to chuse out these few considerations before layed downe, as cheefe and principall among the rest, to worke in any true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian hart.

principall of all ys that, vertuouse lyfe is painfull and harde, and therfore they can not endure to solow the same: especiallie such as haue bene brought vp delicatlye, and neuer were acquainted with such asperitie, as (they saye) we require at their hands.

               </p>
               <p>If any man will be contentiouse and aske me how God doeth this maruailous woorke: I answere hym (as I haue done before) that he doeth it by the assistance of his holie grace, poured into the soule of man, wherby it is beautified and strengthened against all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations as S.

And this grace is, of suche efficacie and force in the soule where it entereth, that it altereth the whole state thereof, making those thinges cleare which were obscure before: those thinges pleasant, which were bytter before: those thinges ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, which were hard &amp; difficult before. And for this cause also it is sayed in scripture, to make a new spirit and a new hart. As where Ezechiel talking of this matter sayeth in the <note place="margin">Exo ca. 11. &amp; 36</note> persone of God: <hi>I vvill geue vnto them a nevv hart, and vvill put a nevu spirit in their bovvelles that they may vualke in my preceptes and keepe my commaundementes.</hi> Can any thing in the worlde bespoken more playnlie?

whiche by robellion doe make the vvay of gods commaundementes vnpleasant: S.

For, so muche signifieth S. Iohn in that. (hauing saide <note place="margin">1.

For that all whiche is borne of God, conquerith the worlde: that is, his grace and heauenlie assistance sent vs from God doeth bothe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>quer the world, with all difficulties and temptations therof: and also maketh the commaundements of God easie, and vertuous lyfe most pleasant and sweete. <note place="margin">An obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ans vvered.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But perhappes you will saye: Christ him selfe confesseth it to be a yoke, and a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: how then can it be so pleasant and easie as you make yt? I answer, that Christ addeth that it is a sweete yoke and a light burden. VVherby your obiection is taken away: and also is signified further, that there is a burden whiche greeueth not the bearer, but rather helpeth and refresheth the same: as the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of fethers vppon a byrdes backe beareth vpp the byrd, and is nothinge at all greeuous vnto her: So also thoghe it be a yoke, yet is it a sweete yoke, a comfortable yoke, a yoke mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re pleasant than hony or hony combe, as sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeth <note place="margin">Psa. 118.</note> the prophet. And whie so? because we drawe therin, with a sweete companion, we drawe with Christ: that is, his grace at one end, and our endeuour at the other. And because when a great oxe &amp; a litle doe drawe together, the weight lyeth all vppon the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:22789:106"/>
greater oxe his necke, for that he beareth vp quite the yoke from the other: therof it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that we draweing in this yoke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Christ, whiche is greater than we are: he lighteneth vs of the whole burden, &amp; onelie requireth that we should goe on with hym comfortablie, and not refuse to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnder the yoke with hym, for that the payne shalbe his, and the pleasure oures. This he signifieth expresselie when he sayeth: <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me you to me all that labour and are heauie loden</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>and I will refreshe you.</hi> Heere you see that he moueth vs to this yoke, onelie therby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshe and disburden vs: to disburden vs (I saye) and to refreshe vs, and not any waye to loade or agreeue vs: to disburden vs of the heauye loadinges and yokes of this world: as from the burden of a guiltie conscience, the burden of care, the burden of melancholie, the burden of enuye, hatred, and malice, the burden of pryde, the burden of ambition, the burden of couetousnes, the burden of wra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the, the burden of feare, the burden of wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckednesse, and hell fire it selfe.

the pretended hardnes of vertuous lyuing: whiche in verie deede is indewed with infinite priuileges of comfort, aboue the lyfe of wicked men, euen in this world.

This is that light wherwith S.

And finallie this is that soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne vnderstanding in the lawe, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes, and iustificationes of God, whiche holy Dauid so muche desired, and so often demaunded in that most diuine psalme, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che begynneth: <hi>Blessed are the unspotted in</hi>

S. Paul sayeth in the place before allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, <note place="margin">1.

VVhich thing, beside scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, is euident also by experience.

For the vertuous hauing now (by the ayde of Christ his grace) subdewed their sayd passions, doe passe on their lyfe moste sweetly, and calmely vnder the guyde of reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, without any pertuibatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them in the greatest oocurrents of this lyfe But the wicked men not hauing morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> the sayd passions, are to ssed and tombled
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:22789:118"/>
with the same as with vehement and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wyndes. And therfore their state is <note place="margin">Esa. 57. lac. 3.</note> compared by Esaye to a tempestuouse sea, that neuer is quiet, and by S. Iames, to a citie, <note place="margin">Two cau ses of dis quietnes in wie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men</note> or countrie, where the inhabitantes are at warre and sedition among them selues. And the causes hereof are two: first, for that the passions of concupiscence beinge many and almoste infinite in number, doe lust after in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite thinges, and are neuer satisfied, but are <note place="margin">Pro. 30.</note> lyke those bloodsuckers whiche the wise man speaketh of, that crye all waies <hi>geeue gee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue,</hi> and neuer say hoe. As for example: when is the ambitious man satisfied with honour? or the incontinent man with carnalitie? or the couetous man with money? neuer truelie: &amp; therfore as that mother can not but be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie afflicted whiche should haue many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren cryeing at once for meate, she hauynge no bread at all to breake vnto them: so the wicked man being greedilie called vppon without ceasing by almoste insinite passions to yelde them their desires: must needes be vexed and pitifullie tormented, especiallie being not able to satisfie anye one of their smallest demaundes.</p>
               <p>An other cause of vexation is, for that these passions of disordinate concupiscence, be often times contrarie one to the other, and doe demaunde contrarie thinges, represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting moste lyuelie the confusion of Babel: where one tongue spoke against an other, &amp; <note place="margin">Gen. 11.</note> that in diuerse and contrarie languages. So we see ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>times that the desire of honour

sayeth <hi>spend heere:</hi> But the passion of auarice sayeth, <hi>holde thy handes.</hi> I echerie sayeth, <hi>ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture heere:</hi> But pryde sayeth. <hi>No, it may turne thee to dishonoure</hi> Anger sayeth, <hi>reuenge thy selfe heere:</hi> But ambition sayeth, <hi>it is better to dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> And finallie, heere is fullfilled that which <note place="margin">Psal. 54</note> the prophet sayeth,
<q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>vidi iniquitate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> &amp; coniradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionem in ciuitate:</hi> I haue seene iniquitie &amp;  co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in the selfe same citie:</p>
                  </q>
Iniquitie, for that all the demaundes of these passions are moste vniust, in that they are against rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son her selfe: Contradiction, for that one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicteth the other their demaundes. From all which miseries God hathe delyuered the <note place="margin">Phil. 4.</note> iuste by geuing them his peace, <hi>vvhich passeth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>all vnderstanding, as</hi> the Apostle sayeth, and which the worlde can nether geue nor taste <note place="margin">Matt. 10</note> of, as Christ hym selfe affirmeth.</p>
               <p>And these many causes may be alleaged now (beside many other which I passe ouer) to iustifie Christs woordes, that his yoke is sweete and easie: to witt, the assistance of grace, the loue of God, the light of vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

By all whiche meanes, helpes, priuileges &amp; singular benefites, the vertuous are assisted aboue the wicked, as hathe bene shewed, and their waye made easie, light and pleasant. To which also we may adde as the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:22789:119"/>
last but not the least co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>sort, the expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of rewarde: that is, of eternall glorie and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <note place="margin">9.

For when the one doe but thinke vpon the daye of deathe, (which is to

And we see, Alipius founde not so great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance: for that the enemye sawe there was muche lesse in hym, to hurt his kyngdome, than in Austen: which ought greatlie to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion.</note> strong temptations, against their vocation, assuring them selues that this is a signe, of more grace and fauoure, yf they manfullye goe throughe. So was S. Paul called (as we reade) moste viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tlie, beyng striken downe to the grounde, and made blynde by Christ, before his conuersion: for that he vvas a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen <note place="margin">Act. 9.</note> vessell, to beare Christes name vnto the Gentyles.</p>
               <p>Secondlye is to be noted, that althoghe this man had moste strong passions, before his conuersion, and that in the greatest, and moste incurable diseases, whiche commonlie afflict worldlye men: as in ambition, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes, and sinnes of the fleshe, (as hym selfe <note place="margin">Li. 6. c. 6. &amp; 15.</note> before confesseth:) which maladies possessed hym so stronglie in deede, as he thought it vnpossible (before his conuersion,) euer to subdue &amp; conquer the same: yet afterwarde, he proued the contrarie, by the help of gods omnipotent grace. Thyrdlye also is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that he had not onelie the victorie ouer these passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s, but also founde great sweetnes in the waye of vertuous lyfe. For a litle after his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>uersion, he writeth thus:
<q>
                     <p>I could not be satisfied (o Lorde) in those dayes, with the <note place="margin">Li. 9. c. 6.</note> maruailous sweetnes which thou gauest me. how muche dyd I weepe in thy hymnes and canticles, being vehementlie stirred vp with the voyces of thy churche, singyng moste sweetlye? Those voyces dyd runne into my eares, and thy trueth dyd melt into my hart, and thence dyd boyle out an affection of

               <p>Fourethlie is to be noted for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction <note place="margin">S.

Austen (as we see) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused not the meanes to know his vocation, but prayed, wept, and often retired hym sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe alone from companie to talke with God, in that matter. VVhiche many of vs will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer doe: but rather doe detest and flye all meanes that maye bringe vs in to those cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of our conuersion. Finallie, S. Austen, after he had once seene clearelie the will and pleasure of God: made no more staye of the matter, but bracke of stronglie from all the worlde and vanities thereof: gaue ouer his rhetorike lecture at Millane: left all hope of <note place="margin">Li. 9. c. 2.</note> promotion in the court: and betooke hym selfe to serue God throughlie: and therfore, no maruayle, yf he receaued so great conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and aduauncement from God after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as to be so woorthye a member in his churche. VVhiche example is to be folowed

But this excuse is no better, than the other goyng before, of the pretended difficultie: for that it standeth vpon a false ground, as also vppon an vniust illation, made vppon that grounde. The ground is this, that a man maye, lyue vertuouslie, and serue God truelie, with all worldlie ease, and without any affliction, tribulation, or persecution: whiche is false.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:22789:128"/>
For that, albeit externall contradictions and persecutions be more in one tyme than in an other: more in this place, than in that: yet can there not be any time or place without some, bothe externall &amp; internall. VVhich althoghe (as I haue shewed before) in respect of the manyfolde helpes and consolations sent from God in counterpoyze of the same, they seeme not heauye nor vnpleasant vnto the godlie: yet are they in them selues bothe great and weightie, as wolde appeare yf they fell vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the wicked and impatient.

I might reckon vp heere infinite other examples: but it needeth not: for it may suffice, that Christ <note place="margin">Mat. 10.</note> hathe geuen this generall rule in the new testament: <hi>He that taketh not vp his crosse and folovveth me, is not vvoorthie of me.</hi> By which, is resolued playnelie, that there is no saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> now to be had, but onelye for them that take vp (that is doe beare willinglie) theyr prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per crosses, and therwith doe folowe theyr captaine, walking on with his crosse on his

               <p>But heere perhappes some man may <note place="margin">An obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>svvered.</note> saye: yf this be so, that no man can be saued without a crosse: that is, vvithout affliction, and tribulation: hovv doe all those that lyue in peacible tymes and places, where no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution is, no trouble, no affliction, or tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation? To which I answere, first, that yf there were anye such time or place: the men lyuing therein should be in great daunger, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the sayeing of the prophet, <hi>they are</hi>

Second: ie, I ansvver, that there is no suche tyme &amp; place so voyde of tribulation, but that there is allvvayes a crosse to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>de, for them that vvill take yt vp. For ether is there pouertie, siknesse, slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, enemitie, iniurie, contradiction, or some lyke affliction offered continually. For that, those men neuer want in the vvorld, wherof the prophet sayed: <hi>These that doe render euill</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 37.</note>

                  <hi>for good, dyd detract from me, for that I folouved goodnesse.</hi> At the leastwyse, there neuer want those domesticall enemyes, of which Christ <note place="margin">Matt. 7.</note> speaketh: I meane, ether our kynred &amp; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall freends, whiche commonlie resist vs, yf we beginne once throughlie to serue God: or els our owne disordinate affections, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che are the moste perylouse enemies of all: for that they make vs warre vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> oure owne grounde. Agayn, there neuer want the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations of the world and deuill: the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting wherof is muche more difficult in time <note place="margin">Time of peace mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous than of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> of peace and wealthe, than in time of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall affliction and persecution: for that the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se enemies are stronger in slatterie, than in force: whiche a godly father expresseth by this parable: The sunne &amp; wynde (sayeth he) agreed one day to proue their seueral streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes <note place="margin">A para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> in takinge a cloke from a wayesarynge ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>. And in the forenoone, the wynd vsed all violence that he could to blowe of the saide cloke: But the more he blewe, the more fast held the trauailer his clocke, and gathered it more closely about hym. At after noone the sunne sent foorthe her pleasant beames, and by litle and litle so entered into this man, as he caused hym to yeeld and put of, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye his cloke, but also his cote. VVhereby ys proued (sayeth this father) that the allureme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of pleasure are more strong, and harder to be resisted, than the violence of persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>. The lyke is shewed by the example of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, <note place="margin">2. Rc. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </note> whoe resisted easilie manye assaults of aduersitie: but yet fell daungerouslie in tyme
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:22789:132"/>
of prosperitie. VVherby appearethe that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous men haue no lesse warre in tyme of peace, than in time of persecution: Nor euer wanteth there occasion of bearing the crosse, &amp; suffering affliction, to hym that will accept of the same. And this may suffice for this first poynt, to proue that euery man must enter into heauen by tribulation as S. Paul sayeth. <note place="margin">2. The cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se vvhye God sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the god lie.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the second, whye God wolde haue this matter so: yt were sufficient to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that yt pleased hym best so, without seeking any further reason of his meaninge heerein: euen as it pleased him, without all reason in oure syght, to abase his sonne so much, as to send hym hyther into this world to suffer and dye for vs: Or yf we will nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des haue a reason hereof: this one myght be sufficient for all: that seynge we looke for so great a glorie as we doe: we should labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re a litle first for the same, and so shewe our selues woorthie of gods fauoure, and exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But yet, for that yt hath pleased his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine maiestie, not onelye to open vnto vs his will and determination for our suffering in this lyfe: but also diuers reasons of his moste holy purpose &amp; pleasure therin, for our fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther encouragement and consolation which doe suffer: I will in this place repeate some of the same, for declaration of his exceeding great loue, and fatherlie care towardes vs. <note place="margin">1. Increase of glorie</note>
               </p>
               <p>The first cause then, and the most princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, is to encrease therby our merite &amp; glorie in the lyfe to come. For hauing appointed by his eternall wisdome and iustice, that none
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:22789:132"/>
shall be crowned there, but according to the <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2</note> measure of his fight in this world: the more <note place="margin">Apoc. 2.</note> and greater co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>bates that he geueth (together with sufficient grace to ouercome therin:) the greater crowne of glorie prepareth he for vs at our resurrection. This cause tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> S. Paul in the woordes before alleaged of the saintes of the olde testament:
<q>
                     <p>to VVitt, that they receaued no redemption from their miseries in this world, to the end they might  find a better resurrection in the world to come.</p>
                  </q>
This also meant Christ expresselie whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> he sayed: <hi>Happie are they vvhich suffer persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for theyrs is the kyngdome of heauen: happie are you vvhen men speake euell, and persecute you &amp;c. reioyse and be glad (I saye,) for that your revvarde is greate in heauen.</hi> Hither also doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine all those promyses: of <hi>gayning lyfe by</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>leesing lyfe:</hi> of, <hi>receauing a hundred for one,</hi> and <note place="margin">Mat. 19.</note> the lyke. Heere hence do proceede all those <note place="margin">Esa. 56.</note> large promyses to virginitie, and chastitie: &amp; <note place="margin">Mat. 19.</note> to such as geld them selues for the kyndome <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note> of heauen: to voluntarie pouertie, and to the <note place="margin">Psal. 67.</note> renovvncing of our owne will by obedience. <note place="margin">Mat. 19.</note> All vvhich are greate conflictes agaynst the <note place="margin">Luc. 12.</note> fleshe, woorld, and our ovvne sensualitie, and <note place="margin">Pro. 21</note> can not be performed but by sufferinges and <note place="margin">Luc. 9.</note> afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>. Finally S. Paul declareth this matter <note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.</note> fullie, when he sayeth: that <hi>a litle and short tribulation in this lyfe vvorketh a vveight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie aboue all measure in the hyght of heauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second cause vvhy God appoynted <note place="margin">2 Hate of the vvorld.</note> this is to draw vs therby from the loue of the world, his professed enemye: as in the next
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:22789:133"/>
chapiter shalbe shevved at large. This cause S. Paul vttereth in these vvordes: <hi>VVe are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Co. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>of God, to the end vve should not be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vvith this vvorld.</hi> Euen then, as a Nurse, that to vveane her child from the lykyng of her mylke, dothe anoynte her teat with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes, or some other suche bytter thing: so our mercyfull father, that vvolde retire vs from the loue of worldlie delytes, whereby infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite men doe perish dayly, vseth to send tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation: whiche of all other thinges hathe moste force to woorke that effect: as we see in the example of the prodigall sonne, whoe could by no meanes be stayed from his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, <note place="margin">Luc. 15.</note> but onelyeby affliction.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie, God vseth tribulation as a most <note place="margin">3. Amedici<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> to cure our disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> present and soueraigne medicine to heale vs of many diseases, otherwyse almoste incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. As first of a certayne blyndenes, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reles negligence in our estate, contracted by wealth, and prosperitie. In whiche sense the scripture sayeth, that <hi>affliction geueth vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 28.</note> And the wyse man affirmeth, that <note place="margin">Pro. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>the rodde bryngeth uvisdome.</hi> This was shewed in figure, vvhen the sight of Tobie was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored <note place="margin">Tob. 12.</note> by the bytter gaule of a fishe.

               <p>Sixthelie, God sendeth tribulation vpon <note place="margin">6.

               <p>The seuenth reason, whye God layeth <note place="margin">7.

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:22789:136"/>
whiche he will laye vppon the heades and faces of his serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tes, as chaynes of loue, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to draw them vnto hym.

               <p>Of this now enseueth an eigthe reason, <note place="margin">8 To mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest gods povver and loue in deliue ring.</note> why God bringeth his serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tes into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

princelye mynde desireth nothing more, than to haue occasion wherby to shew his abilitie and good will vnto his deare freend: so God which hathe all occasions in his owne ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>des, &amp; passeth all his creatures together in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of loue and nobilitie of mynde, woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth purposelye diuers occasions &amp; oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, wherby to shew &amp; exercise the same. So he broght the three children into the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fornace, therby to shew his power and loue in deliuering them. So he broght Daniel, into the lyons denne: Susanna, vnto the point <note place="margin">Dan. 3. 6. 13.</note> of death: Iob, into extreeme miserie: Ioseph, into prison: Tobye vnto blyndenes: therby <note place="margin">Iob. 1. 2.</note> to shevv his power &amp; loue in their deliue ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

               <p>And of this one reason, many other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones <note place="margin">9.

For as water is more gratefull to the vvayefayring man, after a long drythe: and a calme more pleasant vnto passingers after a troublesome tempest: so is our delyuerie more sweet after persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or tribulation: according as the scripture <note place="margin">Eccle. 35</note> sayeth: <hi>Speciosa misericordia dei in tempore tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulationis:</hi> The mercie of God is beautyfull &amp; pleasant in tyme of tribulation.

               <p>Out of this great ioye resulteth an other <note place="margin">10.

And finally, this is one of the cheefest things that God esteemeth &amp; desireth at our handes: as he testifieth by the prophet, sayeing, <hi>call</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Besides all these, God hathe yet further <note place="margin">11.

<q>
                     <p>This the <note place="margin">Psal. 45</note> prophet Dauid expresseth notablie, when he sayeth: God hathe bene our refuge, &amp; streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the, and helper in our great tribulations: and therfore we will not feare yf the whole earthe should be troubled, &amp; the mountaines  cast into the middest of the sea.</p>
                  </q>
what greater confidence can be imagined than this?</p>

Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie <note place="margin">Charitie</note> is exercised, in considering the loue of Christ suffering for vs, and therby prouoketh the afflicted to suffer againe for hym. Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience <note place="margin">Obedience.</note> is exercised in conforming our willes to the will of Christ. Patience, in bearing <note place="margin">Patience Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> quietlye. Humilitie, in abasing our selues in the sight of God. And so lykewise all other vertues, belonging to a good Christian, are stirrd vpp, exercised, confirmed, strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, &amp; establyshed in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> by tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the sayeing of S.

               </p>
               <p>Finallie, gods meaning is by layeing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution <note place="margin">13. To make vs lyke vnto Christ. Esa. 53.</note> and affliction, vpon vs, to make vs

therby to receaue the more glorie at his returne to heauen, and to make more glorious all those, that will take his parte therin.

This is the heauenlie meaning of our Soueraigne Lord and God, in sending vs persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, tribulation, &amp; affliction: in respect whereof holie Iob dowteth not to saye: <hi>Blessed is the man that is afflicted by God.</hi> And <note place="margin">Iob. 5.</note> Christ hym selfe yet more expresselie: <hi>Happie</hi>

For proofe &amp; better declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> wherof, I will enter now into the third pointe of this chapiter, to examine what reasones and causes there be to induce vs to this ioyfullnes &amp; contentation of tribulation.</p>
               <p>And first, the reasones layed downe
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:22789:139"/>
alredie of gods mercifull, and fatherlie mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">3 The third parte of this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter whi tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld be re ceaued laufullie.</note> in sending vs affliction, might be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for this matter: That is, to comfort and content any Christian man or woman, who takethe delite in godes holie prouidence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes them. For yf God doe send affliction vnto vs, for the encrease of our glorie in the lyfe to come: for draweing vs from infection of the worlde: for opening our eyes, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our diseases: &amp; for preseruing our sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les from synne hereafter: as hathe bene she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed: whoe can be iustely displeased ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, but suche as are enemies vnto their owne good? we see that, for the obtaining of bodilie healthe, we are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tent, not onelie to admitt many bytter and vnpleasant medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: but also (yf neede require) to yeeld wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglie some parte of our bloode to be taken from vs. And how muche more shoulde we do this, for the eternall healthe and saluation of our soule? But now further, yf this medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine haue so many more commodities besi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, as haue bene declared: yf it serue heere for the punisheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t of our synnes, due other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse at an other place, in farre greater qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie and rigour of iustice: yf it make a triall of our estate, and doe drawe vs to god: yf it procure godes loue towardes vs: yeeld mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ioye by our delyuerance: prouoke vs to thankefullnes: embolden and strengthen vs: and finally, if yt furnishe vs with all vertues, and doe make vs lyke to Christ hym selfe: then is there singular great cause, why we should take comfort and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>solation therein:
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:22789:139"/>
for that, to come neare and to be lyke vnto Christ, is the greatest dignitie &amp; preeminence in the world. Lastlie, yf gods eternall wisedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me hathe so ordayned and appointed, that this shalbe the meanes of his seruantes salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the badge and lyuerie of his sonne: the hyghe waye to heauen vnder the sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>darde of his crosse: then oughte we not to abhorre this meanes, not to refuse this lyuerie: not to flye this waye: but rather, with good peter <note place="margin">Act. 5.</note> and Iohn to esteeme it a great dignitie to be made woorthie of the most blessed participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio therof. VVe see that to weare the colours of the prince, is thought a prerogatiue among courtiers in this world: but to weare the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be or crowne yt selfe, were to great a digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for anye inferiour subiect, to receaue. Yet Christ our lord and king is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tent to imparte bothe of his, with vs. And how then ought we (I pray you) to accept therof?</p>
               <p>And now (as I haue sayd) these reasons <note place="margin">Speciall Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>fort in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> might he sufficient to comfort and make ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full all those that are called to suffer afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> and tribulation. But yet there want not some more particular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>sideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s besides. VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the first and moste principall is, that this matter of persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> cometh not by chaunces or casualtie, or by any certaine generall dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from higher powers: but by the speciall prouidence and peculiar disposition of God: <note place="margin">Mat. 10.</note> as Christ shewethe at large in S.

Christ restored, as he passed by, a certaine beggar vnto his sight, whiche hadd bene blynde from his natiuitie. For whiche <note place="margin">Ioh. 9.</note> thing, the man being called in question, and speaking somewhat in the prayse of Christ, <note place="margin">Note this example.</note> for the benefit receaued, he was cast out of the synagoge by the pharasies: VVhereof Christ hearing, sought hym out presentlie, &amp; conforting his harte, bestowed vppon hym the light of mynde, muche more of importan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce than that of the bodie geeuen hym before.

<q>
                     <p>This S. Paul most certaynlie assured him selfe of, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> he sayed, that he dyd glorie in all his infirmities and  tribulations, to the end, that Christ his vertue
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:22789:143"/>
might dwell in hym:</p>
                  </q>
that is, to the end that Christ should assist hym more abundantlie with his grace: <hi>Cum enim infirmor, tune potens sum:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <p>For when I am in moste infirmitie, then  am I moste strong, saythe he:</p>
                  </q>
That is, the more tribulations and afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s are layed vpon me, the more potent is the ayde of Christs grace vnto me. And therfore the same Apostle wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thus of all the Apostles together: <hi>VVe suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Co. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>tribulation in all things, but yet vve are not distressed: vve are brought into perplexities, but yet vve are not forsaken: vve suffer persecution, but yet vve are not abandoned: vve are flong dovvne to the grounde, but yet vve perishenot.</hi> This then ought to be a moste sure and secure staffe in the hand of all Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s afflicted, that, what soeuer befall vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>: yet the grace of God will neuer fayle to holde them vp, and beare them owt therein: for moste true &amp; certaine is that sayeing of S. Austen, so often repeated <note place="margin">Ser. 88. de temp. &amp; de nat. &amp; gr. ca. 26.</note> by hym in his woorkes: that God neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saketh anye man, except he be reiected and first forfaken by man.</p>
               <p>For the last reason of comfort in affliction, I will ioyne two thinges together, of great force and efficacie to this matter. The first wherof, is the expectation of rewarde: the other is the shortnes of tyme wherein we <note place="margin">2. Co. 4.</note> haue to suffer: bothe are touched by S. Paul in one sentence, when he saythe, <hi>that a litle, and momentarie tribulation in this vvorld, vvorketh an eternall vveight of glorie in the byghth of heauen. By momentarie</hi> he shewethe the litle time we haue to suffer: and by <hi>eternall vveight</hi>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:22789:144"/>
                  <hi>of glorie</hi> he expresseth the greatnes of the rewarde prepared in heauen for recompence of that suffering. Christ also ioynethe bothe these comfortes together, when he sayethe: <note place="margin">Apo. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Beholde I come quicklie, and my revvarde is vvith me.</hi> In that he promiseth to come quicklye, he signifiethe that our tribulation shall not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure long: by that he bringethe his rewarde with hym, he assureth vs that he will not come emptie handed, but redie furnished, to reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>pence our labour throughelie. And what greater meanes of encouragement could he vse than this? If a man did beare a verie heauy burden: yet yf he were sure to be well payed for his labour, &amp; that he had but a litle waye to beare the same: he wold strayne hym selfe greatlie, to goe throughe to his wayes end, rather than for sparing so snorte a labour, to leese so large and so present a rewarde. This is our lordes most mercyfull dealing, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vs in our afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, &amp; to animate vs to hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de out ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>fullie for a time, thoghe the poyse seeme heauye on our shoulders: the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ming <note place="margin">Iac. 5.</note> of our Lord is euen at hand, and the iudge is <note place="margin">Mat. 11.</note> before the gates, who shall refreshe vs, and <note place="margin">Apoc. 7.</note> wype awaye all our teares, and place vs in <note place="margin">21.</note> his kyngdome to reape ioye without fayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge. <note place="margin">Gal. 6.</note> And then shall vve prooue the sayeing of holye S.

                  <hi>vvhich shalbe reuealed in vs.</hi> And this may be sufficient for the reasones left vs of comforts in tribulation and affliction. <note place="margin">The fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vverthe</note>

               <p>Finallye, this was the resolution of all the holye martyres and confessors, and other seruantes of God: wherby they haue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode the temptations of the deuill, the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurementes of fleshe and bloode, and all the persecutions of tyrantes, exacting things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laufull at their handes.

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:22789:149"/>
fathers doe note) thoghe it tooke some heate of Christian feruour and constancie towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des martyrdome. The example is wounder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, for that in mannes sight it was but for a small matter required at their handes, by the tyrantes commaundement: that is, onelie to eate a peece of swynes fleshe: for thus it is recorded in the scripture.</p>
               <p>It happened seuen brethren to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended together in those dayes, and to be <note place="margin">2.

At what tyme one of them, (whiche was the eldest) sayde:
<q>
                     <p>what doest thou seke? or what wilt thou learne oute of vs o king? we are readie heere rather to dye, than to breake the auncient lawes of our God. VVherat the king being greatlie offended, commaunded the fryeing pannes &amp; pottes of brasse to be made burning hote: whiche being redie, he caused this first mannes tongue to be cutt of, with the toppes of his fingers, &amp; toes, as also with the skynne of his head, the mother and other brothers looking on, &amp; after that to be fried vntill he was dead. VVhiche being done, the second brother was brought to torment, and after his heare pluckt of from his head, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether withe the skynne, they asked hym whether he wolde yet eate swynes fleshe or no, before he was put to the rest of his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes? wherto he answered, Noe: and ther vpon was (after many tormentes) slayne with

the other. VVho being deade the third was take in hand, and being willed to putt forthe his tongue: he helde it foorthe quicklye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether withe bothe his handes, to be cut of, sayeing confidentlie: <hi>I receaued bothe tougne and handes from heauen, and novv I despyse them</hi>

But when the youthe was nothing moued therwith: Antiochus called to hym the mother, and exhorted her to saue her sonnes lyfe, by persuading hym to yeeld: whiche she faigning to doe, therby to haue libertie to speake to her sonne: made a most vehement exhortation to hym in the hebrew tongue, to stand to yt, and to dye for his conscieuce: whiche speeche being ended, the youthe cryed owt with a lowde voyce, and vttered this noble sentence woorthie to be remembred: <hi>Quem sustinetis? non obtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro praecepto regis, sed praecepto legis:</hi> VVhome doe you staye for? I doe not obey the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of the kyng, but the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demente of the lawe of God. VVhere vppon

               <p>This then is the constant and immouable resolution whiche a Christian man should haue in all aduersitie of this lyfe. VVherof <note place="margin">Li. 1. offi. c. 38.</note> S. Ambrose sayeth thus.

Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose in the same place, puttethe two wayes: the one is to remember the endles and into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable paynes of hell, yf we doe yt not: and the other is to think of the vnspeakable glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of heauen, yf we doe yt. VVhereto I will adde the thirde, whiche vvith a noble hart, may perhappes preuayle, as much as ether of them bothe: and that is, to consider what others haue suffered before vs, especiallie Christ hym selfe, &amp; that onelie of meere loue and affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> towardes vs. VVe see that in this worlde, louyng subiectes doe glorie of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, than of their daungers or hurtes taken in battaile for their prince, thoghe he neuer tooke blowe for them agayne. VVhat then wolde they doe, yf their prince had
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:22789:151"/>
bene afflicted voluntarilie for them, as Christ hathe bene for vs? But yf this great example of Christ seeme vnto thee to highe for to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate: looke vpon some of thy brethren before thee, made of flesh and bloode as thou art: see what they haue suffered before they coulde enter into heauen: and thinke not thy selfe hardlye dealt withall, yf thou be called to suffer a litle also.</p>
               <p>Saint Paul writeth of all the Apostles <note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.</note> together: euen vnto this hower we suffer <note place="margin">The suffe ringes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.</note> hungar and thirst, and lacke of apparell: we are beaten with mennes fistes:
<q>
                     <p>we are vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bondes, not hauing where to staye: we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure and woorke withe our owne handes: we are cursed, and we doe blesse: we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted, and we take it patientlie: we are blasphemed, and we praye for them that blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme vs: we are made as it were the verie  owte castes &amp; purginges of this worlde euen vnto this daye:</p>
                  </q>
That is, thoghe we be Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, thoghe we haue wroght so manye mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, &amp; conuerted so manye milions of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: yet euen vnto this daye are we thus vsed. And a litle after, describing yet further their <note place="margin">2. Cor. 6</note> liues, he sayeth:
<q>
                     <p>we shew our selues as the ministers of God, in muche patience, in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s, in necessities, in distresses, in beatin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in imprisonmentes, in seditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s, in labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, in waches, in fastinges, in chastitie, in lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganimitie, <note place="margin">1.

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:22789:151"/>
the rest, in beatinges aboue measure, &amp; often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes in doathe it selfe. Fyue tymes haue I bene beaten of the Iewes, and at euery tyme had fortye lashes lacking one: three tymes haue I bene whipt with roddes: once I vvas stoned: three times haue I suffered shipwrake: A daye and a nyght was I in the bottome of the sea: oftentymes in iourneyes, in daungers of fluddes: in daungers of theeues: in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Iewes: in daungers of Gentyles, in daungers of the citie: in daungers of wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: in daungers of sea: in daungers of false bretheren: in labour and trauayle: in muche waching: in hungar and thyrst: in muche fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting: in colde and lack of clothes: and besyde all these externall thinges, the matters that daylie doe depend vpon me, for my  vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall care of all churches.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>By this we may see now whether the Apo stles taught vs more by woordes, than they shewed by example, aboute the necessitie of suffering in this lyfe. Christ might haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyded for them yf he wolde, at least wyse thinges necessarie to their bodies &amp; not haue suffered them to come into these extremities of lacking clothes to their backes: meate to their mouces, &amp; the lyke. He that gaue the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to doe so manieother miracles, might haue suffered them at least to haue wroght sufficient maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce for theyr bodyes, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che should be the first miracle that wordlie men would woorke, yf they had suche au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. Christ myght haue sayed to Peter when he sent hym to take his tribute from
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:22789:152"/>
owte of the fyshes mouthe: take so muche more, as will suffice your necessarie expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <note place="margin">Mat. 17.</note> as you trauayle the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>trie: But he wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de not, nor yet diminishe the great afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s whiche I haue shewed before, thoughe he loued them as dearelie, as euer he loued hys owne sowle.

               <p>Saint paul vseth this, as a principall consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> when he writeth thus to the hebre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, vppon the recitall of the sufferinges of <note place="margin">A nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleexhor tation of S.

VVherto Mathathias answered with a lowde voyce: yf all nations should obey Antiochus, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte from the obedience of the lawes of theyr auncestours: yet I, and my childredn, and

By whiche wordes, this holye father si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifieth, that euen, as a mans naked bodye, tossed and tumbled among many thornes, can not be but much rent and torne, and made bloudie with the prickes therof: so a worldly mans soule beaten with the cares and cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of this lyfe, can not but be vexed with restles pricking of the same, &amp; wounded also with many temptations of sinne, which doe occurre.

And first he saythe, <hi>they put theyr hope in thinges of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and doe talke vanities:</hi> To signifie, that he meanethe of the vanities, and vayne men of this worlde: whoe commonlie doe talke of the thinges whiche they loue best, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin they place their greatest affiance.

               <p>But, yet to expresse this matter more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciblye, he vsethe two other similitudes: say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eing, <hi>they breake the egges of serpentes, and doe vveaue the vvebbes of spiders:</hi> Signifieing by the one, the vanitie of these worldlie cares: and by the other, the daunger therof. The spider we see, takethe great paynes and labour many dayes together, to weaue her selfe a webbe: and in the ende, when all is done, cometh a puffe of wynde, or some other litle chaunce, and breaketh all in peeces: euen as he in the gospel, which had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> great trauayle &amp; care, <note place="margin">Luc. 12.</note> in heaping riches together, in plucking down his olde barnes, and buylding vp of now: and when he was come to saye to his soule, <hi>Novv be merie:</hi> That night his soule was taken from him, &amp; all his labour lost. Therfore Esay saithe in this place, that <hi>the vvebbes of these vveauers shall not make them clothe to couer them vvith all? for that their vvoorkes are vnprofitable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other comparison contayneth mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great daunger and feare. For, as the bird that sitteth vpon the egges of serpentes, by breaking &amp; hatching them, bringeth foorthe a perilous broode, to her owne destruction: so those that sytt a broode vppon these va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the worlde (saythe Esay) doe hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che at last their owne destruction. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son wherof is, (as he saythe) <hi>for that the vvorke of iniquitie is in their hande:</hi> Still har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vppon this stringe, that a man can not loue and folow these vanities, or intangle hym selfe with their ropes (as his phrase is) but that he must in deede drawe on muche
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:22789:173"/>
iniquitie there with: that is, he must mingle muche sinne and offence of God with the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me: whiche effect of sinne, because it kylleth the soule, that consenteth vnto it: therfore Esay compareth it vnto the broode of serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, that kylleth the byrd which bringeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> foorthe to the world. And finallie, Moyses vsethe the lyke similitudes, when he saythe, of vayne and wicked men. <hi>Their vineyard is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 32</note> 
                  <hi>the vineyarde of Sodomites, their grape is the grape of gaule, and their clusters of grapes are moste bytter: their vvyne is the gaul of dragons, and the poyson of cocatrices, vncurable.</hi> By which dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full &amp; lothesome comparisons, he wolde geue vs to vnderstand, that the sweete pleasures of this worlde are in deede deceytes, and will proue them selues, one daye, most bytter and daungerous.</p>

It is well knowne that Beniamin among all the twelue so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>nes of Iacob, was the dearest vnto his father, <note place="margin">Gen. 42 43.</note> as appeareth in the booke of genesis, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore also greatlie respected by God: and his tribe placed in the best part of all the land of promise, vpon the diuisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> therof, hauing Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, <note place="margin">Iosu. 18.</note> Iericho, and other the best cities wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thin it. Yet notwithstandinge for one onelie sinne committed by certayne priuate men in the citie of Gabaa, vppon the wife of a leuit, God punished the whole tribe, in this order, <note place="margin">Iudi. 19. 20.</note> as the scripture recounteth. He caused all the other eleuen tribes to ryse against them: and first, to come to the house of God in Silo, to ask his aduise, and folow his direction in this warre against their brethren. And thence ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by gods appointement entered battaile twise with the tribe of Beniamin, the third daye God gaue them so greate a victorie, as they slew all the liuing creatures, within the compasse of that tribe, except onelie six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men that escaped awaye into the desert: the rest were slayne bothe man, woman, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,

and infantes, together with all the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes: and cattall, and all the cities, villages, and howses burnt with fire: And all this, for one sinne committed onelie at one time, with one woman.</p>
               <p>And who will not then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>fesse with Moy <note place="margin">Deu. 10.</note> ses, <hi>that God is a iust God, a great God, and a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible God?</hi> who will not confesse with S. Paul, <note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note>

               <p>If thou woldest consider the greate and <note place="margin">Greate &amp; straunge effectes of gods iustice.</note> straunge effectes of gods iustice, whiche we see daylie executed in the world: thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest haue litle cause to persuade thy selfe so fauorablie, or rather to flatter thy selfe so daugerouslie, as thou doest. VVe see that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ding godes mercye, yea after the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the and passion of Christ our Sauiour, for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the whole world: yet so many infinite millions to be damned daylie, by the iustice of God: so many infideles, heathens, Iewes and Turkes, that remayne in the darkenes of their owne ignorance: and among Christians so many hereti ques &amp; misbeleuers: &amp; amonge Catholiques so many euell lyuers, as Christ truelie sayde, that fewe were they whiche <note place="margin">Ma. 7. 20</note> should be saued: albeit his deathe was payd for all, yf they made not them selues vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie therof.

And yet among them also, the greater part perhappes were not saued, as may be coniectured by the speeches of the prophetes from tyme to time: and speciallie by the sayeings of Christ to the pharisees and other rulers therof. Now then, yf God for the satisfieing of his iustice, could lett so manye millio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s perishe, throughe their owne sinnes, as he dothe also now daylie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt, without any preiudice or impechement to his mercie: whye may not he also damne

               <p>But here perhappes some man may saye, <note place="margin">VVhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gods mercie be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than his iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.</note> yf this be so, that God is so seuere in punishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of euerie sinne: and that he damnethe so many thousandes for one that he saueth: how is it true, <hi>that the mercies of God are aboue all his other vuoorkes,</hi> (as the scripture saythe,) <hi>and that it passeth and exalteth it selfe aboue his</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>iudgement?</hi> for yf the number of the damned <note place="margin">Iac. 2.</note> doe exceede so muche the number of those which are saued: it seemeth that the worcke of iustice dothe passe the worcke of mercie. To which I answere, that touching the small number of those that are saued, and infinite quantitie of suche as are damned, we maye in no wyse dowte: for that beside all other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, Christ our Sauiour hathe made the <note place="margin">Matt. 7. &amp; 20.</note> matter certaine, &amp; owt of question. VVe haue to see therfore, how, notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ding all this, the mercie of God dothe exceede his other worckes.</p>
               <p>And first, his mercie may be sayd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, for that, all our saluation is of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, &amp; our damnation from our selues, as from the first and principall causes therof, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the sayeing of God, by the prophet, <hi>Perditio tua Israel: taniummodo in me auxilium tuum.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <p>Thy onelie perdition is from thy selfe <note place="margin">Ose. 13.</note> (o Israel) &amp; thy assistance to doe good, is  one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie from me.</p>
                  </q>
So that, as we muste acknowlege gods grace and mercie for the author of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:22789:188"/>
good thought, and acte that we doe, and consequenlie ascribe all our saluation vnto hym: so none of our euill actes (for whiche we are damned) doe proceede from hym, but onelie from our selues, and so he is no cause at all of our damnation: and in this dothe his mercie exceede his iustice.</p>
               <p>Secondlie his mercie dothe exceede, in <note place="margin">2.</note> that he desireth all men to be saued, as S. Paul <note place="margin">1. Ti. 2.</note> teacheth, and hym selfe protesteth, when he sayeth, <hi>I vvill not the deathe of a sinner, but rather</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eze. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>that he turne from hys uvickednes and lyue.</hi> And againe by the prophet Ieremie, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>playneth greeuouslie that men vvill not accept of his mercie offered. <hi>Turne from your uvicked vvayes</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iere. 3.</note> (saythe he,) <hi>vvhye uvill ye dye, you hovvse of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real?</hi> By which appeareth that he offereth his mercie most willinglie and freelie to all, but vseth his iustice onelie vpon necessitie (as it were:) constrained therunto hy our obstinate behauioure. This, Christ signifieth more plainlie, when he sayth to Ierusalem:
<q>
                     <p>O Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, <note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> Ierusalem, whiche kyllest the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes: and stonest them to deathe that are sent vnto thee: how often wolde I haue gathered thy children together, as the henne clocketh her chickyns vndernethe her wynges, but thou woldest not? beholde thy howse (for this cause) shalbe made desert, and left withoute  children.</p>
                  </q>
Heere you see thee mercie of God ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> offered vnto the Iewes: but, for that they refused it, he was enforced (in a certaine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) to pronounce this heauie sentence of destruction &amp; desolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> vpon them: which he

fullsilled within fortie, or fiftie yeeres after, <note place="margin">Ioseph de bello Iud. li. 1. c. 1. 2. 3.</note> by the handes of Titus, and Vespasian, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours of Rome: who vtterlie discomfaited the citie of Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, &amp; whole nation of Iewes, whome we see dispersed ouer the world at this daye in bondage, bothe of bodie &amp; soule. VVhiche worke of gods Iustice, thoghe it be moste terrible: yet was his mercie greater to them, as appeareth by Christs woordes, yf they had not reiected the sonne.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie, his mercie exceedeth his Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, <note place="margin">3.</note> euen towardes the damned them selues: in that he vsed many meanes to saue them in this lyfe, by geuing them freewill, and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting the same with his grace to doe good: by mouing them inwardlie with infinite good inspirations: by alluringe them owtwardlie, with exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s, promisses, exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ples of other, as also by sickenes, aduersities, &amp; other gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le corrections: by geuinge them space to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, with occasions, opportunities, and exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations vnto the same: by threatning them eternall deathe, yf they repented not. All whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che thinges beinge effectes of mercie, and goodnes towarde; them: they must needes confesse amyddest theyr greatest furie, and tormentes, that his iudgementes are true, &amp; iustified in them selues, and no wayes to be compared with the greatnes of his mercies.</p>
               <p>By this then we see that to be true, which <note place="margin">Psal. 83.</note> the prophet sayeth, <hi>Misericordiam &amp; veritatem diligit dominus:</hi> God loueth mercie and trueth. And againe: <hi>Mercie and trueth haue mett toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Iustice and peace ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

VVe see the reason why the same prophet <note place="margin">Psa. 100</note> protesteth of hym selfe: <hi>I vvill sing vnto thee mercie &amp; iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t</hi> (o Lord,) not mercie alone, nor iudgement alone, but mercie and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment together: that is, I will not so presume of thy mercie, as I will not feare thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: nor will I so feare of thy iudgement, as I will euer despayre of thy mercie The feare of Gods iudgement is alwayes to be ioyned with our confidence in gods mercie: yea in verye saintes them selues, as Dauid sayeth.

yt is a great wickednes (no dowt) and a greate exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of God against vs, to take the one halfe of gods nature from hym, whiche is: to make hym mercifull without iustice: and to lyue so, as though God wolde take no accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t of our lyfe: wheras he hath protested most earnestlie the contrarie, sayeing that he is a hard and eouetous man, whiche will not be <note place="margin">Matt. 25</note>

               <p>Christ in the three score &amp; eight psalme, <note place="margin">Mat. 27.</note> which in sundrye places of the gospell he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreteth <note place="margin">Marc. 15</note> to be writen of him selfe, amonge other dreadfull curses, whiche he setteth do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wne, <note place="margin">Ioh. 2.</note> against the reprobate, he hath these:

                  </q>
Heer (loe) we see, that the greatest curse, which God can laye vpon vs, next before our blotting owt of the booke of lyfe, is to suffer vs to be so blinded, as to adde iniquitie vpon iniquitie, and not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into consideration of hys iustice.

<pb n="366" facs="tcp:22789:191"/>
the feare and respect of gods iustice vpon sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p>VVherfore, to conclude this matter of presumption: me thinke, we may vse the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me kynde of argument touching the feare of <note place="margin">Rom. 13</note> gods iustice, as S. Paul vseth to the Romanes of the feare of gods ministers, which are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall princes:
<q>
                     <p>woldest thow not feare the power of a temporall prince, sayeth he? doe well then: &amp; thow shalt not onelie not feare, but also receyue laude and prayse therfore. But if thow doe euill: then feare. For he  bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not the swoorde without a cause.</p>
                  </q>
In lyke sort may we saye to those good felowes, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che make god so mercifull, as no man ought to feare his iustice. VVolde ye not feare (my brethren) the iustice of god in punishement? lyue vertuouslie then: and you shall be as voyde of feare, as lyons are fayeth the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: <note place="margin">Prou. 28 1. Ioh. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>For that, perfect charitie expelleth feare.</hi> But yf you lyue wickedlie: then haue you cause to feare: for god called not hym selfe a iust iudge for nothing. <note place="margin">2. Ti. 4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>If the matter had bene so secure, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye men by flatterie doe persuade themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues it is: S. Peter wold neuer haue sayde vnto Christianes now baptized: <hi>VValke you in fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi>

<pb n="367" facs="tcp:22789:191"/>
that our spirite is not a spirit of seruile feare: that is, to lyue in feare, onelie for dreade of <note place="margin">Seruile feare, and the feare of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> punishement, without loue: but a spirite of loue ioyned with the feare of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, wherby they feare to offend their father, not onelye in respect of his punishement, but principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie for his goodnes towardes them, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> bestowed vpon them. This S. Paul decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth playnlie to the Romanes, putting the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce betwene seruile feare, and the feare of childeren: <hi>you haue not receyued agayne the spirit of seruitude</hi> (saythe he) <hi>in feare, but the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of adoption of children, vvherby vue crye to God, Abha father.</hi> He saythe heere to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes: you haue not receyued againe the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of seruitude in feare, for that their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer spirite, (being gentiles,) was onelye in <note place="margin">Hovv the feare of gentiles vvas ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile.</note> seruile feare: for that they honoured &amp; ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their Idoles, not for any loue they beare vnto them, being so infinite as they were, and suche notable lewdnes reported of the (I mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of Iupiter, Mars, Venus, and the lyke:) but onelie for feare of hurt from them, yf they dyd not serue, and adore the same.</p>
               <p>Saint Peter also in one sentence expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.</note> all this matter. For hauing sayde <hi>timoreincorum ne timueritis,</hi> feare not their feare: mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the seruile feare of wicked men: he addeth presentlie, <hi>Dominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> autem Christum san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctificate in cordibus vesiris &amp;c cum modestia, &amp; timore, conscientiam habentes bonam:</hi>

So that the spirite of seruile
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:22789:192"/>
feare, which is grounded onelie vpon respect of punisheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t, is forbidden vs: but the louing feare of children is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>maunded. And yet also about this, are there two things to be noted.</p>
               <p>The first, that albeit the spirite of seruile <note place="margin">Tvvo thinges to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> feare be forbidden vs: (especiallie when we are now entered into the seruice of God,) yet is it most profitable for sinners, and suche as yet but begynne to serue God: for that it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them to repentance, and to looke aboute them: for which cause it is called by the wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>the begynnyng of vvisdome.</hi> And therfore, <note place="margin">Prou. 1.</note> bothe Ionas to the Niniuites, and S. Iohn Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptist <note place="margin">Ion. 13.</note> to the lewes, and all the prophets to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners <note place="margin">Matt. 3.</note> haue vsed to styrre vp this feare, by threatning the daungers and punishementes which were imminent to them, yf they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented not. But yet afterward, when men are conuerted to God, and doe goe forwarde in his seruice: they chaunge euery daye this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyle feare into loue, vntill they arriue at last, vnto that state wherof S. Iohn saythe, <hi>that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>perfect loue, or charitie expelleth feare.</hi> VVheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <note place="margin">Tract. 9. in ep. 1. Ioh.</note> S. Austen sayeth, that feare is the serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t sent before to prepare place in our hartes, for his mystres, vvhiche is charitie: VVho beyng once entered in, and perfectlie placed: feare goeth owte againe, and geueth place vnto the same. But where this feare neuer entereth at all, there, is it impossible for charitie euer to come and dwell, fayeth this holye father.</p>
               <p>The second thing to be noted is, that albeyt this feare of punishement be not in verie perfect men, or at leastwyse, is lesse in
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:22789:192"/>
them, than in others, as S. Iohn teacheth: yet beyng ioyned with loue and reuerence: (as it ought to be: (it is moste profitable, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie for all common Christianes, whose lyfe is not so perfect, nor charitie so greate, as that perfection wherof S.

                  </q>
Nay (that whiche is more) S. Paul testifieth, that notwithstanding all his fauours receyued from God: he retayned yet him selfe this feare of Gods iustice, as appeareth by those woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of his: <hi>I doe chastyne my bodie, and doe bring</hi>

of the deuill is more established, and confirmed in vs by continuance: and so, the more harder to be remoued. Fowerthlie, the <note place="margin">4.</note> libertie of oure free will is more and more weakened, and daunted by frequentation of sinne, thoughe not extinguished. Fiuethlie, <note place="margin">5.</note> the faculties of our mynde, are more corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, as the vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ding is more darkened, the will more peruerted, the appetite more disordered. Sixtelie and lastlye, our inferiour <note place="margin">6.</note> partes and passions are more styrred vp, and strengthened against the rule of reason, and harder to be repressed, by continuance of ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, than they were before.</p>
               <p>VVell then, put all this together (my freend) and consider indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tlie within thy selfe, whether it be more likelie, that thow shalt rather make this resolution hereafter, than now.

               <p>The reason heerof is, that which the wise man sayeth, <hi>languor prolixior grauat medicum,</hi>

               <p>For we must vnderstand (as S.

Besides this, this act was a speciall miracle reserued for the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ his power and glorie, at that howre vpon the crosse.

                  <p>It is a remedyles perill, when a man gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth hym selfe ouer so muche to vices, as he forgetteth that he must geue accompt therof to God! and the reason whye I am of this opinion is, for that it is a greate punishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sinne, to haue lost the feare and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of the iudgement to come, &amp;ce. But (dearlie beloued) least perhappes, the newe felicitie of the beleeuing theefe on the crosse, doe make any of you too secure and remisse: least peraduenture some of you saye in his harte, my guyltie conscience shall not trouble nor torment me: my naughtie lyfe shall not make me verie sadde, for that I see euen in a moment all sinnes forgeuen vnto the theefe: we must consider first in that theefe, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye the shortnes of his beleefe and confession, but his deuotion, and the occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of that tyme, euen when the perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of the iust dyd stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.

               </q>
               <p>By these woordes of S.

The generall waye that God propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to all is that, whiche S. Paul sayeth: <hi>Finis</hi>

the waye of sinners is paued with stones, and <note place="margin">Ec el. 23</note> their ende is hell, darkenes, and  punishmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. Finallie, S. Paul maketh this generall and peremptorie conclusion:</p>
                  </q>
                  <hi>Be not deceyued: God is</hi>

               <p>Notvvithstanding (as I haue sayd) this <note place="margin">That the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de at the last daye is insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicient.</note> barreth not the mercie of God from vsing a priuilege to some at the verie last cast. But yet miserable is that man, vvhiche placeth the Ancker of his eternall vvealthe or vvoe, vpon so tyclesome a point as this vs. I call it ticle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, for that, all diuines, vvhiche haue vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of this matter, doe speake verie dovvtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of the penance or conuersion of a man, at the last ende. And althoughe they doe not absolutely condemne yt, in all, but doe leaue it as vncertaine vnto gods secret iudgement: yet doe they incline to the negatiue parte: &amp; doe alleage fovver reasons, for vvhiche, that conuersion is to be dovvted, as insufficient for a mans saluation.</p>
               <p>The first reason is, for that the extreeme <note place="margin">The first reason</note> feare and paines of deathe, being (as the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher sayeth) the moste terrible, of all terrible thinges, doe not permitt a man, so to

gather his spirites and senses, at that tyme, as is required, for the treating of so vveightie a matter vvith God, as ys our conuersion and saluation. And yf we see often, that a verie good man can not fyxe his mynde earnestlie vpon heauenlie cogitations, at suche tyme as he is troubled with the passions of cholique, or other sharpe diseases: how muche lesse in the anguishes of deathe can a vvorldlie man doe the same, beinge vnaequainted with that exercise, and loaden with the guilt of many and greate sinnes, and cloyed with the loue, bothe of his bodie, and thinges belonginge thervnto?</p>
               <p>The second reason is, for that, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion, <note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> which a man maketh at the last daye, is not (for the most parte) voluntarie, but vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> necessitie, and for feare: suche as was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of Semei, whoe hauing greeuouslie offended king Dauid, in tyme of his afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>: <note place="margin">2.

Re. 19</note> he came, and foll downe before hym, &amp; asked hym forgyuenes with teares. But yet, Dauid well perceyued the matter how it stoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de: &amp; therfore, thoughe he spared him for that daye, wherein he wolde not trouble the myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the with execution of iustice: yet, after he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue order, that he should be vsed according to <note place="margin">3. Reg. 2.</note> his desertes.</p>
               <p>The thyrd reason is, for that, the custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me <note place="margin">The third reason.</note> of sinne, whiche hath continued all the life long, can not be remoued vpon the insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t beinge growen into nature it selfe, as it vvere,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:22789:202"/>
For vvhiche cause, God sayeth to euill me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, by the prophet Ieremie:
<q>
                     <p>yf an Ethiopian can <note place="margin">Iere: 13.</note> chaunge his black skynne, or a leoparde hys spottes, that are on his backe: then can you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so doe vvell, hauing learned all dayes of your  life to doe euill.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The fovverth cause is, for that, the actes <note place="margin">The fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vverth reason.</note> of vertue them selues, can not be of so greate value vvith God, in that instant, as yf they had bene done in time of healthe before. For, vvhat greate matter is yt (for example sake) to pardone thy enemies at that tyme, vvhen thovv canst hurt them no more? to geue thy goodes, avvaye, vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> thovv cannest vse them no more? to abandon thy concubine, vvhen thovv cannest keepe her no longer? to leaue of to sinne, vvhen sinne must leaue thee?

               <p>Theese are the reasons vvhie the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie fathers and doctors of Christ his church, doe speake so dovvtfullie of this last conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: not, for any vvant on gods parte, but on theirs vvhiche are to doe that great acte.

For the time present, he neglecteth it, nor maketh any account of vsing it to his benefite.

And of these two hartes in this lyfe dependeth all our miserie, or feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie for the lyfe to come.
