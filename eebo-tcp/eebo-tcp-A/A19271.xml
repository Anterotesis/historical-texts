            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that opinion
(good chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
that I
thinke the
ſcriptures of
God, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge
the
ſubſtance of doctrine contained in them,
be of ſuch difficultie to the learned and
ſkilfull in the tongues, that they may not,
with the aſsiſtance of Gods grace and
meane diligence, eaſily atttaine to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of them. But for ſomuch as
God worketh nowe by ordinarie meanes,
and not by miraculous inſpiration, as hee
did in the Apoſtles time, it can not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
but that to the vnlearned reader or
<pb facs="tcp:9118:3"/>
hearer that wanteth the helpe of knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and vnderſtanding, they may bring
ſome difficultie, as well for the matter in
ſundrie particular places, as generally for
the phraſe and maner of penninge farre
differing from other writers. Wherefore
I thought it woulde not be vnprofitable to
the Church of Chriſt, nor vnpleaſaunt to
the Godly, if, for the help and furtherance
of ſuch vnlearned perſons, I did ſet foorth
ſome briefe and plaine expoſition of the
Chapters of the old teſtament, which vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
are red in the Church on the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
dayes of common prayer.</p>
            <p>Beſide the motion of ſome godly perſons,
and other cauſes, wherewith I haue bene
induced herevnto, one principall is this,
that the aduerſaries of the Goſpell, when
they are by vs blamed for keeping the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God in ignorance of the Scriptures;
<pb facs="tcp:9118:3"/>
and hauinge their common prayer in a
ſtraunge tongue, haue nothing more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
then this anſwere, that the common
people do not only heare the Pſalmes and
other partes of the Scripture euen nowe
that they be in Engliſh with as little fruit
and ſmall edefying, as they did before, but
alſo with ſome perill of conceiuing erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and falſe opinions by hearing thoſe
thinges which they doe not vnderstande.
This anſwere, as it is vntrue in a great
part, (for that we ſee manye nowe, which
conceiue good inſtruction and ſweete com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortes
by hearing the Scriptures redde,
where none did before,) ſo I cannot denie,
but in ſome it is to true, But ſurely in ſuch
perſons as either vpon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
miſlike the ſeruice and ſtate of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
or elſe as men giuen ouer to the cares
of the world and luſtes of the fleſh haue no
<pb facs="tcp:9118:4"/>
ſenſe of God or godlyneſſe. Otherwiſe
there is no man ſo ſimple but that by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Scriptures, although hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande
not the whole matter, nor euerye
clauſe therof, yet he ſhall light vpon ſome
partes whereby he may gather both good
instruction of his faith, and profitable leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
for the amendement of his life. Yea,
and the verye Godleſſe wordling that is
furthest from all true ſenſe of Religion
and holyneſſe, ſhall heare thoſe terrible
threatninges of Gods iustice, that when
God ſhall touch him by ſickeneſse or other
affliction, bee hee neuer ſo deſperate, ſhall
make his conſcience to quake. But that
the more good might bee wrought in mens
hearts, and the leſſe euill conceyued in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious
opinions, I thought ſome ſuch tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueile
as this is might be a very good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and eſpeciallye where they lacke the
<pb facs="tcp:9118:4"/>
preſence of ſome learned and diſcrete ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to teach them. In this doing albeit my
conſcience did beare me witneſſe of a good
meaning, and did put mee in hope to doe
ſome good thereby: yet, to confeſſe the
truth, I both was and yet am ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed
to giue my traueiles abroade vnto
the world. I know how daintie theſe days
are, and haue felt by experience how wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
and vncharitable many be in ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of other mens doinges, very ready to
ſhake euery fillable and letter, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any iust cauſe at all to obiect heynous
and blaſphemous crimes. If I pleaſe not
ſuch perſons (gentle Reader) thou maiſt
not greatly maruaile, For in dede neither
doe I ſeke it, neither thinke my ſelfe hable
to doe it. I write not to them, I write to the
good and modeſt Chriſtian that deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
in reading and hearing of the worde
<pb facs="tcp:9118:5"/>
of God, and lacketh thoſe ordinarie helps,
whereby he may the ſooner attaine to the
vnderstanding of it. And, this my purpoſe
conſidered, I trust, ſhall bee ſufficient to
moue the godlye learned of the Church to
interprete my doinges to the best, and to
take this my ſmall traueile in good parte,
although they finde not in it a number of
things, which are of neceſsitie to be looked
for in ſuch woorkes, as are layde forth for
learned men to traueile in They ſhall not
finde here, either eloquence in penning, or
great ſhewe and varietie of learning, or
curious triall and conference of expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and tranſlations, or large diſcourſes of
difficult matters in controuerſie. Theſe
things the wiſe and learned know are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for mother kinde of writing, then for
this. They ſhall finde here a briefe and
eaſie expoſition of the texte, whereby the
<pb facs="tcp:9118:5"/>
vnlearned reader may not only the ſooner
attaine to the true ſenſe and meaning of
the holyghost, the authour of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
but alſo learne ſome godly inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
out of the ſame. If I had written to
the learned, I woulde haue indeuoured to
my power in ſome other points to haue ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied
their expectation: but in this I haue
tempered my ſelfe wholye to the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of the moſt ſimple. My meaning
was before I had publiſhed anye part, to
haue written of ſo manye of the Chapters
as are redde on the dayes of common prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and alſo of the Pſalmes. But forſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as my health and ſome other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
buſineſſes will not ſuffer me to doe it
with ſo much ſpeede as my deſire was, I
thought it not good in the meane time to
ſtay from them that nede the help hereof,
ſo much as I haue preſently done. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue
<pb facs="tcp:9118:6"/>
as God ſhall giue mee ſtrength and
leaſure, I minde in conuenient time to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe,

               <q>Out of this Chapter are theſe leſſons

               <p>1 Firſt, that we do not truſt and glorie in the bare
<pb facs="tcp:9118:12"/>
names of <hi>Chriſten men,</hi> the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> the
<hi>people of God,</hi> the <hi>children of God,</hi> for theſe names
are burthens vnto vs and notes of vnthankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
(as the like were to the Iewes) if we ſerue
not God ſincerely according to our profeſſion, and
therfore cannot turne away the diſpleaſure of God
from vs, which he iuſtly conceiueth for our ſinnes.</p>
               <p>2 Secondly, that we be not negligent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptous
in hearing the worde of God, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of his holy will, calling vs to repentance, leſt
he call heauen and earth, and his vnſenſible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to witneſſe agaynſt our obſtinacie, as he did
agaynſt the Iewes.</p>
               <p>3 Thirdely, that we be not vnmindefull of the
great benefits of God from time to time beſtowed
vpon vs, but that with thankfull heartes and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
mindes, we acknowledge and confeſſe the
ſame, leaſt we be iuſtly in the ſight of god eſteemed
more dull and thankeleſſe, than the brute beaſtes
are to their mayſters and keepers.</p>
               <p>4 Fourthly, when God ſhall for our ſinfulneſſe,
fatherly chaſtice vs with any ſcourge of aduerſitie,
whether it be with warre, ſedition, trouble, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
pouertie, vexation of minde, or any other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
publique or priuate, of purpoſe by that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
correction to bring vs home to him againe by
repentance, that we doe not ſtubburnely ſtande a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt

and repentant heartes ſubmit our ſelues and flie
to him for mercie through Chriſt Ieſu our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:9118:12"/>
5 Fifſtly, that we flatter not our ſelues and think
to winne Gods fauour by externall and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
worſhipping of God, being inwardly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of true fayth toward God, and vnfeyned loue
or vpright dealing towardes our brethren. For
God doth here notably declare how he lotheth, and
abhorreth ſuch maner of hypocriſie.</p>
               <p>6 Sixtly, when want of repentance, and the
multitude and greatneſſe of our ſinnes ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke
the iuſtice of god, to lay his heauy hand vpon
vs by rayſing vp of cruell Tyrannes, or bringing
in of forraine enimies by his iuſt iudgement, to
ſpoyle our countrey or people, that we conceyue
this comfort of his great mercie, that he will not
vtterly and for euer deſtroy his Churche, and the
number of them that feare him, but by this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
will purge them from their owne corruption,
and from the infection of the wicked ones, that
they may more ſincerely ſerue him in ſpirite and
in truth.</p>

               <p>The glorie and aduauncement of the Church
which is here ſo highly ſpoken of, muſte not bee

               <p>When the Prophete ſayth, <hi>Come let vs aſcende

of the Gentiles (in whoſe perſon this is ſpoken)
not only to imbrace the fayth of Chriſt themſelues:
but alſo cheerefully to encourage other to the ſame.
Which may appeere in this, that by the preaching

<hi>And he will inſtruct vs in his wayes.</hi> Hereby
is to be noted, that the chiefe care and ſtudie of the

               <p>The Prophete doth here inſult vpon the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne

from the beginning had bene accounted the choſen
people of God.</p>
               <p>2 Secondly, that the chiefe ſtudie of the church

is their duetie, that aſſociate themſelues vnto the

For their obſtinacie in refuſing Chriſt the

               <p>This plague of Gods heauy iudgement vpon
the <hi>Ievves,</hi> doth the Prophet ſet forth in forme of a
waſte or deſolation made in warre. For albeit
the <hi>Ievves</hi> after their reiecting were in deede by
warre vnder <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> brought to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
waſte and deſolation: yet is this place not
onely to be vnderſtanded therof, but alſo and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
of their Spirituall calamitie being vtterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to be the people of God, and turned out of all
that heauenly riches, glory, bleſſe, and comfort that
they had before through the lawe, promiſe, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant
of almightie God made vnto them. Which
was a farre more grieuous plague than the ſpoile
of their Countrie, and ſubuerſion of their Citie.
For by that, the glorie of Gods kingdome among
them was raſed and defaced.</p>
               <p>In warre, men eyther are ſlaine or caſt out of
their Countrie, the lande is made waſte from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitance,
goodlye buildinges are ouerthrowne.
There is no regarde of prieſt or people, maiſter
or ſeruant, maiſtreſſe or mayde, riche or poore. &amp;c.
all ſortes are ſpoyled and feele the plague there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
And then needes muſt the inhabitantes lament
and mourne, and the whole Countrey be turned
into an horrible and miſerable fourme and ſhape.
As this was the outward waſte, ſo was the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
deſolation no leſſe, but rather more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous.
For they were bereft of all that maieſtie and
glorie that they had before God, they remained no
<pb facs="tcp:9118:23"/>
longer the people of God. Fewe of them came to
the knowledge of ſaluation. Both prieſt and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
mayſter and ſeruant, and al other ſortes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
difference were caſt of from God, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
of all his bleſſings. To conclude, kingdome
and prieſthoode, and all the treaſures of heauenly
knowledge were taken from them. And that not
by the hande of anye mortall Prince, but by the
mightie power of God. <hi>For the Lorde</hi> (ſayth he)

for the glorie of the name of God, wherewith they

ſomewhat troubled, ſo yet did they not declare ſo

               <p>Heare we haue to learne, that God oftentimes,
after promiſe and comfort of deliuerance giuen,
doth, for the time, encreaſe and double, as it were,
the affliction of his people, as he doth here to <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias,</hi>

Wherefore it cannot be thought, when

               <p>Vnto the ende of the twenteth verſe. In this
ſeconde part of the Chapter, GOD doth ſharpely

deride the fonde blindeneſſe,<note place="margin">Baruc. 6. b. 19. 26. 48. 56. 67</note> and furious rage and

pleaſant in this place to conſider, how he painteth
out the buſie vanitie of them, that make the Idols
and the fonde and importunate deſire of thoſe that
long for them, and the vnſenſible groſſeneſſe of
ſuch as be giuen to the worſhip of them: Euen ſo
may it ſeeme horrible in the ſight of God and man,
that man indued with reaſon, and the moſt hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

Blindeneſſe, as that he will aduenture with his

at this day for their defence, and ſay they
haue Iniurie, when they be ſo charged. And yet
ſurely is their defence herein no better, than the
defence of the Heathen and Gentiles, whom God
here thus mocketh and reprooueth. For they had
the ſame anſweres and pretences, and yet is it
<pb facs="tcp:9118:63"/>
euident, that both the one and the other do ſo rage
in their madneſſe, that ſo ſoone as they be made by

therefore doe they Cap and kneele vnto them, call

               <q>And God ſaw the light that it was good:<note place="margin">Verſ. 4.</note>
and God deuided the light, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>This maner of Iudgement God giueth of all
things that he made, he ſayth not, God ſawe that
they were pleaſant, beautifull, and faire, but that
they were * Good.<note place="margin">Eccle. 39. e. 34.</note> Whereby we may learne that
God did not ſo much reſpect his owne glorie in the

               <q>Let there be a Firmament betweene the

               <p>After God had created and made perfite all the

marueylouſly diſtincted eche thing in hys
kinde, place, and office, he laſtly commeth to the

vſe principallie al other his creatures might ſeeme
to be framed. That he in the vſe of them might
vnderſtande the great goodneſſe of his Lorde and

him true Worſhip and glorie. Concerning Man,
he noteth here briefely 3. thinges, his Creation,
his Dignitie, his Bleſſing and encreaſe.</p>
               <p>Of his Creation it will be ſpoken in the next
chapiter more particularly. Of his Dignitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all other Creatures, this is one euident teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonie,
that he ſayth not, let Man be made, as he
ſayde before of other things. <hi>Let there be a lyght:

He as it were, calleth in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſultation his <hi>VViſdom,</hi>
that is, the ſeconde perſon in Trinitie, and hys

and ſaith, <hi>Let vs make man.</hi> So that in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Man, is a more perfite token giuen of the
Three Perſons in Trinitie, then in the Creating
<pb facs="tcp:9118:98"/>
of any other part of the worlde. And further to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the Dignitie of man,<note place="margin">Gen. 5. a. 1.</note> He was made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the * Image of God:<note place="margin">Coloſ. 3. b. 10</note> whereby we maye

that God hath a like proportion of body,<note place="margin">Cor. 11. b. 7</note> as we ſee

ſo was Man made by God, wiſe, iuſte, merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
good, innocent, holy, immortall: and to expreſſe
a more perfite lykeneſſe he was made of power,
and appointed Lorde and Ruler ouer all the other
Creatures of the worlde. This Image, by the
fall of <hi>Adam</hi> was almoſt cleane blotted out,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. f. 45</note> and

to the ende that by lawfull procreation they
might fulfill the earth, and raiſe vp a large and

to giue Honor and glorie to their Lorde and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.
Wherefore it cannot be thought that Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
and the lawfull ioyning of Man and Woman
is an euill or an vncleane thing, but the lawfull
and good ordinance of God himſelfe. And therfore
well ſayth <hi>Saint Paule.</hi>

               <p>3 The thirde Helpe is Comfort in ſickeneſſe, in
affliction, and in all houſhold cares and troubles,
as in education of children, and keeping the family
in order. In this place haue we the Inſtitution
and notable commendation of matrimonie by God

Poſteritie of the Wicked; but from the Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Godly, though they were now fallen to
great corruption, and liued in Idolatrie. And this

that there are two cauſes, for which a godly man
may &amp; ought to Forſake the Companie and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of the wicked. 1 The one is, if he can not
be out of daunger of Life and Conſcience among

if he haue the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

calling him, and good Oportunitie to Spreade the
glorie of God, and ſtudie of his true worſhip in an

they were both in <hi>Abram,</hi> I thinke he is not bound
in conſcience to depart, but without Sinne maye

               <p>This Bleſſing that God here promiſeth to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brain</hi>

Wherefore we ſee, that God him ſelfe in thys

out ſome great conſideration, whie God did nowe
chiefely plague the <hi>Chananites</hi> after that <hi>Abram</hi>

that all things,<note place="margin">Exod. 32. d. 14</note> for their cauſe, ſhoulde haue gone
the more Proſperouſly with them. But ſeeing it
pleaſed God otherwiſe, we muſt thinke that Gods
pacience was greatly ſtirred againſt them, both by
ſome meruelous increaſe of their Stubburnneſſe,
and wickedneſſe, and alſo by the malicious and
frowarde Abuſing of the Godly. For, ſo we ſee it
oftentimes by the prouidence of God, that, when
Gods truth and his holy will is preached, &amp; taught
in the worlde, by his notable and worthie inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
ſome great Aduerſitie and Plague doth
followe to the puniſhment of the ſtubburnneſſe,
and blaſphemie of the wycked agaynſt it. The
cauſes of which plagues the Malice of the worlde,
to their further co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation, not ſeeing their owne
Sinnefulneſſe, doth blaſphemouſly. Impute to
the true Doctrine of God, and to the good and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perſons publiſhing the ſame. Thus was it in
the time of <hi>Hieremie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 44. d. 16</note> and of the Prophetes. Thus

               <p>Here, firſt, we haue to note that euen Godly
men comming among the Wicked, or into place of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:9118:120"/>
daunger, though they put their truſt in God, yet
are they not voyde of care and feare,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 21. d. 13</note> and * Deuiſe
by all meanes they can, howe they may Shunne

the Violence &amp; Malice of the wicked, which
to ſatiſfie there Filthie, and fleaſhly Luſt, whyll not
ſpare to commit any Miſchiefe, eyther by Murder
or otherwiſe. Thirdly, it may be doubted howe
a godly man can deuiſe to ſaue himſelfe by a <hi>Lye,</hi>
for aunſwere wherevnto, vnderſtande you there
are three kinds of <hi>Lying.</hi> 1 Firſt, when we vtter an
Vntruth. 2 Secondly, when we denie a Truth.
3 Thirdly, when Truth is diſſembled, and for the
time vpon conſiderations concealed. The two firſt
wayes no man can vſe without ſinne, nor ought to
ſaue himſelfe by them. The thirde waye <hi>Abram</hi>
did vſe, concealing that <hi>Sarah</hi> was his wyfe, and
yet vttering no vntruth in ſaying ſhe was hys
ſiſter. But neyther in this, nor yet in that, that
foloweth, is it to be thought, that <hi>Abram</hi> was voide
of ſome Imperfection, proceeding of to much ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morouſneſſe
and want of confidence in the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of God. For how can it ſtand with perfit Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie,
for his bodily ſafetie, and hope of better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement
in a ſtraunge place, to haſarde the
Chaſtitie of his faythfull, true, and louing Wife,
and giue occaſion both to her, and to the Prince,
or other of the <hi>Egiptians,</hi> to commit adulterie.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth <hi>VVe may not doe ill that good

                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3. b. 8.</note> We haue not therfore any colour
here in <hi>Abram,</hi> wherby we may be encouraged for
<pb facs="tcp:9118:121"/>
any cauſe, to vſe the lyke dealing: but rather a
plaine example, that euen Holy men are ſubiect

ſometimes doe that, which is Euill, and can not be

the Egiptians behelde the woman,<note place="margin">Verſ. 14.</note> &amp;c.</q>
               <p>Marke here the vanity of Worldly &amp; fleſhly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
<hi>Abram</hi> vndoubtedly was a man of comely
Stature, Graue in countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; of much Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
and curteſie in behauior. And <hi>Saray</hi> his wife

And yet theſe fleſhly men had no conſideration
of thoſe giftes,<note place="margin">Iudit. 10. d. 18 Da. 14. a. 8. 10</note> but, with vnchaſte affections, * caſt
their eyes altogether vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hir faireneſſe. And euen
for the ſame take her, without further conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to be a Preſent for the Prince hymſelfe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
may appeare a great corruption of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
as well in the Prince as in the People.
For had not the Prince ſhewed himſelfe in lyfe to
be ſuch a one, as, to ſatiſfie his fleſhly luſt &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he regarded neither honeſtie nor godlyneſſe,
but onely the bewtie of the perſon: The <hi>Egiptians</hi>
would neuer haue bene ſo readie to haue tolde the
King, nor he to haue taken her into his houſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
their report. Therefore it is well ſayde that the
Offence of a Prince is a Double Offence, as well
for the euill, that is in the thing it ſelfe, as that it is
an Example to drawe many to the like euill.</p>

early, got him to the place where he ſtoode before the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence

and towarde all the lande of that plaine countrie,
and behelde, and lo the ſmoke of the countrie aroſe as the
ſmoke of a furnaſſe. 29 And it came to paſſe, that when
God deſtroyed the Cities of that region, he thought vpon
Abraham: and ſent Lot out from the middeſt of the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe,
when he ouerthrewe the cities in one of the which
Lot dwelled. 30 And Lot departed out of Soar, &amp; dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the Mountaine with his two daughters: for he feared
to tary in Soar, but dwelled in a caue, he &amp; his two daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
31 And the elder ſaide vnto the yonger, Our father is
olde, and there is not a man in the earth to come in vnto vs,
after the maner of all the worlde. 32 Come, let vs giue
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> our father wine to drinke, and lye with him, that we maye
ſaue ſéede of our father. 33 And ſo they gaue their father
wine to drinke that night: and the elder daughter went and
laye with hir father, and he perceyued it not, neither when
ſhe lay downe, neyther when ſhe roſe vp.</p>
               <p>34 And on the morrowe the elder ſaide vnto the yonger,
Beholde, yeſternight laye I with my father: let vs make

               <p>This Inceſtuous acte of <hi>Loths</hi> daughters and

Horrible to be Committed by them, who did yet,
as it were before their eyes beholde the heauie
hande of God, for the like vncleaneſſe in the <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites.</hi>
But that the leſſe offence may be taken here
at, and ſome doubtes aunſwered, we will briefely
examine the hyſtorie in this maner. This doing
of <hi>Loth</hi> and his daughters may be conſidred three
<pb facs="tcp:9118:127"/>
wayes, eyther in reſpect of the fact it ſelfe, or of
their knowledge or ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or of their intent and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> purpoſe. The qualitie of the fact in it ſelfe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
is verie greeuous, not onely in that he had to
doe with two ſiſters, but the ſame alſo his owne
daughters, And therefore can not be iudged to be
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> leſſe then Horrible Inceſt in the fact it ſelfe. If we
reſpect <hi>Loth</hi> he knewe not what he did, and ſo the
ſcripture ſayth, <hi>He knewe not when they came to
bedde, or when they roſe:</hi> and therefore can he not
be condemned of wilfull Inceſt. And yet his dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe
may not be ſo Excuſed, but that he muſt
needes be noted of Vntemperancie. For although
after ſo great feare and trouble of minde in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
&amp; his daughters, he might drinke wine more
then vſuall, to comfort his ſpirites, yet he ſhoulde
not in anye wiſe haue gone ſo farre, as to haue
bene dronke therewith, and incited to Vncleane
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> luſt of the bodye. And further, if we conſider the
Intent and purpoſe of the Daughters, by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie
of the ſcriptures they ſeeme not to haue
done the thing ſo much for the heate of bodily plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
as of a deſire to raiſe poſteritie and iſſue after
them: becauſe, through feare aſtonied, they thought
all mankinde had bene extinguiſhed by that terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
plague of God. The ſumme then is this, The
fact being of it ſelfe horrible as well in the Father
as in the Daughters, by conſideration of ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
is extenuated, but not ſo, that they can
be diſcharged of Iuſt Crime and blame.</p>

               <p>This Tentation ryſeth by ſundrie degrees to an
<pb facs="tcp:9118:129"/>
exceeding great triall of the fayth of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to
kill any Innocent perſon may ſeeme an vniuſt and
cruell thing: much more to kill, not one of his Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and kindred onelye, but his owne naturall
Sonne, yea, and his Onely ſonne, and that onely
ſonne, that he, at the appoyntment of God, loued
ſo tenderly,<note place="margin">Gen. 21. b. 12.</note> and vpon * whom the Fulfilling of the
promiſe and bleſſing of God did ſeeme to depende,
this, I ſay, was a marueylous triall of his fayth.
And it was no ſmall tentation alſo, that it might
ſeeme vncredible, that the true and lyuing God
ſhould nowe delite in the ſacrifice of mans bloud:
It was neuer before done. Nor <hi>Adam,</hi> nor <hi>Abel,</hi>
nor <hi>Noe,</hi> were willed to doe the like, Yea, God him
ſelfe had ſhewed,<note place="margin">Gen. 9, a. 5. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. that he deteſted the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of mans bloud. Therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> might
haue ſuſpected that this commaundement was not
of God, but of the Deuill, to drawe him and his
ſonne to the diſpleaſure of God, and to defeate and
ouerthrow the fulfilling of the bleſſing of all the
Nations in earth by his ſeede.<note place="margin">Heb. 11. d. 19.</note> But ſo * ſtrong was
<hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, as al this could not ſhake it, no not
though both he and his wife were paſt children by

               <q>Then Abraham roſe vp early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and ſadled his Aſſe,<note place="margin">Verſ. 3. 4. &amp;c.</note> &amp;c.</q>
               <p>This is in <hi>Abraham</hi> an example of a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Obedience. It maye appeare, that this man,
euen from the beginning of his calling, had ſetled
his minde both conſtantly to Beleue whatſoeuer
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:9118:129"/>
God promiſed, (were it neuer ſo vnpoſſible to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
reaſon) and alſo wyllingly to obey that he
was commaunded by him, though it ſeemed neuer
ſo lothſome, diſpleaſant, and odious in the ſight of
the worlde.<note place="margin">Gen. 12. a 4</note> He * forſooke his naturall countrie, He
liued wyllingly as an exile in a ſtraunge land, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
preſſed with * famine,<note place="margin">Gen. 12. b. 10.</note> He bare it paciently and

put from his his elder ſonne * <hi>Iſmaell</hi> whome he
loued,<note place="margin">Gen. 21. b. 14.</note> and ſetled his hope altogither vpon the
yonger. And nowe ſheweth himſelfe readie to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
his life alſo at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of the Lord:
Such is the fayth and obedience of the ſaintes of
God. For they alwaye cleaue to the ſincere and
Simple worde and commaundement of God. If
there be any thing therein, that ſeemeth difficulte,
ſtraunge, or abſurde, that they leaue to the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and prouidence of God, to the vnderſtanding
wherof they are not hable to attaine. And in deede
right Faith &amp; Obedience are grounded and ſtayed
vpon theſe two things, that is, the Truth, and the
Omnipotencie of God. If his promiſe ſeeme vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
&amp; thereby ſhake our faith, it is Staied vp
by the conſideration of his Truth. For he can not
* but ſpeake that is True,<note place="margin">Titus. 1. a. 2.</note> ſeeme it neuer ſo vnpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.
And againe if we doubt of the truth, we
ſtrengthen our ſelues with his Omnipotency: and
therefore appeare it to mans weakeneſſe neuer ſo
vntrue, yet God is hable to performe it. With theſe
two pyllers did <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtay vp his fayth and ſet
forwarde is readie obedience, that is declared in
<pb facs="tcp:9118:130"/>
all this hiſtorie.</p>
               <q>And Abraham ſtretching forth his arme
tooke the knife to haue killed,<note place="margin">Verſ. 10. &amp;c.</note> &amp;c.</q>
               <p>Nowe the purpoſe of God is opened, and the
matter declared, that whatſoeuer GOD cauſed
<hi>Abraham</hi> hitherto to do, was not to this ende, that
his ſonne ſhould be Sacrificed, but that his fayth
and Obedience toward God ſhould be tried and
teſtified to the worlde. For when <hi>Abraham</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
and done all thinges, and was nowe in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe
to haue offered vp his Son in ſacrifice, the
Angell of God, euen in the very point, ſtaieth him,
ſaying: <hi>Lay not thy hande vpon the childe, nowe I
knowe that thou feareſt God.</hi> In which words, he
ſheweth alſo, that the feare of God is the Roote of
true obedience. God knewe before, that <hi>Abraham</hi>
did feare him: but by this maner of ſpeaking the
ſcripture gyueth vs to vnderſtande, that GOD
doth not regarde the Shewe and pretence of hys
feare and worſhip,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. b. 13.</note> but the true * Practiſe of the
ſame in deede,<note place="margin">Iac. 1. d. 22.</note> that the world alſo may vnderſtand
the ſame and * glorifie God therein.<note place="margin">Math. 5. b. 16.</note> They are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable
to God, that pretend to feare and worſhip
him, and doe not in deede but by hipocriſie and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation.
Therfore doth he extoll here the Faith
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that ſhewed ſo notable proofe therof.</p>
               <q>And Abraham lifting vp his eyes looked,<note place="margin">Verſ. 13. 14.</note>
and beholde there was, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>God of his ſinguler prouidence, by ſuch meanes
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:9118:130"/>
as his wiſedome onely knoweth, prepared this
Ramme to be their vpon the ſodaine, to be offered
in the place of <hi>Iſaac.</hi> And <hi>Abraham</hi> to make a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
and perpetuall Memoriall not of his owne
Doing, but of gods Mercies: chaungeth the
name of the place, calling it, <hi>The Lorde will ſee,</hi> to
ſignifie, that God is readie, and at hande alwaye
to His, and ſeeth them in their diſtreſſe and neede.</p>
               <q>And the Angell of the Lorde cryed to
Abraham the ſeconde time.<note place="margin">Verſ. 15. &amp;c.</note> &amp;c.</q>
               <p>Thys is the fruite of <hi>Abrahams</hi> fayth and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
that by the Mouth of the Angell of God
he hath Confirmed vnto him the great Bleſſings
that God before had promiſed. But for ſomuch as
the reaſon why God doth here ſo bleſſe <hi>Abraham</hi>
is added in thys wiſe. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt done thys
thing, and haſt not ſpared thy only ſonne, &amp;c.</hi> There
may ſeeme two great Doubts to be moued. Firſt,
howe this may ſtande with the Free Promiſe of
the ſame bleſſing made to <hi>Araham cap.</hi> 12.<note place="margin">Gen. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. a. 2.</note> before he
ſhewed this obedience. Secondly, becauſe this
part of the bleſſing (<hi>In thy ſeede all the nations of
the earth ſhall be bleſſed</hi>) doth appertain to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
and Heauenly bleſſing in the Sauiour of
the world <hi>Chriſt Ieſu:</hi> It may ſeeme by the words
that the ſame bleſſing did depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpon this Fact of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> ſo that, if he had not this done, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
had not bene performed. For he ſayth, <hi>Becauſe
thou haſt done this thing, &amp;c. and becauſe thou haſt
heard my voyce.</hi> But thys maye ſeeme verie ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurde
<pb facs="tcp:9118:131"/>
and repugnant to the Scriptures that the
Sauing of the worlde by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſhould be graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
becauſe of the Obedience of <hi>Abraham</hi> and not
of the Free mercie of God.</p>
               <p>To theſe doubtes we muſt anſwere, that, with
out exception, theſe Promiſes were made and in
dewe tyme performed of the free mercie of God,
and loue towarde, not <hi>Abraham</hi> alone, but all
mankinde alſo: not regarding their Worthineſſe,
but his Owne goodneſſe. And when God ſayth,
<hi>Becauſe thou haſt done this thing, and becauſe thou
haſt heard my voyce,</hi> we muſt vnderſtande, that
God, for our imbecillitie and weake capacitie in
heauenly matters, ſpeaketh in this place, as he
doth in manye other, after the Maner of Men.
For a man oftentimes hath a fauourable inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to loue an other, and that of his owne motion,
without any conſideration of deſert in the perſon,
and vpon the ſame loue towarde him, doth freely
promiſe him ſome good benefite and pleaſure. But
when he ſeeth the good will of the partie towarde
him againe, he is greatly Delited therewith, and
the more he doth declare it by his readie ſeruice,
the more he is incenſed to performe his Liberall
Promiſe to him, and to aſſure him of the ſame.</p>
               <p>In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like maner doth God deale here with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
The principall Cauſes of theſe bleſſings,
and the Performance thereof are the Truth and
Free mercie God as it maye appeare in that they
were made to <hi>Abraham</hi> not onely * before he did
this,<note place="margin">Gen. 12. a. 3.</note> but before <hi>Iſaac</hi> was borne. The ſecond cauſe
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:9118:131"/>
that moueth God here to repeat them, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
<hi>Abraham</hi> in the aſſurance of them, was his
* Faith and obedience in this place declared.<note place="margin">Iere. 5. a. 3.</note>
               </p>
               <q>After theſe thinges one tolde Abraham,<note place="margin">Verſ. 20. &amp;c.</note>
beholde Milcha, ſhe hath, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>This may ſeeme ſtraunge to the worldly Man,
that <hi>Abraham</hi> forſaking his countrie at the calling
of Almightie GOD, and hauing the promiſe of
great increaſe of his ſeede: at the length when he
was an Hundred peares of age, hath but One
ſonne, and <hi>Nahor</hi> his brother, who taried behinde,
and had no promiſe of God, hath by that time a
Number of children. So the Bleſſings and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of God, in this life ſeeme not to take ſuch
force, but the vngodlye be more happie then they.
But the onely ſonne of <hi>Abraham,</hi> was not giuen
by the Common Courſe of Nature, as <hi>Nahors</hi>
were, but of the mightie Power of God, aboue
all Nature or reaſon: and, before the birth of the
Child, he had the Promiſes of gods bleſſings and
the aſſured couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God,<note place="margin">Gen. 17. a. 7</note> that he would be * His
God, and the God of his Seede, which was a far
greater Felicitie, then the Multitude of <hi>Nahors</hi>
children.</p>

               <q>And it came to paſſe, when Iſahac olde,
and his eyes were dimme, &amp;c.</q>

ſetteth forth in this Chapiter ſo
largely, may ſeeme at the firſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
no great matter of weight, but
onely the Sleight and Craft of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and her ſonne, cauſing the Father to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
the bleſſing of his Heritage vpon one, that
<pb facs="tcp:9118:134"/>
he would not haue done it vnto. But if with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence,
as our duetie is, we looke into the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of God, and lay aſide vaine and wicked co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations,
we ſhall ſee in this place the worke of the
wiſedome &amp; Prouidence of God vſing the Blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes
and frailties of the Godly, vnto his glorie, and
to the perfourmance of his determined purpoſe
and promiſe. For as the Patriarkes were God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men,<note place="margin">Eccle. 44. c. 16 17. 18. &amp;c.</note> and in the * ſinguler Fauour of GOD, ſo
had they, as men, their Imperfections and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
which God vndoubtedly miſliked, and yet, of
his mercie, pardoned, as in other Chapters before
is declared. The like is here nowe in this place,
as well in <hi>Iſaac</hi> as in <hi>Rebecca,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> her ſonne.
Therfore no perſon can by them take Example of
the like doyng, but rather learue a Godly leſſon to
be more ware of themſelues, and to take heed leaſt
to the Haſarding of the Fauour of God they doe
that, which ſhall be contrarie to his holy Will and
diſpleaſant vnto him.</p>
               <p>When the two children were borne, the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
purpoſe of God was declared,<note place="margin">Gen. 25. c. 23.</note> and his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
made manifeſt,<note place="margin">Oſee. 12. a. 3</note> * <hi>That the elder,</hi>

be Seruant vnto Iacob the yonger.</hi> This was reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vnto <hi>Rebecca,</hi> and not vnknowne to <hi>Iſaac</hi> the
father. And yet this notwithſtanding, of a Carnall
affection and loue towarde his elder Sonne, hee
ſought to Tranſfer the bleſſing of God &amp; heritage
of preheminence in the couenant of God vnto him:
Wherein he might ſeeme to ouerthwart the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God, which coulde not be done without ſome
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:9118:134"/>
offence, and therefore GOD did ſuffer him to be
Deluded by his Wife and Childe. And yet this
humaine affection in <hi>Iſaac</hi> was ioyned with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
fayth in the fauor of God, wherby he beleeued
that aſwel himſelf as other Patriarks were ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> good inſtruments of God, by their bleſſings
to denounce and declare the Heritage and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of the Couenant of God made to <hi>Abraham
and his Seede.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>And Rebecca ſpake vnto Iacob her ſonne
ſaying,<note place="margin">Verſ. 6. 7. &amp;c.</note> beholde, I haue heard, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> here declareth, by what Craft the bleſſing
was tranſferred to <hi>Iacob</hi> from <hi>Eſau.</hi> And truely
this dealing of <hi>Rebecca</hi> is not without blame. For
albeit ſhe could not rule her huſbande, and Cauſe
him to yeelde to the declared purpoſe of God, in
preferring <hi>Iacob</hi> the yonger brother: yet ſhoulde
ſhe not haue vſed ſo vncomely and vnlawfull
meanes to worke the thing by Counterfeyting
and Vntruth.</p>
               <p>If ſhe * knewe,<note place="margin">Gen. 25. c. 35.</note> as ſhe did in deede, that it was the
Immutable purpoſe &amp; electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, She ſhould
haue paciently looked, and haue abidden vntill
God had wrought it by ſuch waies as he thought
good, if ſhe could not by any godly perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue
brought it to paſſe. But ſuch Frailetie God often
in his Saintes of his great mercie pardoneth,
when it is not done of Malicious minde and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
as ſurely it was not in <hi>Rebecca,</hi> but of a deſire
by ſome meanes or other to bring that to effect,
<pb facs="tcp:9118:135"/>
which ſhe knewe was the will of God.</p>

and, as in his words, he ſhewed, that he
feared his father, and was lothe to enter his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure:
ſo he ſhoulde haue feared GOD much
more, and Conſidered, what a blemiſhe it was to
purchaſe his bleſſing by Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfayting &amp; vntruth.
For although he reſpected a right ende, that is, to
attaine that,<note place="margin">Gen. 25. c. 23.</note> which was the * promiſe of God: yet
by Such meanes he ſhould not haue done it.</p>
               <q>Then ſaide Iſaac vnto Iacob come neere,<note place="margin">Verſ. 21. 22.</note>

                  <hi>Iſaac</hi> did ſuſpect, that he was abuſed, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Tryeth the matter by all meanes he can. But
it pleaſed God to dull hys ſenſes, partly to ſhewe,
that Man laboureth in * vaine to ouerthwart hys
Purpoſe,<note place="margin">Gen. 45. c. 8.</note> &amp; that which he is determined to haue:<note place="margin">Gen. 48. d. 18.</note>
partly,<note place="margin">Prou. 21. d. 30.</note> that, by this maner of correction, he might
puniſhe and Chaſtice his Immoderate affection

               <q>God giue thee of the dewe of heauen,<note place="margin">Verſ. 28. 29.</note> &amp;

                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12. d. 17.</note> for the loſſe of his fathers bleſſing:
but it is euident, that this lamentation did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
of a Sound fayth and true Repentance, but
rather of a prowde minde and of a Deſperate fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

that he proteſted, and by the bitter wordes &amp; gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
Threatnings that after he vſed againſt hys
brother, Manacing that after his fathers death
he would aſſuredlye kill him. And of what affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he was, and howe ſmally he eſteemed his birth
right and the felicitie that might come thereof, he
declared, when he Solde the ſame to <hi>Iacob</hi> his

               <p>The bleſſing that <hi>Iſaac</hi> had giuen to his yonger
ſonne might ſeeme of Small force, ſeing he was
brought euen nowe preſently into ſo great Feare
<pb facs="tcp:9118:136"/>
to be Slaine by hys brother: and this was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
no ſmall temptation and trouble to the
minde of <hi>Rebecca,</hi> that ſhe ſawe her ſonne, whome
ſhe ſo tenderly loued, by her Fact to be brought in
daunger of Preſent death. But yet did ſhe and
her ſon ſo much eſteeme this Bleſſing, that rather
then they woulde yeelde it vp to <hi>Eſau</hi> to haue his
fauour, he was Contented to go into volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
Baniſhment and ſhe to forgo the Preſence and
Companie of her ſonne, that ſhe ſo much eſteemed.
By this example in <hi>Iacob</hi> we muſt learne to take

out vnto Iacob to commune with him.</p>

wroth, bicauſe he had wrought folly in Iſrael, in that he had
lyen with Iacobs daughter, which thing ought not to be
done. 8 And Hemor communed with them, ſaying, The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

He was nowe at ſome quietneſſe in the companie

            <q>
               <p>IOſeph was brought vnto Egypt, and Putiphar a
Lorde of Pharaos, and his chiefe ſtewarde, an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian,
bought him of the Iſmaelites which had
brought him thither. 2 And God was with Ioſeph,
and he became a luckie man, continuing in the houſe of his
mayſter the Egyptian. 3 And his mayſter ſaw that God
was with him, and that God made all that he did to proſper
in his hande. 4 And Ioſeph found grace in his mayſters
ſight, and ſerued him: And he made him ouerſeer of his houſe,
and put all that he had in his hande. 5 And it came to paſſe
from the time that he had made him ouerſéer of his houſe,
and ouer all that he had, the Lorde bleſſed the Egyptians
houſe for Ioſephs ſake: and the bleſſing of the Lorde was v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
all that he had in the houſe, and in the fielde.</p>
               <p>6 And therefore he left all that he had in Ioſephs hande:
and he knewe nothing with him, ſaue onely the breade which
he did eate. And Ioſeph was a goodly perſon, and a well fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured.
7 And after this, his maiſters wife caſt her cyes
vpon Ioſeph, and ſayde, (<hi>come</hi>) lie with me.</p>
               <p>8 But he refuſed, and ſayde vnto his maiſters wife, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde,
my maiſter woteth not what he hath in the houſe with
me, and hath committed all that he hath to my hande.</p>
               <p>9 There is no man greater in the houſe then I, neyther
hath he kept any thing from me but onely thée, becauſe thou
art his wife: howe then can I doe this great wickedneſſe,
and ſinne agaynſt God? And after this maner ſpake ſhée to
Ioſeph day by day: but he hearkened net vnto her to ſléepe

Ioſeph entered into the houſe to doe his buſineſſe, and there
was none of the houſholde by, in the houſe.</p>
               <p>12 Then ſhe caught him by the garment, ſaying, lie with
me. And he left his garment in hir hande, and fled, and got
him out. 13 And when ſhe ſawe that he had left his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p>14 She called vnto the men of hir houſe, and tolde them,
ſaying, Sée, he hath brought in an Hebrue vnto vs to doe vs
ſhame: for he came in to me to haue lyen with me, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to crie with a lowde voyce. 15 And when he hearde
that I lift vp my voyce and cryed, he left his garment with
me, and fledde away and got hym out.</p>
               <p>16 And ſhe layde vp his garment by hir, vntill hir Lorde
came home. 17 And ſhe tolde him with theſe wordes, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
This Hebrue ſeruant which thou haſt brought vnto vs,
came vnto me to doe me ſhame. 17 But aſſoone as I lift vp <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

which ſhe tolde him, ſaying, after this maner did thy ſeruant
to me,<note place="margin">Pſal. 103. b. 18</note> he waxed wroth. 20 And Ioſephs maiſter tooke him,

               <p>21 But the Lorde was with Ioſeph, and ſhewed him mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,

               <p>22 And the kéeper of the priſon committed to Ioſephes
hande all the priſoners that were in the priſon houſe: and
whatſoeuer was done there, that did he.</p>

his people from thoſe Miſeries, that he caſteth v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

The ſecond Miracle was that by the ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

winde, as ſtaied the waters of the Sea, that the
children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> might paſſe through vpon the dry

as men blinded with the furie of their
owne wickedneſſe, did follow the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to the
Sea, the Angell of God ſo abaſhed them, that
they were readie to flie from the face of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and
then, <hi>Moſes</hi> at the appointment of God ſtretching
out his rodde, the waters returned vpon them in
ſuch ſort that the <hi>Egiptians</hi> with all their power
were drowned in the ſea. By theſe Miracles the
name of God was glorified throughout the whole
worlde, and he knowne to be both a mightie and
mercifull God in the defence of his people, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
a ſeuere Lord in puniſhing ſuch as did reſiſt his

doe gather, ſhoulde haue dwelt in <hi>Meſopotamia.</hi>
For that country is a great number of miles from

Neyther is it to be thought that this <hi>Balaam</hi>
was an ordinarie Prophete of God, and indued
with the ſpirite of continuall prophecie and charge
of doctrine, as the other Prophetes were: For,
2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2. c. 15.</note> he and his fellowes are condemned. I
thinke rather he was a Southſayer or Sorcerer,
which vſed the helpe of euill ſpirites, and by them
did ſome ſtraunge things, that brought him in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
with the Heathniſhe people of thoſe
partes. And yet, when the cauſe of Gods people
came in hande, it pleaſed God by his holy ſpirite,
for the time, to Bridle his wicked affection, to ſtop
his couetous mouth; and to vſe his tongue euen
againſt his will, as an inſtrument to bleſſe his
people, and by prophecie to ſhewe to his enimies
the cauſe why he did ſo ſingulerly preſerue them,
that is, becauſe the true <hi>Meſsias</hi> ſhould deſcende of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:9118:182"/>
them. And this interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can not ſeeme ſtrange
and repugnant to the ſcriptures, that God for the
time putteth his ſpirite of Propheſie euen into the
wicked, to their further condemnation. For, we

he Lyked eyther the minde of <hi>Balaam,</hi> or the

it were, by their ſuperſtitious Importunitie, to
winne his fauour from his people, and to make
him to yeelde to their lewde and naughtie affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Therefore God maketh the falſe Prophet to

yet all this would not ſatiſfie them, ſuch is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

dede to * obſerue and performe the ſame, bicauſe
the lawe of God is a doctrine of practiſe and not
of hearing onely. The condition of their reward
is added, that ſo they might liue and poſſeſſe the

were * conditionall,<note place="margin">Deu. 11. d. 22 27.</note> and depended vpon their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience

If they dyd onely worſhippe God in the <hi>Calfe,</hi>

that he would by mighty hand deliuer them, to

alſo that he thought, it woulde make greatly to

In ſuche matters where Gods glorie is

It is not to be thoughte that this his faſting

it coulde not be againe confirmed, and the

<hi>Moyſes</hi> taried there fortie days and fortie nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,

a matter of ſo greate momente, and therefore
when God preſſeth ſo earneſtly the prohibition,

they might eſteme the Liues of all things, and

               <p>This maketh the former Precept more plain,

a great occaſion eaſily to leade them to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
and worſhipping of ſtrange gods, <hi>Moyſes</hi>
heere ſtraightly forbiddeth them not ſo muche
as to Enquire of the maner of their falſe Gods.
For this is lightly the beginning of all Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,<note place="margin">Sap. 14. b. 12.</note>
when men, vnderſtanding the ſimplicitie of
Gods true worſhip, curiouſly Enquire of mens

to their Lorde God,</hi> for hee did not onely miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like

               <p>Therefore to knit vp this inſtruction, God
commaundeth them that they ſhoulde cleaue
faſte vnto his worde, and not in any poynte to
alter it, eyther <hi>By adding any thing thereto, or by

and by vs noted vnder the name of <hi>Eaſter.</hi>
               </p>

was the <hi>Feaſt</hi> of <hi>Tabernacles.</hi> As touchyng the
<hi>Paſſouer,</hi> there is more large declaration of it
vpon <hi>Exodus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exo. 12. a. 1. &amp;c.</note> 12. redde on <hi>Eaſter</hi> day. It was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemniſed
the firſt moneth, that is, the moneth of

                  <note place="margin">Exo. 12. c. 16. Exo. 13. b. 6.</note> The principall cauſe of the
Inſtitution* of the <hi>Paſſouer</hi> was to put them in

benefite in paſſing away his plague from them,
and not ſtriking them when hys <hi>Angell</hi>* killed

by his mighty plagues ſo Brake his harte, that
he did not onely deliuer them, but forced them to

ſome trouble to them, and thereof doth this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leauened
bread put them in remembrance, and
for that cauſe is called here <hi>The bread of tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
As for all other ceremonies appertainyng
to this <hi>Feaſt,</hi> they are expounded in the chapiter

<pb facs="tcp:9118:229"/>
to the nexte daye after the ſeuen weekes ended

for the <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> called here the <hi>Feaſt of vveekes</hi>
and in <hi>Exodus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exo. 23. c. 15</note> 23: <hi>The Feaſt of Harueſt,</hi> and wyth
vs as I haue ſayd, is named <hi>VVhitſontide.</hi> The
firſte cauſe of the ordynance of thys <hi>Feaſte</hi> was
that they mighte remember the <hi>Libertie</hi> that
God had geuen them, and ſhewe themſelues
thankefull for the ſame. For fiftie dayes after
their comming out of <hi>Egipte,</hi> God gaue them the
Lawe in Mount <hi>Sinay,</hi> and firſt ordained them
a free State and Policie by peculiar Lawes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelues, whereas before, they were in
bondage and lyued in miſerable oppreſſion vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Lawes and * tyrannie of the <hi>Egiptians.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exo. 1. b. 10.</note>
An other cauſe of the Inſtitution hereof was,
that they myghte offer a newe Oblation vnto
God, that is two Loaues of new Corne baked,
as the firſt Fruites, in way of thankeſgeuing to
the Lorde: So that they did not offer onelye the
Meaſure of <hi>Newe corne</hi> before Harueſt, but Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
alſo towarde the ende of Harueſte. And
thereby are taughte, as We alſo ſhoulde be, that
the Fruites of Harueſte come not eyther of the
Fertilitie of the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, or of their owne Labour
and trauayle, but of the ſinguler Fauour and
Bleſſing of God, and therefore that they ſhould
vſe the ſame not to Ryote and Drunke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neſſe, but
wyth reuerence and * thankeſgeuyng.<note place="margin">1. tim. 4. a. 4.</note> The third
cauſe of the Inſtitution was, that it might be a
figure both of the true Libertie of conſcience, and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:9118:229"/>
of the ſpirituall Harueſt that was to come, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the true <hi>Moyſes</hi> and Deliuerer <hi>Chriſt Ieſu.</hi>
For euen as fiftye dayes after the deliuerie of
the Chyldren of <hi>Iſraell</hi> oute of <hi>Egipte</hi> they had
the Lawe geuen them in Mounte <hi>Sinay:</hi> So
the fiftieth daye after oure deliuerance from the
Tyrannie of Sinne and Sathan by the Deathe
and Reſurrection of <hi>Chriſte,</hi> (whiche was the
true* <hi>Paſſouer</hi>),<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5. c. 7.</note> The holye Ghoſte was ſente

but alſo by the Apoſtles and other good
Miniſters &amp; labourers, might* gather together
the Spirituall Harueſt of God throughoute the
whole worlde, and that all Faithfull might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
the firſte Fruites of the benefytes of hys
Deathe and Reſurrection. We do not therfore
Obſerue this day ſuperſticiouſly, bicauſe the like
was ordeined among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> But for that it
is an ordinarie time appoynted for the people of
God to aſſemble &amp; heare the declaration of thoſe
maruellous workes of God, which as at thys
tyme were done after the Aſcention of <hi>Chriſte</hi>
into Heauen. For then dyd <hi>Chriſte</hi> declare and
confirme the Maieſtie and trueth of hys Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
wyth wonderfull <hi>Miracles,</hi> So that it
was euidente that he onelye was the trewe
<hi>Meſsias</hi> and <hi>Sauioure</hi> that the ſame Holy Ghoſt
had ſpoken of manye yeares before vnto the

And bycauſe at the tyme of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> when the
Holye Ghoſt was giuen, the Goſpell firſte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be publiſhed, we may not thinke that one
or two Feſtiuall dayes is appointed for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmance
thereof: but from that firſt <hi>Pentecoſt</hi>
vntill the worldes ende, ſhould be to vs one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
<hi>VVhitſonday,</hi> in which we ſhould wyth
thankeſgiuing reioyce for our ſpiritual fredome,
and take in the fruites of <hi>Chriſts</hi> bleſſed Paſſion

               <q>Thou ſhalte obſerue alſo the feaſt of the

               <p>This <hi>Feaſt</hi> of the <hi>Tabernacles</hi> or Tentes was
Solemniſed the .15. of September, when they
had not gathered in all their fruites, graine, and

partly to put them in mind of their former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
Whence they came, and that it was God
that firſte made them to dwell in Tentes in the
wilderneſſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he brought them out of <hi>Egipt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondlye, that they mighte remember the
wonderfull miracles and benefites that God
did in maintayning and Preſeruing them vntill
they came into the lande of <hi>Chanaan,</hi> where
they founde in ſteede of Tentes and <hi>Tabernacles,</hi>

               <p>16 And the men riſing vp from thence, loked toward So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
and Abraham went with them to bring them on the

               <p>20 And the Lorde ſayde, Becauſe the crye of Sodome

21 I will goe downe now, and ſée whether they haue done
altogether according to that crye which is come vnto me: and
if not, I will knowe. 22 And the men departed thence, and
went to Sodomewarde: but Abraham ſtoode yet before the

righteous within the citie, I will ſpare all the place for their
ſakes. 27 And Abraham aunſwering, ſayd, Behold I haue
taken vpon me to ſpeake vnto the Lord, which am but duſt
and aſſhes: 28 If there ſhall lacke fiue of fiftie righteous,
wilt thou deſtroy all the citie for (<hi>lacke</hi>) of fiue? And he ſaide,
If I finde there fortie and fiue I will not deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>29 And he procéeded to ſpeake vnto him againe, and ſaide,
What if there ſhalbe fortie founde there? He aunſwered, I

               <p>30 He ſaid vnto him againe, Oh let not my Lord be angry

theſe angels vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> was to confirme to

Why it pleaſed God to ſende three An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
&amp; not two, or one, we muſt not with vayne

               <p>In <hi>Abraham</hi> we haue an example of a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
&amp; willing deſire to entertain Strangers, and
to relieue them, which is not vnfruteful for vs

not of Idlenes, but of purpoſe to eſpie if any tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uailers

and called the one of them by the name of

               <p>This Reuerende <hi>Patriarke</hi> and father of the

               <p>Forſomuch as it was the pleaſure of god, that

all that he had ſpoken, not onely of the beſt,
but with ſpeed. For as he knew it to be curteſie
to entertayne ſtraungers: ſo hee thoughte it
<pb facs="tcp:9118:234"/>
no good manner to cauſe them to tarie longer,
than happily the neceſſitie of theyr buſyneſſe
woulde ſuffer them. As wel by the place before
mentioned, as by the reſidue of this Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we may learne, that the worlde was not
yet growen to ſuch a nicitie, tenderneſſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacie
in feeding, &amp; other furniture, as by Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualitie
men ſince that are come vnto, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in theſe latter dayes.</p>
               <p>Here ſome moue queſtion how the Angels
did eate, or whether they did eat or no? Seing
that they be celeſtial Spirits, and haue no Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
that neede ſuſtenance and feeding: ſurely
Godly Chriſtians muſt not in ſuch queſtions be
curious. As gods pleaſure was, that they ſhuld
be taken as men for the time: So of his diuine
power, whiche dayly worketh ſtrange things,
he had prouided bodies for them to walke in,
and with the ſame bodyes did they eat, althogh
their Spiritual ſubſtance needed no ſuſtenance.
And when their appointed offices were done,
the meate and drinke vaniſhed away togyther
with the Bodies.</p>
               <q>And they ſayde vnto him, where is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah

               <p>In the former Chapiter we reade, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
had receyued a manifeſt declaration of the

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:9118:234"/>
                  <hi>Sarah</hi> did not, as may appeare by this place. And
therefore the Angell of God aſketh for <hi>Sarah,</hi>
thereby to haue an occaſion to renewe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
that promiſe, and alſo to reproue <hi>Sarahs</hi> in
credulitie, who meaſured the promiſes of God
by the *likelyhoodes of natur all power.<note place="margin">Luk. 1. d. 34.</note> When
the Angell ſaid, that at his returne, <hi>Sarah</hi> ſhuld
haue a <hi>Chylde,</hi> it may be thought, that <hi>Sarah</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened
behinde the Tente doore, what talke the
Strangers had with hir huſbande. Wherein
ſhe by example declareth, how hard a matter it
is, to haue eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the honeſteſt and moſt chaſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones
to leaue al maner of womanly Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
Although as a modeſt and ſober wife ſhe
ſtayed within the Tent, and came not foorth to
ſhew hir ſelfe vnto the ſtrangers: yet could ſhe
not ouercome this tentation of curious deſire to
knowe what was ſpoken. When <hi>Sarah</hi> he arde
the Angel ſay ſhe ſhold haue a childe, ſhe laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at it as a vaine and vnlikely thing, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
vndoubtedly did greatly offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. For ſhe might
well knowe that promiſe came from God, being
ſo well agreeing with that which was ſpoken
to hir huſband not long before. And therefore by
vnlikelyhode of nature, to deride it as falſe, was
in hir much raſhnes. But that which followeth
was of womanly Baſhfulneſſe, when ſhe bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
charged, for hir laughing beeing ſome what
aſtonied doth denie it. <hi>Sarah</hi> laughed, not aloude
as the maner of diſſolute women is, but ſoftly
<hi>within hir ſelfe.</hi> When it is ſaide, <hi>It ceaſed to bee
<pb facs="tcp:9118:235"/>
vvith Sarah, after the Maner as it is</hi> with <hi>VVomen:</hi>
The meaning is, ſhe had not thoſe ſuperfluities
that all women naturally haue, ſo long as they
by age may haue children. As hir Chaſtitie is to
be reuerenced, ſo was it a great blame and fault
in hir not only to * Miſtruſt the promiſe of god,<note place="margin">Baru. 1. d. 18.</note>
but alſo to Laugh it to ſcorne, bycauſe it ſeemed
vnlikely to naturall Reaſon.</p>
               <q>And the men riſing vp from thence loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
toward Sodome.<note place="margin">Verſe. 16. 17. 18. 19.</note> &amp;c.</q>
               <p>Abraham perfourmeth that, whiche is the
third parte of Hoſpitalitie, that is, Courteſie in
diſmiſſing his geſts. He taketh not his leaue of
them at his Tent, but perceiuing their iourney
toward <hi>Sodom,</hi> went part of the way with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
which his paines God well requited, opening to
him by his Angell the purpoſe to deſtroy <hi>Sodom</hi>
for the horrible ſinne and wickedneſſe thereof.
<hi>Shall I</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>Hide from Abraham that
thing whiche I doe: ſeeyng that Abraham shall
ſurely be. &amp;c.</hi> It may be that one of the Angells
to whome <hi>Abraham</hi> in all this ſtorie had direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his ſpeech, vttered theſe words in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of <hi>Abraham</hi> Wherin he noteth two cauſes
why he wold reueale this thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vnto him. The
one is the great preheminence of that promiſe,
that he had made to him before time of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
and multiplying of his ſeede. <hi>Seing</hi> ſaith
he, <hi>that Abraham shall ſurely be a mighty Nation.</hi>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:9118:235"/>
The other is, For that he knewe him to be ſo
godly a man as woulde not only himſelfe liue
in Iuſtice and iudgemente, but alſo woulde. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
his children, and Houſhold <hi>To keepe the

               </p>
               <p>By thys, Godly Parentes maye learne,
that it is theyr Office and duetie to ſee theyr
families * inſtructed and taughte,<note place="margin">Eph. 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But Fathers now a dayes are farre from

regard as thoughe it did Nothyng appertayne

               <q>And the Lord ſaide,<note place="margin">Verſ. 20. 21.</note> becauſe the crie of
Sodome and Gomorha is greate. &amp;c.</q>
               <p>There is a double Crie that ſoundeth in the
eares of the Lorde. The one is the crie of Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe
and Sinne, and that is it the Angell
here ſpeaketh of: The wickedneſſe of <hi>Sodome</hi>
Cried vnto God, that is, was ſo great that it
required<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wrath and vengeance from God.</p>
               <p>Sometyme the Bloud of the oppreſſed and

manner Crye vnto hym. For ſo dydde the
<pb facs="tcp:9118:236"/>
bloud of <hi>Abel</hi> crie vnto the Lorde.</p>
               <p>When the Scripture ſayth, that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
Down to ſee or know any thing, we may
not thinke that there is eyther Mouing of place
or want of Knowledge in God. But then God
is ſayde to come Downe, when he doth applye
himſelfe to worke ſomewhat to oure behoofe,
And then he is ſayd to come to Knowe or See,
when hee ſo Worketh, that eyther Men or his
Angels may know. God right well knew that
the Sinne of <hi>Sodome</hi> after his long Pacience &amp;
Suffring, was come to full ripeneſſe: but hee
ſent downe his Angels, that not only <hi>Abraham</hi>
and <hi>Loth,</hi> but the Whole world alſo by their
puniſhment, ſhould vnderſtande how greeuous
and deteſtable their ſynne was in the ſighte of
God.</p>
               <q>And Abraham drewe neere and ſayde,<note place="margin">Verſ. 23. 24. 25. &amp;c.</note>
wilt thou alſo deſtroy the righteous. &amp;c.</q>
               <p>The Saintes of God are alway Louers of
mankynde and are greeued to vnderſtande of
the Plague and Puniſhmente euen of the
wicked, whome wyth all their heartes they
would wiſhe rather to Liue and Repente, than
to dye in their ſinnes. Therfore <hi>Abraham</hi> here
vnderſtanding by the Angell, that the Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Sodome,</hi> and thoſe other Cities was at
hande, ſheweth himſelf very careful for them,
and as it were by the remembrance of thoſe
good and iuſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that might be in it, doth moue
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:9118:236"/>
God to haue pitie on them, and to ſpare their
plague. Good men doe not quickely diſpaire of
any, ſeeme they neuer ſo euill. And therfore <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
thought, in ſo great a Multitude, that
there muſt needes haue ben ſome mean number
of good men, for whoſe cauſe God wold extend

iuſt men in <hi>Sodome,</hi> they muſt haue ben perſons
vncircumciſed, and no partakers of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of God. And yet this Reuerend <hi>Patriarke</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelfe a iuſt man, circumciſed, of the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
couenant with God, and the Father of the
Faithful, did not in reſpect of himſelf contemne
ſuche, but made that accompte of them, that,
if there had bene ſuche, he would haue God to
haue ſpared the wicked for their ſakes.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Abraham</hi> talking with God, we ſee a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſtrife between the Charitie and Loue that
was in him toward the <hi>Sodomires,</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of his own humbleneſſe and vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyneſſe
in the ſight of God. His Charitie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
him to intreate for them. But the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his owne vnworthineſſe, beeing but
duſte and aſhes, did on the other parte abaſhe
hym, and therefore doth ſo often deſire pardon
of his ſpeeche.</p>
               <q>What if tenne ſhall bee founde there?<note place="margin">Verſe. 32.</note>

not to a ſmaller number of ſixe or foure, but
<pb facs="tcp:9118:237"/>
ſtayed at ten. But it may be, that he was ſtayed

               <p>Or elſe vnderſtanding by the Angel, that there
were not tenne, he did not iudge them Worthie
to be preſerued by Gods mercie, and therefore
ſo ſtayed himſelfe. But whatſoeuer the cauſe
hereof was, This is of Gods exceeding great
Mercies, and a ſingular Comforte to the Iuſt
and godly, that the Angel of God, in puniſhing
the wicked, ſhall not only Fynde them out, and
Preſerue them,<note place="margin">Gen. 19. 6. 16.</note> as appeareth by * <hi>Loth,</hi> but alſo

that in dede it ſhoulde be fulfilled. The Kings

For it was he that <hi>Iehu</hi> tooke by the * hand into

to deſtroye <hi>Achab</hi> his houſe,<note place="margin">4. re. 10. d. 15.</note> for the Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
that he wrought againſt the Lorde.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Ionadab</hi> for certaine conſiderations, which
after ſhalbe noted, gaue in charge to his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
that they and their Poſteritie for euer ſhuld for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
the Drinking of Wine, the Tilling of the
Earth, the keeping of Vines, &amp; dwelling in any
Builded houſes, but only to vſe for their abiding
Tentes and Bouthes. This order and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement,
as I haue ſaide, the Poſteritie of
the <hi>Rechabites</hi> kept very diligently from the time
of <hi>Ionadab</hi> their father or Aunceſtour, vnto this
time of <hi>Hieremie,</hi> which was .300 yeares.</p>
               <p>The occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that God toke at this time, was,
that theſe <hi>Rechabites,</hi> whiche hitherto had not
dwelt in anye Townes &amp; Cities, but in Tentes
and Bouthes in the fieldes, throughe the great
<pb facs="tcp:9118:284"/>
Spoile and waſte that <hi>Nabuchodonoſor</hi> and the
<hi>Chaldees</hi> did make in all the Countrey of <hi>Iurie,</hi>
were forced, for their ſalftie, to come and dwell
in <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> in ſuche places, as they mighte
get. And yet did they obſerue all the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of <hi>Ionadabs</hi> commaundement, although by
meere neceſſitie they were driuen, at this ſeaſon
to dwell in houſes.</p>
               <p>Wherfore, <hi>Ieremie,</hi> by the commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of
God, in ſuch ſort, as is declared in this chapiter,
calleth the <hi>Rechabites</hi> together,<note place="margin">Verſe. 4. 5.</note> being manie in
number, vnto a place by the Temple whiche
was notorious, and where things done coulde
not be kept cloſe, but muſte needes be ſpredde by
fame both through the whole Citie and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
For it is not to be thoughte that <hi>Hieremie</hi>
did it ſecretely or in cloſe maner. For ſuch a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
coulde not be called to ſuch a place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
admiration and greate expectacion of ſome
notable thing to followe. <hi>Hieremie</hi> therefore in
the place here diſcribed, in ſolemne manner ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
pottes of Wine before them, and willeth
them to Drinke.<note place="margin">Verſe. 6. 7.</note> But they refuſe ſo to doe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging
for their excuſe their Obedience to the
order and commaundemente of their Aunceſtor
and forefather <hi>Ionadab,</hi> who had giuen them
charge to obſerue thoſe things, which are eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente
in the Texte.</p>
               <p>Here maye ſeeme to be ſome doubtes Iuſtlie
moued. Firſt, whether the <hi>Rechabites</hi> did offend
or no in refuſing to Drinke Wine, at the bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:9118:284"/>
of the Prophete of God. Therein they
mighte ſeeme to ſet more by a tradition of their
fathers, than by the appointment of God vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the Prophete. But wee reade not, that
the Prophete <hi>Hieremie</hi> did ſay vnto them, that
it was Gods will and commaundemente, that
they ſhoulde Drinke Wine: but it ſemed to them
a bidding of the Prophete ſimply, &amp; vttered to
them withoute the Authoritie of Gods name.</p>
               <p>And yet in their refuſing thereof, they vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
did excuſe themſelues with greate mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie:
ſo that if the Prophete had preſſed Gods
commaundement vpon them, it may be thought
they woulde haue yelded, as they did to dwell
in houſes in <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> when they coulde not
ſalfely haue place abroade to vſe their Tentes.</p>
               <p>Secondly if maye be doubted whether <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab</hi>
did well in bidding them to forbeare Wine,
or not to vſe Tillage, not to plante Vines, or to
dwell in houſes. For therein ſemeth to be ſome
great Superſtition to forbid the people of God
to vſe his Creatures, and thoſe trades of Life
that haue their Iuſte comendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and were vſed by good and Godlie men.
And therfore this place is alleadged of ſome for
the maintenance of Monaſtical vowes and ſuch
like Obſeruations of mens Traditions euen
with burden of Conſcience and reſtrainte of
Chriſtian Libertie.</p>
               <p>Surelie, it is not to be thought, that <hi>Ionadab</hi> did
<pb facs="tcp:9118:285"/>
meane to Inſtitute any new worſhip of God, or
to laye any burden of Holineſſe or <hi>Religion</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Conſciences in the forbidding of theſe
things, but only the obſeruation of a Politique
meanes, whereby they mighte be traded to a
more Moderate life, &amp; eaſier Contempte of the
worlde. For it is to be thoughte that <hi>Ionadab</hi>
(who ioyned himſelfe to <hi>Iehu</hi> in the puniſhment
of the wicked houſe of <hi>Achab</hi>) had great feare of
God, and a deſire to haue his Law &amp; true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe
reſtored and maintained. And bicauſe he
ſawe that Senſualitie, Looſneſſe of life, &amp; glory
of the world, were the chiefeſt Cauſes, that did
carie the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from the Obedience of God,
fearing ſome great Plague and puniſhment to
followe for the ſame,<note place="margin">Deu. 8. d. 20. Deu. 11. d. 28. Jere. 42. d. 22</note> according to the * Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of the lawe, ſo muche as mighte be, to
preuent the ſame Inconuenience, in his flocke or
kindred, He enioyned them to forbeare Wine,
whereof ryſeth Drunkenneſſe and Wanton luſt,
and not to vſe any other trade of life, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Paſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
or keping of Cattaile, wherein they were
alwayes brought vp, from their firſt fathers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ionadab</hi> thought that kind of life to be beſt, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vnto
himſelfe had beene accuſtomed. He ſawe
what Inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniences Immoderate vſe of Wine
did bring, all which they ſhun that Forbeare it.
And they haue their mindes Freer that are not
Tied to Tillage &amp; huſbanding of Vineyardes.</p>
               <p>And if God did bring any Plague vpon their
Countrey for the Sinnes of the People, their
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:9118:285"/>
loſſe ſhoulde be the leſſe, and they mighte more
eaſily ſhift for themſelues. But, howſoeuer it
was in <hi>Ionadab,</hi> wee reade not here, that God
doth praiſe that ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but only ſemeth to like
the Obedience of the <hi>Rechabites,</hi> and taketh the
ſame for an Example to reproue the <hi>Ievves</hi> for
their Diſobedience and contempt of his holie
Lawes and ordinances: being not their Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
father but the euerliuing Lorde and God.</p>
               <q>Then came the worde of the Lorde to
Hieremie ſaying.<note place="margin">Verſe. 12. &amp;c.</note> &amp;c.</q>
               <p>In theſe verſes foloweth the applying of this
example and compariſon of the <hi>Rechabites.</hi> In
which application, theſe things are to be noted,
Firſt the compariſon betwene a mortal man and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
God. If the Authoritie of <hi>Ionadab,</hi> a mortal and
fraile Creature preuailed ſo much with his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie,
whom he did neuer greatly benefite: how
much more Iuſtlie ſhoulde the Maieſtie and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
Power of God in giuing of his Lawe,
haue bene eſteemed among his owne people, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whom he had beſtowed ſo many and ſo great
bleſſings? Secondly, <hi>Ionadab</hi> gaue his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
but Once, and neuer called vpon it
afterwarde, and yet was it obſerued very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſlye
for the ſpace of .300 yeares: But Gods
Law, as it was once giuen with greate Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie
&amp; terrour, ſo was it Continually called vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by his Prophetes and teachers, euen by the
<pb facs="tcp:9118:286"/>
diligent and carefull ſending of God himſelfe.
And that in ſo earneſt maner as poſſibly could be
deuiſed, and yet woulde they neuer either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in his obedience, or eaſilie returne vnto his
true worſhip, when they were once fallen from
it.<note place="margin">3</note> Thirdly, thoſe things which God required
of the <hi>Ievves,</hi> were not of like Seueritie and
rigour, as the commaundementes of <hi>Ionadab</hi> to
his poſteritie. For he lefte vnto them the vſe of
Tillage, Inhabitinge of houſes, Drinkinge of
Wine, Planting of vines, and all ſuch other like
things that mighte be to their comforte in the
worlde, and onely required that they would not
run after the worſhipping of other Gods. And
yet would they not therin obey him, nor yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
themſelues, when they were reproued,
wheras the <hi>Rechabites</hi> did not onely kepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
in more Obedience of the Lawe of God,
than they did, but alſo tied themſelues to the
ſtreicte and rigorous obſeruation of the orders
before mentioned, onelie in reuerence of <hi>Ionadab</hi>
their Anceſter and Forefather, by whom they
were giuen.</p>
               <q>And therefore thus ſaith the Lorde of
hoſtes,<note place="margin">Verſe. 17.</note> the God of Iſrael, beholde. &amp;c.</q>
               <p>Nowe that God by the example of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabites</hi>
had confounded the diſobedience of his
People, and ſhewed, that they haue nothing
to laie for their excuſe, he addeth what puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:9118:286"/>
ſhall come vpon them for it.</p>
               <p>Forſomuch, ſaith he, as I haue often ſente my
Prophetes vnto you to cal you to repentance, &amp;
to bring you home againe into the righte way, &amp;
yet you will not in any wiſe heare them: I will
ſpeake no more vnto you in way of exhortation,
but I will pronounce terrible Sentence againſt
you, and moſt earneſtly aſſure you, that thoſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhmentes,
that I haue deuiſed, withoute faile
ſhall come vpon you.</p>
               <p>Here is to be noted, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men Obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
refuſe the comfortable worde of God ſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them in the waie of inſtruction and teaching,
they ſhall after heare and feele his Dreadfull
worde of Threatning iuſte puniſhment to come
vpon them for their Diſobedience and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt.</p>
               <q>Hieremie alſo ſpake vnto the houſholde
of the Rechabites,<note place="margin">Verſe. 18. 19.</note> thus ſaith. &amp;c.</q>
               <p>After that he hath pronounced puniſhment
againſt the <hi>Ievves,</hi> for their Contempt of Gods
holy will: he declareth alſo, that God of his
goodneſſe according to his Promiſe anexed to
the fifte commaundemente, woulde reward the
obedience and Reuerence that the <hi>Rechabites</hi> did
ſhew towarde their Father <hi>Ionadab,</hi> and that
he would ſo proſper their ſtocke, as <hi>They should
neuer faile of one to ſtande before him,</hi> that is,
whiche ſhoulde be acceptable vnto him. For
it cannot be interpreted that they ſhoulde ſtand
<pb facs="tcp:9118:287"/>
before God in the Miniſtration of the Temple,
for that was appointed to the Prieſtes and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites
onely. As touching that the Patrons of
ſuperſtition alleadge this place for the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of obedience to mens traditions in the
Churche, it is verie vnfit. For the <hi>Rechabites,</hi> as
is ſaide before, were not tied to this obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
with opinion of Holineſſe, or as a worſhipping
of God, as men were with the traditions of the

               <p>IN the fourth yéere of Ioakim the ſonne of Ioſias the king

               <p>3 That when the houſe of Iuda heareth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plague which

               <p>9 And this was done in the fifth yeare of Iehoakim the

Gamariah the ſonne of Saphan the ſcribe, which is beſide

Wée will certifie the king of all theſe wordes.</p>
               <p>17 And they examined Baruch, ſaying: Tel vs, how did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt

               <p>18 Then Baruch anſwered them: He ſpake al theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des

Dalaiah, and Gamariah beſought the king that he

               <p>The readie Willingneſſe of <hi>Baruch</hi> is here to

Cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ningly ſhifted the danger hereof from

greater Miſliking by this publiſhing of things

                  <hi>Baruch</hi> did reade theſe Prophecies of <hi>Hiere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi>

the Whole number of the People, as wel of the
Citie, as alſo of the Countrey, gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at that tyme: wherby his doing was the
more Notable, and further Knowne and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</p>
               <q>Nowe when Micheas the Sonne of

               <p>It is not here expreſſed of what mind or Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
this <hi>Micheas</hi> did make ſo greate Speede
to declare the doing of <hi>Baruch</hi> vnto the Nobles
and Counſellers. If he did it as beeing ſtricken
with Admiration and Terrour of thoſe things
that he did heare, as it may be thought he did,
(bycauſe hee was the ſonne of <hi>Gamariah,</hi> who
ſhewed himſelfe to haue the Feare of God, in
perſuading the King not to Burne the Booke,)
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:9118:291"/>
then his doyng was worthy greate commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But if he did it to purchaſe Blame vnto the
Prophete, or to get Fauour of the Counſailers,
it was that, which alway dothe folow the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes
&amp; Preachers of almightie God in doing
of his meſſage:<note place="margin">Eſai. 53. a. 1. Rom. 10. c. 16 Jo. 12. f. 38. Jo. 7. b. 12.</note> that is that * All doe not heare

are readie to depraue their doings and ſayings,
&amp; by malitious Accuſations to worke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

<hi>Micheas,</hi> it was not done withoute the aſſured

might knowe of it, and not pretende ignorance.
Where by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way this alſo is to be Noted, that

               <p>It may appeare that the Princes did not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect

               <q>Nowe when they had hearde all the

               <p>The Maieſtie of Gods wordes and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings

ſo that as men aſtonied, they loked one vpon the

True repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and right feare of Gods wrath.
For if that had bene in them, ſurely they would

of theſe Noble men ſeemed, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
therof to be Fainte &amp; colde. They queſtioned
with <hi>Baruch,</hi> how he was hable to write thoſe
things, and he anſwered ſimply, that <hi>Hieremie</hi>
ſpake them and he wrate them at his mouthe.
Wherby they might vnderſtand that it was not
done by the curious Deuiſe &amp; Induſtrie of man,
nor laid vp together in writing as matters Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
penned: But by the ſtrength of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spirite
of God, which brought thoſe things freſhe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
to <hi>Hieremie,</hi> that he in ſpeache had
vttered long before. With whiche conſideration,
&amp; the weighte of thoſe things that were redde,
they being Somewhat moued, ſaid they would
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:9118:292"/>
Enfourme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of all that was done, &amp; know
his pleaſure. But bicauſe they ſuſpected his
Furie &amp; crueltie, they willed <hi>Baruch</hi> &amp; <hi>Hieremie</hi>
to Hide themſelues out of the way, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
might know where they were.</p>
               <q>And they wente in to the King to the
Court,<note place="margin">Verſe. 20. &amp;c.</note> but they kept the booke. &amp;c.</q>
               <p>The Princes might ſeme to be touched with
ſome Feare of God, but yet not ſo greatlye, but
that they feared the Prince more, and eſpecially
the multitude of them. And therefore did they
put the matter ſo vnto him, that they would not
doe otherwiſe than ſtoode with his Pleaſure.
Some of them did more Freelye deale with the
King, as <hi>Elnathan, Dalaiah,</hi> and <hi>Gamariah,</hi> and in
his moſt vehement rage with ſome Danger of
their owne ſtate &amp; liues perſwaded &amp; intreated
him not to Burne the booke. But nothing could
ſtaie his Furie, but that before he had hearde it
redde through, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Contempt of God &amp; of his
worde and Threatnings, he out it in peeces and
caſt it in the fire. When God, in the wordes of
his Prophete, did ſo terribly Thunder in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eares
of the king, he ſhould haue bene Greatly moued
therwith,<note place="margin">3. Re. 21. g. 27 2. pa. 34. d. 19</note> and haue * Rent &amp; tore his garments
in token of the inward feare and Sorow of his

ouer both him and his kingdome. But after the

Rageth eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt God himſelf, &amp; thinketh by

If he thought it to be the doyng of poore <hi>Hiere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi>

therwith, ſeyng he knewe, that ſo contemptible
a perſon, as he iudged him to be, coulde not of
himſelfe worke hurte to him, or to his realme?
If his conſcience, trembling at the matter, dyd
tel him, that the Authoritie of God was in thoſe
wordes, why did he ſo furiouſlie ſtorme at the

liuing in baniſhmente, and is inſtructed what
maner of people they are, how they will receiue
him, and howe he ſhall behaue himſelfe toward

mentioned that <hi>Ezechiel</hi> ſeyng in a viſion an
Image of the glorie of God, not being hable to
abyde the Maieſtie thereof, fell downe vpon his

I hearde the voyce of his vvordes, and fell aſtonied

Many at theſe dayes doe harden themſelues by

By the <hi>Houſe of Iſraell</hi> he dothe not note the

tyme Miſſeled by the falſe Prophets, &amp; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of other. And now by the ſmart of their
Puniſhement being quickened, and as it were
wakened out of their errours, they looke more
diligently and carefully vnto the truth of God,
and retourne from their Corruptions into the

and beeing nowe Ioyned to the Couenaunte

               <p>The Iewes were greatly ſtayed from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce
by an hope and confidence that they
had in the Prayers of holie men, whiche they

The Earneſt prayers of ſo many Godly men

God by his Prophet in this ſecond parte
of the Chapiter taketh from them. For where
as he hath Foure plagues, whiche he is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to bryng vpon them, that is Famine,
Wylde beaſtes, the Sword, and the Peſtilence,
he doth aſſure them, that if <hi>Noe, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Iob,</hi>
or the Holieſt men that euer liued, were at this
tyme amongſt them, they ſhoulde not by theyr
Prayers in any one of theſe Plagues, obtaine
pardon for any, but for themſelues only, No not
for their owne ſonnes and daughters, or ſuche
as were nigheſt to them: muche leſſe ſhoulde
they be hable to preuaile by their Prayers now
when God in his Iuſt diſpleaſure ſhall caſt v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

thoſe Foure Plagues together. When men go
on forewarde in their wickedneſſe, it is but a peruerſe
and vayne perſuaſion to thinke they
ſhall eſcape the puniſhemente and Plagues of
God by the Faith and Prayers of other. They
muſte Repente themſelues, if they will looke
to haue God turne his wrathe from them.</p>
               <p>God ſpeaketh fyrſte ſeuerally of euery one of

That yf they coulde not obteyne for One,

               <p>By <hi>Samaria</hi> the Prophete meaneth the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
and the Kingdome of the tenne Tribes, which he
calleth the elder Siſter, becauſe their Dominion

they continued in the ſame, and added o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Heathniſh Idolatrie to it: we may read abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly,
in the firſt and ſeconde of the kinges, and in
the latter booke of the Chronicles, beſide many of
the Prophetes.<note place="margin">Verſ. 49.</note> The wickedneſſe of <hi>Sodome</hi> is

                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. and afterwarde here, are more
<pb facs="tcp:9118:315"/>
particularly ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>The Prophete verie bitterly vpbraydeth them,<note place="margin">Verſ. 47. 48.</note>
that they haue not followed the Corruptions of
<hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Samaria a little,</hi> but that in all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and Abhomination they had done Worſe,
and farre paſſed them, ſo that in compariſon of the
Iewes, the other might ſeeme almoſt Iuſte men.
For ſo meaneth he when he ſayth,<note place="margin">Verſ. 51.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou haſt iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
thy Siſters in all thy abhominations which thou
haſt done.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 52.</note> Therefore God ſayth by the Prophet,
that they ſhall beare the Shame and rebuke of
their naughtie doynges, and he will Grieuouſly
plague them with Deſolation as before to theyr
Example,<note place="margin">Verſ. 53. &amp;c.</note> he had done the other. And he will Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
their Captiuitie, when he reſtoreth the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie
of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> that is, Neuer.</p>
               <p>The ſinnes of <hi>Sodome</hi> mentioned Verſe. 49. are
theſe,<note place="margin">1</note> Firſt Pride and arrogancie, with which
whoſe mindes are once poſſeſſed, they can neuer
Submit themſelues to the Worde of God, nor to
the Calling of his Prophets, but go on ſtill and do
all thinges according as liketh themſelues beſt.
The next is Fulneſſe of bread,<note place="margin">2</note> that is, Gluttonie,
Riote, and Dronkenneſſe: which doth not onely
ouerwhelme all good motions of the Spirite of
God, but confoundeth and aſtonieth the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of common Senſe and reaſon. Therefore
Chriſt gaue a good warning when he ſayd,<note place="margin">Luc. 21. g. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>Beware
that your heartes bee not oppreſſed vvith ſurfeting

more Hinder men from all Godlineſſe, or made
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:9118:315"/>
them more ſubiect to the tentations of the Deuill
then that did. God had giuen the Sodomites a
verie Plentifull and wealthie Country,<note place="margin">Gen. 13. b. 10.</note> *called the
Paradiſe of the Earth, which thing they abuſed to
Luſt and wickedneſſe. So Corrupt we are that
when GOD giueth Wealth and plentie, we can
hardly ſtay our ſelues from turning it to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning
and feeding of Riote and Exceſſe.</p>
               <p>3 The thirde vice was Securitie, and Idleneſſe.
Long peace and quietneſſe is the great bleſſing of
God, but we ſee it come to paſſe, that they on whom
he doth beſtowe it, doe commonly ſo fall to Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and Securitie, that they almoſt forget God,
and will hardly by any meanes be brought to the
remembrance of their Duetie vntil God hath tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
them with ſome Grieuous plague. 4 The
fourth is Crueltie and vnmercifulneſſe towarde
the poore and needie, which as it is in all men a
great fault, ſo it is ſpecially in them on whom God
had emploied ſo ample benefits of Plenty, Welth,
Peace, and quietneſſe, as he had done on them of
<hi>Sodome.</hi> 5 The fift and laſt is that which of all
other is moſte Abhominable and ſprang out of
Theſe vices, as out of moſt naughtie and contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
rootes, that is, Filthie and vnnaturall Luſt,
without all Shame and moderation, as you may
ſee more largely.<note place="margin">Gen. 19. a. 1. &amp;c</note> 
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. redde in the Church on
the Sunday <hi>Sexageſima.</hi> In all theſe deteſtable
vices, the Prophet ſayth that the Iewes did farre
paſſe the Sodomites, and therefore that gods
Iuſt plague muſt needes come vpon them.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9118:316"/>
               <q>Thy Siſter Sodome was not hearde of by
thy reporte in the day of thy pride,<note place="margin">Verſ. 56. 57</note> &amp;c.</q>
               <p>That is, when thou waſt aloft in Honour and
proſperity, thou wouldeſt neuer call to thy remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
the horrible Puniſhment which they by
Gods Iuſtice ſuſtayned, that by their example
thou mighteſt haue learned to feare hys iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
and terrible plagues: vntill thine owne
Wickedneſſe was diſcouered, &amp; God had brought
vpon thee moſt dreadfull puniſhment, and cauſed
thee to be an open Reproch to all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be about thee.</p>
               <p>By this place let vs learne whyle God dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
Myldely and mercifully with vs, that we dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently

our affections with the feare of Gods Iuſtice,
leaſt, at the length when it ſhall be to late, we be
driuen by extreame Miſeries to ſee and feele the
lyke in our ſelues. When the Prophet ſayth, <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the time of the reproche of the daughters
of Aram or Syria:</hi> Some doe expounde it of that

wrappeth with it that Plague and Reproch which

doth grieuouſly puniſhe any perſon for his ſinnes,
<hi>His wickedneſſe</hi> is ſaid <hi>To be diſcouered,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

affirmeth that he will not deale with the remnant
of the Iewes according to their deſeruings, but
vpon their repentance will be Reconciled vnto
them. The moſt part of the people were euill and
wicked, and when the Prophetes threatned the
wrath of God and their deſtruction, they would
obiect for their defence the couenant that God had
made with them, as to be <hi>Their God</hi> &amp; <hi>Their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender,</hi>
and therefore eſteemed they all the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

their owne vniuſt doinges in Following the foote

that God Sometimes doth puniſhe ſome for the

no man is ſo Righteous in the ſight of God, but
that he Iuſtly deſerueth puniſhement: we muſt
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:9118:321"/>
moreouer conſider, that Gods Scourges are not

the wicked they are Plagues of his Iuſtice, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde

Firſt, that God is Iuſte and doth iniurie to no
man: And as the ſonnes of the children ſhall not
hurt the father, onleſſe they grewe by the fathers

the ſonne, if he doe not followe the fathers ſteps.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we ſee that there were in thoſe dayes
many which carped and cauilled at the preaching
of the Prophets, and made matter of ſcoffing and
ieſting at it. No meruaile therfore if we ſee the like
in theſe dayes, but their ieſting tauntes will in the

So doe we eyther denie our ſinnes, or wyth

               <p>10 Nowe when I had cauſed them to go out of the lande

doth ſignifie ſometime, to Sweare or take an oth,
becauſe the Ceremonie or geſture of lifting vp the

they called God to wytneſſe, that they Concealed
no truth, nor Vttered any falſhood: or if they dyd,
they deſired the ſame God to be Reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged of them.
And in this ſignification of <hi>Swearing,</hi> it is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

               <p>In manye places of the Scripture, the lande
of <hi>Chanaan</hi> is mentioned to flow with Milke and
Honie, that is, to abounde with all things Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie,
not onely for ſuſteynance, but alſo for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and pleaſure. For in thoſe dayes there was
no more delectable feeding then Milke and Hony.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Hierome</hi> who lyued a long tyme in that
Countrie, wryteth that it was a verie Delectable
and fruitfull place, but yet can we not thinke that
it was then any thing in compariſon of that it was
before, ſo long as they were the people of God,
and remayned in his obedience, keeping his lawes
and ordinances. For when they had reiected the
ſonne of God and promiſed <hi>Meſsias,</hi> it is likely the
land it ſelfe alſo was ſtriken for their wickedneſſe,
and thereby farre decayed from that it was in
times paſt.</p>
               <q>But they rebelled againſt mee,<note place="margin">Verſ. 8.</note> and would
not harken to me, they did, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>It is a teſtimonie of the great goodneſſe &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of God, that he calleth earneſtly to repentance
before he ſtrike and puniſhe his people for their
ſinnes. And ſo did he then to the Iſraelites, but
they would not harken vnto him, nor did caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:9118:328"/>
                  <hi>The abhominations of their eyes,</hi> that is, their
wicked Idoles on which they dyd caſt their eyes
with great delight: euen as they that be in vnchaſt
loue be alwaye deſirous to ſee and beholde them
that they loue. Vndoubtedly Idolatrie was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſaunt
to <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and the other <hi>Patriarkes</hi> in
<hi>Egipt,</hi> and they did exhort their children to remain
in the True worſhip of the liuing God. Yet many
of them, as borne and bredde in <hi>Egipt,</hi> were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
and fell to Idolatrie by the Imitation of
that People. Then were <hi>Moyſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> ſent
from God vnto them, and yet contynued they ſtill
in Idolatrie. Whereby we may gather what was
the Cauſe why God did ſo long ſuffer his people to
continue in ſo miſerable oppreſſion in <hi>Egipt,</hi> and
did not ſooner turne his mercifull continaunce to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
them. And that was, becauſe they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Forgot him and his true Worſhip deliuered
them by their Fathers, and were gyuen to the
worſhipping of ſtraunge Gods. And yet GOD
would not euen Then poure out his wrath vpon
them, although they had iuſtly deſerued it, but
for his Owne name ſake, and for the Couenant
that he had made with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi>
with his mightie hande, he Deliuered them.</p>
               <q>I wrought for my names ſake,<note place="margin">Verſ. 9.</note> that it
ſhould not be polluted before, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>I ſtayde my ſelfe, ſayth God, from Extremitie
of my wrath, and from working vtter deſtruction,
not for my people ſake, which in deede had iuſtly
<pb facs="tcp:9118:329"/>
deſerued it, but for my Names ſake, that it might
not be diſtained, and euill ſpoken of among the
<hi>Egiptians, Amalechites,</hi> and other Heathen Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in whoſe ſight my great works were wrought
and which had Hearde of my purpoſe to delyuer
my people, And therefore would haue ſayde that
I had neyther beene hable nor willing to doe that
which I had promiſed, and therby to haue thought
of me no otherwiſe then they dyd of their owne
Falſe Gods. This cauſe in this Chapiter ſo often
repeated, maye bring a ſinguler Comfort to the
godly in time of affliction and trouble. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Moyſes</hi> and other holy men haue alway ſtaied
moſt vpon that in their earneſt prayers vnto God,
when he hath threatned or begunne any priuate or
common plague, deſiring him, that he would ſpare
his people, &amp; holde his mercifull hande ouer them,
though not for their Owne ſakes, which in no wiſe
they haue deſerued, yet for his promiſe ſake, and
for his Owne Names ſake, that the enemyes
might not reioyce in the confuſion of his people.
And theſe praiers haue euer taken good effect with
God.</p>

Prepare a pot, ſet it on, and powre water into it.</p>

Wo vnto the bloudy citie, to the pot whoſe ſcumme is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,

I haue ſet her bloud vpon a highe (<hi>drye</hi>) rock, that it ſhoulde

thou ſhalt not be purged any more, till I haue cauſed mine

ſpoken it: yea it is come thereto all readie that I will doe it,
I will not go backe, I will not ſpare, I will not repent: but

God by an other parable ſetteth forth his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to the Iewes, which partly were alreadie
in captiuitie in <hi>Babilon,</hi> partly as yet remayned at
<hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> The Parable is this, that God telleth
the Prophete before hande of the ſodaine death of
his wife whiche he loued moſt tenderly, and yet
commaundeth him in any wiſe not to bewayle her
death. And if the people did aſke him, whie he did
not lament the death of her y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he eſteemed ſo derely,
that he ſhoulde anſwere them, it was done as a
ſign or token, agaynſt them. Becauſe the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Temple, and the loſſe of their wiues and
children, at the taking of the Citie ſhould be ſuch a
coroſiue to their heartes, as for extremitie of ſorow
they ſhould not be hable to weepe any more then he
did. For extremitie of griefe ſometimes vtterly
drieth vp teares &amp; maketh that one cannot weepe.
God calleth his wife <hi>The pleaſure of his eies,</hi> becauſe
he aboue all worldely thinges delighted in her.
Moreouer when people mourned at the death of
their friendes, the maner of the Countrey was to
lay away the ornament or attyre of their heades, to
put of their ſhooes, and to go barefooted, to couer
their face, and ſpecially the nether part thereof vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their eyes, to faſt &amp; not to eate meate or drinke
wine, or if they did, it ſhould be none other but ſuch
as was ſent them by other.<note place="margin">Verſ. 17.</note> But God willeth <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel</hi>
at the death of his wife to vſe none of theſe
ceremonies, nor to ſhew any outward token of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
for his wife.<note place="margin">Verſ. 18.</note> In the .18. verſe, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
declareth, that he did as God had bidden him.
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:9118:338"/>
In the morning of that day, in which his wife died
at night, he tolde the people that his wife ſhoulde
die ſodainly, whome all they knewe he loued very
earneſtly, and the next day he came abrode among
them, not vſing any ceremonie of mourning.</p>
               <q>And then the people ſaide vnto him,<note place="margin">Verſ. 18.</note> wilt
thou not tell vs what this ſignifieth, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>To lament the death of a mans wyfe, his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
or deare friendes, is not onely a thing vſuall
with men, but alſo ſuch as nature it ſelfe doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe,<note place="margin">Gen. 23. a. 2.</note>

Wherefore the people of the Iewes, ſeing <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel,</hi>

that he did it not of himſelfe, for that his nature
might hardly beare it, but by the commaundement
of God, thereby to ſignifie to them the great ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

               <p>16 Then the king commaunded, and they brought Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niell,

ſpake vnto Daniell, and ſayde, Thy God whom thou alway

a ſtone, and layde vpon the mouth of the denne, this the king
ſealed with his owne ring, and with the ſignet of his princes,
that the purpoſe concerning Daniel ſhould not be chaunged.</p>

in his owne perſon, and teacheth all good men
to conſider,<note place="margin">Num. 16. a. 3.</note> what be the fruits and works of cank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Enuie.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Darius</hi> that is here ſpoken of, was the
ſonne of <hi>Aſtiages,</hi> and vncle vnto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to whome
alſo he gaue his daughter in mariage, and in <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon</hi>
is called <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> he raigned not paſſing
one yeare after the conquering of <hi>Babilon:</hi> and
maye ſeeme to haue bene a Wiſe and Politique
Prince. By the aduice of <hi>Daniel,</hi> as it maye be
thought, he had ſet a verie good order of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in his kingdome. He deuided his whole do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
into .3. partes or Prouinces, and in eche
of them had ſet fortie Iudges or Gouernours, ſo
that the whole number came to ſixe ſcore. And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
them had appointed three Lieuetenants noble
and wiſe men, which might haue a diligent &amp; care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
eye into their doings, and take a iuſte recke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or accompt of them for all things. One of
theſe three was the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> whome he
* brought with him out of <hi>Babilon</hi> at his returne
into <hi>Medea.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 1. b. 6.</note> In him he ſawe ſo great Wiſedome,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:9118:349"/>
ſinceritie, faythfulneſſe, and diligence aboue all the
other, that he minded to ſet him ouer the whole
Realme. And this was the cauſe of that canckred
roote of enuie, that grewe in the hartes of the other
Princes and Nobles againſt him.</p>
               <q>Wherefore the Rulers and Gouernours
ſought an occaſion againſt Daniel,<note place="margin">Verſ. 4. 5.</note> &amp;c.</q>
               <p>The kingdome of the <hi>Medes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 3. g. 96.</note> was in great to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe
of good gouernement, but Satan the
common diſturber of mans life could not abide it:
knowing, that by the continuance therof his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
would be diminiſhed, and Gods glorie and
truth encreaſed. Therefore, he pricked forwarde
his Miniſters and Inſtruments to worke trouble
to <hi>Daniel</hi> the chiefe cauſe therof, and by al meanes
that might be, to bring him to confuſion. And here
I praye you conſider the nature of * enuie.<note place="margin">Pſal. 9. b. 10. Prou. 24. b. 15</note> They
looke into his doings with al diligence, whether he
did anye thing ambitiouſly towarde the atteining
of the kingdome, or at the leaſt wiſe, that might
be ſo interpreted. They conſider whether he dealt
vntruely in his accomptes of the kings treaſure,
or otherwiſe ſlackly and negligently in any thing.
But the innocencie and faithful diligence of <hi>Daniel</hi>
in all pointes was ſuch, as his verie enimies ſaide
of him, <hi>That they ſhould neuer finde matter agaynſt
hym, vnleſſe they did entrappe him by the lawe and
worſhip of his God,</hi> from which they were well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
he would not ſwarue. The conſideration of
this mans ſinceritie, being ſo Curiouſly ſcanned
<pb facs="tcp:9118:350"/>
euen by themſelues, ſhould haue moued them to
haue imbraced and loued him. But malice and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
is alwaye ſo blinde that it doth neuer conſider
any good gift or well doing in a man, but onely to
peruert it to an euill purpoſe.</p>
               <q>Vpon this went the Princes and Lordes
together vnto the king and ſayde,<note place="margin">Verſ. 6. &amp;c.</note> &amp;c.</q>
               <p>Now followeth the wicked practiſe of the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of <hi>Daniel,</hi> turning that, by ſiniſter meanes,
vnto his daunger, that of all things was worthy
greateſt praiſe in him, that is, his faithfull conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in the true worſhip of God. From which neither
the loue of worldly honour, nor the authoritie of
the Prince, nor the daunger of his life could moue
him.<note place="margin">Heſter. 3. c. 8.</note> Malicious enuie eſpyeth all oportunities to
worke miſchiefe. The king, although wiſe &amp; well
enclyned, yet was he of nature glorious, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to haue his honoure aduaunced, as it maye
appeare in <hi>Xenophon.</hi> This occaſion doe they take,
and pretende, that nowe at the beginning of his
raigne, this their deuiſe would ſtrike a greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
and Reuerence of his perſon, into the
mindes of his Subiects, and cauſe them thereby
to be more readie to obey him, and the more afraid
to diſpleaſe him. They omit not the authoritie of al
their conſents: whereby they might ſeeme euen to
force the Prince to a thing ſo profitable as they
pretended this to be. By which allurements, the
glorious Prince was eaſilie wonne to conſent: not
knowing the ende of their malicious meaning.
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:9118:350"/>
And yet were they not content with this, but they
would haue it ſo confirmed, that the King might
not after, vpon repentance, reuoke the lawe. And
therefore doe they burden him with the authoritie
of the <hi>Medean</hi> lawes, which are neuer altered, they
knewe how he liked <hi>Daniel,</hi> &amp; therfore they would
preuent it.</p>
               <q>Now when Daniel vnderſtood,<note place="margin">Verſ. 10. 11.</note> that he
had ſealed the wryting he went, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>In <hi>Daniel</hi> all men that feare God haue an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
howe to behaue themſelues in like diſtreſſe
and daunger, that is, firſt with earneſt and often
prayer to call vpon God for the aſſiſtance of hys
helpe and grace. And then conſtantly, and without
all cloking or diſſimuling of worldly Policie, to
ſtand to the confeſſion of Gods true and holy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
Some woulde by friendſhip or perſwaſion,
haue wrought with the king to alter the lawe,
which he well vnderſtoode was made as a trappe
only to take him in and bring him to danger. Or if
that might not be, they would haue thought thus
with themſelues, what? I may pray to God in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
and hart, why ſhould I neede anye externall
bowing of my bodye or kneeling, why ſhoulde I
raſhly caſt my ſelfe in daunger? and hurt my ſelfe
and all my Countriemen that are nowe in Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie?
One Moneth ſpace may quickly be paſſed
ouer, and then I may freely ſerue my God againe.
But <hi>Daniel</hi> would take none of theſe deuiſes, but
ſhew himſelfe ſimplie and plainely what he was,
<pb facs="tcp:9118:351"/>
not for any feare diſſimuling or altering any of his
cuſtomable maner in praying to God. Where it is
ſaide, that he prayed looking towarde <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi>
that maner he and all the Iewes vſed by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of <hi>Salomon</hi> in his prayer vnto God.<note place="margin">3. Reg. 8. e. 48.</note> 3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 8

enemies of <hi>Daniel</hi> were readie watching for their
purpoſe, and taking him in the deede doing, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
went vnto the king with great complaint,
ſaying,<note place="margin">Verſ. 12. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>O king, haſt thou not ſealed the Decree that

you the craft of theſe malicious men, and in them
the * nature and maner of all the enimies of Gods

being Noble men, might haue authority with
the Prince. Then they wreaſt from the king, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

that he had ratified the Degree. And laſtly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
vnto him the accuſation of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and that
with ſo much ſpite as poſſibly coulde be deuiſed.
That he was one of the Captiues of <hi>Iuda,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 1. a. 6.</note> that he
did not regarde the king, that vpon ſtubburnneſſe
and contempt, to the perilous example of all his
Subiectes he diſobeyed his Decree, and prayed
vnto his God not once or twiſe, but three times
euery day, and that in more open maner, then euer
he did before, that he might ſhewe to all men that
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:9118:351"/>
he made no accompt eyther of the King, or of his
lawe.</p>
               <q>When the king heard theſe wordes,<note place="margin">Verſ. 14. 15.</note> hee
was ſore diſpleaſed with him ſelfe, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>Nowe at the length the king perceyueth that
he was ouerreached by the * craft and enuie of his
Nobles,<note place="margin">Prou. 12. a. 5.</note> to his great miſlyking and diſpleaſure.
Whereby, it may appeare, there was in him a good
inclination of Iuſtice and equitie, but it was ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with time rouſneſſe, and the want of the true
knowledge of God, and truſt in his prouidence. He
feared, if he ſhould haue ſhewed himſelfe more to
eſteeme a ſtraunger then all the Nobles of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and for his cauſe, contrary to the maner of the
<hi>Medes,</hi> to reuoke a Lawe that he had made, that
they woulde haue rayſed ſome conſpiracie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
agaynſt him, to his great trouble, &amp; daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of his kingdome. Wherefore at the length, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the ſtay of one whole dayes ſpace, he yeeldeth,
and contrarie to his owne conſcience, committeth
an innocent and faythfull ſeruant into the handes
of his wicked enimies, and to the clawes of greedie
and hungrie Lions.</p>
               <q>Nowe the king ſpake vnto Daniell and
ſaid,<note place="margin">Verſ. 16. &amp;c.</note> thy God whom thou haſt ſerued, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>If <hi>Darius</hi> did thinke, that the GOD of <hi>Daniel</hi>
would deliuer him from the iawes of the Lions,
whie did he not perſwade himſelfe, that the ſame
God was hable alſo to ſaue his kingdome to him,
<pb facs="tcp:9118:352"/>
agaynſt the endeuours of all enemies or rebelles,
but that through feare thereof he would yeelde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his conſcience to giue ſentence of cruel death
agaynſt an innocent. Surely, if he had had <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels</hi>
fayth, he woulde rather haue haſarded his
kingdome, then ſo to haue tempted God in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt
puniſhment of an innocent and hurtleſſe man.
But the reſpect of worldlye Glorie oftentymes
drowneth the fayth of Princes. Yet the prouidence
of God ſo worketh by him, that the miracle that he
woulde ſhewe in the deliueraunce of his ſeruant,
might be euident &amp; without all exception or quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reling.
For <hi>Darius</hi> calleth for a great ſtone, to be
layde at the mouth of the Denne, and cauſeth the
ſame to be ſealed with his owne ring, and with the
ſignets of his princes, which were the accuſers of
<hi>Daniel:</hi> that there might not be ſo much as a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition
of any ſiniſter working, by feeding the lions
with meate or otherwiſe. When the king had this
done, his conſcience could not be quiet, for that he
had haſarded the life of ſo godly a man, but went
home with ſorrow and heauineſſe, forbearing his
meate and ſleepe, &amp; ſhunning all occaſion of myrth
and pleaſantneſſe.</p>
               <q>But betimes in the morning at the breake
of the day the king aroſe,<note place="margin">Verſ. 19. 20</note> &amp;c.</q>
               <p>The ſpeede that <hi>Darius</hi> made ſo earely in the
morning, declareth the care that he had for the life
of <hi>Daniell,</hi> and could not ſtay his affection, but with
lamentable wordes calleth vnto him. And <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:9118:352"/>
although his faithfull ſeruice ſhewed to the prince,
was very vnthankefully rewarded: yet with mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of ſpirite he aunſwereth. And neyther vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braydeth
the king with his vniuſt ſentence, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigheth
with one worde agaynſt his accuſers and
cauſers of all his daunger, but ſayth, <hi>My God hath
ſent his Angel and ſtopped the Lions mouthes.</hi> He
ſayth not, <hi>I am aliue,</hi> or <hi>I am not deade,</hi> but that he
may not ſeeme vnthankefull to the authour of his
deliuerance, <hi>My God,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>hath ſent his Angel,
&amp;c.</hi> To the confuſion of his enemies giuing the
glory of his deliuery to God alone, that they might
thereby knowe, that they had not ſtryued agaynſt
him alone, but agaynſt the eternall and euerliuing
God. The king reioyſed, <hi>Daniel</hi> was taken out of
the denne,<note place="margin">Pſal. 90. c. 14.</note> and the * cauſe of his deliuerance is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared:
<hi>That he did put his truſt in God.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>And as for thoſe men which had accuſed

               <p>The king being now by this miracle Encreaſed

we haue no true ſenſe of Gods wrath inwardly in

other ſignes be vſed as tokens and witneſſes to

when he heard the threatnings of God read in the

here: <hi>He will returne, and leaue behinde him a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

that where they were before oppreſſed with ſuche

that in a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon daunger all generally might

was it fulfilled about. 70. yeares after the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and leading of the people cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
into <hi>Babilon.</hi> At which time <hi>Cyrus</hi> tooke and

               <p>He, ſayth the Prophet, that lifteth vp his minde
vpon confidence &amp; truſt of his owne deuiſes, helpe,
and ſtrength, and thereby thinketh that he ſhall be
ſafe agaynſt all mutabilitie of fortune or other

<pb facs="tcp:9118:366"/>
he hath the vnfallible truth &amp; the almightie power
of God whereon he reſteth. Wherfore by this verſe
the Prophete willeth the people,<note place="margin">Pſal. 59. b. 12. Eſa. 20. b. 5. 6</note> to * lay aſide all
confidence of worldely helpe, and to reſt onelye in

               <q>Yea in deede the prowde man is as he that
tranſgreſſeth by wine,<note place="margin">Verſ. 5.</note> therfore ſhall, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>Here the Prophete beginneth to declare what
ſhall come to the Empire of <hi>Babilon</hi> &amp; of the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees,</hi>
together with the cauſes wherwith God was
mooued thereto. <hi>The prowde man,</hi> ſayth he, that is,
the prowde and ambitious <hi>Babilonian,</hi> is like to a
drunken man, that hath paſſed all meaſure in drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of wine. As in the Drunkarde the vapours of
the wine aſcendinge to the heade ſo trouble the
braine, and taketh away the right vſe of ſenſe and
reaſon, that without ſhame or meaſure he runneth
headlong to all filthineſſe, and the more he hath
powred in, the more ſtill he deſireth to drink: Euen
ſo the prowde and * ambicious ſpirite of the <hi>Babilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
doth ſo trouble his minde with vaine imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,<note place="margin">Iudith. 1. c. 7</note>
and carieth him awaye with furious luſt
and deſire of larger dominion, That without all
ſhame or meaſure he attempteth anye thing that
may ſerue his pleaſure. And the more he hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:9118:366"/>
vnder his dominion by violence and crueltie,
the more ſtill he luſteth. <hi>Therefore ſayth God,</hi> by
the Prophete, <hi>He ſhall not endure,</hi> he ſhall come to
a fowle ende. For euen as hell mouth, the graue or
the ſepulchre, and Death itſelfe are vnſatiable, and
drawe vnto them yong, and olde, and of all ſortes
and ſtates: euen ſo the outragious luſt of the <hi>Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian,</hi>
not contented with the great Empire of
<hi>Aſsiria,</hi> ſeeketh by might, violence, and oppreſſion,
by heapes as it were, to pull vnder his ſubiection
all Nations and Countries of the earth. By this
that is here ſpoken of the <hi>Babilonians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4. Re. 14. c. 10 Sopho. 3. c. 11. Eccle. 10. b. 7.</note> we muſt

               <p>The firſt plague that God threatneth to the

that al thoſe nations that it before had afflicted and
grieued, when they ſawe the ouerthrowe thereof,
ſhould triumph at it, and take vp taunting ſayings
and Prouerbes againſt it. And in reproch of it ſay,
Wo be to this greedy kingdome, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with vnſatiable

of the <hi>Babilonians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 14.</note> that his glory ſhal be ſpred ouer

               <p>The next vice that the Prophete doth reproue,
is <hi>Drunkenneſſe</hi> and <hi>quaffing,</hi> wherevnto the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilonians</hi>
were muche giuen, and ſpecially vnder
their king <hi>Balthaſar,</hi> as appeareth. <hi>Dan.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 5. a. 2.</note> 5. When
the Prophete ſayth, <hi>VVoe to him that giueth his
Neyghbour drinke,</hi> he doth not blame them, that
offer drinke in honeſt maner to their gheſtes, or to
relieue the poore.</p>
               <p>But as he expoundeth himſelfe, ſuch perſons
as in the Heate of their drunkenneſſe prouoke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to quaffing and immoderate drinking, vntill
they haue made them more like beaſtes then men,
diſcouering themſelues filthily, and therein take
they great delight and pleaſure. Wherefore God
threatneth them puniſhment for that wickedneſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:9118:368"/>
and ſayth that they <hi>Shall be filled with ſhame in ſtede
of Glorie,</hi> For when the Prophet ſayth <hi>Thou art,
&amp;c.</hi> by the preſent time (as the Prophets often do)
he ſignifieth what ſhall ſo aſſuredlye come vnto
them as if it were now already fulfilled. Then the
Prophet with bitter ſcorne addeth, <hi>Drinke thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
and be made naked &amp;c.</hi> As if he hadſayde, ſeyng
it is ſuch a pleaſure and delight to thee, to beholde
the filthy nakedneſſe of other, whome thou haſte
made drunke, thou alſo, will thou nill thou, ſhalte
drinke, and haue thy filthineſſe, thy ſhame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche
diſcouered and layde open to all men. For
the lorde by his right hande and mightye power
hath prepared a <hi>VVofull Cup</hi> of affliction for thee,<note place="margin">Verſ. 17.</note>
which when it ſhall be poured vppon thy heade
<hi>Shamefull ſpuing,</hi> that is, the bewraying of thyne
owne ignominie, reproche, and ſhame, ſhall ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme
and diſtayne all thy glorye wherein thou
haſt reioiced. Thus bitterly God reproued in them
that foule vice of drunkenneſſe. And he addeth
moreouer the principall cauſe of their vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
to be the exceeding crueltie, murder, and
ſpoyle, that they had vſed towarde the country of
<hi>Iury</hi> and his people dwelling therin. For that is
it that he meaneth by the <hi>Crueltie of Lybanus.</hi> By
<hi>Lybanus,</hi> which is a parte of the lande of <hi>Chanaan,</hi>
he vnderſtandeth the whole countrie.</p>
               <q>What profiteth the Image,<note place="margin">Verſ. 18. &amp;c.</note> for the maker
therof hath made it an Image. &amp;c.</q>
               <p>God, that his people being in captiuitie among
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:9118:368"/>
the Heathen, and ſeing their proſperitie might not
attribute the ſame to their falſe Gods, in this place
by his Prophet reproueth the Idolatry of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilonians,</hi>
and ſheweth that they are not * hable to
helpe them,<note place="margin">3. Reg. 18. e. 26 28. 29.</note> or in any reſpect to doe them good. For
they are but ſtockes and ſtones * and haue theyr
ſhape and figure of the workeman,<note place="margin">Pſal. 114. a. 4.</note> that maketh
them: Who as an vnreaſonable Creature and as
it were bewitched of his ſenſes * worſhippeth it as
God,<note place="margin">Eſa. 46. a. 6. 7</note> and putteth his truſt in the woorke of his
owne handes. They are ſet as <hi>Teachers of lyes,</hi>
For they breede opinion that they are the Image
of God, which can be expreſſed by no Image, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a ſpiritual ſubſtance. They mooue many vaine
falſe &amp; wicked cogitations of God, in the minds of
men, and leade them into errour. They corrupt
and ouerthrowe the true worſhippe of God, and
cauſe it to be tranſferred to creatures. And what
greater <hi>Lye</hi> can there be then this, to induce men
to * attribute diuine power to that,<note place="margin">Eſay. 44. c. 17</note> which hath not
ſo much as any thing like to a mortall man, more
then the dead figure and proportion.</p>
               <p>This place let them conſider which before time
haue taught the people of God that <hi>Images are laye
mens bookes.</hi> In deede bookes and teachers they
may well be called, but as the Prophet here ſayth,
to teach them <hi>Lyes,</hi> and errors touching God and
his worſhippe. Therefore the People that haue
bene ſo lamentably miſſledde, may well ſay, woe,
woe, vnto them that haue brought vs to ſo palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and
groſſe errour as to forget the eternall, true,
<pb facs="tcp:9118:369"/>
and liuing God,<note place="margin">Eſay. 44. d. 24</note> * who made vs, who preſerued,
and by his ſonne redeemed vs, and knéele downe
to dumbe ſtockes, and ſtones, and in our
