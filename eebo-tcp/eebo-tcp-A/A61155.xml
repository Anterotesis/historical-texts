            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. We have found by experience, that the ſpeedy ſetling of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Nation, hath made Reformation take little root, ſave in the outward man, or formall Obedience; and the reaſon was, Becauſe they received not Reformation firſt in the power of the Word, but of the State, which went not ſo deep into their Conſciences, but they could part with it at any time upon a Law: Oh then, <hi>Why do not daies ſpeake, and multitude of yeares teach knowledge?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is againſt the nature of <hi>Chriſts deſcription</hi> of himſelfe, and againſt that ſutableneſſe which he preſſes for, amongſt all ſuch as ſhould ſubmit to his <hi>Commandements; He ſhall not ſtrive, nor cry, neither ſhall any man heare his voyce in the ſtreets,</hi> Matth. 11. 19. <hi>My yoke is eaſie, and my burden light,</hi> Matth. 11. 29. <hi>His Commandements are not grievous,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 3. <hi>Neither do men put new wine into old bottles.</hi> All which cannot be fulfilled in the Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiall Congregations.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The more time for <hi>trying</hi> the <hi>ſpirits,</hi> and <hi>proving all things,</hi> there is leſſe danger to that <hi>State</hi> of errings in things received and authorized, and of involving it ſelfe into the deſignes of Eccleſiaſticall power, then which nothing hath ſooner broken the Civill power, as may be ſeen in Popiſh Kingdoms, and our late Prelaticall. There can be no great danger in the not ſudden incorporating the two powers: Since <hi>Moſes</hi> is not alive to bring down the juſt <hi>Paterne of the Tabernacle,</hi> there may a new Star ariſe, which was not ſeen at firſt; which, if we ſhut up our ſelves too ſoone while the <hi>ſmoake</hi> is in the <hi>Temple,</hi> cannot appeare.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We have not yet any experiment of our new <hi>Clergie,</hi> who are many of them <hi>branches</hi> of the old <hi>ſtock,</hi> and ſo may weild the Government too much of the <hi>Epiſcopall</hi> Faction, as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> did with the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, becauſe they were not naturall <hi>Iews.</hi> It is not ſafe truſting a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer too far into thoſe hands.

                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:65857:6"/>9. We experience in part ſome remainders of Prelacy working in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which ſhewes a conſtitution not ſo cleare nor pure as the Diſciples of Chriſt ſhould have; then whether it be ſafe committing the power too ſuddenly: For though I queſtion not but ſome may be like the <hi>ten,</hi> yet there are others like the <hi>two Brethren</hi> who ſtrove which ſhould be <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,</hi> till the Lord ended the difference, <hi>It ſhall not be ſo amongſt you.</hi> We find the hotteſt Controverſie is now moved about Church-government; and there hath been moſt written and ſpoken this way, and in moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: Now when the contention for power is ſo much, and the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie ſtreames moſt in Government, we may ſoon diſcerne diſpoſitions. Well, is it good parting with the ſtakes yet while there is ſuch quarrelling for them, &amp; when one party cannot but take it for an injury, if wholly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the other? It is to be feared, there is too much of man, becauſe the bias runs moſt in theſe times towards this one truth of government, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other are wholly ſet by, which might well be lookt upon with it; which if there were not a Principle in man more fitted for a truth of this kind then any other, would not be: But every truth hath its age and ſeaſon. This only for caution.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. There is no Religion eſtabliſhed by State, but there is ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in the two Powers, and ſome compliancy betwixt the Civill and Eccleſiaſticall; ſo as the eſtabliſhing the one, will draw with it ſome motions in the other: And we all ſee how hazardous it is to diſintereſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the Civill part, even in Kingdomes that are more firme, as <hi>France,</hi> where the Proteſtants are partly allowed their Religion in pay for their Civill engagements; and ſo in other States. And ſure I am, that State is moſt free, where the conſcience is leaſt ſtraitned, where the Tares and the Wheat grow together till the harveſt.</p>
                  <p>11. Our parties or diſſenting Brethren being now together, and claſped by intereſt againſt the common enemy, this foundation of common unity is ſuch as may draw in both affections and judgements, if not too ſuddenly determined into Hereticks and Schiſmaticks: It is poſſible, while a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie is long ſuſpended, and time given for concluſion of things, Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions may be ſooner at peace: A fire let alone, may dye out under that wood which ſtirred in would kindle it. The <hi>Contentions of Brethren are like the ſtrong bars of a Caſtle; and a Brother that is offended is harder to be won then a ſtrong City,</hi> Prov. 18. 19.</p>

                     <p>I perceive then in a word, That the maine thing the <hi>Vindication-Book</hi> drives at, is, to place <hi>Presbytery</hi> upon ſuch a <hi>mixed uniformity</hi> in the partaking of <hi>Ordinances,</hi> that there ſhould be no <hi>act</hi> of <hi>ſuſpenſion</hi> or <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> practiſed in their <hi>Church,</hi> leſt the <hi>ground</hi> of <hi>ſeparation</hi> get in; and they that make conſcience to ſeparate or ſuſpend in ſome particulars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it implies, they may go on to a further <hi>ſeparation,</hi> till upon more degrees of <hi>purity</hi> in <hi>communicating,</hi> they go off from all kinde of <hi>mixt communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,</hi> in the <hi>conſtituting,</hi> as well <hi>Churches,</hi> as <hi>Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations,</hi> and ſo at length become, either Congregationall, or of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way.</p>
                     <p>But many of us tooke ſuch of the Presbyteriall way, as writ and taught,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65857:12"/>
for a pure <hi>Reformation</hi> in partaking of <hi>Ordinances,</hi> for the better, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their <hi>light:</hi> And it ſeems they are but novices, as we may gather from the <hi>Vindication-Book,</hi> and are ignorant of his <hi>Presbyteriall ſecret,</hi> or <hi>myſtery</hi> of <hi>uniformity,</hi> and <hi>unmixt communicating,</hi> according to the <hi>grounds</hi> there.</p>

                        <p>Whence we may infer, That the <hi>Sacrament</hi> being a <hi>converting Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> may be given to all unregenerate perſons, in or out of the Church; for if it be a <hi>converting Ordinance,</hi> the conſequence lies cleare, that no ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, of any ſort, kind, quality, condition, in or out of the Church, ought to be denied it; nay, to have it adminiſtred, as well without the <hi>Word,</hi> as with it, it being of equall power with the <hi>Word</hi> for <hi>converting,</hi> as the <hi>Vindication</hi> faith; and that who holds otherwiſe, are miſtaken. And though there be a diſtinction premiſed of converting to the <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>formall profeſſion,</hi> and a <hi>converting</hi> to a <hi>ſpirituall ſincere Faith in Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> yet this diſtinction makes not any thing againſt the Sacrament, to be given before the <hi>Word,</hi> even for converſion to the firſt Faith, or faith from Paganiſm; which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Scriptures,</hi> nor <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or any <hi>Diſciple</hi> of <hi>his,</hi> from <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to the <hi>ſeventy,</hi> and ſo down through any age, to our own, that ever I could read on, practiſed: and yet the principles laid down in <hi>Fol</hi> 38. will infer ſuch a conſequence, naturally and truly; for the <hi>Vindication</hi> ſaith in <hi>Fol.</hi> 38. That the <hi>Word, and all Ordinances, are alike for converſion;</hi> and if ſo, the <hi>Sacraments</hi> may be uſed as well to convert from <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred ſingly by themſelves, as the <hi>Word</hi> by it ſelfe may be taught.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The <hi>Vindication</hi> ſaith, That it is doubtleſſe to be given to all, for elſe it had been an impertinent and ineffectuall thing to adminiſter to cloſe <hi>Hypocrises</hi> that are <hi>carnall Chriſtians.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Whence we may infer, That becauſe the Counſels of the Lord in all his Adminiſtrations, do not clearly appeare, but through the <hi>Vindications</hi> of his own ſuppoſitions and premiſes; therefore he concludes fully, That it were <hi>impertinent</hi> and <hi>ineffectuall,</hi> when as there appeares no ſuch end at all in the inſtitution of it, but rather two other ends.</p>
                        <p>One which himſelfe laies down, as occaſionall or evidentiall, <hi>for the damnation, and hardening ſome;</hi> though I ſcarce allow him that, that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> are properly active to condemnation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="14" facs="tcp:65857:14"/>The other which he never thinks on in his Book, is this, That God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left no infallible Rule for diſcerning, hath ordered it by a pure Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell-rule, which if wicked men will come up to, they hazzard greater condemnation.</p>
                        <p>Further we may infer, That things may be called <hi>impertinent</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectuall,</hi> which are inſtituted of the Lord, when the reaſons of the Lords Inſtitution appeares not to us; and that we may put our own ſuppoſitions and ends upon any adminiſtration in the Word, when his ends are not cleare to us; nay, and conclude againſt any other end then that of our own conjecture, or ſuppoſed probable reaſon; which I am confident is too too groſſe to be in the learned <hi>Author Intentionally,</hi> though not <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially,</hi> in his <hi>Vindication.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But the ends which I clearly gather from the Analogie of things in Gods diſpenſation, are theſe; Why the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> though according to the inſtitution delivered to Hypocrites, yet is no converting Ordinance?</p>
                        <p>God having left no infallible <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>diſcerning</hi> his, but only a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <hi>Rule for outward evidences,</hi> the <hi>Ordinances</hi> muſt either be adminiſtred to all, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king according to the <hi>Rule of outward evidences,</hi> or to none; and according to that Rule, Hypocrites may come in, and do; yet that is no ſin to the <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> nor <hi>Communicants,</hi> ſo long as Adminiſtrations be ordered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that <hi>Rule,</hi> and <hi>Gods End</hi> of his revealed Will ſhewed.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The worke of ſifting, and reaping, of dividing betwixt the Tares and the Wheat, the Sheep and the Goats, is the work of the great day of the Son of man; and therefore, though Ordinances be adminiſtred here to Hypocrites; yet at the time of the finall diſcerning, the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of Hypocrites ſhall be viſited in judgement, and greater condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon them. So as there is no need of framing it into any Notion of a converting Ordinance, leſt otherwiſe it prove impertinent or ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; for if the cloſe Hypocrites be finally impenitent ones, God reckons for a greater ſin; if not, yet it is no more impertinent then the Word is to all the children of God, who yet never partake truly of it, till converted.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, That the diſtinction of his into the firſt converſion from Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm to Faith; and ſecondly, from a formall Faith, to a true ſincere Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, which is the corner Stone in his building, is a diſtinction, and certain degrees, which we have not in any ſuch Notion in the Word; nor if it were, doth it appeare that the Scriptures place adminiſtration up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bottom of any ſuch diſtinction, though he doth it? But ſuppoſe I grant it, yet a <hi>formall profeſſion</hi> then, as he contends for, and many other, was not <hi>ſuch</hi> as is now, ſince <hi>Kingdoms</hi> were <hi>Chriſtia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ized;</hi> but a profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then was according to the <hi>Rule of evidence,</hi> till the contrary appeared, as in all the firſt gathered Churches, as in <hi>Simon Magus, Ananias, &amp;c.</hi> And formall profeſſion then, was as much as a kind of powerfull profeſſion
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65857:14"/>
now; for then it was perſecution, to take up an Ordinance or Name of Chriſt, and now it is faction on the Law of the Land, as well as the Law of the God, to profeſſe Chriſt; neither were the whole Counſels of the Spirit of Chriſt brought forth then to make up the rule of evidences, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; but they were brought forth by degrees, till the whole Scriptures of the New Teſtament were finiſhed. And we are now to take the whole Counſels of God concerning Adminiſtrations, as laid down in the whole New Teſtament, and not by parcels, though ſo much as they did profeſſe in the firſt time of gathering, were rule enough then, to them, when no more was revealed, yet not to us now, who have a full Goſpell for our learning: And this miſtake or want of juſt conſideration of times, and Scriptures, is the ground of all the miſtakes.</p>

                        <p>Secondly, that becauſe <hi>afflictions</hi> are therefore <hi>Sacraments</hi> are that is, becauſe one thing is therefore another thing is: This is but the <hi>Old Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> But God may ſanctifie any thing at his own pleaſure, to make way for <hi>Converſion</hi> and yet that no inſtituted Ordinance for converſion neither: Becauſe ſome have been converted when afflicted, when ſick, when poor; therefore will you firſt go afflict them, and make them ſick, and poore, taking all they have from them, that you may convert them, and ſo make them ſtanding Ordinances?</p>

                        <p>But I ſhall argue further: What need ſuch comparing of the mixt <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations</hi> of ſeverall <hi>Kingdoms;</hi> ours and theirs?

                        <p>But what of all this?

                        <p>Yet I obſerve another <hi>ſecret,</hi> why the <hi>preaching of the Word</hi> thrives bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and reformes more then the <hi>Government</hi> in theſe Kingdoms, becauſe that <hi>the Preaching of the Word</hi> is an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of the Lord; and when prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched or held forth to ungoldly ſcandalous, and notorious ſinners, is but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its right order of Inſtitution ſo preached; the <hi>end</hi> of the Lord is but fully and clearly ſerved; becauſe the <hi>Word,</hi> in the <hi>miniſtery</hi> of it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for a <hi>converting Ordinance;</hi> but the <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not inſtituted as a <hi>converting Ordinance</hi> primatily, but for a <hi>people</hi> alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>converted</hi> and brought in it cannot be accompanied with ſuch <hi>power from heaven,</hi> became it is not managed according to <hi>pure Goſpell-order,</hi> nor upon a <hi>people</hi> rightly prepared and fitted: ſo as the fault is not, becauſe there is a <hi>Government,</hi> as the <hi>Vindication</hi> obſerves; but, not the <hi>pure Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> nor the <hi>Government</hi> rightly placed.</p>

                        <p n="1">1.

The <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> contained in the <hi>Word,</hi> or <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> beare only the Image of a <hi>God,</hi> in their <hi>holineſſe, purity, righteouſneſſe, glory, infiniteneſſe, eternity, immortality,</hi> which are all, with many more things of like excellency, there, which are as the beams of light to the Sun, or ſo many things of God, revealing God.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Word is ſo tempered into a <hi>middle nature</hi> betwixt God and man, as no Word can be more revealing the moſt glorious, ſpirituall, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite things from a God, in a meane, literall, figurative, comparative, ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative way to man.</p>

                        <p>Now from theſe I argue:</p>

Each one is perſonally and individually bound by the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and in his owne <hi>proper conſcience</hi> is obliged to endeavour a Reformation accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>to the Word of God,</hi> and ſo far to the example of the beſt <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> as they are agreeable to that <hi>Word;</hi> I hope no further: Now who ſhall be the <hi>Iudge</hi> and <hi>Interpreter</hi> of this <hi>Word of God,</hi> to each mans conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the <hi>things of God,</hi> but he who is <hi>Lord</hi> of the conſcience, in things
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65857:36"/>
immediately <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>ſpirituall?</hi> The <hi>conſciences</hi> of men are under a <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall</hi> and <hi>immediate Interpreter</hi> of the Word, even the <hi>Spirit of the Lord,</hi> in all things of <hi>ſpirituall cognizance,</hi> as every <hi>Scripture-truth,</hi> or <hi>Truth</hi> in the <hi>Word</hi> is: and this is not only ſtrengthened and cleer from the Word, but from a <hi>teſtimony</hi> which ſome when they read, may know better then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others.</p>
                        <p>By the Clauſe, <hi>According to the Word of God,</hi> we underſtand, <hi>ſo far as we doe or ſhall in our conſciences conceive the ſame to be according to the Word of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now each man ſtanding thus <hi>ingaged</hi> in his owne particular, and in his own proper <hi>conſcience</hi> by a Covenant recommended and impoſed, each is bound to bring forth the evidence of their <hi>conſciences</hi> in particular, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this to which they are covenanted: So as <hi>I,</hi> or <hi>you,</hi> being covenanted againſt <hi>Popery, Hereſie,</hi> and according to the Word of God, <hi>you</hi> and <hi>I</hi> ſtand bound by our own private <hi>conſciences</hi> to reveale to the State, who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended ſuch a <hi>Covenant</hi> unto us, what our <hi>conſciences</hi> interpret accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Word, againſt <hi>Popery</hi> or <hi>Hereſie,</hi> unleſſe there could be one uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall, or publike infallible Interpreter of the Word of God and Truth, who might determine concerning <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and whoſe <hi>determinations</hi> is as in the <hi>formerly inſpired Apoſtolical teachers,</hi> we may reſt.</p>
                        <p>So being thus ingaged by <hi>Covenant,</hi> we are at the ſame <hi>time,</hi> by <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> Act, bound to <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>conſcience,</hi> in theſe particulars of the <hi>things of God:</hi> And if there ſhould be any perſecution for the pious, modeſt, and peaceable liberty, ſo taken and practiſed, whether would it not clearly and undeniably follow, that our conſciences are not under the Lord <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and his Spirit immediatly in the things of God, but under the interpretations of <hi>men.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And ſurely that one Clauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <hi>according to the Word of God,</hi> is moſt provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially inſerted; for if we be ſo cloſely covenanted to the <hi>Word</hi> of God, how tender ought we to be? leſt in this dark ſeaſon of our diſcerning, we oppoſe ſomthing of the <hi>Word,</hi> and ſo in ignorance, perſecute what we co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to maintaine.

I ſigh to conſider: There would be edge againſt edge, authority againſt authority, power againſt power, and all the State or Kingdome involved into bloud and confuſion: So as we muſt conſider things according to their principles, not according to their temporary or occaſionall <hi>advantages.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> But you give not enough to the Magiſtrate?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, more then any. He that gives him that which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, gives more then any that pretend to give him the moſt.</p>
                        <p>The pretenders that bid for the Magiſtrate at this time, are,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. They that put him as an help and government in the Church, as ſome,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 28.</note>

                        <p n="2">2. They that make uſe on him but as an help to the Church extrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and by way of forraigne aſſiſtance, as others, <hi>viz.</hi> they of the <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall</hi> way.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. They that give him power over body, goods, over all morall and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill behaviours of men, <hi>Profeſſors</hi> and <hi>Beleevers,</hi> of what ſort ſoever, of what opinion ſoever, as I and the reſt of our <hi>Brethren</hi> do, praying with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſupplication, that under them we may lead a peaceable, godly, and quiet life.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Obj.</hi> But why dare you not ingage civill Magiſtracy in Religion over conſciences, as ſome others do?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, in all things morally good and evill, God hath ingaged them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hath ſet the Law and Light of nature and conſcience in all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſide with them, <hi>condemning</hi> and <hi>excuſing</hi> what they and their Law doth <hi>condemne</hi> and <hi>excuſe,</hi> and thus to beare witneſſe with their <hi>dominion</hi> and <hi>power.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But in things of pure Goſpel-myſtery and Evangelically good or evill, I dare not ingage them (whatever others doe) over conſciences, becauſe I give more to their juſt power, and becauſe I dare not draw them into ſuch

principles, which hath broken more Magiſtracy, then all the other <hi>plots</hi> and <hi>devices</hi> of men.</p>
                        <p>For things of Worſhip which are laid up in the <hi>pure ſimple myſtery</hi> in the Light of the Spirit, not of nature, as all meer Goſpell-myſtery is, to ingage the <hi>Magiſtrates Sword</hi> into theſe, is rather a way to daſh them againſt every mans conſcience, and ſo in time to lay in a <hi>fatall power,</hi> or a <hi>fatall ſuffering.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We know that power which makes Kingdoms <hi>ſoundeſt</hi> in their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and moſt laſting, is the trueſt and wholſomeſt; and ſurely that which ingages them leſt into that part of the ſoule, the conſcience which can leſt endure to be oppreſſed, is the ſafeſt and moſt peaceable.</p>

                           <p>Your <hi>Queſtion</hi> was accordingly put by you, and accordingly <hi>anſwered</hi> by me.

The Apoſtles waited for the full <hi>revelation</hi> of all <hi>Truth</hi> by the <hi>Spirits</hi> comming. The <hi>Bereans ſearched daily to ſee whether the things were</hi>

                              <hi>ſo, or no. Apollos</hi> preached not Chriſt clearly till he was <hi>inſtructed in the way of God more perfectly.</hi> We are bidden to <hi>try the ſpirits,</hi> and <hi>prove all things:</hi> So as I appeared in thoſe degrees but by <hi>Scripture</hi> warrant. And I could name to you examples of another ſort; <hi>Auguſtine, Luther,</hi> both finding <hi>truth</hi> but in <hi>degrees;</hi> and the latter ſweetly acknowledging how he was enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened by <hi>beam</hi> after <hi>beam.</hi> Angels, who lie more naked towards God, and take in the things they know, by way of <hi>Viſion;</hi> yet ſee not any of that <hi>will</hi> of God which gives <hi>Laws</hi> to them, but as he reveales: Much leſſe ſuch as we who <hi>dwell in houſes of clay,</hi> and whoſe <hi>foundations are in the duſt,</hi> and who come by the <hi>ſight of things diſcourſively,</hi> and by <hi>ſpirituall reaſoning;</hi> God giving in the revelation of his Truths, in a <hi>naturall,</hi> yet <hi>ſupernaturall way.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But for that Notion of <hi>Independency</hi> you ſpeake on, I dare not owne it,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65857:38"/>
becauſe I account my ſelfe both under a ſpirituall and civill Supremacy; under Jeſus Chriſt and the Magiſtrate ſeverally, and exempt from neither. We are not of thoſe that <hi>deſpiſe Governments,</hi> and <hi>ſpeak evill of Dignities;</hi> nor are we under any ſuch <hi>ſingular Notion</hi> that I know on, to be called <hi>Independents,</hi> &amp;c. We all hold of the <hi>Body of Chriſt,</hi> and of the <hi>Communion of Saints</hi> below; and we hold <hi>one upon another,</hi> but not <hi>one over another.</hi> We dare not be <hi>Claſſicall, Provinciall, Nationall;</hi> theſe are no formes of <hi>wholſome words</hi> to which we are commanded, nor know we any ſuch po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; but that of <hi>Brethren,</hi> and <hi>Miniſtery,</hi> and <hi>fellowſhip.</hi> We dare not take out a Copy either from the <hi>States</hi> of the world, or the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to <hi>obey</hi> or <hi>rule</hi> by under the Goſpell. And if you can the <hi>Churches</hi> or <hi>Chriſt Independent</hi> for this, we muſt ſuffer till the Lord bring forth <hi>our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as the noon-day.</hi> Yet this you and we both know, that when <hi>Truth</hi> would not embody or mingle at any time with corruptions, it had preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the name of <hi>Sect, Schiſme, Faction</hi> (all which are implyed in the name <hi>Independency</hi>) put upon it. Thus were the <hi>Reformed Nations</hi> of <hi>England, Germany, France,</hi> &amp;c. ſcandalized by Popiſh Writers, and the old <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts</hi> by the Prelaticall; the <hi>Jews</hi> formerly by the <hi>Nations,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> by the <hi>Jews.</hi> We have heard enough of <hi>Independency</hi> and <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> ſuch notes of diſtinction are now become names of reproach: and ſo I lay them downe.</p>
                           <p>And whereas you ſay, <hi>you will not entertaine me as an enemy;</hi> It is more likely then in the end, both <hi>you</hi> and <hi>I</hi> may prove a better <hi>friend</hi> to the <hi>Truth.</hi> It is poſſible many in this Age might have ſeen more, had they not eaſt ſo much duſt in <hi>one anothers eyes</hi> by their <hi>ſtrivings:</hi> It were well ſuch a <hi>Goſpell ſpirit</hi> would walke more abroad, and that <hi>ſpirit</hi> which caſts men ſometimes into the <hi>fire,</hi> and ſometimes into the <hi>water,</hi> were not ſo ſtirring.

                           </p>
                           <p>For my ſuggeſtion of a <hi>ſuſpition of haſte;</hi> you know; <hi>words</hi> and <hi>phraſes</hi> are not the ſame to all: one may <hi>interpret</hi> thus, another <hi>thus.</hi> I had no thought of <hi>Jehu's</hi> driving, as you imply, when I wrote.

                           <p>For that of <hi>my taxing the Miniſters</hi> for deſiring power; none have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſpeak but the <hi>guilty,</hi> it concernes not the <hi>innocent.</hi> It is not ſtrange for <hi>ſome Miniſters</hi> to affect <hi>Government,</hi> or rather <hi>ruling:</hi> we have ſo much of <hi>Prelacie</hi> yet left, and working in the Countrey with us; and if not in the City too I refer you to Maſter <hi>Coleman.</hi>

                           <p>For the <hi>word rendred from the Originall</hi> metaphorically, I quoted only the Text, to my remembrance, to the Printers hand; and how he came by the metaphor, I know not; but I find fault as well as you: However, to make the beſt of it now; <hi>tranſlations</hi> of Scripture are not all <hi>Grammaticall,</hi> as you know; nor to the <hi>letter,</hi> as I could wiſh them with you.</p>

                           <p>Since you will help me to prove you are welcome: You have furniſhed me with one <hi>Argument</hi> more: You are a fair enemy, to lend out your own weapon. And now you have made your <hi>Argument</hi> half for me, I ſhall make the other half my ſelf. You ſay,</p>
                           <p>What the <hi>impoſers of Government cannot doe in Faith, is ſin:</hi> This is your half Argument. But you take it for granted, <hi>Our impoſers of Government are not ſuch,</hi> but ſuch as are <hi>fully perſwaded,</hi> and can ſet up the <hi>Government in faith;</hi> and you prove it thus, from <hi>thoſe of their Counſellors ſo near them,</hi> and from their <hi>Scripture-diſcuſſions.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Firſt, I know not what Counſellors you mean; but they are too wiſe a Senate to be carried by any <hi>intereſt</hi> but their owne; and I wiſh them no other Counſellors then <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace:</hi> nor doe I know that they are ſo fully perſwaded of any ſuch <hi>Government.</hi> I beleeve ſome of them are not ſo fully principled for your way, and then they all are not perſwaded ſo of the <hi>Government:</hi> nor have you yet been able to make out the <hi>evidence</hi> of every <hi>truth</hi> you preſented them from cleare <hi>Scriptures,</hi> ſaving your Art of deductions, and conſequences, and prudence: and if all cannot be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that <hi>State-conſcience,</hi> or <hi>Publike conſcience,</hi> is not ſo <hi>wholly</hi> nor <hi>fully</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded: then, as you imply, a <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Publike conſcience</hi> is like a <hi>Particular conſcience;</hi> which if it doth not <hi>wholly conſent,</hi> is <hi>doubtfull,</hi> or <hi>weake;</hi> for it is not in <hi>Spirituall things</hi> as in <hi>Civill: Votes</hi> of <hi>major parts</hi> make <hi>laws,</hi> and they ſtand good from any ſuch <hi>forms</hi> of <hi>Policie:</hi> but I never yet ſaw that <hi>rule</hi> in the Goſpell for any ſuch proceedings in <hi>ſpirituall things:</hi> but that is a <hi>Law</hi> in Chriſts Kingdome, not that which is <hi>voted</hi> ſo, but that which <hi>is</hi> ſo in the truth of it: For elſe <hi>Popery</hi> were the beſt, for it hath moſt <hi>voices</hi> and <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</hi> So as unleſſe you can prove the <hi>Parliament</hi> to be of one minde in it, how can you prove a <hi>Parliament</hi> ſo fully <hi>perſwaded</hi> in <hi>minde</hi> as you imply? Let them prove a Truth by moſt <hi>voices</hi> that pleaſe or can; but I wiſh the buſineſſe of a <hi>State-conſcience,</hi> in a thing of this nature, were more enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into then yet it hath been.</p>
                           <p>But if the <hi>Parliament</hi> were fully perſwaded of the truth of the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> yet there would be a new queſtion, yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is very learnedly diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by our worthy Brethren, Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> and the Commiſſioner, how they could be perſwaded of the <hi>impoſing,</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of <hi>ſetling.</hi> For my part, if there muſt be an <hi>impoſing</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> (for I would have the State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſciences left to their <hi>liberty</hi> as well as Particular, and yet Truth to have
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65857:41"/>
the liberty of acceſſe unto them) I would have the power of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment laid up there: we have had too ſad experience when it hath been given out from thence, and truſted too far. <hi>Paul</hi> referred himſelfe thither, (<hi>I ſtand,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>at Ceſar's Judgement-ſeat</hi>) rather then to the <hi>Councell</hi> of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Elders.</hi> Chriſt had more favour from <hi>Pilate</hi> a Roman Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, then from <hi>Caiaphas</hi> the Prieſt.</p>
                           <p>One word more. How can the Parliament properly be ſaid to be <hi>fully perſwaded,</hi> &amp;c. unleſſe they could freely ſigne it with a <hi>Jus divinum,</hi> or <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right?</hi> Nothing but <hi>Scripture</hi> and the <hi>Word,</hi> can properly fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade. Now if they cannot find ſo much <hi>Scripture</hi> as to warrant it for Chriſt's Goverment, how can there be a purely Goſpell-warrantable, a <hi>full perſwaſion,</hi> or <hi>faith,</hi> where there wants a <hi>word</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> to ſecure it?</p>
                           <p>And now I ſhall forme your Argument, you halfe made to my hand thus, and return another with uſury.</p>
                           <p>Your Argument is this:</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Thoſe that ſet up a Government which they cannot be fully perſwaded on, cannot but ſin.</hi>

                           <p>
                              <hi>But, the Parliament cannot be fully perſwaded of this Government:</hi>

                           <p>Some of this might have been ſpared. Let us have as much <hi>reaſon,</hi> and as little <hi>reviling</hi> as may be.

                           <p>Firſt, a <hi>truth</hi> of Government, and the <hi>eſtabliſhment</hi> of it, is but indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, unſutably, and diſproportionably proved from <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Covenants.</hi> Indeed, under the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and in the State of <hi>Iſrael, Covenants</hi> were more agreeable to the way of that Church; they were <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Worſhip</hi> then; and it was a way of <hi>obligation</hi> and <hi>engagement,</hi> fitted more to the <hi>Policie</hi> of that Nation: They were a People or Nation of <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> ſingled out from the <hi>world,</hi> and marked by a <hi>carnall Ordinance:</hi> And their <hi>Diſcipline</hi> was fitted to the <hi>whole Nation</hi> by God himſelfe; and ſo <hi>Covenants,</hi> &amp;c. gathered them up from the <hi>world</hi> into their <hi>Nationall way of Worſhip,</hi> &amp;c.

                           </p>
                           <p>And now you are to prove more then perhaps you thought on; that is, to cleare a <hi>Church-covenant,</hi> which many of your Way are againſt: for though you condemne it in ſome Churches, not of your Way; yet a <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall Church-covenant</hi> you plead for.

                           <p>To your firſt, <hi>It belongs not to the people,</hi> &amp;c. It ſeems then the <hi>people</hi> muſt be kept out from all intermedling. But I would have the people mark well what <hi>kind of Government</hi> that is that ſits upon the <hi>waters</hi> or <hi>people:</hi> I am ſure Chriſt's <hi>Government</hi> takes in the people: and being once in a <hi>Church-way,</hi> they loſe their <hi>old</hi> capacity for a <hi>new,</hi> and are raiſed up from <hi>People</hi> to <hi>Brethren, Act.</hi> 15. It is a worthy ſaying of Maſter <hi>Goodwyn</hi> and Maſter <hi>Nye,</hi> That the Clergie got the <hi>golden ball of Government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them;</hi> and I cenſure it is not much mended in the <hi>Preſbytery.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But you ſay, <hi>The people muſt be inſtructed,</hi> that is, they muſt <hi>only know</hi> that they <hi>muſt obey.</hi> But they are <hi>called,</hi> and <hi>conſulted with,</hi> and <hi>owned,</hi> as the <hi>Scripture</hi> holds forth, where ever there is any Church ſpoken of? But what though <hi>inſtructed?</hi> They are only to be <hi>inſtructed</hi> and <hi>taught</hi> that this is the <hi>Government</hi> to which they muſt ſubmit. So the <hi>people</hi> under <hi>Popery, Prelacy,</hi> &amp;c. were inſtructed, with that <hi>limitation</hi> and <hi>reſtriction.</hi> But ſhall they be thus <hi>inſtructed</hi> and <hi>taught</hi> in it? <hi>People, here is a</hi> Government <hi>which to ſome of us ſeemeth to be a</hi> Government <hi>according to the</hi> Word; <hi>take it and examine it: if you be ſo perſwaded, and that the</hi> Word <hi>holds it forth clearly, embrace it; if not, do not obey anything in</hi> blind <hi>and</hi> implicite <hi>obedience.</hi> This were faire dealing with <hi>Conſcience;</hi> thus the Churches of Chriſt had their <hi>Government</hi> among them.</p>
                           <p>To that of the <hi>peoples compliancy</hi> you ſpeak on, it is not my work here to diſpute the <hi>Intereſts</hi> of <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>People</hi> diſtinctly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>; but to make anſwer, that the complyancy and ſubmiſſion which are the <hi>duties</hi> you ſet out for
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65857:43"/>
the <hi>people,</hi> are ſuch as they may eaſily ſee the <hi>Intereſt</hi> you allow them: <hi>viz.</hi> an <hi>Intereſt</hi> of <hi>compliance</hi> only, and <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> or <hi>obedience to what is done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready</hi> not any liberty to <hi>examine and refuſe.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And when <hi>people are inſtructed,</hi> ſtill your work remaines to prove your <hi>Presbytery</hi> over <hi>Congregations,</hi> or a <hi>Church</hi> gathered out of a <hi>Church</hi> to be over a <hi>Church;</hi> which may upon the <hi>Presbytery</hi> more juſtly be recriminated then where you do ſo often recriminate, upon <hi>gathered Churches.</hi> And me thinks to me it is unreaſonable to taxe any for <hi>church-gathering,</hi> when your very <hi>Presbytery</hi> is maintained by ſuch a kind of <hi>principle.</hi> What is your <hi>Claſſicall,</hi> your <hi>Provinciall,</hi> your <hi>Nationall Presbytery,</hi> but a <hi>Church</hi> gathered out of the <hi>reſt,</hi> call it a <hi>virtuall,</hi> or <hi>repreſentative,</hi> or what you pleaſe?</p>
                           <p>For that of <hi>Meekneſſe;</hi> how meek it will prove, and how meekly they ſhall be dealt with under it, we are not to judge by any <hi>promiſes</hi> of Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but by <hi>Principles.</hi> Are the <hi>Principles</hi> ſuch as naturally bring forth <hi>Meekneſſe,</hi> or rather ſuch as inveſt the <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> with a power <hi>ſupreame</hi> and of <hi>dominion?</hi> But what if ſuch as your ſelf, and ſome other god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meek of your <hi>Way,</hi> may propound nothing but waies of <hi>meekneſſe</hi> to your ſelves? Can you undertake to ſecure the <hi>people</hi> for hereafter, and for all of the <hi>Way,</hi> and for the <hi>Way</hi> in its <hi>own nature?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>There are things of meek appearances, as the <hi>Presbytery</hi> may be, yet prove not ſo. The <hi>Lamb</hi> in the <hi>Revelation</hi> had two horns, though a Lamb. <hi>Hazael</hi> could ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                              <hi>Am I a dog, that thou ſhouldeſt think ſo harſhly of me, that I ſhould kill the children in the womb,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 8? He as little ſuſpected his own <hi>cruelty,</hi> which the Prophet foreſaw in his nature would come to paſſe as you do in your <hi>Presbytery,</hi> which ſome, ſeeing into the nature of it, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but propheſie accordingly. You know <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> began in meekneſſe, and <hi>Biſhops</hi> were brought in firſt for <hi>good</hi> and for <hi>Peace:</hi> But how proved they? <hi>Tyranny</hi> had ever a <hi>countenance</hi> of <hi>Meekneſſe</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> till it got ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Throne. So <hi>Abſolon</hi> was very faire ſpoken in the <hi>Gate;</hi> but how was he in the <hi>Throne?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>For that of my <hi>Dilemma</hi> of <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>miſery,</hi> which you ſay people ſhall not be put upon; it may be ſome in your or another <hi>Claſſis</hi> may find more <hi>meekneſſe,</hi> a ſpirit of more <hi>love</hi> and <hi>ingenuity:</hi> But what is this to the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Government,</hi> that ſome in it are well <hi>natured?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And for that of <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>miſery;</hi> ſurely if the <hi>Presbytery</hi> be ſet on with power, many a one will be in that <hi>ſnare,</hi> partly in <hi>feare,</hi> and partly in an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie <hi>complyancy:</hi> For there are whole <hi>Pariſhes</hi> and <hi>Counties</hi> of this <hi>conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> And you your ſelf ſay, The <hi>wilfully weak</hi> muſt have the <hi>rod.</hi> And who will this be? Such as are ſo in the judgement and interpretation of the <hi>Claſſis?</hi> or how? I would this were well cleared.</p>
                           <p>And for your Scriptures of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 21. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25. <hi>Shall I come to you with a rod,</hi> &amp;c. and in <hi>meekneſſe inſtructing,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are full <hi>Scriptures</hi> for

We know the Kingdoms of <hi>Scotland</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands</hi> take their Tythes to maintain their wars, and will not let their preachers live by decimation, bur by penſion. And methinks you that profeſſe ingenuity, ſhould be ſo candid to diſtinguiſh where you ſee I diſtinguiſh, and not to <hi>force</hi> on conſtructions of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which neither any thing of <hi>mine</hi> nor the Covenant will beare.</p>

                           <p>To your firſt, <hi>That inſtructions muſt go before,</hi> I have anſwered to this before, as you expounded it before: One word more will ſuffice. What kind of <hi>inſtruction</hi> is it you mean, but <hi>authoritative compulſive inſtruction,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Schoolmaſters,</hi> even your own inſtance, and here moſt pertinent, who teaches and whips every one of <hi>thoſe</hi> that will not <hi>underſtand as well as he?</hi> Something an <hi>unreaſonable</hi> way of <hi>correction</hi> in matters of <hi>pure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe</hi> and <hi>conſcience,</hi> and beſt amongſt boys, as your inſtance implies: Men of <hi>Scripture-conſciences</hi> cannot beare it.</p>
                           <p>And for that you ſay <hi>it makes againſt Doctrine as well as Diſcipline:</hi> Yea, in ſome ſort it is granted; for neither <hi>Doctrine</hi> nor <hi>Diſcipline</hi> ought to be forced but in a <hi>Goſpell-way.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And for that you ſay <hi>it makes againſt the Parliament, becauſe they make Statutes:</hi> I anſwer, Nothing makes againſt a <hi>Legiſlative</hi> power, which reduces it to <hi>ruder,</hi> and <hi>clearer,</hi> and <hi>free<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              </hi> Principles. And thus the Parliament very juſtly argues in all their Remonſtrances touching the <hi>King,</hi> while they go about to reduce him to his <hi>juſt</hi> Rights, from thoſe exorbitances he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers himſelfe to be brought into.

                           <p>To your firſt, <hi>That the fault was in the choyce of a wrong Government,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer: That is the feare now, leaſt there ſhould be a choyce of a wrong Government, and ſo the ſame fault ſhould be committed again: And this very Government hath no <hi>Image of Divine Right</hi> upon it, nor hath it warrant in all things from the <hi>Word,</hi> as your ſelf acknowledge.</p>
                           <p>To your ſecond: <hi>That Doctrine and Diſcipline go together,</hi> &amp;c. Yea, <hi>pure Doctrine</hi> and <hi>pure Diſcipline</hi> go rightly together; and if either be impure or unſound, there is ſo much the more danger: So as this is an Argument rather againſt you, becauſe where Doctrine opens the conſcience, and lets in any thing of Diſcipline but that of the pure Word, there is one evill on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mended with another.</p>
                           <p>And for your inſtance of a <hi>Schoolmaſter,</hi> who both teaches and corrects: You know we are not to <hi>prove</hi> but to <hi>illuſtrate</hi> by ſimilitudes: And that of a Schoolmaſter is a fitter illuſtration for the <hi>Pedagogie</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and that Diſcipline then the Goſpels: You know the Apoſtle uſes it only to <hi>that; The Law was our Schoolmaſter,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.</p>
                           <p>To that of your deſcription of the Government, <hi>that it is a curb, a goad,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer; There is nothing you ſay of Government in theſe words, but may be ſaid of any civill Government, nay, of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> when it was in its primitive form. But that only which you ought to ſay, and that which only differences it from all deviſed forms of men, as your Covenant binds you, and ought to be your only reaſon for erecting and ſetting it up, is this: Is it the Scriptures form or model? Is the people ſo in the exerciſe and capacity of it as in the Goſpell times? If ſo, then you prove ſomething. And further: All this you ſay is true in a kind too of Chriſts Government; but yet, in ſome ſort communicable with deviſed Governments. The only diſtinguiſhing and eſſentiall marks are not to be a curb and goad, but the Scriptures <hi>only mark</hi> and <hi>image,</hi> and ſome <hi>ſpirituall operations,</hi> &amp;c. which no other deviſed form of man hath.</p>
                           <p>To your other, of <hi>the bleſſings and bleſſed fruits in</hi> Scotland <hi>that there is no Hereſie nor Schiſm there,</hi> Let Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> (our learned and pious
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65857:45"/>
Brother) ſpeak for us both, from his experiences. And for that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> time will ſhew whether it will prove to be a bleſſing or no, to want that which you call <hi>Hereſie</hi> or <hi>Schiſm.</hi> Surely to be free from Hereſie and Schiſm, in a Scripture ſenſe, it is ſuch a bleſſing as the whole Goſpell can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not patern. What? No Hereſie in a whole Kingdom? No Schiſm in a whole Kingdom? Never ſuch a pure Church heard on? <hi>Corinth, Epheſus, Coloſſe, Jeruſalem, Antioch,</hi> all not comparable? The worſt I wiſh our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren there, is, that all were ſo pure as we heare on. Indeed <hi>Scotland</hi> had the honour to awaken us firſt in the work of <hi>Reformation</hi> and <hi>Liberty;</hi> but leſt <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould be puffed up, <hi>England</hi> ſhall have the glory (I hope) to improve that liberty to a fuller light, which ſome would cloſe up too ſoon, in the narrowneſſe of a Presbytery.</p>
                           <p>Methinks there is ſomething of this nature conſiderable in the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi> who though they follow the firſt Light in <hi>Germany,</hi> yet the Lord hath ſuffered them to ſtick there without a fuller Reformation, that the firſt may be laſt, and the laſt be firſt; For if a State be covenanted ſo cloſe to the Word, they had need be favourable and free to all that are accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly covenanted; for each mans conſcience is the Interpreter in himſelf of what makes for or againſt the Covenant he takes; and by this very Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, you are all to be tender to conſciences, becauſe the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> (not power of <hi>men</hi>) can intterpret the Will of God; but in their <hi>civill</hi> and <hi>prudentiall</hi> things only, they may interpret <hi>themſelves.</hi>

                           <hi>There is great diſproportion of times. Men were then converted from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm, and while they were ſo, they were uncapable.

                           <p>To that of the <hi>diſproportion</hi> (you ſpeak on) <hi>of times, and converſion,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer:</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="40" facs="tcp:65857:46"/>The Apoſtle's and Primitive times are the times we are to looke at for a <hi>patern</hi> and <hi>modell.</hi> 'Tis true, there is great diſproportion; for they were Apoſtles who gave the government then; yet are but private Divines, as you ſay by me, if you be compared with them.</p>
                           <p>For that of the <hi>converſion from Paganiſm to Chriſtianity:</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>There is no ſuch diſproportion there neither, but that very proportion which our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath himſelf foretold, and ſet forth: For how doth a <hi>Iewiſh</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian State</hi> differ? Nay, how doth a <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> or <hi>Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> State, differ from an <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> or <hi>Parochiall</hi> State, as <hi>Parochiall</hi> or <hi>Pariſh</hi> is in that notion? Chriſt hath put them that are out of the Church under that very <hi>notion, Matth.</hi> 19. 17. and the <hi>ſpirit</hi> in the <hi>Revelation</hi> makes the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> State to be as unlawfull as a <hi>Paganiſh,</hi> and cals out equally from that as from the other, as by comparing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 4. toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will appeare.</p>
                           <p>So, as ſpeaking of things and notions, I cannot but ſpeake in a Scripture way nor am I uncharitable in this neither, though I thus ſpeak; I looke on thouſands in this State as godly beleevers: It is not the Paſtors I write againſt, but the way. There may be a <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court; a <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in <hi>Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>So as <hi>government</hi> and <hi>diſcipline</hi> is a <hi>Churches right,</hi> and <hi>priviledge,</hi> not the <hi>worlds</hi> and <hi>Nations priviledges,</hi> as ſo and then.

                           <p>I agree with you, and here the controverſie might be ended: If your Temples ſhall be of <hi>living ſtones,</hi> the controverſie is granted: But becauſe I will not ſeem to miſtake you, I beleeve the <hi>ſpirituall building</hi> you mean, and I, are not the ſame here: You mean as it appears, the <hi>inviſible ſpirituall,</hi> or <hi>Church myſticall;</hi> and yet <hi>there,</hi> all is not ſo <hi>Homogeneall,</hi> and of the ſame kind neither: The <hi>head</hi> of the body is <hi>both God and man,</hi> and one <hi>member</hi> like one <hi>ſtar</hi> differs from <hi>another</hi> in <hi>glory.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But, we are ſpeaking of the <hi>ſpirituall building</hi> or <hi>Church</hi> here, which is the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> above; and as that is of <hi>true, reall, eſſentially ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall living ſtones:</hi> ſo the <hi>Church below</hi> is to conſiſt at leaſt of ſuch as <hi>viſibly</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> appeare ſo; and therefore the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> cals them in his Epiſtles <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>called to be Saints.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And to that <hi>of your peeces of Rubbiſh in the materiall building:</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It is true; But what is that to <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple, which my compariſon drives up to? How much <hi>Rubbiſh</hi> can you prove in that type, nay, <hi>ſquare ſtones, pure Cedar, gold,</hi> &amp;c. to figure out the <hi>Goſpell-building</hi> or <hi>Temple,</hi> as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. So as your rubbiſh is only in your owne alluſion, not in mine.</p>

                           <p>It muſt be then only ſuch a <hi>building</hi> as the <hi>materiall one</hi> you ſpeake on, which is made up of <hi>rubbiſh</hi> and <hi>broken peeces:</hi> and if that be according to<note place="margin">1 Cor. 19. Eph 2. 19, 20, 21, 22.</note>

                           <p>And for their ſubmitting indeed, there is a <hi>nationall, blinde, traditionall</hi> obedience in them, I cannot call it <hi>Goſpell ſubmiſſion.</hi>

                           <p>Nor do we ſtand ſo for the firſt poliſhing as you pretend.

                           <p>Every thing of Chriſt's bears the Image of Chriſt.

                           <p>And thus with much ado, you only prove them to be as I intended them, no <hi>Commandements</hi> for the <hi>mixed</hi> and <hi>unregenerate,</hi> or in a word, <hi>Chriſts go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> no <hi>Nationall government.</hi>

                           <p>All your proof reaches but to this:</p>

                           <p n="1">1. To that of <hi>Gods Church</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> before his <hi>Word,</hi> &amp;c. which you would inſinuate as ſome advantage to your <hi>ſerling,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>What is that to Gods <hi>diſpenſation</hi> now, if there wanted a <hi>Word,</hi> there was a <hi>ſupplement</hi> of <hi>viſion</hi> and <hi>dreams,</hi> &amp;c. And I hope you will not goe before the <hi>Law,</hi> ſo much as you doe for a <hi>Patern:</hi> You goe too far when you goe to the <hi>times</hi> of the <hi>Law:</hi> You <hi>have a Prophet now to hear</hi> in all things, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 22</p>
                           <p n="2">2. To that of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> to be <hi>delayed as well as Government</hi> from <hi>Chriſts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample:</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I cannot diſpute that here. Maſter <hi>Tomes</hi> will ſatisfie you at large in his learned <hi>Examen,</hi> where he hath made work for a whole Aſſembly; That he knowes not but it may be delayed till they be of years.</p>
                           <p>But, to anſwer you in your ſcope:</p>
                           <p>You bring this to prove, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not to be imitated in all things. I grant it. But what is that to prove that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſetled not his <hi>Government</hi> when he began his <hi>Miniſtery,</hi> or <hi>Iohns?</hi> For the buſineſſe on your part is to find out, either that the <hi>Government</hi> was ſetled before, or with the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,</hi> or there was as much <hi>neceſſity</hi> of it as of the <hi>Word;</hi> but for ſome <hi>reaſon,</hi> and not from any <hi>thing</hi> in the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Government,</hi> but ſome other <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſicall reaſon</hi> it was delayed: Which ought not to take <hi>place</hi> now.</p>
                           <p>And this is yet to prove; all your <hi>proof</hi> ſummed up, reaches not to this.</p>
                           <p>But you imply, <hi>The will of God in his diſpenſations was the cauſe:</hi> But the <hi>will</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in his diſpenſations carries a <hi>rule</hi> of <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> along with it, and of <hi>ſpirituall reaſon.</hi> And in <hi>Goſpell</hi> diſpenſations and <hi>extrinſicall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi> will, you will find a <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>golden reed</hi> of <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring the <hi>Temple;</hi> and every <hi>diſpenſation,</hi> and even this of ſuſpending <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> hath its <hi>rule</hi> in the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> that a <hi>word of obedience</hi> muſt precede and go before a <hi>forme of obedience,</hi> and a <hi>word</hi> of faith before the obedience <hi>of faith,</hi> and <hi>living ſtones</hi> before a <hi>living Temple.</hi>

                              <hi>To that of many heightning their ſpirits into contempt.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Do not aggravate againſt your Brethren; remember your own profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ingenuity, in theſe words, <hi>I would not excite Authority to needleſſe ſeveritie.</hi>

                           <p>To that of the <hi>Brethrens politike advantage on your ſlow pace, and amica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble carriage,</hi> as you ſay.</p>
                           <p>Give not over your amicableneſſe for that, their <hi>policie</hi> is no warrant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your <hi>dutie;</hi> and if they be <hi>politike,</hi> blame them in print: For my part, I hate to ſee in any too much of <hi>man</hi> in the buſineſſe of <hi>God;</hi> but if ſome of the Brethren be <hi>politike,</hi> what is that to the reſt, who waite for the Spirit in the ſimplicity of their <hi>own?</hi>

                           <p>To that of your <hi>fire and drie wood, and that your ſetling a Government would be no bellows.</hi>

                           <p>I dare not beleeve your Hiſtorian, nor take all againſt them from the Pen of an enemie.

                           </p>
                           <p>Yea go on, take theſe offended Brethren, theſe Caſtles, in your military way; but then, let your Warfare be ſpirituall, your weapons not carnall put on the armour of <hi>light,</hi> &amp;c. and take them by a <hi>Goſpel-ſiege,</hi> and we are ſatisfied.</p>

                           <p>You ſay, <hi>The difference is not ſo equall, but betwixt government and no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; Parliament and all Orthodox Divines againſt an inconſiderable party.</hi>

                           <p>You ſay firſt, <hi>Why begin I for Hereticks and Schiſmaticks from</hi> John's <hi>firſt Sermon?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I begin there, becauſe there began the <hi>myſtery</hi> of the <hi>Goſpell.</hi> And yet I ſhew you that no <hi>Government</hi> began with that <hi>Goſpell manifeſtation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              </hi> by which I made appeare, that if Government had been of ſuch <hi>morall neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> why was it not <hi>given out</hi> with the Goſpels firſt <hi>giving out.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now you prove in a <hi>chronologicall</hi> diſcourſe the ſpace of <hi>time</hi> from <hi>Johns Sermon</hi> to <hi>Pauls Epiſtle,</hi> to make the <hi>time</hi> appeare for <hi>Government.</hi> And, after you have ſummed up all the <hi>time</hi> and <hi>periods,</hi> and find it no two or three <hi>yeers</hi> work, you conclude People of that age could not be ſo eaſily gathered as now: Nor the <hi>long eſtabliſhing</hi> then to be an <hi>haſty eſtabliſhing</hi> now.</p>
                           <p>And now, after all this <hi>diſcourſe</hi> and <hi>ravellings</hi> out of <hi>time</hi> from <hi>Johns Sermon,</hi> &amp;c. What have you gained? Not that the <hi>Government</hi> was ſoon ſetled. Then you have proved (much to my advantage, and in a clearer and fuller computation then I did) the <hi>contrary.</hi> So as you have only been taking ſome <hi>learned paines,</hi> if you well obſerve, and the <hi>Reader</hi> well
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65857:57"/>
obſerve you, to prove that the <hi>Government</hi> at firſt was not ſuddenly caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>modell,</hi> nor <hi>brought forth</hi> in <hi>practiſe,</hi> which is the very thing <hi>I</hi> aimed at; and truly your pains in it have been more exact then mine; and I thank you for it.</p>
                           <p>But you ſay, <hi>It ought not to be ſo now; nor can it be ſaid to be haſtily done now, that was done ſo long ago.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>You ſay true in that: But you know the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> muſt <hi>reveale</hi> it that <hi>formed</hi> it; and it formed it at firſt by <hi>degrees:</hi> and the way of <hi>Revelation</hi> hath been more <hi>year's</hi> then the firſt <hi>farming;</hi> reckon but your <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> years as exactly as you have done your firſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Primitive</hi> yeares, and you may be more ſatisfied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So as all, both the firſt <hi>Revelation</hi> of it from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, and the latter from <hi>Antichriſtianiſm,</hi> makes all for the not haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which I aimed at.</p>
                           <p>Indeed, if you can as infallibly aſſure us this <hi>forme</hi> and <hi>modell</hi> is the very <hi>forme</hi> then given out, it were very true that you ſay, <hi>That it cannot be ſaid to be haſtily done now, what was done ſo long agoe:</hi> viz. <hi>If it be that very one which was done ſo long ago.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>For your exception againſt me concerning my placing the <hi>giving</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> ſo late, if you interpret <hi>ſenſe</hi> by the ſtrict order of <hi>words,</hi> you will loſe many a Scripture truth in the words, as you well know.</p>

In things doubtfull, conſcience hath refuge to the ſureſt ſide: Now its granted by all, and not controverted by any, that in the Apoſtolike Church, the government of the Church of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament was in the hands of Apoſtles, Paſtors, Teachers; and therefore Conſcience would ſway to that in which there can be no Error, except on ſuppoſall of abuſe; and Chriſtian Rulers would not doe well to venture upon Eternity, wrath, the judgement to come; confiding on the poore plea of an <hi>Eraſtian</hi> diſtinction, to incroach upon the Prerogative Royall of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>Their Congregations Pariſhionall, and of politick conſtitution; not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall, according to Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Their way of conſtituting this preſent Presbytery extraordinary, by ſuch an Aſſembly, without precept or example for ſuch a Way in the whole New Teſtament, from whence the whole Order of that diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation ought to be framed, and not from the Law, or Old Teſtament, or<note place="margin">See the <hi>humble Advice,</hi> &amp;c. of the Aſſembly in manuſ.</note> ſome caſes of neceſſity in the State or Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by way of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, as they ſay in their Modell to the Parliament.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Primitive Elders</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were qualified immediately from the Spirit with <hi>gifts</hi> proper to ſuch a Miniſtration; which theſe <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> being not, but moſt by gifts, and habits of Art and Science ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by induſtry; therefore theſe preſent <hi>Presbyters</hi> cannot challenge the ſame power for <hi>Church-Cenſures,</hi> without the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> gifting them, and <hi>anointing them</hi> to ſuch a <hi>power</hi> and <hi>adminiſtration</hi> in the <hi>Church;</hi> but ought to be content meerly with a <hi>mixed</hi> and partly prudentiall <hi>power,</hi> becauſe of the mixture of their anointing and gifts, if they will needs

have ſuch a Government ſet up for <hi>Chriſt's,</hi> which is not all <hi>Chriſts,</hi> and moſt of that <hi>all</hi> very queſtionable whether of <hi>Chriſt</hi> or <hi>no.</hi>

                  <p>For all their proofs alleadged from <hi>Scripture</hi> for the <hi>Presbytery</hi> by <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> or of ſuch <hi>Presbyters</hi> as were ordained either by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> or by a power from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or from ſuch who in that power received from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> did <hi>ordaine,</hi> or by a <hi>power</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Congregation</hi> preceding ſuch a <hi>power,</hi> and accompanying ſuch a <hi>power:</hi> Now this preſent <hi>Presbytery</hi> can neither make it ſelfe appeare to be ſo purely <hi>ordained,</hi> nor have they the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Congregationall power</hi> ſo preceding or accompanying ſuch an <hi>Ordination;</hi> nor is that act of <hi>Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands</hi> by which their <hi>preſent Presbyters</hi> ſtand Miniſters, a meere ſigne of ſetting apart, or meerly ſignificative, but an <hi>Inſtitution</hi> for <hi>gifts</hi> to be conferred: under the <hi>Law,</hi> it was an empty and bare Rite; but under the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> it cannot be proved to be ſuch an empty Rite; <hi>Goſpell</hi>-ſignes being but <hi>few full,</hi> and <hi>miniſteriall</hi> to the <hi>ſpirit;</hi> not meerly <hi>ſignificatively-viſible,</hi> as the <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> and <hi>Rites</hi> under the <hi>Law</hi> were. So as all being thus queſtionable ſtill in this <hi>preſent Presbytery;</hi> how can they ſo <hi>Apoſtolically</hi> challenge ſuch a <hi>Divine Right,</hi> their preſent <hi>conſtitutions</hi> being <hi>mixt, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable, fallible,</hi> not one and the ſame with that <hi>primitive, pure, certaine conſtitutions</hi> and <hi>practices?</hi>

And ſo how proportionable a power

THey are no ſuch Presbyters of Jeſus Chriſt as the firſt were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ordained by an Antichriſtian power of Biſhops; nor were Biſhops true Presbyteres, nor thoſe who joyned with them in their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation who were made by them, nor is there any ſucceſſion of Ordination, but it implies both a Perpetuall Viſible Church, and a true Church Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Ordinances under Antichriſt, which all are to be proved by them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If there were any ſuch true Church inviſible under Antichriſt, to which they ſucceed in their Miniſtery, then it muſt appeare that they ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed that very inviſible Church, and that that very inviſible Church had a true Miniſtery or Presbytery in it; for men may be Saints, or good men,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65857:89"/>
yet not good Presbyters, or Miniſterially ſent.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As they now in their practice will not account any for true Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters but ſuch who can prove to them their perſonall Ordination from them, ſo we demand of theſe Presbyters an account of their perſonall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion accordingly, which perſonall ſucceſſion if it be falſe and interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any where in the Line, muſt needs be all falſe, from ſuch a point where the firſt interruption was made.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Though Chriſts promiſe is enough to ground a perpetuity of Church and Chriſts preſence, yet not of his promiſe made good to ſuch particular men, or to their pretended ſucceſſion.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. They that challenge a Divine Right to the power they act by, muſt act by a gift as Divine and infallible as their right and power, and thus did the primitive Presbyters and Elders; therefore the gift being but mixt, their right or power is but mixt accordingly, and not Divine.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. They who were Elders or Presbyters in the firſt Churches, as <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> &amp;c. were gifted by a ſpirit which taught the very infallible Word which is now written or Scripture, and ſo they then did conſtitute, adviſe, counſell in the place of this written Word; and all Scripture Formes and Inſtitutions were then in the gift, and perſons; but no ſuch thing can be ſaid of any Elderſhip or Presbytery of men now.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. They who ſet up an Elderſhip or Presbytery now of Divine Right, to conſtitute, ordaine, counſell, &amp;c. do joyne to the Word written, or infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Scripture, a Power leſſe infallibly gifted, who by ſuch a Divine Right and Power pretended, ſhall controle the Word of Truth, by Interpretations of that Word leſſe then Truth, which is not conſiſtent with the glory of the Word.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. There is no Elderſhip or Presbytery in Scripture, but either the Churches Act did precede it, act it, or accompany it, by precept or practice, which makes the Divine Right of the Presbytery queſtionable, uncertain, unſafe, becauſe of a contrary Scripture, and Precept.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The Elderſhip and Presbytery which are brought for inſtances, are queſtionable; firſt for the Perſons, who were not ſuch very Presbyters as they would imply, but Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, &amp;c. or otherwiſe ordained, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Apoſtles or Church, or otherwiſe gifted by ſpeciall unction, or elſe an Elderſhip of eminency, not of Office.</p>

                     <p>To the 2. Is Presbytery, becauſe Parochiall, Claſſicall, Provinciall. leſſe Tyrannicall then Epiſcopall, becauſe many rule in that, and in this but one? or rather not more Tyrannicall, becauſe one Tyrant is not ſo much as many together?

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65857:94"/>
your Elderſhip and Presbytery, how little or large ſoever, over the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Congregations? Independent upon the Magiſtrate, coercive to all that beleeve not as they beleeve, as to <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks?</hi> And yet men are not convinced, nor is Magiſtracy or Chriſtian liberty ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as you ſay: let both the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> judge, who in the mean time you would be <hi>Iudges</hi> over.</p>
                     <p>To the 4. For my <hi>reſtoring of Tythes,</hi> now unlawfull to me; I have done it; I have returned to the State my property of a full yeers Arrearage: nor did I take Tythes ſince I was in <hi>Kent,</hi> but the peoples free compoſition from the firſt, and being even convinced againſt that too, a yeere ſince, I forbore it. But take heed how you put forgiveneſſe of <hi>ſin</hi> upon <hi>reſtitution;</hi> for that is not only <hi>Popery,</hi> but like the <hi>Pope</hi> you would <hi>ſell Pardons</hi> only to the <hi>rich,</hi> and none to the <hi>poore;</hi> and you would put more upon <hi>Sacrifice</hi> then upon <hi>Mercy.</hi>

Indeed, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is a more eaſie adverſary, becauſe he oppoſes the <hi>Truth;</hi> and I, though a <hi>weake one,</hi> may be more conſiderable, becauſe <hi>Truth</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends me, rather then I the <hi>Truth:</hi> for I will rather make <hi>it</hi> my <hi>Champion,</hi> then <hi>my ſelfe a Champion</hi> for <hi>it.</hi> And for my <hi>new-ſprung Notions</hi> (as you ſay) call <hi>Truth Notion,</hi> or <hi>new,</hi> or what you will; you can never call it out of its own <hi>nature</hi> or <hi>eſſence:</hi> And <hi>Truth</hi> is Gods own Notion; neither <hi>mine</hi> nor <hi>yours:</hi> and <hi>new</hi> only to the <hi>old man,</hi> not to <hi>him</hi> who after <hi>God is created in</hi>

                     <p>To the 8. Nor am Ileſſe a <hi>Diſputant</hi> in <hi>Divinity,</hi> becauſe againſt <hi>Forms of Art</hi> and <hi>Logick</hi> (as you ſay) I may diſpute in Chriſts Schoole, though refuſed in the <hi>Schoole</hi> of <hi>Tyrannus.</hi> And if you will challenge me in any poynt of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> I ſhall not refuſe you <hi>there</hi> in <hi>Logick</hi> or <hi>Forms of Art.</hi> They are Forms only for the wiſdom of men, not the wiſdom of God.

and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Free-grace? It is not the Free-grace of any of theſe: Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace is of God in Jeſus Chriſt; Prophets and Apoſtles are but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencers of it, and Ambaſſadours of it, and Miniſters of it; and yet Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours not in the ſame habit: The <hi>Prophets</hi> preached Grace in a <hi>rough</hi> and <hi>hairy</hi> garment, or, more <hi>Legally;</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in a more <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>bright</hi> habit, in the <hi>revelation</hi> of the <hi>myſtery</hi> of <hi>Chriſt: The Law was given by Moſes, but Grace and Truth by Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> I could as eaſily ſay, Maſter <hi>Gatakers Free-grace,</hi> and the <hi>Legalists Free-grace,</hi> as he ſayes <hi>Our Antinomian Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace;</hi> but ſuch <hi>words</hi> and <hi>reproaches</hi> make neither <hi>you</hi> nor <hi>I</hi> ſpeake <hi>better truth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To your Second, That <hi>in ſaying the Old. Teſtament ſtraine was rather Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall then Goſpell, taxes the Miniſtery of the Prophets for no Free-grace:</hi> That is according to your Inference only. Becauſe the <hi>Spirit</hi> ſayes, the <hi>Law was given by Moſes,</hi> therefore will you put upon the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi> taught or gave out nothing but <hi>Law?</hi> Becauſe I ſay, <hi>The Old Teſtament was a Legall miniſtration,</hi> therefore do I ſay there was no Free-grace in it? or doe I not rather ſay, Therefore it was Free-grace legally diſpenced, or preached, or miniſtred? Would not ſuch Inferences be bad dealing with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and will it be faire dealing with me? I wonder you who pretend to write againſt me, as having not dealt <hi>juſtly</hi> with your ſenſe, will deale ſo <hi>unjuſtly</hi> with mine, and commit the ſame <hi>ſin</hi> your ſelf, in the very time of your reproving mine. You may ſee what this <hi>Logick</hi> hath brought you to, To deceive your ſelfe, as well as your neighbour. Can you caſt out my mote, and behold, a beame in your own eye?</p>
                        <p>I have printed all you quoted: let the Reader judge from this and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with the reſt of my Book.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The whole frame of the Old Teſtament was a draught of Gods anger at ſin.—And God in this time of the Law appeared only as it were upon tearmes and conditions of reconciltation: and all the Worſhip then, and acts of Worſhip then, as of Prayer, Faſting, Repentance,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>went all this way, according to God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that appearance. And in this ſtraine</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>runnes all the Miniſtery of the Prophets too, in their exhortations to Duty and Worſhip, as if God were to be appeaſed and entreated, and reconciled, and his love to be had in way of purchaſe by Duty, and Doing, and Worſhipping: So as under the Law, the efficacy and power was put as it were wholly upon the Duty and Obedience performed, as if God upon the doing of ſuch things, was to be brought into tearmes of peace, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and forgiveneſſe; ſo as their courſe and ſervice then, was as it were a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for life and reconciliation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Do not theſe words and termes inſerted, <hi>As it were,</hi> and, <hi>in the way,</hi> and, <hi>as if,</hi> and, <hi>is it were,</hi> cleare me from ſuch poſitive and excluſive aſſertions of <hi>Free-Grace</hi> as you would make me ſpeak?</p>
                        <p>To the Third, That <hi>in ſaying the Preachers with their qualifications over-heate</hi>
                           <pb n="132" facs="tcp:65857:106"/>
                           <hi>Free-grace, I doe by that make the Prophets deluders of the people,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer: That way of preaching the Prophets uſed, preſſing, as you ſay, Repentance, Reformation, Humiliation, and with Commination, and the Law, &amp;c. was but according to the way, and method, and ſtraine the <hi>Spirit</hi> taught them under the <hi>Old Teſtament:</hi> but if the <hi>Prophets</hi> ſhould have held forth Jeſus Chriſt under the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and when Chriſt was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the <hi>fleſh,</hi> with ſuch <hi>vails</hi> over him, and ſo much <hi>Law</hi> over him, as they did before, they had ſinned againſt the <hi>glory</hi> of that <hi>miniſtration,</hi> as well as ſome of you, who bring Chriſt back againe under the cool ſhadow of the <hi>Law,</hi> and make that <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſſe</hi> that he warmes not ſo many with the <hi>love</hi> of him as he would doe, if ye would let them behold with open face as in a glaſſe the glory of the Lord, and if you would give his <hi>beams</hi> more liberty to ſhine upon them; doth not the <hi>miniſtration of the Spirit exceed in glory?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nor were the Prophets <hi>deluders of the people then,</hi> becauſe it was the peoples time of <hi>Pupillage,</hi> and being under <hi>Bondage;</hi> they <hi>were ſhut up under the Law till faith came;</hi> they were under <hi>Tutors</hi> and <hi>Governors till the time appointed:</hi> So as that was <hi>truth,</hi> and right diſpenſation in them to preach ſo much of the <hi>Law,</hi> of <hi>curſe,</hi> and <hi>judgement, &amp;c.</hi> as they did; and of <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> and <hi>Reformation</hi> in that ſtraine they did: But in ye who pretend to preach <hi>Chriſt come in the fleſh;</hi> ye who pretend to be <hi>Preachers in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God,</hi> and ſo greater then the greateſt <hi>Prophet,</hi> then he that was more then a <hi>Prophet;</hi> in ye, ſuch preaching were deluſion, becauſe it were not as the truth is in Chriſt, nor according to that <hi>glory</hi> of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> to that <hi>grace revealed,</hi> to that <hi>manifeſtation of Chriſt in the fleſh,</hi> to that <hi>miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of glory;</hi> but rather to thoſe <hi>deceitfull workers</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks on, to thoſe that <hi>troubled them with words, ſubverting their ſouls,</hi> who preached <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpell, Circumciſion</hi> and <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

                        <p>To your firſt, for our <hi>girding at thoſe that bid men repent, and be humbled,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as Legall teachers:</hi> If ye preſſe <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>humiliation</hi> legally, why wonder ye at ſuch words as <hi>Legall teachers?</hi> Will ye doe ill, and not be told of your faults? muſt we propheſie ſmooth things to you, and ſay ye are able Miniſters of the New Teſtament, when we are perſwaded that truth is detained in unrighteouſneſſe? We blame not any that bid men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, or be ſorry for ſinne, &amp;c. be humble, &amp;c. if they preach them as Chriſt

and the Apoſtles did; as <hi>graces</hi> flowing from <hi>him,</hi> and out of his <hi>fulneſſe,</hi> and not as ſpringings of their owne, and <hi>waters</hi> from their fountaines; as if the teachers, like <hi>Moſes,</hi> would make men beleeve they could with ſuch Rods and exhortations, ſmite upon mens hearts as upon rocks, and bring waters out of them, be they never ſo hard and ſtony. We agree with you, that <hi>repentance,</hi> and <hi>ſorrow for ſinne,</hi> and <hi>humiliation,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-deniall,</hi> are all to be preached, and ſhall contend with you, who preaches them moſt, and cleareſt: but then, becauſe <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaid Repent, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid Repent, and <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid Repent; are we to examine the Myſtery no farther? Know we not that the whole Scripture in its fulneſſe and integrality reveales the whole truth? and muſt we not looke out, and compare Scripture with Scripture, ſpirituall things with ſpirituall, and ſo finding out truth from the degrees, to the glory and fulneſſe of it, preach it in the ſame glory and fulneſſe as we find it? We heare Chriſt preaching before the Spirit was given, <hi>Repent;</hi> and we find, when the Spirit was given, Chriſt is ſaid to give <hi>Repentance</hi> to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>forgiveneſſe of ſinnes;</hi> and ſhall we not now preach Jeſus Chriſt, and Repentance in Jeſus Chriſt the fountaine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, the author of repentance, and yet preach repentance, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance thus, and repentance in the glory of it more? The Apoſtle in one place ſaith, <hi>Beleeve in the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved;</hi> and in another place, <hi>He is the author and finiſher of our Faith;</hi> Shall we not now preach <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> firſt? and <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> the <hi>fountaine,</hi> and <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> the <hi>author</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>beleeivng,</hi> and yet preach <hi>faith;</hi> yea and thus preach <hi>faith,</hi> faith in the <hi>glory,</hi> faith in the <hi>revelation</hi> of it, faith from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and faith in <hi>Chriſt?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>One Scripture tels us <hi>godly ſorrow worketh repentance to ſalvation, &amp;c.</hi> And another tels us, <hi>They ſhall look on him whom they have peirced, and they ſhall mourne for him, &amp;c.</hi> Shall we not now preach <hi>ſorrow for ſin</hi> took from <hi>Chriſt, Chriſt</hi> piercing, and wounding, and melting the heart; Chriſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering ſin, and <hi>powring water</hi> upon drie ground? this is ſorrow for ſin in the glory of the Goſpell.</p>
                        <p>One Scripture bids, <hi>He that will follow me, let him deny himſelfe, and take up his croſſe.</hi> Another ſaith, It is <hi>he that worketh in us both to will and to do of his good pleaſure,</hi> and <hi>I am able to do all things through Chriſt that ſtrenghneth me.</hi> Shall we not now preach <hi>Chriſt</hi> our ſtrength, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> our ſelfe-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all? and is not this <hi>ſelfe-denyall</hi> in the <hi>glory</hi> of the Goſpell?</p>
                        <p>So as the difference betwixt us is this; Ye preach Chriſt and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and the graces of the Spirit in the parts as ye find it: we dare not ſpeak the myſtery ſo in peices, ſo in halfe and quarter revealings; we ſee ſuch preaching anſwers not the <hi>fulneſſe</hi> of the Myſtery, the <hi>riches</hi> of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> the <hi>glory</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament:</hi> We find that in the fulneſſe of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> Chriſt is ſet up as a Prince, as a King, as a Lord, as a

crown and glory to every grace and gift: nay, he is made not only <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,</hi> but <hi>ſanctification</hi> too; and ſo we preach him. Whereas to preach his riches without him, his graces by themſelves ſingle, and private; as, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> and <hi>beleevs,</hi> and <hi>be humbled,</hi> and <hi>deny your ſelves,</hi> ye make the gifts loſe much of their glory; Chriſt of his praiſe, and the Goſpell of its fulneſſe.</p>

                        <p>To the firſt, That <hi>the Independents confeſſe you a true Chruch and Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> You are not to prove what others confeſſe or hold you to be, but what you are indeed, according to <hi>Truth.</hi> Nor do I contend with thoſe that hold you ſo, but with <hi>you</hi> that hold <hi>your ſelves</hi> ſo; as the Spirit to the <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diceans; Thou ſayeſt thou art full,</hi> &amp;c. and, <hi>behold, thou art poore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>To the ſecond, That <hi>they ordained by Biſhops, are true Miniſters as the Independents, and I a Preacher, for all that Ordination.</hi> If you meane that the Biſhops Ordination makes not one for ever a falſe or Antichriſtian Miniſter, I grant it, becauſe it is no marke to them that renounce it: <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> is no more <hi>Babylon</hi> to them that are gone out of it. But what is this to your Miniſtery or Ordination, who are yet under the Marke and Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Ordination? Renounce it, come out as the Spirit cals ye, and then your being <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> is no more to ye, then to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> that they ſhould be leſſe <hi>light</hi> becauſe they were once <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> or leſſe alive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were once dead.</p>
                        <p>To the third, That <hi>Succeſſion is not neceſſary to a true Miniſtery,</hi> It is both true, and falſe, in ſeverall acceptions. When there was a true power, they ordained others, and others them. There was ſucceſſion. But that
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65857:112"/>
being loſt under Antichriſt, ſo far as viſibly to derive it to us, there can be no ſuch true viſible Succeſſion appearing. And yet you that pretend to ſtand by the firſt power, muſt prove your Succeſſion, if you will prove your power.</p>
                        <p>To the Fourth: <hi>If no true Miniſtery, no true Baptiſm.</hi> For that as you pleaſe: I dare not exalt the <hi>truth</hi> of your <hi>Baptiſm</hi> above that of your <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery,</hi> no more then <hi>you.</hi>
                        </p>

Why come you under <hi>their ſhadow</hi> in a ſtorme, and yet will let them have no <hi>liberty</hi> under <hi>yours,</hi> but would turne us all abroad as <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To the Seventh: <hi>Though the Ordination by Biſhops be null, yet they have the other neceſſaries to a Preacher.</hi> Will ye undertake for the Aſſembly they ſhall ſtand to this, that all their former Ordination by Biſhops is null? If ſo, we are agreed: if not, all their other neceſſaries are no more then <hi>Ahabs peace: What peace,</hi> ſaith Jehu, <hi>ſo long as the whoredoms of thy mother Iezebell are alive?</hi> So, what <hi>Miniſtery,</hi> ſo long as the whoredoms of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> yet remaine?</p>

I pray forbeare this; it is too manifeſt an errour.

                        <p>To the Ninth, That <hi>ſome of the diſſenting Brethren hold Synods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, and this Aſſembly ſo.</hi> I know ſome of our Brethren for the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi>

                           <pb n="145" facs="tcp:65857:112"/>To the Tenth, That <hi>Presbyteries, becauſe not infallibly gifted, are of no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right, and ſo concludes againſt all Presbyteries and Ordinances.</hi> Yea, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all your <hi>Presbyteries</hi> to be of <hi>Divine Right</hi> as the firſt. But our queſtion is rather whether the <hi>firſt</hi> was any ſuch <hi>Presbytery</hi> as you now affirme: and for ought I ſee, you can no more prove the <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi> then in the ſenſe you take it, then your <hi>Presbytery</hi> to be <hi>one</hi> with it, <hi>one</hi> only in <hi>Divine Right,</hi> not in <hi>Divine power</hi> or <hi>gifts.</hi> And how are theſe things ſutable?</p>
                        <p>To the Eleventh, That <hi>I contradict the pure Government I plead for, by pleading for yours as prudentiall.</hi> It were true indeed, if I pleaded it in mine own behalfe. I plead it occaſionally for them, who will needs have what the <hi>State</hi> cannot in <hi>conſcience</hi> allow them, and yet will not practice any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but what the State ſhall give them; and ſo trouble both the <hi>State</hi> and their own <hi>conſciences,</hi> and would caſt a <hi>ſnare</hi> upon both. Brethren, if ye will needs have the <hi>State</hi> to allow ye your <hi>Presbytery,</hi> Why are ye not content with what they can allow ye? If ye will have a <hi>Divine Right</hi> which they cannot allow ye, why do ye trouble them, and ſit down under a <hi>bondage</hi> of your own making? But how juſtly is this <hi>yoke</hi> come upon you, who would have brought a worſe upon your <hi>Brethren.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To the Twelfth, That <hi>the firſt Presbyters, and Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible as in divers practices.</hi> What is this to the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>gifts</hi> they taught and taught by? They failed as <hi>men,</hi> but not as <hi>Apoſtles:</hi> They erred as they were <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> but not as moved by the Holy Ghoſt. Take heed by opening the Apoſtles failings to juſtifie your own you ſpeake not worſe Blaſphemy then you name in me, and make that glorious Word of Scripture queſtionable which they preached, like the <hi>words</hi> that your ſelves <hi>preach</hi> from that <hi>Scripture.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To the Thirteenth, That <hi>to ſay the Apoſtles did adviſe in place of the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word, is Blaſphemy.</hi> What Blaſphemy is it to ſay, that the ſame <hi>Word</hi> which they writ and <hi>preached;</hi> the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> ſpake in them, and <hi>ſpake</hi> the ſame <hi>truth</hi> in <hi>them</hi> which writ in <hi>them?</hi> And is it ſo with any of your <hi>Presbyters?</hi> Therefore till the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> ſpeak <hi>truth</hi> in them ſo as in the firſt <hi>Presbyters,</hi> will they challenge the ſame <hi>right,</hi> the ſame <hi>power?</hi> Will they have a <hi>Divine Right</hi> acted by a <hi>ſpirit</hi> leſſe <hi>Divine</hi> then the <hi>Right?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To the Fourteenth, That <hi>the Presbyterians in</hi> France, Scotland, <hi>and the</hi> Netherlands, <hi>do not embroyle Kingdoms.</hi> There is good reaſon: in <hi>France</hi> they cannot if they would. I wiſh you would walke under the Magiſtrate as they do, and as your diſſenting Brethren here, and not make him ſerve you, And in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> do you as they do there, and leave your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to the like <hi>liberty</hi> that is in that State, and they will not grudge ye your <hi>Presbytery</hi> amongſt your ſelves. For <hi>Scotland</hi> they are Brethren I wiſh no worſe to, then <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>power</hi> above their <hi>Miniſters.</hi>

                           <pb n="146" facs="tcp:65857:113"/>To that of <hi>excommunicating kingdoms being a bugbear.</hi> You do well to ſay ſo, till ye be eſtabliſhed: but you that dare ſo capitulate with <hi>States,</hi> whom ye are called to adviſe in things onely propounded, what more may be expected upon all your principles, I leave to be judged.</p>
                        <p>To the Fifteenth, That <hi>they aske not of the State a power, but a liberty to exerciſe that power.</hi> Well: and will ye trouble the State no further? Will ye not intreat them to puniſh ſuch a one, and ſuch a one, whom ye judge an <hi>Hereticke</hi> and a <hi>Schiſmaticke?</hi> to fine and impriſon, when you have done with them at <hi>Excommunication?</hi> May the State be quiet if they ſay to ye, go all that are ſo perſwaded as you are, and <hi>worſhip</hi> and <hi>practiſe</hi> as your diſſenting brethren and other Saints, and trouble not us to provide for your Tythes, and Rule for you in things of your own cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance over Conſciences.</p>
                        <p>But you would onely have <hi>liberty</hi> from them; your <hi>power</hi> is of Chriſt. But you cannot ſo cleare things as you thinke. If your <hi>power</hi> and <hi>liberty</hi> reſpectively to your <hi>ſelves</hi> and the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> be ſo diſtinct, why have ye mingled them and confounded them all this while? Why make ye the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>power</hi> ye have from Chriſt, wait ſo at <hi>Parliament-doores,</hi> as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Caſe</hi> ſaid? If the powers on earth will not do for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as you would make the people beleeve, Why do not ye your ſelves more for Chriſt? <hi>Is it better to obey God or man?</hi> Thus the more ye would ſingle your ſelves in your power and right from the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> the more your practice makes an argument againſt ye.</p>
