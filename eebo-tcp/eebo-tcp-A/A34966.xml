            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PREFACE TO <hi>the Reader.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>DOctor Stilling fleet hauing late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly published a Book entitled, A Discourse concerning the Idolatry practised in the Church of Rome, &amp;c. (being a Rejoynder to a reply of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Catholick Gentleman engaged in some former Controuersy with him) at the end of the Same Book hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed<note place="margin">Rom. Idol. p. 557.</note> certain <hi>Principles,</hi> drawn up, as he saith, <hi>to giue an Account of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant-Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as touching the main Book, it would be inciuility and injustice in any other to inuade the Right of his worthy Aduersary by, vntertaking an Answer thereto. To his Aduersaries Answer therefore, as the times permitt, and to Gods mercy I leaue him: if perhaps he may repent, and endeavour some satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction 1. For his accusing the whole Catholick Church of God, both Wes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern<note place="margin">1.</note> and Eastern (for the same Practise as to Seuerall of his Idolatries are in
<pb facs="tcp:50386:3"/>
both) for so many Ages before Luthers time of Idolatry, and this Idolatry as gross as that of Heathens: Which<note place="margin">Ib p. 69. 134. &amp;c. 142. 159. 161.</note> surely must Vn-church this Great Body, and quite divorce this Adulteress from Christ (for we cannot but think but the Doctor will maintain the Teaching so manifold an Idolatry in this Church to<note place="margin">2.</note> be Fundamentall Errour) 2. For his repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting the Highest Deuotions practised from all Antiquity in the same Church, Mysticall Theology, Contemplation, heauenly Inspirations, all those Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall Favours and familiar Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications of the Diuine Majesty to purer soules receiued in Prayer, and continued still in his Church (as also Miracles are, and so attested in her Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories) but vnknown indeed to stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and foolishness to Greeks, his representing all these I say, as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Fanaticisms,</hi> and <hi>impostures:</hi> though he knowes that Catholicks account themselues obliged to submitt all these things to the judgment of Superiours: a Duty vnknown to <hi>Fanaticks.</hi> And what may we expect next from such (who are to many) as make ill use of such Books as his, but that the frequent
<pb facs="tcp:50386:3"/>
Allocutions of Gods Holy Spirit men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Scripture, the Visions, Reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Extasies and Spirituall Vnions of the Saints there, our Lords, <hi>Ego in eis, &amp; tu in me, ut sint consummati in unum;</hi> and S. Pauls, Viuo, non ego, sed in me Christus, will shortly become matter of Drollery and Bouffonry? 3. For his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king<note place="margin">3.</note> so many of Gods glorious Saints in Heauen [<hi>quorum causam discernat Deus</hi>] the subject of his scorn and derision. By all which he has fitted his Book for the sport and recreation of the Atheist and Debauched; from whose applause, with the regret and horrour mean while of all piously disposed, he may receive his reward.</p>
            <p>The Reuisall of these, not very grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, Subjects of his Book, therefore I leaue to the worthy Gentleman pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged in these Disputes. But for the now mentioned Principles separately adjoyned at the end, as euery Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick has an equall Right to apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the examining of them; so seeing that from these it is that such bad fruits, of forsaking first, and then censuring and condemning their Mother the Church, doe grow, it may, with Gods
<pb facs="tcp:50386:4"/>
blessing, proue a seruice not altogether vnbeneficiall, to discouer their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kness: especially since by such a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery his whole preceding Book will be demonstrated vnconcluding against Gods Church.</p>
            <p>And this is here the rather, and with greater confidence vndertaken, because, since it is Impiety to deny in generall that true Christian Faith hath a certain, vnmoueable Foundation; in case there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it shall appear that the Foundation here layd by the Doctor is but a meer trembling Quiksand on which a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian cannot without a dreadfull danger to his soule build his Faith, namely, An Errability in the Guides of Gods Church, and <hi>(Inerrability in all necessary Doctrins contained in Scripture by Him attributed indefinitely to all sober Christians, who without any necessary consulting or depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on such Teachers as haue been institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God shall vse their sincere endeauours to find out such Truths</hi>] this Foundation, I say (not Scripture, but each priuate mans sense of Scripture) being ruined, it will vnauoydably follow, That <hi>the only cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way not to be misled, will be the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting our Internall Assent and Belief to
<pb facs="tcp:50386:4"/>
Church-authority</hi> which those who haue dissented from, and refused to stand to before Luthers time haue been always marked with the name of <hi>Hereticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where by <hi>Church-authority,</hi> I mean in generall that Superior and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensiue Body of the Ecclesiasticall Hierarchy; which in any dissent and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of the Clergy, according to the Church Canons ought to be obeyed; and which hath hitherto in her supremest and most generally accepted Councills in all Ages from the Beginning required such Submission vnder penalty of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema, and justly assumed to her self the Title of the onely authenticall Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of Scripture, and authoritatiue Teacher of Diuine Verities.</p>
            <p>A Submission this is, which no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church diuided from this more Vniuersall can with the least pretence of reason challenge from her Subjects, since she her self (and particularly the Church of England) refused the same to all the Authority extant in the world when she separated her self.</p>
            <p>And this being obserued by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth (a schollar, herein, of the Socinians) and by many other Diuines
<pb facs="tcp:50386:5"/>
of late vpon whom hls Book hath had too must influence, they accordingly are forced to disclaime that Submission<note place="margin">Synod. A. D. 1603. c. 4. 5. 36. &amp;c. Stat. 13.</note> which the Church of England formerly had challenged in her Canons, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely, euen with Ecclesiasticall death,<note place="margin">Elizab. c. 12.</note> punished the refusers vntill they should repent (not their Externall Disobedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce or Contradiction, but) <hi>their wicked Errour.</hi> The 39. Articles being declared in the same 5, Canon to haue been by this Church agreed vpon <hi>for the auoyding diuersities of Opinions, and the establishing of Consent touching true Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that these later Divines do decline such Submission, I need goe no further then to Doctor Stillingfleets Rationall Account for proof, where the Lord Primat of Ireland is cited thus, <hi>The</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ration. Account. P. 55.</note> 
               <hi>Church of England doth not not define any of these Questions</hi> (speaking of the 39. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles) <hi>as necessary to be belieued, but only binds her sonnes for Peace sake not to oppose them.</hi> And again, <hi>We do not suffer any man to reject the 39. Articles of the Church of England at his pleasure yet neither do we oblige any man to belieue them, but only not to contradict them.</hi> Thus they speake of late, and thus M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Chilling worth hath
<pb facs="tcp:50386:5"/>
cleared the way before them, in abrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging thus the just Authority of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue<note place="margin">Chillingw p. 200.</note> Councills, <hi>The Fathers of the Church</hi> (saith he) <hi>in after times might haue just cause to declare their judgment touching the sense of some generall Articles of the Creed. But to oblige others to receiue her Declarations under pain of damnation</hi> (or Anathema) <hi>what warrant they had I know not. He that can shew, either that the Church of all Ages was to haue this Authority; or that it continued in the Church for some Ages, and then expired; he that can shew either of these things, let him: for my part I cannot. Yet I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly confess the Iudgment of a Councill though not infallible yet so far Directiue and obliging, that without apparent reason to the contrary it may be sin to reject it, at least not to afford it an outward submission for Publick Peace sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now by this way our late English Diuines seem to haue brought the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their Church into a great disreputation and wayning condition, and to haue excused, yea justified all Sects which haue, or shall separate from her. For indeed what fault can it be to forsake the Doctrine of a Church,
<pb facs="tcp:50386:6"/>
whose Teaching none is bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue or obey out of conscience? and which quietly suffers, yea liberally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her sons, while they thus dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage her?</p>
            <p>These Principles therefore layd by the Doctor, which, by aduancing the Clearness of the Rule so as to inferr the vselesness of a Guide, do seem to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant what soeuer Authority of any Church, are here weighed in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Considerations. The great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of which Subject requiring Expressions serious, modest, and euery way vnlike those made vse of by the Doctor in his Book, such haue been studiously endeauoured here, without the least resentment of seuerall vnci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and vnmerited Aspersions which in the sayd Book the Doctor hath cast vpon seuerall among vs: and the more moderate any haue bene the more immoderately haue they bene traduced. God Almighty inspire into all our hearts a sincere loue of Peace and Truth.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Chilling. p. 19.</note> (who anchored his whole Religion vpon it) states this Point, namely, <hi>such a measure thereof, as humane Prudence and ordinary Discretion, (their abilities and opportunities, and all other things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered) shall aduise.</hi> And thus, such a clearness in necessaries must the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures haue as suits with the very lowest capacities. <hi>Such a Clearnesse,</hi> I say, euen to all Articles of the Athanasian Creed, if these be esteemed Necessaries; and euen as to the Consubstantiality of the Son with God the Father. In which notwithstanding the whole Body of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> dares to oppose all Antiquity, vpon pretence of cleare Scripture to the contrary.</p>

That if euery Christian may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thus Infallible in Necessaries from 1. a clear Rule, 2. a due Industry vsed, 3. and a certainty that it is so vsed; May not the Church-Gouernors still much rather be allowed infallible, and so retain still their infallible Guide-ship; and the People also, the more clear the Rule of Faith is proued to be, the more securely be referred to their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection? And haue we not all reason to presume that the chief Guides of the Church (euen a General Councill of them, or if it be but a major part of this Councill, tis sufficient) in their consults concerning a Point necessary to saluation deliuered in Scripture, vse at least so much <hi>endeauour</hi> (for more needs not) as a plain Rustick doth, to vnderstand the meaning of it; and also the like <hi>sincerity?</hi> For what they define for others, they define for themselues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, and <hi>their Saluation is as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,</hi> as any other mans is, in their mistakes.</p>
                  <p>And next: Why may not these Gouernors, vpon such certainty of a sincere endeauour and clearness of the Rule, take vpon them to define these
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50386:16"/>
Points, and enjoyn an assent to, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of them to their Subjects; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly since it is affirmed, that all those, from whom they require such Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, if they please to vse a <hi>sincere endeauour,</hi> may be certain thereof, as well as they? And are we not here again arriued at Church-Infallibility, if not from extraordinary Diuine assistance, yet from the clearness of the Rule? Only we must suppose such <hi>sincere en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour</hi> in the Church, as the Doctor allows may be in <hi>euery priuat man.</hi> And thus does not his conditionall Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of particular persons in necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the condition being so easy, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily inferr a Morall Impossibility of the Churches erring in them? Which ought the rather to be admitted by them: Since some of their Divines, to make this their Problem the more iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifiable, that the Scriptures in all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries are clear to all persons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, think it a safe way in the next place to contract these necessaries to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Creed.</p>
                  <p>But after all, supposing these Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors<note place="margin">Tillots p. 113.</note> in stating some Points fallible enough: I cannot hence gather any just
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50386:16"/>
relaxation of their Subjects submission of their judgment to them, vpon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of clearness, because such Falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> of their Superiors in some Points can, reasonably, be supposed to arise from nothing else, but some obscurity in the Rule, which must be greater still to their Subjects: and then, what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re fitting and ordinary, then in matters of consequence to follow a prudent and experienced, though fallible, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Direction, rather then our own?</p>
                  <p>Lastly, suppose this granted, That the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> may be vnderstood by all persons, in all things necessary (and so an infallible Guide vselesse;) yet I see not what aduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge the Doctor can make of this Principle for the Protestant Religion. For since the sence of Scripture is now <hi>de facto</hi> debated between Catholiks and Protestants about so many necessary Points of Faith, the Doctor cannot with truth or charity affirm the sense of these Scriptures clear to be vnderstood on the Protestants side to all those who sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely endeauour to know their meaning, where the Major part of Christendom vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands their meaning contrary, as he must grant they doe in all those hee accounts the common Errours both of the Greek and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church: (a large Catalogue of which may be found in many Protestant Authours)
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50386:17"/>
And will he charge all these as defectiue in a sincere endeauour? But rather such sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere endeauour being indifferently allowd to all parties, he ought to pronounce the sence of Scripture to be clear, if on any, on that side as the Major part doth appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it: Which certainly is not the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant.</p>
                  <p>For Example: How can the Doctor ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally maintain this Text <hi>Hoc est Corpus meum,</hi> so often repeated with out any varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Terms, to bear a sense clear on the Protestants side; that is, <hi>That the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist is not in a litterall or Proper sence the Body of Christ;</hi> when as they are vnderstood in a litterall sence by much the Major part of the Christian world, not onely the Western but Eastern Churches also (as Monsieur Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<note place="margin">Claud. in his last. Reply. l. 111. c. 13.</note> concedes to his worthy Aduersary Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur Arnaud) to which also may be added half the Body of the Protestants, namely, all the Lutherans. Now all these haue vsed their senses, and weighed the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments drawn from them, as well as Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.</p>
                  <p>But if the Doctor put this Text so much controuerted among Obscure Scriptures (which therefore not containing any Point necessary to saluation, saluation is not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered by it) if a Christian should err or be mistaken in their sense, then how comes this great Body of Christians meerly by the mistake of its sence in thinking that our Lord meaneth as the words sound, that <hi>the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50386:17"/>
is his very proper Body,</hi> and so in <hi>ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> (as they ought, should it be so) how come they, I say, to committ such grosse Idolatry, as the Doctor in his Book char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them with, and so all without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, miscarry in their Saluation?</p>
                  <p>And if from a Major part of the present Church interpreting Scripture an Appeal be made to a Major part of the Ancient Church, pretended to interpret them on the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants side; neither will this relieue the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, because since this also (<hi>on what side Antiquity stands</hi>) is a thing in Controuersy, for deciding of it we are to presume here like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise that a <hi>sincere endeauour</hi> being allowd to all Parties to vnderstand the sense of the former Church, this also stands on that side as the Major part apprehends it. Now the present Catholick Church (being a Major part) professes to follow the sence of the Ancient in interpreting Scripture.</p>

and the whole Christian Church of the first Ages with folly, in belieuing the fullnesse and perfection of the scriptures in order to saluation.</hi>

                  <p>The two inferences made here by<note place="margin">Consid. §. 14.</note> the Doctor are faulty. For 1.

Neither can the Writers of scripture be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with <hi>insincerity,</hi> if, so much as they were inspired with to set downe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister there, they haue done it.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile as touching the Perfection of<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> Holy scriptures, Catholiks now, as the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers anciently, do grant, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all Points of Faith which are simply ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be of all Persons belieued for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining saluation.

                  </p>
                  <p>But if the supposition in the Doctors sence<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> be allowed for true, there seems to follow <hi>something more</hi> then the Doctor deduceth, and which perhaps he would not admit: viz. the non-necessity of any society at all, falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or infallible, to explain these Writings, as to Necessaries (all Christians being herein clearly taught from God in these scriptures, or this their Rule) vnless perhaps these Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers may be said to be left by our Lord for others to supersede their endeauours; or for instructing them in non-necessaries.</p>
                  <p>As touching that which the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor<note place="margin">§. 18.</note>

in the clause of this Princ. speaks, of <hi>Moses and the Prophets:</hi> certain it is, that Moses his Writings and the Law were not penned with such Clarity, But that Doubts and Controuersies<note place="margin">2. Chron. XIX.

Whateuer their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence<note place="margin">Deuteron XVII. X. XI.

                  </p>
                  <p>To do, I say, <hi>according to such sentence;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 19.</note> not only when they were to vndergo some mulct, or punishment imposed by these Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for a fault; but when they were enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the obseruance of some Law formerly misunderstood by them and so broken and disobeyed. This seems clear enough from the words of the Text: for who can reasonably interpret them thus, <q>
                        <hi>Thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee, to the right hand or to the left,</hi> (vers. 11.) that is, <hi>Thou shalt not decline</hi> in not paying the mulct in which they shall fine thee, or not

vndergoing the corporall punishment they shall inflict on thee: <hi>Thou shalt obserue to do according to all that they shall informe thee, and according to the sentence of the Law that they shall teach thee</hi> (vers. 10.)</q> that is, thou shalt suffer what they impose, but not obey what they enjoyn. Again they were <hi>to do</hi> according to such sentence, <hi>vpon pain of death,</hi> not then only, when the Litigants do aknowledge their sentence to be (juxta Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem Dei) conformable to Gods Law (for then what sentence of the Iudge would stand good?) but so often as the Judge should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it to be conformable to Gods Law: And when will a Judge declare his sentence to bee otherwise?</p>
                  <p>Lastly, not to debate here the Infallibility of these supreme Judges as to all necessaries in the Law of Moses, Let the like absolute Obedience be now yielded to the supreme Ecclesiasticall Courts; Let their sentence be so conformed to, so assented to among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, for none is obliged to do a thing (as the Jewes were by those Judges) but is, by the same decree, obliged to assent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the doing it lawfull, and more is not required.</p>

                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:50386:21"/>1. But its failings being of no difficult<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> discouery, I shall not let it pass vnexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. First, then I see no reason, that those equally assisted by God in deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Truth, must also be enabled by him to giue an equall euidence of such Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, where there is not the same neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of it; as there is not, when the <hi>later</hi> deliuer no new thing from the former.</p>
                  <p>2. Again, Though none can pretend<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> to be Infallible, or actually not erring in what he proposeth, but that he must be as infallible, as to the truth of that wherein he erreth not, as our Lord, or his Apostles; for one, or one persons truth, is no more true then any others: yet in many other respects the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Infallibility is much inferiour to that of the Apostles; in that it is. 1. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for <hi>its matter</hi> so farr extended, the Apostles being affirmed infallible in all they deliuered, as well in their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as Conclusions, both in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating things heard from our Lord, and things anew inspired by the Holy Ghost: whereas the Church-Gouernours are acknowledged infallible only in their Definitions in matters of necessary Faith; and, not in their receiuing any
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50386:21"/>
new matters inspired by God, but in faithfully deliuering the Inspirations of the former. 2. Neither for <hi>the manner</hi> are the Church-Gouernours so highly assisted, by reason of the other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and euidence they haue of that Doctrine, first deliuered by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and so from them receiued, which vnchanged they conuey vnto Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Of which degrees of infallibility see Archbishop Lawd pag. 254. and 140.</p>
                  <p>3. And in the third place, hence it<note place="margin">§. 23.</note> follows, that Miracles hauing been wrought by the <hi>first</hi> in confirmation of that Doctrine which <hi>both</hi> deliuer, are not now alike necessary to, or reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably demanded of the <hi>second.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Yet, since our Lord and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles<note place="margin">Aug. de Ciuit. Dei 22. book. 8. Chapt.</note> time, Miracles haue been, and are continued in the Church: of which see irrefragable testimonies giuen by S. Augustin: In that Church, I say, that pretends Infallibility; and only in that Church, not any other, departed from it, pretending thereto: And vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersally to deny the truth of them is to ouerthrow the faith of the most cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Histories. But these are done in these later, as in former, times, only
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50386:22"/>
when, and for what ends God, and not man his Instrument, pleaseth, and many times without such persons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent knowledge, in making his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, what the Diuine Majesty will effect. Neither are the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be imagined to haue had the Operation of Miracles so in their power, as as to do these in any kind, when, and upon what Persons they pleased, or others demanded. For such a thing would be of such a force vpon mens wills to compell them into Christianity, or to reduce unto the Catholick Church Christians strayed from it, as the Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Prouidence, perhaps for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tryall of mens hearts, and merit of their Faith, hath not ordinarily vsed.</p>
                  <p>5. Lastly, Miracles remaining still in this Church, though they be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly done for conuincing a Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in this or that particular Truth, yet do sufficiently testifie in generall a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of saluation in the Communion and Faith of this Church, if God only honours with them the Members of this Communion, and no others that liue out of it: as we see no other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian society diuided from it that layes
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50386:22"/>
claim to them, or shews any Records of them, or euer did: at least such as may be any way equalled, either for frequency, variety, or eminency with those of this Church; I mean, although so many of these be rejected and layd aside, where appears any rationall ground of suspicion.</p>
                  <p>That the Doctor and the Archbishop do<note place="margin">§. 24.</note> hold such Generall Councills as haue an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall Acceptation from the Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik diffusiue, to be Infallible, seems to me clear from the places forecited in them. For in those both the Doctor and Archbishop ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt, That the Church diffufiue is for euer preserued Infallible in all Fundamentalls, or Points absolutely necessary to saluation; and this by vertue of the Diuine Promise, that <hi>the Gates of Hell shall not preuail against her,</hi> and other Texts: And therefore such Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills whose Decrees are admitted by the whole Church diffusiue, must be so too. I say, <hi>as to Fundamentalls,</hi> though as to other Points not fundamentall they affirme these Councills also lyable to errour and fallible, because the Church Catholick diffusiue (say they) is so also.</p>
                  <p>Among the Conditions also that render any Generall Councill obligatory they require<note place="margin">See. Rat. Account. p. 536.</note> this for one, that they be vniuersally accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or <hi>haue the generall consent of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50386:23"/>
World.</hi> such Councills then there may be. And then, such Lawfull Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and so approued, and consequently obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Christian World, they confess the first four Generall Councils to haue been; To which Councills therefore they profess all Obedience.</p>
                  <p>Now wee see what kind of Obedience it was these Councils exacted, in the Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian Creed, accepted by the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, which contains the summ of their Decrees, viz. no less then <hi>assent</hi> and <hi>belief</hi> and <hi>submission of judgement,</hi> and all this <hi>vpon penalty of eternall damnation.</hi> And this, if ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly required by them, inferrs, vpon the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors<note place="margin">See Rat. Account. p. 50. 6.</note> arguing, their Infallibility. For (saith he, <hi>where Councills challenge an internall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent by vertue of their Decrees</hi> (or, because their Decrees are in themselues infallible) <hi>there must be first proued an Impossibility of error in them, before they can look on themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues as obliged to giue it.</hi> And therefore He and the Archbishop, so farr as any such<note place="margin">Ib. p. 539.</note> Councills, are fallible, allow only an Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Obedience, or silence, to them.</p>
                  <p>Now for Obedience to these first four Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall<note place="margin">§. 25.</note> Councills in a submission of judgment to them, vpon such an Vniuersall Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, the Doctor in another place thus writes, <hi>The Church of England looks vpon the keeping the Decrees of the fower first Generall Councills as her Duty: and professeth to be guided by the sence of scripture as inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted

by the vnanimous consent of the Fathers, and the fowr fist Generall Councills:</hi> that is, shee professeth to take that which such Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciils deliuer, for the sence of scripture: Not then, to admit their Definitions, if first they accord with the scripture taken in our own sence. So also else where he saith, <hi>The Church</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ib. p. 59.</note> 
                     <hi>of England doth not admit any thing to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered as the sense of scripture which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the consent of the Catholick sense of the fowr first Ages</hi> (that is) <hi>in their Oecumenicall Councills,</hi> as he expresseth it in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding page. And here also he giues the Ground of such submission, viz. <hi>a strong presumption, that nothing contrary to the necessary Articles of Faith should be held by the Catholick Church, whose very being depends vpon the belief of those things that are necessary to saluation.</hi> And <hi>when</hi> (saith he) <hi>those correspondencies were maintained between the seuerall parts of it, that what was refused by one, was so by all.</hi> In another place also speaking in generall of Councills vniuersally accepted, he saith, That <hi>both the Truth of Gods Promises, the Goodness of God to his People, and his peculiar care of</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ib. p. 537.</note> 
                     <hi>his Church seem highly concerned, that such a Councill should not be guilty of any notorious errour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here you see he saith, that the <hi>Truth of Gods Promises is concerned that these Councills should not fall into any notorious Errour;</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore (such Promises are made absolute to some Church-Gouernors after the Apostles.)<note place="margin">Ap. Lavvd, p. 227.</note> And then, <hi>where the Errour is not intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:50386:24"/>
(saith the Archbishop) <hi>at least Obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of Non-contradiction will be due to all such Councills.</hi> Now <hi>a notorious Errour</hi> it must needs be, if an Errour in Fundamentalls. And such notorious Errour in particular would this be, If they should hold themselues (when they are not) infallible in their Decrees, and so should require a Generall <hi>Assent</hi> (such as that in the Athanasian Creed) from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to them, as to Diuine Reuelations, and make them DE FIDE, thereby, in case any Decree be not true, obliging all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church to an Vnity in errour. Thus farr then, as to Fundamentall Errours, it seems Gods Prouidence secures both such Councills, and their subjects: And then also for their erring in Non-fundamentalls, both He and the Archbishop put this among the<note place="margin">Rat.

                  <p>The Archbishop also is much in justifying the Catholick Church infallible not only in<note place="margin">Ap.

                     <note place="margin">Ib. p. 258.</note> And so is that saying of his, viz.

                  <p>1. As all Articles of Faith are not by all<note place="margin">§. 28.</note> Persons learnt at once, so neither by all, exactly in the same order, as is frequently obserued by Catholick Writers. A Christians Faith therefore may begin either at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Authoriry of scriptures, or of the Church; and this Infallible Authority of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these be learnt from Tradition; and that of the other from it, viz. 1. either the Infallible Authority of the scriptures from that of the Church, the Church testifying so much of the scriptures: Or 2. that of the Church from the scriptures: Or 3. Also, the Infallibility of either of these may be rightly proued from its own testimony. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is proued, or granted, once infallible in what he saith, the consequence is clear (without any Circle, or Petitio Principii, or identicall arguing) that whateuer he doth
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50386:26"/>
witness of himselfe is true. I say all these Consequences are naturall and necessary. 1. The Testimony being granted euident that the one bears to the other, or either to its selfe: and 2. the infallibility of one of these, either of the scripture, or of the Church, being, first, learnt not from its own, or the others testimony, but from Tradition.</p>
                  <p>2. When a Catholick then first receiues an<note place="margin">§ 29.</note> assurance of the Truth, or Canon of scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re from the Infallibility of the Church, or its Gouernors, he may learne first this super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall Diuine assistance and Infallibility of these Gouernors (which is made known by Diuine Reuelation to those first persons who communicate it to posterity) from Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition descending from age to age, in such manner, as the Protestant saith, he learneth his Canon of scripture from Tradition. To which tradition also may be committed by our Lord, or his Apostles, whateuer is to scripture.</p>
                  <p>3. Neither may we think, that this Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Assistance or infallibility of these Guides<note place="margin">§. 30.</note> of the Church in necessaries, should either not haue been, or not haue been a thing well known to, or belieued in the Church <hi>by this</hi> (to use the Doctors terms) <hi>Deriuatiue and perpetuated sensation of Tradition,</hi> if there had been no Diuine Writings: for soe the Christian<note place="margin">see Ration.

And this that is said here of the Churches Infallible Authority,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50386:26"/>
may be also of other necessary Articles of the Christian faith. For, as the Doctor saith, <hi>It is euident from the Nature of the thing, that the Writing of a Diuine Reuolation is not necessary for the ground and reason of Faith, as to that Reuelation. Because men may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue a Diuine Reuelation without it, as is euident in the Patriarchs and Christian Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiuers before the Doctrine written.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Such Infallibility in necessaries then<note place="margin">§. 31.</note> being so settled in the Gouernors and Pastors of the Church, (the Apostles and those others ordained by them, by whom the World was conuerted) as that had there been no scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it should not haue failed: for so the Church would haue failed too. The succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors cannot be imagined to become disena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, or depriued of it, because the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles afterwards wrote what they taught; but rather by such Writings more secured in it: Because the Belief of this Infallibility of these successors receiues a second euidence from the Testimony thereof also found in the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se Writings. Thus both written, and vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, Tradition-Apostolicall attesting it.</p>
                  <p>5. Now that these Gouernors of the Church<note place="margin">§. 32.</note> (who hauing an apparent succession, their Testimony must haue been vnquestionably belieued by Christians in what they taught, in case there had been no scripture) alwayes reputed and held themselues Diuinely assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, and infallible for all necessaries, and that this was the Traditiue Faith of the Church (grounded on our Lords Promise)
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50386:27"/>
in all ages, sufficiently appears by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting from time to time (as they thought fitt) their Decisions in the Creeds and by their Anathematizing Dissenters, &amp; the Churches stiling them <hi>Hereticks.</hi> For <hi>no Authority</hi> (if we belieue the Doctor) <hi>but</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ib. p. 506.</note> 
                     <hi>that wich proues it selfe Infallible,</hi> and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore which is Infallible, <hi>can justly require our internall Assent,</hi> or <hi>submission of Iudgment.</hi> And Protestants allowing only an externall obedience, or silence, due to Councills Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, inferrs that Councills Fallible can ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly require no more: and consequently that such Councills are Infallible as do justly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more; as did the fowr first Councills, with the voluntary acknowledgment also and submission of their subjects to such an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority assumed by them. We find indeed subordinate Councills also stating sometimes matters of Faith, censuring Heretiks, and requiring assent to their Decrees; but still with Relation to the same Infallibility resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Generall Body of Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and their concurrence therein: They not passing such Acts without consulting the Tradition and Iudgment of other Churches, and especially of the Apostolick see: and a generall acceptation rendring their Decisions authentick and valid.</p>
                  <p>2. For the latter part of this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple [<hi>Nothing is more absurd, then to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that Infallibility in a Body of men,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50386:27"/>
is not as lyable to doubts and disputes, as in those Bookes from whence only they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue their Infallibility.</hi>] If the Doctor means here (as in his Rationall Account, that the sentence of a Body of men In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible is, he saith not, in some things lyable to some Doubts; but <hi>as lyable</hi> to Doubts and Disputes, as the Infallible scriptures (for there he maintains, That <hi>the Decrees of Councills are as lyable to many Interpretations, as any other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</hi> And again, <hi>If the scriptures can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not put an End to Controuersies on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, how can Generall Councills do it, when their Decrees are as lyable to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate sense and wrong Interpretation, as the scriptures are, Nay more,</hi> &amp;c.) I say, if this be his sense, then, not to compare Absurdities here, Is not this all one as if he said, <q>That a Preacher or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator can, or doth speak or write nothing plainer, then the Text? Nor the Judge giue a sentence any more intelligible, then the Law? That Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills can, or haue decided nothing clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, then the thing that is in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersy? And so, no Party is cast by them, since it appears not, for whom they declare? And that the Decree of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50386:28"/>
Councill of Trent, as to Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation remains still as disputable, as the Text, <hi>Hoc est Corpus meum?</hi>
                     </q> But then, how comes it to pass, that Protestants, when the Definitions of later Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills are urged against them, do not contest them as dubious, but reject them, as erroneous?</p>
                  <p>From the same misarguing the Doctor el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sewhere<note place="margin">§. 34. Ib. p. 101</note> concludes, <hi>That the argument of the Vnity</hi> (in Opinion) <hi>of the Roman Party, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are ready to submit their Iudgment to the Determination of the Church, will hold as well (or better) for the Vnity of Protestants, as theirs; because all men are willing to submit their Iudgments to scriptures, which is on all sides agreed to be Infallible.</hi> Thus He. Now to consider it. Moses his Law prescribed by God for an Infallible Rule, yet had Iudges<note place="margin">Deuter. 17.</note> appointed, when Doubts and Contentions hapned about the meaning of it, to explain the sense: Our sauiour, accordingly in the Ghospell, when any one had a Controuersy<note place="margin">Math.</note> against another, (which Controuersy perhaps might be Heresy, or his Brothers teaching something contrary to the Rule of Faith) ordered, vpon such Person his not being otherwise reclaimed, that in the last place the matter should be brought to the Hearing of the Church, and such Person, if not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Church, to be excommunicated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now I ask, to what end either of these, if
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50386:28"/>
such persons be no nearer to Vnity of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or conuiction and ending their Disputes by submitting their judgments to the sentence of these Iudges, or this Church, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were in the same submission of theirs to the Rule. Infallibility alone ends not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies, but clearness; Clearness in the Point controuerted: Which if the scripture hath, how comes Controuersy about it? and Controuersies between so great Parties, Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Nations? In this sense of scripture Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks dissenting, repair to the Decision of the Church (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> if any way obscure is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being made by it afterward more intelligible) submit to its Iudgment, and so become vnited in Opinion in all those Points the Church decides: wherein Protestants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in their Liberty still to disagree. Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Opinion, I say; true or false, here mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not: We speak here of Vnion, not of Truth. But now, when the sense of scripture is the like matter of Controuersy between two sects of Protestants, as frequently it is, What Course do they take for Vnity of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion? Repair they again to the scriptures they controvert? But these can neuer decide which of the seuerall senses they take them in, is the true. Repair they to synods? So the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians and Antiarminians did? Then sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this they do, because that Vnity (proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there be a submission of Iudgment to both) is attainable by the sentence of the sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod or Church, which is not by that of the scripture. Which is the thing here denyed by the Doctor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:50386:29"/>And hence it proceeds, that Catholicks must<note place="margin">§. 35.</note> be much more vnited in Opinion or Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then Protestants; in as much as they all owne submission of Iudgment to so many Councills, which the other reject; These not accepting the Decrees of aboue fowr or siue of those Councills, whilst the Catholiks ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of fowr (or suppose, three) times so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and namely of one, the Councill of Trent; of which Soaue affirms, <hi>That in all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills</hi>

And moreouer, as for those Differences that remain still, or shall arise hereafter, they are also conclusiue among them by the same way of Councills, vpon the acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged obligation of a common submission of their judgments.

The first, <hi>That a Person in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing any society of men to be Infallible that are so, hath a security incomparably beyond that of another Person who is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to use the best other means,</hi> his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is capable of, <hi>to understand the scriptures,</hi> and so follows his own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the capacity of most Christians
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50386:31"/>
being very little, abstracting from the Directions of a Guide their mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition voyd of learning, or leasure, and it being a thing vncertain also, when they haue vsed a due endeauour; And this a prejudice of it <hi>not rightly used,</hi> that they do not discerne in these <hi>scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> this <hi>Infallible Guide,</hi> which (saith S. Augustin) <hi>the scripture without any ambiguity doth demonstrate;</hi> and which<note place="margin">Contra Crescon lib. 1. c. 33.</note> repaired to, may demonstrate to them what else is necessary.</p>
                  <p>The second Proposition is, <hi>That there</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 39.</note> 
                     <hi>can be no such hazard to any person in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing a society of men to be infallible, that are not.</hi> if this society be at least more learned and studied in Diuine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters then himselfe, and also ordained by our Lord to be his Instructors in them (which Protestants, I hope, allow true of their own Clergy:) <hi>No such ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,</hi> I say, <hi>as is comparable to that euery one incurrs in mistaking the meaning of scriptures, though we suppose he vseth his best other means of vnderstanding them,</hi> exclusiue to his obeying the Instructions of such a society.

                     <hi>For whereas, in following these Guides, such persons may fall into some errours,</hi> and perhaps some of them <hi>great</hi> ones; <hi>in this later way of following their owne fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes the vnlearned may fall into a thousand,</hi> and some of these much greater and grosser, then any such Christian society or Body of Clergy will euer maintain. <hi>For God hath made no Promise to preserue in Truth</hi> those who desert their Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des; nor to reward their <hi>diligence,</hi> who liue in <hi>disobedience.</hi>

                     <hi>Church-Authority.</hi> Thus it happens more then once in these Principles, that in too forward a Zeale in demolishing the one, the other also is dangerously vndermined.</p>
                  <p>2. The Doctor hath all reason here<note place="margin">§. 41.</note> to suppose, him that repairs to, and is instructed by an Infallible Guide, though not knowing him to be such, as well as him, who seeks for an assurance of his Faith, without one, <hi>sincerely to desire to know Gods will, and vpon this to enjoy his promised Assistance,</hi> so far as God engageth it. And then if the Question be, which of these two takes the more prudent course, he that consults, or he that lays aside this Guide, <hi>for his assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the truth of what is contained in the Bookes of scripture;</hi> I should think, the former. Whilst the one relyes on the judgment of such Guide thought wise and learned, though not infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; the other on his own: On the judgment of which Guide the one hath much more reason to be confident, then the other on his own, who neglects the advice of the Wise man [<hi>Ne inni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taris</hi>

the former (of the two) to be <hi>de facto</hi> in a much safer condition. For it must be acknowledged a great benefit to haue an Infallible Guide to shew us our way, though we doe not know him to be Infallible: for so we keep still in the right way, though belieuing only, and not infallible certain, that it is so; so we walke in Humility and obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. And if God hath directed us, for learning our right way, to a Guide, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he will take no prudent course, who committing himselfe to Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Assistance, shall neglect it; and break his commandement in hope of his fauour.</p>

                  <p>Here then Catholicks affirm, That though euery person is not so, any person may be, and that antecedently to the testimony of scripture, at least with a morally-infallible certainty (or what euer Certainty that may be called which Vniuersall Tradition can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford) assured of this Diuine Reuelation, the Churches Infallibility, from such Tradition and other Motiues of Credibility as <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi> allow for a sufficiently, or morally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>infallible and certain means of belieuing <hi>the scriptures to be the word of God.</hi> On which word of God, or Diuine Reuelation the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Articles deliuered by it, in the sense their own priuate judgment apprehends the Protestant grounds his Faith: Again on which word of God, or Diuine Reuelation, in the sense this Infallible Church interprets the same Articles the Catholick grounds his Faith.</p>
                  <p>But as the Protestants except here from being primarily grounded on, or proued by the same scriptures, this
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50386:35"/>
Fundamentall Point of Faith, <hi>That the scriptures are the true Word of God;</hi> so they must giue Catholiks also leaue to except here this their Point of Faith, <hi>the infallibility of the Church,</hi> from being primarily, or, as to the first means of Knowing it, grounded on, or learnt from the testimony of this Infallible Church. For this Point may first come to the Belieuers Knowledge either from Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or from the Holy scriptures (as is explained before in the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on 17. Principle. §. 28.) From the scriptures, I say, as the sense of them is now learnt, not from this Infallible Church, but either from their owne sufficient Clearness in this Point, or from Tradition.</p>
                  <p>Nor are Catholicks necessited in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing against Protestants (who grant the scriptures to be Gods Word) to vse any other Testimony then that of these scriptures for a sufficiently clear Proof of Church-Infallibility. For I think I may call that a clear Proof, euen according to the Doctors <hi>common reason of Mankind,</hi> which by the most of the Christian World is taken to be so, notwithstanding that a Party, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50386:36"/>
by their Reformation in an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent contrary interest, do contradict it. Yet whilst they deny a sufficient Euidence of Church-Infallibility to be found in scripture, if they would allow a sufficient Euidence of <hi>Church-Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> established to decide Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Controuersies with Obligation to <hi>Externall</hi> Obedience, by this Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they would be cast and silenced for the former, if a much Major Part may be admitted (as it ought) to giue Law to the Whole.</p>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50386:42"/>
is no making NEGATIVE ARTICLES OF FAITH, but only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the generall grounds of Faith to particular instances, as, I belieue nothing necessary to saluation but what is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in scripeure; Therefore no such parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular things, which neither are there, nor can be deduced thence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Here first obserue, That what no<note place="margin">Consid. §. 54.</note> Christian is obliged to belieue vnder any pretence of <hi>Church-Infallibility,</hi> he is (much rather) not obliged to belieue vnder any pretence of <hi>Church - Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:</hi> And that the Doctors freeing the Churches subjects here from the former, doth so from the later. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns therefore his superiors to look to it whether their Churches and their owne Authority suffers no detriment particularly from this Principle, I mean, so as it can be applied to priuate mens practice.</p>
                  <p>2. Next obserue, That the Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion<note place="margin">§. 55.</note> (<hi>What is reuealed by God, &amp;c.</hi>) as it is applicable to persons, must either mean, What such person only <hi>thinks, belieues,</hi> or <hi>is perswaded</hi> to be reuealed &amp;c. or, what such person <hi>certainly
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50386:42"/>
knows</hi> to be reuealed: And the same may be sayd of the later expressions (<hi>what hath no foundation What is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>Now as either of these two Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are made, a great alteration is made in the Principle, and what in the one Addition is true, in the other may be false. As for example when a cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Ignorance belieues something that is enjoyned by this Authority not to be reuealed in Gods Word, which indeed is so, and so rejects it, here such act is not justifiable. Very necessary therefore it seems here to make an exact distinction, that if the Doctor means it here of the one, viz. certain Knowledge, it may not be misapplyed by any to the other, namely, a belief or full perswasion. For so, men set once vpon examining well in such high my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries <hi>their owne Certainty,</hi> will, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, neuer find just cause to reject what this Church-Authority, to which they owe obedience, recommends to them vpon <hi>Her Certainty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to take Expressions as they lye.<note place="margin">§. 56.</note> For the first Part of this Principle, thus much is granted, <hi>That no Christian can
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50386:43"/>
be obliged, vnder any pretence of Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to belieue any thing as a matter of Faith, but what is reuealed by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in his Word,</hi> Written or Vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,<note place="margin">Rat. Account p. 162. 208. 210</note> both which the Doctor else where allowes to be of the same Value, so it be euident they are his Word. Where I adde <hi>vnwritten</hi> because though it is granted before, on Principle 14. that the Word written, or Book of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures contains all those Points of Faith that are simply necessary to be of all persons belieued for attaining saluation; Yet some Articles of a Christians Faith there may be that are not there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, which may be also securely preserued in the Church by Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Tradition, both Written and Vnwritten, deriued at first from the Apostolicall; as for example, this by Protestants confessed, <hi>That these Bookes of scripture are the Word of God.</hi> I say thus much is granted. For no Church-Infallibility is now pretended, but only in declaring what this Word of God deliuers, requireth, authorizeth; and a Catholicks whole Faith is grounded on Diuine Reuelation: And, where such pretended Infallible Church-Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50386:43"/>
enjoyns any thing to be belieued meerly as lawfull, it grounds it selfe on this Word of God, for the lawfulness of it.</p>
                  <p>The Consequence also is granted,<note place="margin">§. 57.</note> viz. <hi>That a Christian is bound to reject whatsoeuer is offred to be imposed vpon his Faith, which hath no foundation in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> or Gods Word, as before explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; <hi>or is contrary thereto,</hi> (that is, which is certainly known to such Christian to be so) there being no matter of Faith enjoyned by such Authority, but what is pretended to be so founded.</p>
                  <p>But then, such Christian, where not infallibly<note place="margin">§. 58.</note> certain against it, ought to submit to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Authority for the Knowing what things are <hi>reuealed in this Word,</hi> and what are <hi>contrary to,</hi> or <hi>not founded in it,</hi> and (to vse the Doctors Expression) <hi>to be guided by the sense of Scripture, as it is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by this Authority.</hi> Else a mistaken and culpably ignorant belief herein, will no way justify his disobedience. No more then the Socinians contrary belief justifies him against the Decrees of the Church in those Points which yet he belieues <hi>not to be founded</hi> in Gods word, and rejects as <hi>contrary.</hi>

is glad to call in, <hi>for the interpreting of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> to them, <hi>the concurrant sense of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, the common Reason of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind (that supposeth Scripture the Rule of Faith) the consent of Wise and learned men.</hi> And on their side who disbelieue this Authority, he calls for no less then <hi>Demonstration;</hi> and this not some improbable Argument miscalled so, but which <hi>being proposed to any man and vnderstood, the mind cannot choose but inwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly assent thereto,</hi> that is, that euery reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable man vnderstanding the terms, assents to.

                  <p>Here then we see the Doctor getts as near to an Internall Infallible, or at least Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall Proponent, as his cause and interest will permitt him: Hoping by his requiring <hi>Demonstration,</hi> and introducing <hi>Common Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and <hi>Wise and learned men,</hi> and <hi>Primitiue Church,</hi> to shake his hands of so many Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rists, who molest his owne Churches peace vpon the account of this his Proposition, or something like it, viz. <hi>that no Christian is bound, vnder what euer pretence of Church Authority, to belieue that which is not reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Gods Word; and is bound to reject what euer is offred to be impos'd vpon his Faith, that is contrary, or hath no ground in Gods Word,</hi> &amp;c.

And therefore perhaps it was, that the Doctor in the Reason he annexeth (<hi>That they only apply the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall grounds of Faith to particular instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp;c.</hi>) mentions indeed such Positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues as are <hi>neyther in, nor may be deduced from the Scripture,</hi> but warily omitts such as are pretended <hi>contrary to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>

Idol. p. 52.</note> that <hi>Quaere</hi> of the Doctors in his Book Roman Idolatry. p. 52. which he says <hi>he could not hitherto procure from Catholiks, though he hath often requested it,</hi> viz. <hi>Why the belieuing of all the Ancient Creeds, and leading a good life may not be sufficient to Saluation, vnless one be of the Communion of the Church of Rome?</hi> Where if he will allow me here, for auoyding by disputes, to change these Words (<hi>Communion of the Church of Rome</hi>) into (<hi>the Communion of the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church;</hi> and 2. will giue me leaue to vnderstand <hi>a good life</hi> here, restrained to all other duties of a Christian, saue those which respect this Communion, else if <hi>a good life</hi> be <hi>generally</hi> taken, the Doctors supposition must not be allowed:) Then I answer, That such Belieuing and Leading such a life, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be sufficient for Saluation, to so many persons as persist, without repentance, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a wilfull ignorance of their Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to liue in this Communion, or knowing this Obligation, persist in a wilfull neglect to re-vnite themselus to it. Because all such persons liue in a mortall sin, viz. Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to, and a willfull Separation from their lawfull and Canonicall Ecclesiasticall Superiors, whom our Lord hath sett ouer them. And this sin vnrepented of, destroys Saluation, being the same so heauily condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by our Sauiour (<hi>Si non audierit Ecclesiam.</hi>) Now that vnrepented of it is, we haue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to fear, so long as they hauing opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50386:46"/>
either neglect to inform their judgment, or this being conuinc'd, to reform and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify their practise.</p>
                  <p>And this seems a judged Case in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natist (who pretended some such thing for their<note place="margin">Aug. Ep. 48.</note> security) if we will admitt S. Augustins sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent of it: for thus he directs his speech to them? <hi>Nobiscum estis in Baptismo,</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>You are with vs in Baptism, you are with vs in the Symbol,</hi> or Creed, <hi>you are with vs in the rest of our Lords Sacraments</hi> (and I may safely add with regard to some of them at least, <hi>You are with vs in a good life,</hi> with the former exception) <hi>But in the Spirit of Vnity and bound of peace, and lastly, In the Catholick Church you are not with vs:</hi> And so he leaues them to the punishment due to those who are out of it, and separated from Christ its head.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, I ask this Counter-Question concerning a Christian liuing, for example, In the <hi>Fift Age</hi> of the Church, Why the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing of the Apostles Creed (as those of the <hi>first Age</hi> did) and leading a good life, may not be sufficient for Salvation to such a one, vnless he continue in the Communion of his lawfull Ecclesiasticall Superiors of his owne Age, requiring of him vnder Anathema, or penalty of damnation the belief not only of the Symbol of the Apostles, but of all the Articles of the Athanasian Creed (as in the beginning and Conclusion of that Creed it is clear they did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Here, what Answer the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor

shall make to this Question (supposing he will not justify such Separatist) I cannot imagin but it must fitt his own.</p>
                  <p>Here therefore such a Christians business for knowing whether he stands safe as to his Faith and Life in order to Saluation, seems to be, That he seriously examin, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those whose Communion he rejects, are the true Legall Ecclesiasticall Superiors who are sett ouer him by our Lord, and to whom he is enjoyned Obedience, and with whom he ought to liue (to vse S.

So Holy Scriptures belieued such from Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall Tradition, may be much clearer in some Articles of our Faith, then in others: And some Diuine Reuelations may be so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely expressed there, or inuolued only in their Principles, as that some weak capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties cannot discern them, which yet in the same Scriptures may discouer the Authority of the Church and its promised Diuine As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance and Infallibility in necessaries, and so from thence learn those other.

                  </p>
                  <p>Neyther do the Principles here layd down, afford any effectuall way or means in this Church of suppressing or conuicting any Schism, Sect, or Heresy, or reducing them ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to submission of Judgment, or Silence. For where both sides contend Scripture clear for themselues; the Clearness of such Scripture, how great soeuer on one side, can be made no Instrument of Conuiction to the other.

to perspicuity of Scripture for the attaining Vnity and Peace in the Points controuerted. And the prudent may consider, Whether the Authority of the Church of England is not much debilitated and brought into contempt, and dayly like to wane more and more by this new-taken-vp way of its Defence; Where he thinks himself it's best Aduocat and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of its Cause, who doth most endeauour to sett forth the Defects and faylings of all such Ecclesiasticall Societies, Prelats, and Councills, and best proues no Scripture-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises made to them. Nay where, to the end to euacuate the Infallibility of any Society or Church <hi>in necessaries,</hi> is set vp a <hi>Counter-Lay-Infallibility</hi> of priuate men, if only <hi>sincere En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauourers</hi> of Vnderstanding Holy Writt, in all <hi>the same Necessaries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is done, which causeth still more Sects, instead of that which, if done, would cure them, namely, The Recommending (especially to the illiterate and less intelligent common sort of people) Humility, Obedience, Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of judgment to their Spirituall Pastors and Gouernors, whom our Lord hath ordained by due Succession to continue to the end of the world on purpose to expound the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and out of these to teach them all Necessaries for their Saluation, and <hi>to heep them stable and fixed from being tossed to and fro with euery wind of Doctrin,</hi> that Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Fancies may imagin there, or malicious pretend: Informing them, that they are to learn of these Pastors, the true Sense of Gods

Word according to former Church-Tradition, <hi>to follow their Faith</hi> and to rest in their Iudgment. Lastly, not to vsurp <hi>their</hi> Office, and become their owne Guides: inasmuch as the same Diuine order that appoints the others to Guide, enjoyns them to be Guided. And supposing these Guides should err too; better it is that all err one Error, which is the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of their Guides, for there will be at least some Vnity and Peace in that, some Excuse for Inferiors; yea also, in probability more verisimilitude; then that euery one should err a seuerall, and his own, Error, to the vtter ruine uf Peace, and a greater deuiation from Truth.</p>
                  <p>But whilst these things are so little spoken of, it is no great wonder if vnder the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of such contrary Maximes spread abroad, which were first made more current and common by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Chillingworth (forced to it as the last Refuge left to shelter him from Obedience to a just Church-Authority) the Broachers of New Sects and extrauagant Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in Religion, the Contemners of Church-Authority and of the Clergy, (who first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned and vilified themselues) do dayly in these parts so exceedingly multiply and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease) <hi>Sed tu, pastor bone, reduc in ouile tuum istas oues perditas, vt audiant vocem tuam: &amp; sic fiat vnum ouile &amp; vnus Pastor.</hi>
