            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>CErtain it is, that by the <hi>Fall</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Peace</hi> eſtabliſh'd through the whole <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> betwixt <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> and even among the <hi>Beaſts</hi> themſelves, was univerſally-broken. Nature could never reſtore that <hi>Peace</hi> to the <hi>Brute A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,</hi> but that they ſtill devour and prey one upon another. But <hi>Heaven</hi> provided for <hi>Rational Man</hi> a <hi>Sacred Means</hi> to regain and preſerve that <hi>Bleſſed Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> which would have always accompany'd his <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Innocency,</hi> which was the <hi>Obſervance</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> which as it binds us to <hi>God,</hi> ſo ought it to tie us <hi>one</hi> to <hi>another</hi> in the <hi>ſtrict bonds</hi> of <hi>Heavenly Example.</hi> To this intent, at length <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf brought down from <hi>Heaven</hi> a <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity;</hi> ſo that, as it is the <hi>True Character</hi> of a <hi>True Religion</hi> to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite and Preſerve, ſo it is the moſt certain <hi>Sign</hi> of a <hi>Falſe</hi> and <hi>Counterfeit Religion,</hi> to diſunite and deſtroy <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence we may eaſily conclude, That as there is no <hi>Religion</hi> in the <hi>World</hi> that more imploys it ſelf to the <hi>Deſtruction</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> and the <hi>Subverſion</hi> of <hi>National Order and Government,</hi> then that of <hi>Popery,</hi> ſo there can be no greater <hi>Argument</hi> of its being <hi>Counterfeit</hi> and <hi>Falſe</hi>: that it aſcended from <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> never deſcended from <hi>above.</hi> Which if People blinded and beſotted by <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> cannot be brought to hate for it's <hi>ridiculous</hi> and <hi>abominable Blaſphemous Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Superſtitions;</hi> they ought to abominate for its <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Cruelty.</hi> A <hi>Tyranny</hi> then which never was any <hi>Tyranny</hi> more <hi>Domineering</hi> and <hi>Rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous;</hi> a <hi>Cruelty,</hi> then which never was any more <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous</hi> among the <hi>Adorers</hi> of <hi>Moloch:</hi> as if it were their <hi>deſign</hi> to excel the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the <hi>Old Law,</hi> by Sacrificing <hi>Men</hi> inſtead of <hi>Beaſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Were not this <hi>Cruelty</hi> one of the <hi>main Points</hi> of their <hi>Doctrine;</hi> and <hi>Opreſſion</hi> one of the <hi>chief Supports</hi>

of their <hi>Bloody Principles,</hi> it might be thought a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> in ſome of their Particular <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Potentates,</hi> that ſuch <hi>Enormities</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.

This very <hi>Plot,</hi> ſo providentially diſcovered, of which this very <hi>Tryal,</hi> brings a <hi>bloody part</hi> upon the <hi>Stage</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> is but a <hi>link'd contrivance</hi> of their <hi>Deſigns</hi> of <hi>Maſſacre</hi> and <hi>Cruelty</hi> ever ſince Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> firſt aſcended the <hi>Engliſh Throne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis the <hi>Misfortune</hi> of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and aſſert thoſe <hi>Principles</hi> in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of their <hi>Religion,</hi> which they dare not own.

            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Infancy</hi> of the <hi>Diſcovery,</hi> Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> had onely taken a ſingle <hi>Information</hi> of their <hi>Conſpiracies,</hi> which becauſe it ſhould not be read, they could find no better an <hi>Expedient</hi> then to blur and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Writing</hi> with his <hi>Blood</hi>: So vain was their <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> that the <hi>Eye</hi> of <hi>Juſtice</hi> could not pierce through ſuch a <hi>Crimſon Stain</hi>: So ſwift was the purſuit of their <hi>Malice,</hi> to revenge themſelves againſt the <hi>Law,</hi> upon a Perſon who had onely Acted according to the <hi>Law.</hi>

               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who while this <hi>Honour'd ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer</hi> lay weltring in his <hi>Blood,</hi> and hung in the <hi>Ballance</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Death,</hi> gave thoſe ſignal <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> of his <hi>Unweari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pains</hi> to ſerve the <hi>Publick</hi> and his <hi>Friend,</hi> which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be forgotten. And to whoſe indefatigable and judicious <hi>Induſtry,</hi> as well in the <hi>Diſcovery</hi> of the <hi>Actors</hi> in this <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy,</hi> as in rommaging the moſt <hi>ſecret Penetralia</hi> of the <hi>Plot</hi> it ſelf, the whole <hi>Nation</hi> is not a little indebted.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Conviction</hi> then of the <hi>Perſon</hi> Arraigned upon this <hi>Tryal,</hi> ought to be accounted in the number of the moſt remarkable <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords</hi> of the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> and therefore made publick to be added to the reſt for <hi>general ſatisfaction;</hi> all little enough to combat that <hi>Infidelity</hi> which either <hi>Weakneſs</hi> or <hi>Intereſt</hi> ſtill cheriſh in the <hi>Nation.</hi> Not conſidering that it is the moſt <hi>Notorious Character</hi> of the <hi>great Whore,</hi> that ſhe intoxicates with her <hi>pleaſing Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and charms with the <hi>Gaudy Deluſions</hi> of <hi>Pretence</hi> and <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood.</hi> It were elſe impoſſible that <hi>Men</hi> ſhould ſhut their Ears with ſo much obſtinacy againſt the <hi>Atteſtations</hi> of ſuch a <hi>crowd</hi> of <hi>undoubted Teſtimony;</hi> as if it could have been expected that only <hi>Knights</hi> of the <hi>Shire</hi> and <hi>L.

            </p>
            <p>However it has this <hi>advantage,</hi> that it will be never out of <hi>ſeaſon</hi>: The <hi>Murther</hi> of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> and the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſination</hi> upon Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> will be always at hand, if not to ſtop the <hi>Mouths,</hi> yet to curb the <hi>Inſolence</hi> of <hi>unbelieving Bigots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor let the <hi>Papiſts</hi> think that the <hi>Spirits</hi> of the True <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> are yet ſo low, as to be cow'd, as they expected, by their <hi>Attempt</hi> upon this <hi>Gentleman.</hi> Such <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence</hi> as theſe, rather <hi>exaſperate</hi> then <hi>terrify.</hi> And ſince they have been the <hi>Aggreſſors</hi> of the <hi>Publick Peace,</hi> by ſuch <hi>Violations</hi> of the <hi>Laws Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane,</hi> it cannot be otherwiſe expected, but that the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Juſtice</hi> ſhould be more careful to avoid their <hi>Ambuſcado's</hi> for the <hi>future;</hi> not by withdrawing from their <hi>fury,</hi> but by expoſing themſelves more vigorouſly for the <hi>Preſervation</hi> of the <hi>True Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> and the ſafety of his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi>

Then the Court asked him his Witneſſes Names, and what they could ſay? Which he then declared to the Court. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> being preſent and Proſecutor (<hi>Tam pro Domino Rege quam pro ſeipſo</hi>) the Court asked his conſent, and what he could ſay why the Tryal ſhould not be put off; that ſo all the World might here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſay, that Mr. <hi>Giles</hi> had all the favour that he could reaſonably deſire, and what the Court could in Juſtice ſhew him; and that no manner of Excuſe might be left him?</p>
            <p>After which, Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> in a very pertinent Speech declared part of the Fact, and alſo of the Proceedings before his Wounding, as it had occurred between him and Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi>; and of his favourable and juſt Proceedings againſt Mr. <hi>Herbert,</hi> and alſo againſt <hi>John Giles,</hi> after the Fact was committed; and declared that

                  <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, I am Counſel for the King, and the Indictment hath repreſented to you the moſt Horrid, Vile and Barbarous Aſſault that has been almoſt ever committed, and that any man has heard of; and which I think ſcarce any thing in Hiſtory can parallel. It was, Gentlemen, in its nature moſt cruel, by the giving him ſo many Wounds as are ſet forth in the Indictment; having firſt way-laid and ſurprized him near a place, and at ſuch a time, as was conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for the execution of their wicked Deſign. This Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> having occaſion to go through <hi>Bell-yard,</hi> between the hours of Ten and Eleven of the Clock at Night, at the end of <hi>Jackanapes-lane,</hi> he was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſeized by two Men, and by them halled into the Lane, where they gave him ſeveral Wounds, and uſed him in a moſt barbarous manner. And this did not ariſe from any private Difference or Animoſity, that they could conceive againſt Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi>; but from a cauſe more general, that is, the Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Horrid Popiſh Plot; againſt which Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> as became him, and according to the duty of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41248:6"/>
his Office, he being a Juſtice of the Peace, was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Zealous Perſon. Gentlemen, In the firſt place we will call Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> who ſhall plainly prove that this Priſoner at the Bar, was one of the three Aſſaſſines; and he proves it by a miraculous Providence: for juſt before they ſeized upon him, a Woman in <hi>Bell-Yard</hi> held out a Candle, which gave Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> an opportunity to ſee the Priſoner at the Bar, and did perfectly diſern him. Gentlemen, though this is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, conſidering the Integrity, and Reputation of the Perſon; yet we ſhall fortify his Evidence by ſtrong and undeniable Circumſtances, Circumſtances that do particularly relate to this matter. In the firſt place, Gentlemen, the very day that this Fact was done, this Perſon, tho he had a good Sword by his ſide, yet he did inquire where he might buy a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Sword, and did deſire to know where he might have a Rapier, which was thought more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for this deſign. And the very next day after this Fact, tho Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi>'s having Armour on was a ſecret which no perſon but Mr. <hi>Walcup</hi> a Juſtice of the Peace, and Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> himſelf; yet this ſame <hi>Giles</hi> could ſay, <hi>Arnold</hi> had Armour on; and if <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold</hi> had not had Armour on, his buſineſs had been done. And after this Fact was committed, this <hi>Giles</hi> goes into <hi>Gloceſterſhire,</hi> and being purſued by a guilty Conſcience, he durſt not ſtay there; for he was afraid, as he ſaid himſelf, of being Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended for aſſaſſinating Mr. <hi>Arnold.</hi> After this, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, he came to one <hi>Darcy</hi> a Cutler in <hi>Monmuoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> with his Sword which was broken, and deſired him to mend his Sword. <hi>How now,</hi> ſays he, <hi>how came this Sword to be broken? Have you been fighting with the Devil? No,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I have been fighting with damn'd</hi> Arnold. And at the very ſame time when theſe Villains thought they had effected their bloody purpoſe, and gave Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> his diſpatch: one of them ſaid to him, <hi>Now Villain, if thou haſt any Life in thee, pray for the Soul of Captain</hi> Evans; which <hi>Evans</hi> was a Prieſt Executed in <hi>Wales,</hi> upon
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41248:7"/>
Mr. <hi>Arnolds</hi> Proſecution, at whoſe Execution this <hi>Giles</hi> was preſent, and dipt his Handkerchief in his Blood. Now, Gentlemen, conſidering all this, which we will make plain to you by Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> and all theſe circumſtances, I ſuppoſe you will have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent evidence to find him guilty.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Thompſon,</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, the Indictment has been opened, and the matter of it, that baſe attempt made upon Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> that was a Juſtice of the Peace in <hi>Monmouthſhire,</hi> that is ſhewed in the Indictment. But I muſt crave your Lordſhips leave, that I may more particularly open this caſe. This is a caſe, Gentlemen, of very Great Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and tho' it more immediately concerns Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> yet it highly concerns every man preſent; you of the Jury, and I; nay, every other Freeman of <hi>England,</hi> which ought to be protected by the Laws, muſt needs be concerned at ſo great a Violation of them, and cannot but ſet our Faces againſt ſuch vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainous and barbarous Attempts as theſe, wherein there did not want the good will of the Actors to make it a moſt barbarous and bloody Murther In the courſe of our Evidence and the method we will take to proceed in, it will be neceſſary to do theſe three things. Firſt of all, we ſhall acquaint you with that which we apprehend to be the reaſon and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this horrid Fact. Next we ſhall tell you what that Fact was. And in the laſt place, enquire how far this Defendent is guilty thereof.</p>
                  <p>For the Firſt, Give me leave to acquaint you with what we apprehend to be the true Reaſon of this Aſſaſſination, 'tis notorious to moſt men, but eſpecially to the County of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> was a Juſtice of Peace; how active and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, how faithful and vigorous a man he has been in the diſcharge of his Duty to his King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, in putting the Laws in Execution againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts; and endeavouring to Suppreſs Popery: This was the ground of their Malice, as you will find by the Evidence, and by the ſeveral Threats that he had
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41248:7"/>
before this Act was done. But more particularly there was this occaſion, there was one whom they called Captain <hi>Evans,</hi> but indeed was Father <hi>Evans</hi> a Popiſh Prieſt; this Man in <hi>Monmouth</hi> was taken by Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> and was proſecuted according to Law and convicted. I mention this Circumſtance, becauſe our Evidence will refer to it, and that you will ſee out of the Actors own mouths, if we may believe the Actors in this Bloody Tragedy when they did the Fact: This Proſecution of Father, Captain <hi>Evans,</hi> was no ſmall occaſion of their Villany which they Acted upon Mr. <hi>Arnold.</hi> Theſe were the grounds of their malice, Gentlemen, and what happened to Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> was the Effect. And I do the rather mention this particular, that you may know what ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple theſe were that practiſed this Villany upon Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> for it will be a neceſſary Circumſtance in our proof againſt this Priſoner at the Bar, to ſhew that he is one of that Bloody Tribe.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, the next thing is to ſhew, what this Fact was, and how it happened. Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> had a controverſie with one Mr. <hi>Herbert,</hi> another Juſtice of the Peace in <hi>Monmouth-ſhire</hi>; that Cauſe between them was to be heard before the King and Council the next day after this Fact was committed: I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mr. <hi>Herbert,</hi> but I hope he is more a Gentleman than to be concern'd in ſuch a Villany. We will not at this time give any Evidence that relates to him: For truly I believe this could only be the contrivance of a Jeſuite and the Practice of Bygotted Papiſts. But thus it happen'd, Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> going to attend his Council upon this occaſion, to prepare himſelf for this hearing, that was to be before the King and Council; in <hi>Bell-Yard</hi> there he is Set upon, there he is Wounded, there he is Murther'd, as theſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſines thought. And this Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> will prove to you when he comes to give his Evidence. This to the Fact.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, The next is, now to conſider how far this man at the Bar is guilty of it; and for that, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41248:8"/>
we will give you Evidence of ſeveral ſorts:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The poſitive proof of Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> himſelf, who as Mr. <hi>Holt</hi> has obſerved before, almoſt by a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, diſcovered the Defendant's Face; for a Light ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally coming out of one of the Neighbouring Houſes, and the Defendant looking at Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> to ſee whether he was the Man they wanted, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon that he was aſſaulted and carried into <hi>Jackanapes-lane,</hi> and was wounded in ſeveral places. This Gentlemen is plain, and will be poſitively proved; and then when this Man was taken upon Suſpicion, and was carried before a Juſtice of the Peace, and Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> was ſent for, tho Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> had no private Intimation, no kind of knowledg be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand of <hi>Giles</hi>'s being taken, and there were ſeveral men ſtood beſides this man; yet tho he had never ſeen him before, but at the time when the Fact was done, Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> immediately charged him with the Fact, and as ſoon as he heard him ſpeak he knew his voice. This was ſo plain upon <hi>Giles,</hi> that he had not the power, tho he might have had the confidence, at that time to deny it: but inſtead of a denial, ſaid, The matter could but amount to an Aſſault and Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. In the next place we have Evidence from the Defendants own Mouth, which in a caſe of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ought to weigh as much as can be, and I think is as much as the nature of the thing is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of. This man the very next day after Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> had been thus Aſſaulted, diſcourſing with one <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips</hi> by name, and relating the buſineſs which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> and before he could know he had Armour on, as we will prove from the Circumſtance of the time (what does <hi>Giles</hi> ſay?) Says he, <hi>Dam him, Rot him, Mr.</hi> Arnold, ſaid he, <hi>had Armour on</hi>: And, this Gentlemen, could not be known by him at that time, if he had not been a party in this baſe Attempt. And there is a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that goes yet beyond this, which I would have you obſerve, that when Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> was Aſſaſſinated, when they made their Attempt, in the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41248:8"/>
very Act were theſe words uſed, <hi>Dam him, Rot him, he has Armour on.</hi> Theſe very words were ſpoken then, and upon that they fell to Cut his Throat. We have this Circumſtance more; he had broken his Sword, and went to a Cutler, one <hi>Darcy</hi> by name; this man was a Papiſt, and ſays he, <hi>Where haſt thou been</hi> Giles, <hi>a fighting with the Devil? No, it was with damn'd</hi> Arnold. This we will prove to you: Theſe are Evidences that are poſitive.</p>
                  <p>Some other Witneſſes we have, that will be very material to prove to you what ſort of Man the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant is. That he has declared there is no Plot; that thoſe that believe it, are Rogues; and if ever any of the Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi> ſhould Suffer, this Nation ſhould feel a Bloodyer War than ever it had done; by which you may ſee his Bloody Nature. Gentlemen, beſides this we ſhall prove (according to their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of Shamming) that he has from time to time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as if Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> had done this buſineſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or ſome of his Friends, to revive the Plot. A very fine contrivance indeed! for a Perſon to Stabb himſelf and Cut his own Throat, to revive the Plot. Theſe things we will make out clearly to you: And I muſt tell you it is a Notorious Crime, ſuch a Fact as has no Precedent: There's no remembrance in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that I know of, of ſuch barbarous Attempts, except in the caſe of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> who was moſt barbarouſly Murther'd by this ſort of Men. And this caſe, Gentlemen, differs from that only in this, that there they accompliſh'd their Villany upon him: but the Providence of God ſaved Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi>'s Life, and I hope to as good purpoſe: For as Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ordered that to confirm the truth of the Popiſh Plot; ſo this Aſſaſſination of Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> muſt convince all mankind (not concerned in the Plot it ſelf) that this damn'd Popiſh Plot ſtill continues, and that 'tis high time for all honeſt men, as much as in them lies, to endeavour to ſuppreſs it. You, Gentlemen, will do your duty in finding this man Guilty (if the Evidence we give ſatisfies your Conſciences that he is ſo, elſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41248:9"/>
God forbid) and then I doubt not but the Court will do their duty, in putting ſuch an examplary puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon this Villain, that may deter the like Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and Bloody Attempts for the future.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I was ordered by the King and Council to attend upon them the next day after this Villany befel me. I was upon the 15th day of <hi>April</hi> in my Chamber in the Afternoon, and my Lord <hi>Shandois,</hi> and ſeveral other Perſons came to my Chamber, and one <hi>Evans,</hi> one of the Meſſengers, belonging to the Council, came to give me Notice that my Hearing (which I was informed was to be at Four in the Afternoon) was ordered to be at Ten in the Morning, which was the reaſon I ſent my Servants out to give Notice of this Alteration to my Witneſſes and Council. And though I had reſolved not to ſtir out that Night, I went out with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to the <hi>Devil</hi> Tavern, where we were and ſtaid till about Ten, or paſt; and juſt as we were breaking up, I recollected that I had ſome buſineſs with Mr. <hi>Phillips,</hi> who is a Councellor at Law, and lives near the end of <hi>Bell-Yard.</hi> I deſired the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to ſtay, and I would come to them in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I went to the Room were ſeveral Servants were, and called to ſome of them to go with me; for ſeveral of my Friends and Neighbours being in Town, I very often took their Servants with me, when mine were buſy, or out of the way. As I went croſs <hi>Fleet-ſtreet</hi> I did ſee two Men in Campaign-Cloaks follow me, and I thought them to be Servants belonging to ſome of my Company, who had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me on my calling, and as I came into <hi>Bell-Yard,</hi> one of them went faſter than I went, and got before me, and turned and looked earneſtly in my Face, and I went by him, when a Woman ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41248:9"/>
in a door about the middle of <hi>Bell-Yard</hi> with a Candle in her hand, I looked in his Face, and that Perſon was the Priſoner at the Bar; and when his Companion or Companions came up to him, I heard them laugh aloud; I took no notice but went on, and went as far as to that Houſe.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>I did not know him ſo well before as to know his Face. At the Kennel at the end of <hi>Jackanapes-lane,</hi> I looking down to find the Kennel, a Cloak was thrown over my Head, then I found very rough hands upon my Shoulders, and they ran me into <hi>Jackanapes-lane</hi> juſt croſs the lane, againſt the oppoſite Wall, and they run my head ſo hard I think they broke it; I drew my Sword before, but before I could uſe it I was ſtruck, and immediately upon that, one of them ſtruck me; then I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended what it was, but could not turn to make any defence. I received a Second blow and fell, and the firſt thing I was ſenſible of was a very ſharp quick Thruſt in my Side, and the point at that Thruſt ran into my Belly: Then I recovering began to make what defence I could. With a broad Sword I was run through my Arms, and with a ſmall Weapon I was run through in another place of my Arm. I had ſeveral other Wounds; one of them ſet his foot hard upon my Breaſt, and kept me down, and he was, as I conceive, run into the Leg, by one of his Companions; for I heard him ſay, <hi>Damme Thou haſt ſpoil'd my Leg.</hi> They laughed all the while and were exceeding merry. I had then on a pair of Bodice of Whale-Bone, notwithſtanding which I had Four or Five Wounds in my Body through them, for they were not Proof; but they imagin'd they were, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Swords double ſometimes; and then ſaid one of them, <hi>Damme he has Armour on, Cut his Throat.</hi> Immediately one kneeled down, and gave me ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cuts in the lower part of my Face, and I did what I could to defend my ſelf, but they have given me ſome indellible Marks, Characters that will never be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41248:10"/>
obliterated while I live, and I am afraid I ſhall never be my ſelf again by reaſon of the Bruiſes in my Head and Breaſt. By a Candle in a Window, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in Sir <hi>Timothy Baldwin</hi>'s Houſe, and ſome Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in his Yard, gave them the firſt diſturbance, and a Boy coming by with a Link the ſame time, I both ſaw the Face of the Priſoner at the Bar again, and remembred I ſaw him in the Lane juſt before. They then pulled the Cloak from off me, and I ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Light, and being eaſed of the Weight, I ſtrayn'd all my ſtrength and cryed out, and then ſome Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny came in, who are here to prove it; but ſeeing me all Blood and Dirt, they ſtood gazing on me a time, but at laſt took me up, and carried me into the <hi>Sugar-Loaf,</hi> and from thence I was carried to my Lodging, where all the Company I left came to me, and a Chirurgeon was ſent for, who is alſo here to prove his knowledge of the Condition he found me in. And when they went away, they did not ſteal away as other Malefactors uſe to do, but clapt their Swords cloſe to their Bodies and went away laughing aloud. But as they were going, one of them ſaid theſe words, <hi>Now you Dog pray for, or pray again for the Soul of Captain</hi> Evans. Captain <hi>Evans</hi> was a Jeſuite, and was Executed at <hi>Cardiffe</hi> for being a Prieſt; and I have been informed by ſeveral Perſons of good Quality, that when the under Sheriff came to give him No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that he had a Warrant for his ſpeedy Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the ſaid <hi>Evans</hi> being in a Game at Tennis, ſaid <hi>God Damme I will play out my Sett firſt.</hi>

                  <p>And Firſt, my Lord, In Anſwer to the Evidence that hath been given, There have been Sworn among others, Mr. <hi>Richmond,</hi> Mr. <hi>Phillips,</hi> and one <hi>Powel.</hi> Firſt as to <hi>Phillips</hi>'s Evidence, of what paſſed in Diſcourſe at the <hi>Crown Tavern</hi> in <hi>Covent Garden</hi>; we have a Witneſs here who vvas preſent at the ſame time, that will give you an Account of the whole Diſcourſe, and that there were no ſuch words ſaid by <hi>Giles</hi> in Relation to Mr. <hi>Arnold, As Dam him he had Armour on</hi>; and as to the Evidence given by <hi>Watkins,</hi> of what paſt at <hi>

they came to <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> though it was at the time of the General Quarter Seſſions, yet they ſtaid there four or five hours, at a Publique Houſe without the leaſt ſign of their Apprehenſion of any Purſuit; which ſhews the Improbability of any ſuch Diſcourſe at <hi>

We ſhall prove further, if my Brief be true, by five or ſix ſubſtantial Witneſſes, againſt whom there can be no Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how and where he imployed himſelf all that day, from the Minute that he came to Town: And that when he returned to his Inn, about Nine a Clock at Night, the Maid of the Inn Lockt his Chamber door after he was a Bed, and kept the Key of the Chamber all Night. And my Lord, if all this be clearly proved, I make no doubt but your Lordſhip and the Jury and all Perſons here, will be ſatisfied that the Priſoner at the Bar is not guilty of this Indictment.

               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:41248:22"/>
               <head>Then Sir <hi>GEORGE JEFFREYS</hi> the <hi>Recorder,</hi> gave Directions to the <hi>Jury</hi> to this Effect:</head>
               <p>GEntlemen of the Jury, the Evidence has been very long, and I know you have taken parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular care to Write down and take Notice of all the Circumſtances that have been offer'd to you in this Caſe: According to the beſt of my Memory, I ſhall refreſh yours with ſuch of them as I apprehend to be moſt material in this Cauſe; and if any thing happen to be omitted, others will ſupply it.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place I am to take Notice, and I think I am bound to do it, in diſcharge of my own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and of my Duty to the Court, that certainly if the Priſoner at the Bar be guilty of the Offence of which he now ſtands Indicted; the Puniſhment that we can inflict upon him, cannot be proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to the Offence: For the Offence is too great for any Puniſhment that the Law can Inflict, for Men are not preſumed to be guilty of ſuch Actions as this; and therefore the Law has not proportioned Puniſhments to them, becauſe it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes no man to be guilty of ſo baſe and barbarous an Action as this; and becauſe it never could be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed that any Man would be guilty of ſuch Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, therefore the Law has not provided Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments proportionable to them. But this is not your queſtion, the queſtion before you is, Whether this Man be Guilty or not Guilty? That there was a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Plot, no Man ſure doubts at this time aday. Certainly there can be none here under ſo ſtrange an
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41248:23"/>
infatuation, as in the leaſt to doubt but that there was a Plot; eſpecially, when ſo many perſons upon full and clear Evidence and Tryals, have been Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed as Inſtruments in that Bloody Tragedy. But you are not to make uſe of theſe things by way of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt the Priſoner at the Bar: But only in the general to premiſe ſome things by way of Intra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to their particular Evidence, and I muſt plainly tell you (for it is fit it ſhould be mention'd) that if any Villany can come near that Horrid Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> this does; and I am ſorry with all my heart, that within the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the City of <hi>London,</hi> or ſo near it, there ſhould be ſuch a barbarous Attempt as this made and concealed ſo long. It would not be ſtrange to hear of ſuch Villanies committed in other Popiſh Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: but for the Honour and Credit of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which I hope we ſhall maintain with our lives, that is, the Proteſtant Religion, I ſay in a Proteſtant Countrey, where the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is Profeſt, I never heard of ſuch a barbarous Act committed before this one; becauſe our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our Religion will not allow us to commit ſuch Villanies by any Diſpenſation whatſoever. Juſtice and Truth, and Righteouſneſs, are the things that our Religion Teaches us. God Almighty, and our Bleſſed Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, by whom alone all Mankind muſt be Saved; have commanded the contrary.</p>
               <p>Their Religion may diſpenſe with ſuch Villain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Actions; but this I can ſay in Vindication of ours, ours cannot do it; nay it would be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion if it could.</p>
               <p>In the next place, Gentlemen, all Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Time and Place, of Men and Things, ſhould be taken notice of; for dark Caſes muſt be made appear by Circumſtances: For as I hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, no body calls Witneſſes when they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41248:23"/>
do ſuch Facts and Works of darkneſs, the Works of the Devil, that is the Father of all ſuch Works. I do not mean the Devil, Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> but I mean they are the Works of the Devil. <hi>Belzebub</hi> himſelf, the Prince of Devils, can be only an Inſtrument and an Agent in Affairs of this Nature.</p>
               <p>Another thing that is fit to be taken notice of by you, is this, That by way of Circumſtance, whatever has been ſaid one way or another, relating to the Plot, relating to the buſineſs of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> is not to be taken notice of, as Evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Priſoner. You ſhall have a Faithful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what has been ſaid by every Witneſs, both for and againſt him; for right is to be done. Our Law comes even to a Proverb, we muſt give the Devil his due; we muſt give every body right. You know that this buſineſs was deferr'd, that the Priſoner at the Bar might be left without all manner of Excuſe; for if Innocent, all Mankind would be glad to have him cleared; if Guilty every honeſt Man would have him convicted. Now this being premiſed, the Evidences againſt the Priſoner are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral, and I will as far as I can, give you an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them. And</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, It is not doubted but Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> has behaved himſelf like an honeſt Man, and as every honeſt Man ought to do for the Intereſt of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; for there is no Man can do too much, if he does it Legally for the Preſervation of his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; of that Religion which he is bound to rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Salvation of his Immortal Soul. Now, ſays Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> in the firſt place he gives an honeſt Account of his being one Night, on Thurſday Night in <hi>Eaſter</hi> Week, at the <hi>Devil</hi> Tavern, about Nine or Ten a Clock with ſome Friends, and he went out between Ten and Eleven a Clock, and his own Servant not being there; he did intend to call ſome other Servants by. But as it happen'd, he went away without them, and he perceived Two Men in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign Cloaks follow him into <hi>Bell-Yard.</hi> He does
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41248:24"/>
take it upon his Oath, that about the middle of the Lane, there happen'd to be a Candle coming out, and one of theſe two, that he did ſo obſerve to dog him, having a Campaigne Cloak upon him, and likewiſe a Coat Lin'd with Red, he did obſerve came before him; and he doth take it upon his Oath, that he does believe the Priſoner at the Bar to be that very Man that ſo came before him; he does ſay that he had a perfect ſight of him, and he does ſay that the reaſon why he ſhould believe him to be the Man, is, that he does remember his Face, and he knew his Voice. He tells you likewiſe that there were perſons caſt a Cloak over his head, ran him into <hi>Jackanapes-lane,</hi> fell upon him, bruiſed his Head, and Wounded him in ſeveral places; particularly he mentions that there was at the ſame time, ſaid by one of them, <hi>Pray for the Soul of Captain</hi> Evans; and at the ſame time, which is a wonderful Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>Dam the Dog he has got Armour on, cut his Throat.</hi> He ſays that one Man held him up by the Chin, having ſeveral paſſes made at him, and he ſays he had ſomething or other to preſerve him; but notwithſtanding that, he was run into the ſide, There was three Men he does tell you, and that one overtook him in <hi>Bell-Yard,</hi> and he continues to Swear it was the Priſoner at the Bar, according to the beſt of his underſtanding and Conſcience; he ſays it was he, and he diſcovered him by the ſight of a Candle. Beſides this, which is a material Circumſtance, ſome other Perſons being brought to Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> about it, Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> did not Tax them; but did poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Tax that Perſon to be one of the Perſons. But he tells you he ſuffer'd by paſſion, as I cannot blame any Man for being in a paſſion at ſuch a time. But his Witneſſes determine the thing, that that is the Man, and he did poſitivly ſay it, his Memory being better ſettled then he could at firſt pretend to; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he gives that for another Evidence, that he was not deceived in the Perſon. This is the ſubſtance as I remember, I would not do any Injury to the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41248:24"/>
Priſoner, by repeating any thing that has not been ſaid; nor would I do any injury to the Evidence for the King, in omitting any thing that occurs to me. The next is one <hi>Phillips,</hi> and he tells you that the next day being Friday, about Six or Seven a Clock at Night, he happen'd to be in company with him at an houſe in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> and having ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning <hi>Arnold,</hi> and concerning that bloody, baſe, and foul Attempt that was made upon him, he was ſo far from having the Bowels of an Engliſh Man, or any thing of Chriſtianity in him, that he does ſay he broke out into this extravagant Expreſſion, ſaying, <hi>Dam him, Rot him, he had Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour on, Dam him, Rot him, he had Armour on:</hi> I ſpeak it Twice over, becauſe Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> tells you that the Perſons, during the Fact was committing, ſaid, <hi>Damme Cut his Throat, he has Armour on.</hi> The next perſon comes and tells you, at a certain place in <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouthſhire</hi> upon the 5th of <hi>May</hi> following, that he went with one of the <hi>Richmonds</hi> to this <hi>Giles,</hi> and had ſome diſcourſe: Says he, <hi>How chance you have not been as good as your Word, about providing me Horſe-hair to make Fiſhing-lines, and you promiſed to leave it at a Farriers in</hi> Gloceſter? How chance it was not ſo? He immediately adds, <hi>We were in ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary haſt, becauſe we thought we were purſued about the buſineſs of</hi> Arnold. And that he gives as the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he did not ſtay at <hi>Gloceſter.</hi> If in caſe it had not been ſo, why ſhould he come and tell him he could not ſtay about the buſineſs of the Hair, becauſe he was like to be purſued about the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Arnold.</hi> The next thing, Gentlemen, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning one <hi>Powel; Powel,</hi> he tells you, that he being at one <hi>Darcies</hi> houſe, a Roman Catholick, that is a Sword Cutler that lives, I think likewiſe, at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ske.</hi> And it ſeems the Priſoner at the Bar came to him to have his Sword mended. By the way I ſhould have told you that the Priſoner at the Bar before the Fact was done, did enquire at a place where he might have a good Rapier: that was before the Fact was done.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41248:25"/>
The Witneſs ſpake of it laſt, which was the occaſion that I did not give it you in order. He asked where he might have a good Rapier?</p>
               <p>But now to come to <hi>Darcy, Darcy</hi> having been very familiar with him, inquired, Wherefore, having had his Sword ſo lately, he ſhould have it to mend already? <hi>Have you,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>been fighting with the Devil?</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon that he ſwears the Priſoner return'd, <hi>No, but with dam'd</hi> Arnold. And upon that his Wife pluckt him by the Coat, and bid him hold his Tongue. I think that is the ſubſtance of what he ſwears. He ſays there were by at that time the Priſoner at the Bar, the Apprentice to this <hi>Darcy,</hi> and a Woman, that is the Priſoners Wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Richmond</hi> he comes and gives you a further Account, That he being in his company; he tells you, They went to ſome place in the City to inquire after their Friends, and afterwards went to the <hi>Artillery</hi> to ſee the Exerciſe, then to <hi>Long-lane,</hi> from thence to <hi>Whetſtones-Park,</hi> and afterwards to <hi>Drury-lane</hi>; and that about Nine a Clock at Night they came to their Inn, and he left <hi>Giles</hi> taking a Pipe of Tobacco in the Kitchin, and went up into his Chamber with ſome other People drinking and making merry; and he does poſitively ſay that between Eleven and Twelve a Clock at Night, he ſaw the Servant Maid come up into the Room, and did ſee ſhe was making the Bed; that he ſeem'd to be a little ſurprized that any Body ſhould make a Bed at that time of Night; which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned him to go in to her, and ask her the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. The Anſwer that he had was very Material, that ſhe ſaid, <hi>There is a Gentleman below that I muſt make this Bed for, he does not deſire to have any body lie with him.</hi> That was the Anſwer the Maid gave. There was, he ſays ſome little talk of love between him and the Maid, and that he poſitively ſays was near upon Twelve a Clock. He ſays that after this, he went into his own Chamber, and continued in his own Chamber till nigh One, and about One, being pulling off his Breeches, the Priſoner at the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41248:25"/>
Bar came and knocked at his Chamber door and ſpake to him; and that was near One a Clock at Night. But it is plain, during that time the Priſoner was not in his Chamber, if you believe him; nor indeed is there any Account given of the Priſoner from Nine a Clock till near One, till he knockt at his door, as he was pulling off his Breeches and going to Bed. As to the Anſwers that are given by the Witneſſes of the other ſide, I ſhall give you them, when I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to give you the Teſtimonies of the other ſide.</p>
               <p>To give you yet this further Teſtimony, ſay they, We do not only give you this Teſtimony that he is guilty of this Fact, but we do give you an Account of him, that he is very likely to do ſuch a thing; for he is an Ill Man in himſelf. As on the other ſide, no man can give a better Teſtimony to himſelf in matters that are dark and obſcure, than the Teſtimony of his Converſation, that he is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in his Converſation; and therefore cannot be thought guilty of ſo baſe an Action: So, they think they give a good Evidence againſt him, that he is an Ill Man in himſelf; and therefore becauſe he is an Ill Man, he may be guilty of ſuch a thing. And to prove that, they call up theſe Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, one <hi>Bridges</hi> comes and gives you an Account, that diſcourſing with him concerning the Papiſts, he damn'd the Plot, and ſaid that all were Raſcalls that were not Papiſts; and if in caſe that the Lords that were in the Tower ſhould happen to ſuffer, it would be a Bloody day, and it would make bloodier work in <hi>England</hi> than ever was known: Which ſhews he is a Bloody Ill Man. The Priſoner ask'd him, If he were not a Papiſt? Its likely he was a Papiſt before, or he would not have truſted him ſo. And this is one Circumſtance to prove that he is an Ill Man, that he hath given out ſuch and ſuch Expreſſions.</p>
               <p>There is another, one <hi>Reynolds,</hi> who comes and gives you an Account of his having ſome Diſcourſe with him afterwards about this Buſineſs of Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold,</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:41248:26"/>
that the Priſoner talked ſlightly of it, and ſaid that he might do it himſelf.</p>
               <p>This, Gentlemen, I take in general to be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what hath been offer'd for the King. If there be any thing elſe that doth not occurr to my Memory, if it doth to yours, you will do well to conſider of it.</p>
               <p>Say the Council for the Defendant, and that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man of the Long Robe ought to ſay, that if the Perſon, which is the Priſoner at the Bar, were guilty of ſuch a barbarous thing as this, no man would offer to open his Mouth. And therefore they offer Evidence for their Client as they are inſtructed to offer to you; and you are to try whether their Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent be guilty.</p>
               <p>Say they, You firſt call one <hi>Phillips</hi> to give an Account, and as to what <hi>Phillips</hi> ſays about the buſineſs in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> about <hi>Dam' him, and Rot him,</hi> they bring one that was there all the time, and ſays he, <hi>I was by all the time, and I heard no ſuch words.</hi> So far was he from making any particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> that he cried it was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry horrible, a very barbarous thing. Nay, ſays he, to give Credit to this Teſtimony of his, I never uſe to keep company with them that uſe ſuch words, as, <hi>Damn him, and Rot him</hi>; as he ſays.</p>
               <p>The next Witneſs, is Mr. <hi>Herbert Jones,</hi> he comes and tells you, I went wiith him from <hi>London,</hi> I went with him to <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> I ſtaid at an Inn call'd the <hi>Old-Bear,</hi> and ſtaid and dined with him there. I went after that to the <hi>New-Bear,</hi> we went thither and drank Cyder together; and this was very pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick: for ſeveral perſons that lived in the Town came to us, and enquired after the buſineſs of <hi>Arnold</hi>; and if in caſe we had been under any ſuch Jealouſy as that was, we would not have ſtaid ſo long, as ſays he, we did. Say they on the other ſide, we do not ſay that you did not ſtay in <hi>Gloceſter</hi>; but, ſay they, by way of Objection againſt the Priſoner at the Bar, we ſay that you your ſelf, on the Fifth
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41248:26"/>
of <hi>May,</hi> ſaid, in Anſwer to the Perſon that came to ask you, Why you had not brought the Hair, that he might go a Fiſhing? You ſaid, We durſt not ſtay, for fear of purſuit upon the Account of Mr. <hi>Arnold.</hi> This you your ſelf ſaid, and by ſaying ſo, you have contracted that guilt in point of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, which is objected by us againſt you. This is the Anſwer given to that that Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> ſays.</p>
               <p>The next Perſon that comes to give you an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, is one <hi>John Jones,</hi> who is the Apprentice: Says he, you bring a Witneſs againſt me that I ſaid ſuch a thing at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ske,</hi> at <hi>Darcy</hi>'s the Sword Cutlers, and you ſay the Apprentice was by: And he gives you this Evidence: Says he, I was by at ſuch a time as the man ſpeaks of, and being by at that time, I do very well remember, that there was a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning ſome great Conflict that Mr. <hi>Giles</hi> had been in, and that <hi>Giles</hi>'s Wife was by, and ſo was t'other Perſon that gave the Evidence that ſuch a Diſcourſe there was of fighting with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; but now he inverts the ſaying of t'other man, and ſays that he ſhould ſay, <hi>He never met with</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold <hi>the Devil.</hi> The one anſwers, when the thing was asked him, Whether he had been fighting with the Devil? <hi>No, not with the Devil, but with</hi> Arnold. The other ſwears, <hi>He did not meet with the Devil</hi> Arnold. He tells you likewiſe his Wife did not pull him by the Cloaths, and bid him hold his Tongue.</p>
               <p>The next Witneſs is <hi>Howel,</hi> and he gives you an Account that he came with him to Town; he gives you an Account how he ſtaid with him, and came along with him till Nine a Clock at Night: for he does not pretend to give you an Account after Nine.</p>
               <p>Then comes <hi>Crook,</hi> and <hi>Crook,</hi> that is the Maid Servant; ſhe ſays, I cannot poſitively tell you when he came in, but I will poſitively ſay that I made his Bed about Ten, and before Eleven I asked him about
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41248:27"/>
his Candle, he bid me lock the door, and he would put out the Candle himſelf; and ſhe went away and left the Candle. And that is very material; for the time this Fact was committed, was between Ten and Eleven. This is what the Maid ſays. Now there is this Anſwer to what ſhe ſwears. She firſt of all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got that ever <hi>Richmond,</hi> that ſpeaks concerning the Breeches and other Circumſtances, that ever he was there at all: but you hear he has refreſhed her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory with a Love Story, that he was in the Room, and ſhe does agree in theſe very Circumſtances he ſpeaks of: ſo that that gives credit to the Teſtimony of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and puts a diſparagment upon her Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, ſince ſhe could be ſo exceeding forgetful, as not to remember ſuch a Circumſtance.</p>
               <p>The next is an Old Woman, and ſhe ſwears point-blank ſhe was with him moſt part of the day; and that ſhe was with him at Dinner, and was with him till Nine of the Clock at Night, and then went to Bed. And though ſhe ſeem'd to differ and blunder in ſome part of her Teſtimony, becauſe ſhe knew nothing of his going into <hi>Longlane</hi> and other places; however ſhe gives an Account about the time of Nine a Clock, that ſhe left him in the Kitchin, and then ſhe went to Bed.</p>
               <p>The next Witneſs is <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>James</hi> doth poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively ſwear that he was drinking with him in the Kitchin, till paſt Twelve a Clock at Night; but that cannot be true, if the Wench that made the Bed, ſwear true: for ſhe ſwears ſhe made the Bed before Ten, and he went to bed before Eleven; ſo that he could not be a-bed before Eleven if he ſwears true: and he could not be in the Kitchin at Twelve a Clock, if ſhe ſwears true.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, <hi>Richmond</hi>'s Man he gives you no further an Account than what runs ſquare to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Teſtimony, that he left him at Nine a Clock at Night, and he heard him call at his Maſters Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber about Twelve; and ſo they punctually agree. But he gives no manner of Account where he was
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41248:27"/>
between Nine and Twelve, between which hours this Fact was done.</p>
               <p>Next Gentlemen, There have been ſome more Witneſſes called for the Priſoner at the Bar, who give you an acount where he was before ſuch time as he came to his Lodging. Now it is not denied on either ſide, but that he might be till within Night at that Houſe they ſpeak of; but the Account that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be given of this Matter, is to know where he was between Nine a Clock and Twelve, when this Fact was committed.</p>
               <p>Theſe, Gentlemen, according as it occurs to me, are the ſubſtantial parts of the Evidence, both on the one ſide and the other. The Matter therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves it ſelf within this narrow compaſs, If upon what you have heard from Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> attended with the reſt of the Circumſtances that you have heard ſworn by the Witneſſes, you do believe the Priſoner at the Bar is guilty: for he might be at his Lodging at Nine a Clock, and he might be at his Lodging at Twelve or One, and yet he might do this Fact: for it is certain it was not a ſudden Matter, for it was a thing done preparedly; and therefore you muſt not expect that men that are guilty of ſuch barbarous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns as this, will lay their Deſigns open. To be ſure, whoever it was did this Fact upon Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> they would do it ſo as to make themſelves appear as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent as could be. It is not a Matter to be relied on, that becauſe this man was Innocent in St. <hi>Martins lane,</hi> therefore he did not do this thing in <hi>Bell Yard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is another Circumſtance againſt the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at the Bar, that he ſhould imagine, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, that Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> had wounded himſelf; but when he found that that was not very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that a Man could wound himſelf ſo, by reaſon of ſeveral places that he received his Wounds in, he would have it, that though he did not do it himſelf, yet ſome of his Friends might. Indeed if he be guilty, ſome of his Relations might do it: but certainly he was no Friend that did it. It is againſt
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41248:28"/>
Nature for any man to believe, that any Perſon ſhould put himſelf to ſo much trouble; if he had a mind to diſpatch himſelf, he might have done it with much more eaſe, and not have put himſelf to that trouble: For Men, when they have a mind to do the buſineſs, they do not uſe to take ſuch a deal of pains to ſtabb themſelves here and there.</p>
               <p>Thus, Gentlemen, the Evidence being very long, and the Circumſtances very many, things may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to you, that do not at preſent to me. Yet I muſt tell you again in a Matter of Publick Example, the Proof ought to be very great, to convict a Man of ſuch an Offence: but you muſt not expect it ſhould be ſo clear, as in a Matter of Right between Man and Man, and of things that are done in the Face of the Sun. It was done in the dark. The Devil that ſet them a-work, does fill them with Cunning enough to keep this Attempt as concealed as may be: And therefore Circumſtances of this Nature muſt be wonderfully conſidered: An Account of which Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> himſelf gives you, and he does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in his Conſcience the Priſoner at the Bar to be the Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THe Jury with-drew, and having debated together about half an hour, returned, and brought the Priſoner in</hi> Guilty. <hi>Which done, the Court adjourned till the Saturday following, the Seventeenth of</hi> July: <hi>At which time the Court being ſate,</hi> John Giles <hi>was brought to the Bar, to whom the Right Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipful
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41248:28"/>
Sir</hi> George Jeffreys, <hi>delivered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to this Effect:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>YOU the Priſoner at the Barr, you have been In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted for a very Vile Offence; an Offence in its Nature that deſerves a greater Puniſhment than the Law can inflict upon any ſuch Offences. There is a Jury has Convicted you of this Crime, againſt whom, had you had any Objection, you might have made your Challenge. And now you ſtand convicted here, it is only the Duty of the Court to pronounce that Judgment againſt you, which they think may be reaſonable to inflict upon ſuch an Offender. For I muſt needs ſay, It was one of the baſeſt and moſt barbarous Actions, that Mankind could poſſibly be Guilty of; an Action of ſo much filth and baſeneſs, that the Law could not fore-ſee any Man would be Guilty of; and therefore hath not made proviſion for a Puniſhment proportionable to it. But in as much as we underſtand by Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> you have a charge of Children, therefore the Court takes ſome Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; not that they think to extend any mercy to you for your own ſake, but a regard they think they are bound to have for thoſe that have not offended; but we ought to have a care to let the World know we do not intend only a puniſhment to the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but by that to terrifie all other People from being Guilty of ſuch extraordinary Villanies. And becauſe they will have regard to your poſterity, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do not think fit to put ſo great a Fine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you as this Fact does deſerve. But on the other ſide, they have thought fit you ſhould be made an Example of, and that you ſhould ſuffer as great a Corporal Puniſhment as the Law will allow. And therefore in the Name of the Court, I do Pronounce this to be your Sentence:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:41248:29"/>
                  <hi>THat you be put in the Pillory towards</hi> Lincolns-Inn Fields, <hi>as near the place where this barbarous Fact was committed, as may be; and there you are to ſtand from the hour of</hi> Twelve <hi>till</hi> One, <hi>one day, at Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day: And on another day from the hour of</hi> Twelve <hi>till</hi> One, <hi>over againſt</hi> Grays-Inn <hi>in</hi> Holbourn. <hi>And another day between the ſame hours, juſt by the</hi> May-Pole <hi>in the</hi> Strand. <hi>Theſe three ſeveral days you are to ſtand in the Pillory, and to have a Paper put upon your Hatt, whereby it ſhall be ſignified, the Offence of which you ſtand convicted. And next, to deter all others from committing the like, the Court does think fit likewiſe to award, That you ſhould pay to the</hi> King <hi>the Sum of</hi> Five hundred Pounds, <hi>and that you be committed in Execution, till ſuch time as you pay that Money. And becauſe it is both to be a Puniſhment to you, and a Terror to all other ſuch Villains, you are to find Sureties for your</hi> Good Behaviour <hi>during Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sentence being pronounc'd, and the Priſoner removed from the Bar, <hi>Richard Cavanaugh</hi> was brought to the Bar, and prayed to be diſcharged: But was by Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> charged with threatning one <hi>Phillip Staneright,</hi> one of the Kings Witneſſes; for which reaſon, and for that alſo a new Evidence was come in againſt the ſaid <hi>Cavenaugh,</hi> with ſome far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41248:29"/>
Charge relating to Mr. <hi>Arnold's</hi> Buſineſs, the Court thought fit, for want of Bail, to continue him a Priſoner.</p>
               <p>Then Mr <hi>Herbert</hi> appeared, and prayed to be diſcharged from his Recognizance to appear at the <hi>Old-Baily</hi>; but being accuſed by a Woman for cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her Whore, Jade, and very ill Names, and holding up his Staff at her, and threatning to beat her, for being a Witneſs againſt his Friend <hi>Giles</hi>; as alſo for taking away her Horſe as ſhe was going to the Mill, and the reaſon was, becauſe ſhe was to be a Witneſs in <hi>London</hi> againſt <hi>Giles.</hi> But ſhe being a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Woman, and none appearing that would be bound to proſecute him for it, he was not bound o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to anſwer it, till another Complaint came in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, which was immediately made by Mr. <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard</hi> and another Gentleman; who charged Mr. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> That, in Whitſon-week laſt, upon a Diſcourſe for Chuſing Knights of the Shire for <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and the ſaying of one in the company, that it was thought Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> would ſtand for it, Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> ſhould make anſwer, I will circumciſe the other ſide of his Cheek firſt, or he muſt have the other ſide of his Cheek circumciſed firſt. Upon which the Court ordered he ſhould not be diſcharged, but remain bound upon the former Recognizance to appear there next Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And the Recorder gave him ſeveral ſharp Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions for his malicious and unmanly Words and Proceedings. This being the ſecond of the Kings Witneſſes, and a Woman that he had barbarouſly treated; ſtill paſſionately giving the reaſon, that they were Witneſſes againſt his Friend <hi>John Giles,</hi> as it was proved on Oath before the Court by ſeveral Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>Then Sir <hi>Thomas Allen</hi> acquainted the Court that a Gentleman had informed him the day before, that Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> told him that Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> wounded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and cut his own Throat; which the Court lookt upon as an high effect of a malicious ingratitude, Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> having beſought his Majeſty, when Mr. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:41248:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was in <hi>Newgate,</hi> to have his Releaſe. Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold</hi> replied, That Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> had been more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to his Majeſty, who had graciouſly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned him greater Offences, and lately: for he had ſpoken worſe of his Majeſties Perſon and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than he had done of him, as it had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before his Majeſty; and of which he believed his Majeſty was well ſatisfied. The Court told Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> he was a ſhame to all Engliſhmen, and bound him by Recognizance to appear and anſwer this Offence at the Kings Bench Bar the Firſt day of the next Term.</p>
