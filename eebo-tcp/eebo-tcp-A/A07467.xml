            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The History comprized within this Booke, doth for sundry reasons apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto you. First, because those things which in themselues are great, rare, or admirable, doe properly belong to great perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, and your Maiesty is the greatest Queene and Princesse of our age. Secondly, for that your name seated in the highest place of the entry of this History, may occasion Princes, Lords, and Gentlemen, to take the paines to reade ouer the same, which will aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and profit them as much, as any booke that hath been published these many yeeres. The third reason (which is grounded vpon the two former) is, that our little King your sonne will proue another <hi>Iosias,</hi> who was crowned and made King of Israel at eight yeeres of age, yet neuerthelesse became the most pious King that euer was in Israel: who did parallel <hi>Dauid</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in sanctity, crushed all manner of Idolatry that for so long space was hatched amongst the people, broake downe their Idols, and put to death all Magicians and worshippers of <hi>Baal.</hi> Neither doe I slenderly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture this, because that since his raigne euen at the very first entrance vnto his Crowne, there hath been

made an admirable discouery of Magicians and of the kingdome of Satan, by the extraordinary proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God. <hi>Henry</hi> the Great his deceased father and our so much desired King, gaue the first light and life thereof vnto him, who would rather die then giue credence vnto Mag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cians: cleane opposite to <hi>Saul,</hi> who did affect rather to make his addresse to such men, then to hazard himselfe any way to danger. To which may bee added that our present King gaue the first grace and pardon vnto her, who by seducements be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Princesse of Magicians: God hauing through his mercy touched her heart, and conuerted her vnto him, as he will doe all those, that of their owne accord doe make acknowledgement of their impieties: which is the most proper remedy to bring the said kingdome of Satan to vtter confusion, and to attract and winne in his adherents and complices to the true knowledge of God; Neither can hee better assure his state and kingdome then by this meanes.<note place="margin">

                     </note> King <hi>Saul</hi> was dis-inuested thereof, because he went to a Witch. And God was stirred vp to wrath against King <hi>Manasses,</hi> in that hee countenanced Magicians and Sorcerers. Vpon the like occasion was the great City of Babylon ruined,<note place="margin">

                     </note> The fourth and last reason is, because that in this History, our late King <hi>Henry</hi> the great is mentioned not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grert Attributes of honour and praise; God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing accepted of his piety and good desires as a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,

and his death as a kind of Martyrdome. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, I am not ignorant, that some will heere alleage, that it is not expedient to beleeue all that is written in this History, and that it was not so fitly managed, to put this booke in print, by reason of the inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which may arise thereupon.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Riendly Reader, When first I made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to put this History in Print, I found two sorts of men, that were of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry opinion. The first had the faire cloak and couerture of Scripture, saying that wee must not beleeue nor giue credence to the Diuell, vpon which (say they) all this History is founded. The second as more eagle-sighted then the former, alleage, that it is vnsitting to put it forth, to auoid thereby the scandall of many (especially of those that are strayed from the Catholicke faith) which they will take at the publishing of this booke, when they shall vnderstand that these things were done by a Priest. To these two points I answere, that as touching the former, Iesus Christ himselfe doth giue vs the resolution thereof, when speaking of the Diuell he saith, that of a certainty there was no truth in him from the beginning of his fall; but hee giueth a restriction and limitation to his Axiome,<note place="margin">Iohn 8.</note> adding immediately these words, <hi>Cum ex pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prijs loquitur, mendax est,</hi> that is to say, when he speaketh from himselfe, and of his owne accord, it is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, he is alwaies a liar, euer endeauouring to worke mans preiudice and destruction; but the case is altered, when being inforced and adiured in the efficacy of the name of God, hee speaketh and answereth to exorcis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.<note place="margin">Marc. 5.</note> This wee see verified in the Gospell, when Iesus Christ would vse his authority ouer the Diuels; as when they cried with a loud voice worshipping him,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nemo poterat cum domare, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenas disrumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, &amp; compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des diminuebat &amp; videns le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum à longè cucurrit &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidens.

                     </note> What haue wee to doe with thee Iesus the Sonne of the high
<pb facs="tcp:7439:4"/>
God? I charge thee by the same God (said one of them) that thou doe not torment me; and earnestly besought him not to cast him out of that region, nor into the bottomlesse pit of hell, but to suffer them all to enter into the heard of swine. And Iesus Christ demanding the Diuell that spake and was the chiefe of them what his name was; he answered, my name is <hi>Legion,</hi> for wee are many. In which we may obserue two remarkeable points; first that Christ Iesus being adiured by the name of God, although it was done by a Diuell, yet from the respect and reuerence which hee did beare to God his father, condescended vnto the request of this Diuell and all his companions: as in the like occasion, being semblably charged by <hi>Caiphas</hi> to declare whether hee were the Sonne of God or no, hee then answered more cleerely and amply then at any time before, although hee well knew, that <hi>Caiphas</hi> was vncapable of that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, and would not make his aduantage of the same? What ought we then to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue of Diuels, being adiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the power of the name of God?<note place="margin">Vid, Acta. 16. Decemb. pag. Marc. 5. Luc. 8. Matth. 8.</note> shall they not deliuer the truth, when by the vertue of the same name, they are compelled to relinquish and abandon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of those, whom formerly they did possesse? The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point to be noted is, that vpon the interrogatories of Iesus Christ, they haue spoken and answered truely, and consequently they doe somtimes tell truth, not of their owne accord or motion, but vpon constraint and that of him who is powerfull to constraine them, to wit, Christ Iesus, and his Lieue-tenants that are endo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed with this power: to whom hee saith; I haue giuen you power to tread on Serpents and Scorpions,<note place="margin">

The old Testament doth not stick to say, that the euill

                     <note place="margin">1. Sam. 19.</note> besides tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, did prophesie also, that is to say, hee spake af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of Prophets, of things absent and hidden from the vnderstanding of men. Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in the 13. Homily vpon Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> giueth vs his reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of this pointe, inueighing against Atheists who deny the paines of bell. They are taught by the Deuils (saith he) who being full of pride will not confesse that they indure any torments, and being replenished with malice, would disswade vs from beleeuing it: yet are they oftentimes compelled (besides the confessions made by them in the Gospell) to say and confesse pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly the great torments which they suffer; and are constrained thereunto by the omnipotency of God, and the excessiuenesse of the torments wherewith they are punished: as a malefactor that is questioned extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, doth by the force of the tortures that are presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him, confesse the truth. If then the Atheists will not beleeue the Scriptures, God maketh the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils themselues to confesse it, and those (saith hee) that will not then beleeue are worse then Deuils.</p>
                  <p>For answere vnto the second, wee will make remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance vnto them, that by their reckoning the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture should net haue laid before vs the History of the yong Preists that were the sonnes of <hi>Hely</hi>:<note place="margin">1. Reg. 2.</note> who did snatch the flesh from the pots that belonged to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and did deflower the deuout women, that came into the Temple to watch there at night. Neither should the narration of the sinnes of <hi>Dauid</hi> who was a Prophet and father of the future Messias be set downe; much lesse should the Euangelists mention the treason of <hi>Iudas:</hi> which are so farre from ministring occasion of scandall vnto the people, that on the contrary, many wholesome doctrines tending much to edification may be drawne from thence. This is declared by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. ad Timoth. 2.</note> when hauing spoken of <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> that did scandalize the Church, hee addeth, <hi>The foundation of
<pb facs="tcp:7439:5"/>
God remaineth sure, and hath his seale on those that are his.</hi> Notwithstanding (saith he) is it not true, that in the house of a great Lord, there bee vessels of gold and vessels of siluer, vessels of wood and vessels of earth, destinated vnto diuers vses? If therefore any man purge himselfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ordures which are in the contemptible vessels, the same shall be a vessel of honour in the house of God. True it is that the vessels of greatest contempt and dishonour, are the wicked Preists: as for example <hi>Iudas</hi> in the Colledge of Christ Iesus, and <hi>Diacrus Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaus</hi> in the society of the Apostles; and the reasons thereof are apparent. First because of their great ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> which maketh the grace of God to depart farre from them, and consequently they are the more blinded by the working of the Deuill, <hi>Ingrati, scelesti</hi>; saith S. <hi>Paul.</hi> Another reason is, because they are more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious to Christ Iesus, as appeareth by Magicians. The third reason is, for that the corruption of those things that are excellent, is worse then the corruption of things lesse excellent, as the putrification of the blood is more pernicious then of any of the other humours. And this would <hi>Ieremy</hi> haue said in the vision of the two baskets of figges; the one being full of figges not onely good, but excellently good, and the other full of figges not onely naught, but extreamely naught, <hi>in por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta templi.</hi> And this is amply declared by Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epist. 117.</note> in an Epistle which he wrote vpon a suggestion against a Preist of his, who was accused of some soule crime. In the house of <hi>Adam</hi> (saith hee) there was <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi>

the house of his father; yea although himselfe was a Prophet and the author of some of the sacred and Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall writtes, yet did not the Deuill cease to gaine vpon him, and to cause him to present vnto him the sacrifices that were appointed for God. Finally Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> bringeth in the example of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and concludes, I haue by long experiences learned, that as there are not on the earth better Christians then good Preists, so on the contrary I neuer knew a Christian so euill as a wicked Preist.<note place="margin">Hiero. contra vigil.</note> To the same purpose speaketh Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> no man did euer disesteeme the Colledge of the Apostles, because <hi>Iudas</hi> plaid the villaine among them: no man euer misconceiued of the Quires of Angels, by reason of <hi>Lucifer</hi> and his confederates: but rather by their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy end we should learne to do well, and be strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the more in the Christian faith, when it commeth into our consideration, that the Deuill paineth not himselfe to draw a Minister to make his supper in a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, nor a Rabbin of the Iewes, nor a Musulman of the Turkes; for from hence can redound no ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vnto Christ Iesus, neither can he by this gaine in any thing in his pretensions, as he would by the assistance of a wicked Preist that doth consecrate the body of Christ Iesus. Neither doth God suffer such execrable villanies to passe without great and maruellous wonders (as shall be seene in this History) but discouereth all by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary meanes, of his vnbounded power, and doth inforce the Deuils themselues to make discouery and proclaime the same, to their vtter ruine and confusion. And from hence he ministreth matter and occasion vnto Hereticks to make acknowledgement of their Heresies: vnto Magicians to abiure and abandon their abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; vnto Catholicks to implant and establish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with better assurance in their faith. I haue made some Annotations in the margent vpon the pointes of greatest difficulty, because I would giue contentment vnto euery one. I must intreate the courteous reader of

                     </gap>tentimes of my selfe, and those that were with me; there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity for the doing of it, for the more ample verificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the History. Moreouer the courteous reader shall do wel to take heed, that in this History he do not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore giue credit to the Deuill, in that hee speaketh naught that is contrary to the Gospell and doctrine of the Church; but to giue credit to him then, when hee would set on foote some new and contrary doctrine. Besides he may obserue, that this tendeth not any way to the ouerthrow of the company of the Virgines of Saint Vrsula, for there is many times mention and repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition made in this History, that God hath made special election of them to confound and crush in peeces all magicke, and the abhorred villanies thereof, and that for compensation of the same, they shall be extolled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and before men. Furthermore the freindly reader will hold me excused for the rude and vnpollish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed phrase of this booke, I hauing a regard in a businesse of this nature to write rather truely then elegantly: hee may remember that the French Dialects are different, as it was in Greece when it most flourished; and that <hi>Aristotle</hi> with his harsh kind of writing was no lesse profitable, then <hi>Demosthenes</hi> with his Atticke phrase was pleasing: and the stile of the Gospell and of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is more powerfull with vs, then all the oratory of the world. Besides those that are possessed ordinarily spake their mother tongue, so that it was expedient for the more faithfull relation of the whole, to follow their vaine of speaking word for word. Hence it commeth, that the phrases of the natiue French tongue could not be alwayes obserued. The scope of this History is, the feare of God and his iudgements, the detestation of vice whereby the Maiesty of God is prouoked, and the auoiding of the paines of hell; more particularly, to cause in vs a loathing of that abominable sinne of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
<pb facs="tcp:7439:7"/>
which is perpetually committed in practising of Magick, and in the Schoole of Satan. In the recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all, there hath beene vsed great faithfulnesse, without any additions whatsoeuer; and the diligence that hath beene employed heerein may bee seene in the page of the actes of the eighth of Ianuary, and in the following page.</p>
                  <p>I haue suppressed this History for the space of a yeere and more, and made no account to haue had it publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; but the zeale of the Catholicke faith hath indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me thereunto, after I had once seene a letter missiue of Monsieur <hi>du Vic,</hi> wherein he aduertised, that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries of our faith did triumph in Rochel, when the depositions of the Magician, now in question, were put forth in print, where it is said, that the said Magician did celebrate Masse in the Synagogue. And thereupon they make an inference, that the Masse is a diabolicall thing, but doe not withall consider, that the Diuels aime is to vsurpe vpon the glory of God, and to inuade (as much as in him lyeth) the honour of his diuinity, that in conclusion hee may cause himselfe to bee adored as a God. For hee shamed not to demand it of Christ Iesus himselfe, saying vnto him, I will giue vnto thee all the kingdomes of the earth,<note place="margin">Matth 4.</note> if thou wilt worship me, that is to say, if thou wilt acknowledge mee to be the onely God and Creator of all things, as Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> doth interpret it: as also hee dared to abuse the sacred Scripture it selfe in the presence of Christ Iesus. To which purpose speaketh Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>: shewing that sacrifice appertaineth to God alone;<note place="margin">August, lib. 20. contra Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum Manich. c. 21.</note> as in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament (saith he) the sacrifice of the law, in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament the sacrifice of the true flesh of Christ on the Crosse: and after his ascension, the sacrifice made in the Sacrament, which is in commemoration of his death and passion; hee goeth on and saith. These are things which those proud spirits the Diuell and his Angels do openly chalenge and demand. And in the 4. booke of
<pb facs="tcp:7439:7"/>
the Trinity, chapter 13. about the end of the chapter hee saith, <hi>Non intelligunt ne ipsos quidem superbissimos spiritus honoribus sacrificiorum gaudere potuisse, nisi vni vero Deo, pro quo coli volunt, verum sacrificium debe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur.</hi> That is, Idolaters doe not vnderstand that these haughty spirits could not be so pleased with the honour of sacrifices, were it not that truesacrifice were due to the only true God, in whose steed they would be serued and honoured. Another inducement wherewith I was much mooued, was a booke in Latine lately printed in Paris, intituled <hi>Mimyca daemonum,</hi> compiled by <hi>Henry de Montaigne</hi> a gentleman of Languedoc L. of S. <hi>Iohn de la Coste,</hi> where in his precursory epistle he giueth to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that the occasion that gaue life and birth vnto this book (which doth intend to shew that in al ages the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel hath bin Gods ape, and vsurpes vpon his glory) is to beat flat that shallow, yet dangerous conclusion which the Ministers of Languedoc held touching the deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the said <hi>Gaufridy</hi>; adding these words, <hi>Nouato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in re tam leui insistunt, &amp; libellum confessionis praedicti Gaufridij à suis curant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Neither could it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise detected; for the truth of this could not sinke into their apprehensions that knew him, hee being after a strange manner by the aide and conuention of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell growne a couert and close hypocrite, and was after a stranger manner dis-masked and layd open by the omnipotency of God, whom the Diuels themselues are constrained to obey, when it is his good pleasure. The streame of this History runneth mainly on this point, to shew, that al tendeth to ampliate the glory of God vnto
<pb facs="tcp:7439:8"/>
vs, and to confirme our holy Catholick faith. Whence the courteous reader may also note, what regard God had of our Priest hood, when to conuert one Priest that had so strangely gone astray, hee did draw it on with such long and admirable solemnities. For matter of fact in this History, there is nothing to bee wondered at, which hath not beene obserued and published vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occurrences by three Inquisitours of Spaine in the yeere 1610.<note place="margin">Printed by Iohn de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gastonat Lon. grond.</note> which was the very yeere that this History was acted; and at the heeles of that followed another booke of the same nature, made by Monsieur <hi>d' Ancre,</hi> one of the Kings Counsell in the Parliament of Borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux.<note place="margin">The 6. booke and 3. discours pag. 459.</note> But the wonders were done in the person of him, who named himselfe and indeed was the Prince of all the rest in France, Spaine and Turky: and Monsieur <hi>d' Ancre</hi> doth write, that he found by the depositions of the Sorcerers of Biscaye, that one <hi>Lewes</hi> came &amp; taught them to accuse those that were innocent, to excuse the nocent, and to inueagle in as many sonnes and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to Satan as they could. So that the prouidence of God, hath been the true meanes to put to rout al the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Satan in this kinde, in that his Standard is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, and the very master of his campe trampled and troden vnder foote. Moreouer hee that will more narrowly consider the History of <hi>Balaam</hi> the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,<note place="margin">Numb. 22.</note> rehearsed in the booke of Numbers, will not think it strange which by assiduall experiments is verified of the Magicians and Witches of our time. For it is there said, that King <hi>Baelac</hi> being conscious to himselfe of his weakenesse to resist the army of Israel, sent to seek out <hi>Balaam</hi> as the greatest Magician of that Countrey, to charme and chaine vp the armes of the Israelits, and so to come to his purpose by this meanes. It is also recited in that History, that to make his charmes and maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions the more potent and effectuall, he caused seauen Altars to be built, and this was to sacrifice and inuocate the seauen Princes of the euill Spirits, which bare sway

These Altars were built to sacrifice a Bull and a sheepe vpon euery of them to these seauen Diuels (which was the very manner of sacrificing to God in the Law) and by these meanes to obteine of them that which he desired, <hi>Dabo sicadens adoraueris me.</hi> And because they sought to worke against the honour of God, and the publicke good of the Church by him that was the Prince of all the Magicians of the East, it is said, that God to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer and giue stoppage vnto such impiety against his Maiesty, and villany against his Church, did shew great and vnusuall wonders; to wit, that a good Angell did visibly appeare highly displeased, and exceedingly dreadfull, brandishing a sword in his hand, that an asse spake by as great a miracle, that the Sorcerer himselfe became a Prophet, God putting that into his mouth which was not in his heart, and he speaking oppositely vnto that which hee had determined, whereby Magick was by the Magician himselfe defeated and put to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion: to the end (saith S. <hi>Ambrose</hi>) that the perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of those that beleeued not in God, might by

If they could not haue had a power to speake a truth, S. <hi>Augustine</hi> had made these other more obstinate in their vnbeleese. S. <hi>Thomas</hi> in his <hi>Opusculum</hi> 17. cap. 10. answering to the fourth obiection of those that said, it was vnlawfull to receiue children into the orders of Religion, because that sometimes it proceedeth from the temptation of the Diuell, hee saith, that there is no danger to follow that which perhaps may be a temptation of the Diuell, so that it bee to a good end, with this prouision, that if the Diuell would afterwards wreath and wrest this to an euill purpose, as to scandalize or corrupt others, they doe not consent vnto the euill; otherwise the Diuell by this scruple may diuert vs from all goodnesse. Thus did S. <hi>Anthony</hi> practise who was well versed in this arte,<note place="margin">Anthanas. in vit. Anthonii. Ioan. Lorin in act. Apost, c. 16. vers. 17.</note> as <hi>Athanasius</hi> obserueth. And for resolution of all scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous doubts, a late Doctor of Prouince of the society of Iesus, called father <hi>Iohn Lorin</hi> hath prettily collected, that the Diuell may speake truth foure severall waies:
<pb facs="tcp:7439:9"/>
first to beguile those that are vnbeleeuers and faithlesse, because they may say, this is not true, for the Diuell saith it; as S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius</hi> haue noted vpon the 16. chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, where it is said, that <hi>Paul</hi> being with his associats in the city of <hi>Philippi,</hi> a maid hauing an euill Spirit vpon her, cryed after them and said, These men are the seruants of the high God, and doe shew vnto you the way of saluation. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> for a while suffered her to say this, thinking that it might bee auaileable vnto some; but when shee still continued on for many daies, hee grew angry, and conceiuing that this might be hurtfull vnto others, hee commanded him to come out of the maiden in the name of Christ Iesus, which he presently did. Secondly to flatter and collogue with the Exorcist, that he would cease to torment him, or to cast him out: which reason is also alleaged by S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> vpon the same passage saying,<note place="margin">Marc. 5.</note> that hee behaueth himselfe heerein as a guilty person before his Iudge, and a boy before his Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master, holding the rodde with his hands for feare of being scourged.<note place="margin">The discours of the history which is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully gathered shall giue you to vnderstand that the Diuell spake after this manner.</note> After this manner did a Diuell flatter Christ Iesus, saying, I pray thee torment me not Iesus, thou Sonne of God; in which hee spake the pure truth. Thirdly, (which is the most ordinary fashion) when they are enforced thereunto in despite of themselues, by the diuine and hidden prouidence of God, or in the vertue of his name by exorcismes; which reason is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged by the sweet and religious Poet <hi>Arator,</hi> in his Poems vpon the Acts of the Apostles, as also by vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Bede,</hi> and many others. Fourthly, hee speaketh truth to gaine thereby an opportunity to accuse and giue attestation against vnbeleeuing and impenitent men, before the throne of Gods iudgement. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon Saint <hi>Anthony</hi> rehearseth the history of a Diuell, that hauing taken on him the shape and habite of a Preacher, made a very good sharpe sermon, and in the end declared before them all, that hee was a wicked
<pb facs="tcp:7439:10"/>
Spirit permitted by God to accuse vnbeleeuing and vnrepentent persons before the tribunall of Gods iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The friendly Reader may be pleased to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard vnto two things; first that this is a History making a bare declaration of a fact, &amp; is no foundation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to build our faith, though it may serue very fitly to stirre vs vp to ponder vpon the iudgements of God. The other is, that hee take not in ill part the frequent repetition of things, for that it was expedient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse and fashion this History to the truth: although those very repetitions were so varied and expressed with such vehemence, that they were neither vnfruitfull nor superfluous to the standers by, but did raise in them such passions, that they cast forth many sighes and teares, God for his goodnesse touch and make tender all our hearts by those many meanes and remedies, which he hath bestowed vpon vs.</p>

Hee fell into it, by reading a certaine booke in written hand, where there was French verses with diuers cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters: and this was found by him amongst the bookes of an Vnkle of his, that died some yeeres past; so that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion the Diuell did visibly appeare vnto him in a humane shape, and said. What wilt thou with me, for thou hast cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me? And after some discourse, the said <hi>Lewes Gaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fridi</hi> said vnto him, If thou hast power to giue mee what I desire, I aske of thee two things. First that all the women that I shall be in loue withall, doe affect and follow me: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly that I may gaine estimation and honour aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Priests of this Country, and amongst men of worth and credit. The diuell hauing promised him these two things did reciprocally demand, to haue giuen him his body, his soule, and his workes: whereunto hee answered, that hee would freely bestow these three things vpon him, onely hee desired to make reseruation of administring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And being thus agreed, the said <hi>Gaufridi</hi> gaue him a schedule signed with his bloud, and the diuell inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably gaue vnto him another, and promised vnto him as aforesaid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:7439:11"/>And being now become such a one, hee endeuoured to seduce a young girle, of the age of nine or ten yeares called <hi>Magdalene de Demandoul, alias de la Pallud,</hi> daughter vnto <hi>Mounsieur de la Pallud,</hi> a gentleman of <hi>Prouinco,</hi> whose consent at last hee gained, and led her whiles shee remained at a Grange of the said <hi>Monsieur de la Pallud</hi>; to a Caue or denne not farre from the said Grange: where she saw a great number of people (who were the Synode of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers) and was much abashed at the same. But the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian told her, these are all our friends, and you must be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked like vnto them: and so tooke the poore affrighted girle and marked and abused her; yet for all this shee would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale nothing when she came home, neither to father, nor to mother, nor to any other. Afterward she was ordinarilie carried by the Deuill to that Conuenticle, and was made the Princesse of the Synagogue, as the said <hi>Lewes</hi> was the Prince. Notwithstanding this, whiles shee re
mained still at her Fathers, by the grace of God (who had regard of her yong and tender yeares) she had a desire to become one of the Virgines of Saint Vrsula, that are resident at Aix in Prouince, vnder the conduct and gouernment of Priests called the Priests of the Christian doctrine.</p>
                  <p>This her intendment she communicated vnto the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician, who dehorted her from it with all the inforcements bec ould, and perswaded her to marry, promising to prouide for her a rich and proper man to be her husband. For all this she stil persisted in her first resolution, which put the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian into such passion and choler, that he menaced her and said, if thou do go thither I will destroy all the company, as well of the virgines of S. <hi>Vrsula,</hi> as of the Priests of the Doctrine. Being gone thither, the Magician by Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, &amp; power of a Schedule which she had formerly giuen the diuell signed with her bloud, so wrought that shee was possessed by Belzebub, and many others of his associates. He also did by a Charme bewitch a companion of hers called <hi>Louyse Capeau,</hi> by the force whereof (as also because she had diuers times besought God, that shee might indure all
<pb facs="tcp:7439:11"/>
torments euen to the paines of hell, as much as she could be capable of, that shee might conuert certaine of her sisters there, who were in a desperate estate, &amp; deuoid of the grace of God) the said <hi>Louyse</hi> was possessed by a wicked spirit called <hi>Verrine,</hi> and by two other his companions. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, father <hi>Iohn Baptista Romillon</hi> Superiour of the Priests of the Doctrine, perceiued by their extraordinarie gestures, that these two women, were possessed, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on caused them priuately to bee exorcised in their Chappell, as one that feared least this might tend to the defamation of that Company. And hauing continued this for the space of a yeere and certaine moneths, and to his vnderstanding profited nothing (for the diuels could neuer all that space be brought to speake) hee brought the said <hi>Magdalene</hi> as more manifestly possessed then the other to S. Maximin, to craue there the aduise of Father <hi>Sebastian Michaelis</hi> Priour of the Couent Royall that is at Saint Maximin, where the body of S. <hi>Magdalene</hi> lyeth: who was of opinion, that there should a generall Confession be by her made to S. <hi>Magdalene,</hi> and so she should receiue absolution from him, as from the Inquisitour of the Faith, least otherwise shee might reserue some particular fact to her selfe. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they made her make a vow for 9. daies in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell where the blessed S. <hi>Magdalene</hi> doth lye, and did exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise her euening and morning, in which time the diuells v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed strange motions and gestures, and greeuously tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her, but would neuer speake.</p>
                  <p>And now approached the time of Aduent, in which the said Father was to preach in the city of Aix: hee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aduised Father Romillon to bring <hi>Magdalene</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Louyse</hi> likewise to S. Baume, a place where S. <hi>Magdalene</hi> for thirty yeares space did her penance; and as a Vicarige that belongeth vnto the Couent Royall of S. <hi>Maximin</hi>: and told him that some dates past he had sent thithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:7439:12"/>
this was done accordingly.</p>
                  <p>When the two that were possessed came to S.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. And further he added that God could no longer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the blasphemies &amp; iniuries, which they in the depth of night committed against his maiesty, and against the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sacrament, and said, that vpon speciall causes God had destinated him vnto this, and to be an instrument of their conuersion, which neuer yet tooke effect, because they had renounced God, the merits of Christ Iesus, his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed mother, all the Quires of Angells, and all the blessed Saints: as also all confessions and the other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, all preaching and exhortations of men, all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and inspirations from God, and al visible creatures which might any way lead them on to their conuersion vnto God: the diuell (said he) onely excepted. Hence it is that God hath made choice by a great and new miracle of the diuells themselues (said he) for the manifestation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion of them.</p>
                  <p>In these discourses, he principally endeuoured the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Magdalene, and did rudely lay to her charge in the presence of a great multitude of people that stocked thither euery day, that she was not intirely conuerted, that she had a heart of stone, and that she did still practise and hold intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence with <hi>Belzebub,</hi> hauing the day or the night before consented anew vnto him. Finally he told her before all the standers by whatsoeuer she did in that Synagogue of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: And heereupon she became so ashamed of her selfe, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when she heard him say she was a Magician, that
<pb facs="tcp:7439:12"/>
she began to shed many teares, and remained afterwards a perfect Conuert.</p>
                  <p>This once performed, <hi>Verrine</hi> began to inueigh against the Prince of the Sorcerers, without naming him: but said, that hee knew well enough what was spoken of him, eyther by the report of wicked spirits, or himselfe comming there in person to hold his synode, or by the speech of the lookers on, who cryed with a loud voice, That if hee would not bee conuerted he should be burnt aliue, yet he made slight of his conuersion: and therefore one day hee named him aloud in the presence of much people, and wrote him a letter by the hand of the Father the Exorcist; of which hee made little reckoning.</p>
                  <p>The Aduent being finished, Father <hi>Michaelis</hi> parted from Aix after Christmas, and came to Saint Baume, where he remained from the first of Ianuarie till the fifth of February, to try whether the two women were really possessed, or no: because they spake diuersly of it, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe had a desire to make tryall thereof, in regard they were in a Church of his Iurisdiction. So hauing obserued all, and being confident that the two girles were indeed pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed, as also seeing what strange euents had befallen, which were caused eyther by the diuells or the Magicians: when the time of Lent drew neere hee went againe to Aix, to continue there his preaching, and acquainted <hi>Monsieur du Vair</hi> cheefe President of the Court of Parliament in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, with euery circumstance: and told him that there were three distinct infallible essences or realities in <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene,</hi> which when he found to be true, he together with the parliament of Aix proceeded against the Magician, but obtained grace and pardon for <hi>Magdalene</hi> from his Maiesty, who had regard and compassion of her tender yeares and considered that the seducements were very full of craft and subtlety.</p>
                  <p>The Acts that were taken day by day from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of December vntill the <hi>24</hi> of Aprill in the yeere <hi>1611.</hi> do extend and inlarge more amply all these strange
<pb facs="tcp:7439:13"/>
euents and passages, as also any new occurrence that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened vntill that time.

                  <head>THE REPORT AND EXPLICATION OF the passage of S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> vpon the 1. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Prophet <hi>Nahum,</hi> where it is said:</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat doe you imagine against God? hee will make an vtter destruction</hi> (that is to say, he will bring all things to an end) <hi>afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall not rise vp the second time:</hi> or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Septuagints, <hi>Hee will not take vengeance twice vpon the same subiect in affliction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereupon S. <hi>Ierome</hi> discourseth against the Marcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, and other ancient Heretickes, who accused God in the old Testament of cruelty, and alleaged the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of those that perished in the flood, of those that were stricken with lightning from heauen, in Sodome and the neighbouring townes: of the Egyptians that were drowned in the red sea, and of a great multitude of people that died in the desert.</p>
                  <p>To which he answereth, that in all this there is more mercy then iustice, for he afflicted them with some tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall punishment, that they might not bee eternally damned. This is cleer in the Prophet, who saith plainly, that <hi>God will not take vengeance twice on the same subiect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then (saith he) those that haue been once punished, shall not bee punished afterwards; otherwise it might occasion men to say that the Scripture is not true, out subiect to lies. Wee are then to say (addeth Saint <hi>Ierome</hi>) that these <hi>receper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nt mala in vita sua,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently not in the other world. Hee groundeth this vpon the saying of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> that many at the time of
<pb facs="tcp:7439:14"/>
the flood repented them of their sinnes, and went not immediately into hell fire, but were put into a prison, from which Christ Iesus deliuered them when hee des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into hell. The same also must bee vnderstood of the others aboue named. After all this Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a very apposite question, saying: What shall wee then iudge of a Christian, whom another findeth in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery and cutteth off his head? To this hee answereth in another manner, and saith: No man can preuent or anticipate the sentence of God our righteous Iudge, thereby to giue impeachment vnto the course of his vengeance, which hee inflicteth according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of those punishments, that are by him decreed for our great offences.</p>
                  <p>He meaneth, that if a man should pretend to delude God, and say, I will hinder God from condemning of this sinner, and will punish him my selfe in this world, he would much deceiue himselfe. For the reason why God doth not punish in the other world, doth presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that God himselfe in his prouidence hath punished it, and that he who receiueth castigation in this world, doth whiles his affliction is vpon him repent him of his sinnes, and semblable vnto the good theese, aske par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in his punishment. On the other side, if a Christian be beheaded in the very act of adultery, he hath no lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to make an acknowledgment, and craue pardon of God; which is another case, and not comprized in the sentence of the Prophet <hi>Nahum.</hi> Better it is (saith S. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>) that the transgressor bee punished in this world; as he who cursed the people of Israel, or hee that gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red wood on the Sabbath day, for they had time to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their sinnes, which yet were much more pardonable then the sinne of adultery.</p>
                  <p>From this discourse of S. <hi>Ieromes,</hi> some schoole di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines haue drawne this conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He wicked Spirit that was the instrument of this discouery, called himselfe <hi>Verrine,</hi> and declared that himselfe was a Diuell, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned eternall, without hope or redemption. This he well shewed by his deeds, for from the moneth of December vntill the end of Aprill, he did what in him lay to stoppe and hinder <hi>Louyse,</hi> whom he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed from making an end of her confession, and from recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the blessed Sacrament: the like did <hi>Belzebub</hi> by <hi>Magdalene.</hi>

                  <p>God (saith he) is not my redeemer, but my seuere Iudge. And addeth, that it is a wonder extraordinarily rare, that he is thus constrained to speake the truth; yea it is more (saith he) then to create the world, in that the Diuels in this constraint, resist as much they are able, and enter into dispute with God. He also said, I was not sent by God to preach the Gospell, I should lye to say it; but said that God had permitted him to enter into this body for his glory, and for the conuersion of many soules, especially of these two.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:7439:15"/>Both the Deuils did discouer and declare, all the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and grosse villanies that these Magicians committed in their cursed Synagogue. <hi>Verrine</hi> further said, I speake vnto you things tending to your saluation: take and make vse of that which is good (as if a wicked Preist should giue you good exhortations) and if you will not, I tell you, you shall not be constrained vnto it.</p>
                  <p>These particulars with many others of a semblable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, will giue an easie checke to those apprehensions, that should misconceiue them to be Angels of light: for they do plainly appeare what they are, to wit true Deuils. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, in this regard there is no danger of being abused, by those which speake in persons possessed, because we know they are very Deuils, which in these cases we must alwaies presuppose as a foundation. The strange torments and gestures which do appeare beyond the strength of man in the bodies of those that are possessed, do prooue also the same vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs.</p>
                  <p>This being presupposed, it remaineth now to cleere vp some difficulties that were propounded since the impression of this booke: which not withstanding <hi>consistunt in facto tantum,</hi> and not in any points of our faith. And although I had for the most part breefly swept away these doubts in my Annotations in the margent, yet because I will giue no disrellish vnto any, I will make a longer explication of the same: alwayes supposing that which I haue noted in the 260. page vpon the day of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangelist, that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the predictions to come, time will make the truth or false-hood thereof to appeare haereafter, and touching those things that are abstruse and hidden, wee must in the meane time hold vs to that, which is decreed and taught by the Church.</p>

And when it is said that God hardened <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, the interpretation heereof is two fold. First that it was God himselfe immediatly that did it, by withdrawing his grace: secondly, that it was by Gods permission, who suffered Satan to tempt him euen to obduratnesse of heart, without controule or hindrance.

<pb facs="tcp:7439:21"/>
                           <hi>Magdalene.</hi> All these prayers were the actions of <hi>Louyse</hi> and not of the Diuell but as an inftigatour. Peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture God would haue it so, to demonstrate the more how greeuous the offence of the said <hi>Magdalene</hi> was; shee at that time sending forth hideous yell's and cries with all the force she had for the space of an houre, till shee had lost her voyce; as also to shew how much prayer and merit must be imployed in the conuersion of a miserable man, so farre banished from the presence of God. And although the wicked Spirit did sometimes speake by Parenthesis in his owne person, to declare that he was the author and moouer of this discourse, yet this lets not, but that those other actions might bee humane, shee working with them, and not these Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentheses. And as wee haue noted vpon the passage in the 292. page, the act of the second of Ianuary and the 275. page in the act of the 29. of December, she after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward said, that she did labour and consent vnto all those prayers, as if it had proceeded from her owne proper and first motion. Which being so, there is no doubt but she might present the oblation of Iesus Christ to God his Father, as all Christians that are present at Masse do or ought to doe. <hi>Pro quibus tibi offerimus, vel qui tibi offerunt hoc sacrificium laudis pro se suisque omnibus, &amp;c.</hi> Heereunto I adde, that of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> cited before in our Epistle, who saith, that when a young man is tempted by the Diuell to enter into the orders of religion, who hopes by this meanes either to ouerthrow him, or by him to spoyle others, and that this young man doth then pray to God to giue him grace to bee receiued, this action is meritorious and good, as being a humane action, proceeding from a good intention, although the Diuell bee the author thereof. And if when the Diuell straineth to put his first designe in execution, hee doe yet resist him, then gaineth hee a double conquest vpon his enemy.

The others not regarding their knowledge (by which they might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily vnderstand, that in the composure of a History, the truth must be purely told and written, and must neither wrappe vp in silence, reprehensions nor praises, vices nor vertues) conclude, that it had beene better to haue spared them.

Truth it is, that I would haue pared this off from the History, but those that were there present did withstand it, protesting that they would then declare o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, that the History was not syncere and full: which yet I wrote not, neither was I present at all these acts. The History was giuen mee in Latine and French, and may word for word be iustified; yet did I qualifie and moderate this in the margent, and said, that this might seeme to sent of flattery: and for feare least it should be misconceiued,<note place="margin">Act. of the 27. of Decem. pag. 260.</note> that this was supposititiall.

Those that doe yet obiect, that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks will take their aduantage thereof, let them read with diligence my Epistle to the Reader, and they shall perceiue that nothing makes for them. To conclude, this History is true, to which nothing hath been added, and in which nothing is contained, either against saith or manners: against the authority of Church or State; no more then is in the collection of the Exorcismes of the woman of Laon.</p>
                        <p>The reason why God hath permitted this wonder, may be on the one part the vnbeleefe of men, and on the other part the wrath of God for their vnbeleefe. Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> inferreth this conclusion against the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiests of his time,<note place="margin">Homil. 13. in Matth.</note> vpon the confessions which the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils made, and their rehearsal of the tortures which they suffered in hell. This proceeded not (saith hee) from their owne accord, for their pride that alwaies swelleth and neuer abateth, is too repugnant thereunto; but it is God that constraineth them to doe this, for the further conuiction of Athiests, who beleeue not the word of God preached, nor yet the Scriptures. Wee are likewise taught by the Scripture, that when God is wroth with vs, he maketh men to vnderstand his indignation, foure seuerall waies. First when hee sendeth them cruell and tyrannous Princes: as in the 13. of <hi>O see</hi> it is said, <hi>I will giue thee Kings in my displeasure, and Rulers in my indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> The second (which is an argument of greater auger) is, when hee suffereth euill and corrupt Pastours to instruct the people either in doctrine (by permitting them to beleeue lies, because they would not hearken vnto the truth) or in manners, as he doth threaten them in the 14. of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> and in other places. So <hi>Caiphas</hi> by prophesying amongst the Scribes and Pharisies, and inducing them to crucifie Christ Iesus, gaue as it were

                     <p>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Wee are to take these and the following discourses, as we take the discourses of <hi>Balaam</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanter, and of <hi>Caiphas</hi> that prophecied of Christ Iesus; not of their owne volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie or proper motion. S. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius</hi> faith, that when the diuell perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded S. <hi>Anthony</hi> to pray vnto God, he prayed vnto him, not because the di uell said it, but because hee spake agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vnto the word of God <hi>Athanasan vit. Anthonij.</hi> Thus we beleeue the diuels saying, in Mat 8. Mark. 5. Luk. 8. that Christ Iesus was the Messias, and the Son of the liuing God; not because they said it, but because they were inforced to speake according to the Scriptures. They feare and tremble (saith S. <hi>Iames</hi>) vnder the puissant arme of God, who serueth his turne with them as he pleaseth Dragons and Serpents, fire and haile, doe all worke the will of God, saith <hi>Dauid,</hi> Psalm. 148.</note> 
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Exclamation vpon the conception of our Ladie.</note>. <hi>Mary</hi> is the goodliest creature that euer the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Father created, to my great griefe doe I speake it. She standeth incessantly before her sonne making in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession for you: she sheweth him the wombe that bare him, the breasts that gaue him sucke, and all the seruices that euer she did for him in the world. True it is that she is so faire, that the diuels themselues would endure all the tortures of the world only to haue a sight of her beautie; but they could neuer haue the grace to see her in glorie, neither haue they deserued, or euer shall deserue the same, by reason of their excessiue pride and arrogancie. She is so amiable, so excellent, and so rich in all perfections, that neither Angell, nor Archan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, no not the Seraphins themselues, can be equall matches vnto <hi>Mary</hi> in beauty. She is rich and a Queene together, so that it were an idlenesse to demaund, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such a one as she be able to bestow on those that beg it of her: so is she wise, and doth therefore know all your necessities. Besides, she is mercifull, and is euer in the presence of her Sonne suing and saying: Sonne, take compassion vpon these miserable sinners, for many
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7439:27"/>
times they vnderstand not what they aske. And in this (said he) they are like the mother of the sonnes of <hi>Zebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deus,</hi> who prayed that one of her sonnes might sit at the right hand, and the other at the left, not knowing that she wronged her selfe in speaking so, and that those that were on the left hand should be damned. But your God, who knoweth better then you what is needfull for you, will answere, <hi>You know not what you aske.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You will tell me, that this is no new thing which I vtter, it is true, but this is new, that the diuell doth speak these things.</p>
                     <p>I say then, that it is good to loue, serue, and honour the most blessed and most worthie mother of God; for all those that are carried with a full and perfect zeale vnto her, they shall neuer, it is true, it is true, it is true, they shall neuer, neuer (<hi>O Mary thou sacred mother of God</hi>) be put to confusion. The diuell himselfe by the coaction of thy Sonne is forced to honour thee, and to call thee the mother of God, a thing vnaccustomed to be done by diuels: for they call thee either plaine<note n="a" place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of the diuels towards our Ladie.</note> 
                        <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> without any accession of title, as did the Iewes in contempt, or they name thee by some other names of blasphemie in great indignation: but neuer before by this so excellent an attribute, as the blessed mother of God. And vsing these words, you say all that may bee said, of a Ladie, in honouring her with the title of the Mother of God; then which no dignitie is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, none more venerable.</p>

Shee is besides, sister vnto the Angels, yea euen their Queene and Princesse. I say further, that next after the blessed humanitie of Christ, shee hath her Quire alone, as one whose excellence admitteth no partners or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals to keepe her companie. And in that shee is the onely and most matchlesse mother of God, it stands

with reason, that hee who is cloathed with all power, wisedome, and bountie, should mould and fashion her to admiration: neither are we to wonder that it is so.</p>
                     <p>Many there are that haue a will to do good, but their impotencie and disability maketh them come short of their intendments: others haue knowledge, to doe good, but by reason of some bodily impeachments, or for want of grace they cannot imploy it thereunto: for the diuels haue knowledge, but it steedeth them very little.

                     <p>I say, <hi>Magdalene,</hi> thy spouse is most louely, most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, most perfect: He would yet be readie to die for thee, and for all those that are here: he hath hands of iron for vs, and feete of wooll for you.

                     <p>Thou louest riches and pleasures, <hi>Magdalene</hi>; thy Spouse is powerfull to bestow vpon thee Paradise and Heauen, which are replenished with all riches and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures that may be. Fie on diuels, fie on <hi>Belzebub,</hi> fie on all hell. True it is, <hi>Magdalene,</hi> that we Diuels promise mountaines and maruels, but the wages wee giue to those that serue and pleasure vs, is meerely hell. But with thy Spouse there are a thousand millions of pleasures, which doe neuer decrease, nor will euer haue end.

                     <p>Thou art also to take the most blessed Mother of

Then at the beginning of the Exorcismes, <hi>Verrine</hi> began to discourse in this sort.</p>

                        <note n="n" place="margin">Exclamation touching the last iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Call to remembrance the day of Gods iudgement, how dreadfull it will be; when hee shall separate the good from the bad, and shall say, Come, giue me an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of your workes of mercie.</p>
                     <p>He will not aske you, whither you haue read or pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much, whether you haue been great or base, noble or ignoble: no, no, hee will not mention this, but will say, Come, giue me an account, whether it be not true, that when I was a hungrie, you (directing his speech to those that he reproueth) gaue me no meate; when I was thirstie, you gaue me no drinke; when I was naked, you cloathed me not; when I was a stranger, you receiued me not; when I was sicke, you visited me not; when I was a prisoner you redeemed me not; when I was dead you buried me not. Then shall they answere and say: What? were you a hungrie? were you thirstie? could so great a Lord as you stand in need of any thing? could you be naked? we neuer saw you thus. <hi>Verrine</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, and speaking in generall as well to those that were absent, as to those that were present, he said: <note n="o" place="margin">A worthie reprehension of Christians.</note> O miserable and vnthankfull men, how misunderstanding you are of the benefits of God. You call your selues Christians, but doe not the workes of Christians: you haue a God so good, that the very Diuels doe confesse his ouer-much goodnesse. What more great expression
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7439:33"/>
and signe can you haue thereof, then to heare him speak these words, <hi>Whatsoeuer you shall doe vnto the least of mine, I will take it done vnto my selfe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Miserable is the state of those Christians, who doe not loue and serue so good a God, know yee therefore, that those who remaine in their obstinacy and wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and yet haue heard those dreadfull words, which God spake to the cursed and reprobate, <hi>Ite maledicti in ignem aeternum,</hi> Ha! how well doe they deserue to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the most seuere castigation.</p>
                     <p>We are to note, that <hi>Verrine</hi> spake these words with such hideous cries, and fiercenesse, that he seemed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speratly enraged: and often repeated these words <hi>Ite maledicti,</hi> about fiue seuerall times; and gaue intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that since they had slighted and set at nought all the wounds of our Sauiour, together with the blessed Trinity, and the 10. Commandements of the law; it comported with good reason, that they should experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and try that amazefull sentence.</p>
                     <p>Hereunto <hi>Verrine</hi> added. Your God is so full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and so dreadfull, that the beames procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from his eyes as from bright-shining flames, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be endured by the wicked: Yea the paines of hell it selfe are not more vnsupportable, then is the fury of this great Iudge, when once he is prouoked by them.</p>
                     <p>I say further, that the soules <note n="p" place="margin">The sight of the damned fearefull.</note> in hell are so horridly fearefull, that if any of them should be presented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, the sight thereof would prooue vnto you so ghastly and vnsufferable, that you would dye in the place, to see all their deformities, pollutions, loathsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, stinkes, and meruailous torments. But your God is so good, that he will giue to euery one according to his deseruings (not for their <note n="q" place="margin">The vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and first grace is the pure &amp; meere grace of God.</note> merits, but from his owne bounty, for if he should handle euery man according to his deserts, there would few scape hell:) And this great God, be your good workes neuer so meane, yet if they flow from charity and the merits of his passion, hee will
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7439:34"/>
giue them a reward, as he hath promised, saying, <hi>Come yee blessed of my father, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Because when I was a hungry you gaue mee meate; when I was thirstie you gaue me to drinke; when I was a stranger, you tooke me in; when I was dead, you bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me; when I was sicke you visited me; when I was naked you cloathed me; when I was in prison you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed me. Then shall he carrie them to Paradise, to haue there the fruition of his pleasures, because they contemned all for his sake.

                     <p>Is it not a thing that was neuer heard of before, that the Diuell is at variance with the Diuell, and that hell combateth against hell?</p>
                     <p>Here is to be obserued, that this discourse and many others semblable vnto them, were spoken with such an emphasis and efficacie, that all the assembly began to weepe, and to aske God forgiuenesse: as also to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse themselues, and to receiue the Sacrament instantly vpon it. Of which the foure aboue-named Pilgrimes would needs giue attestation in forme as followeth.</p>

And hauing no further occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to remaine or soiourne here any longer, as men har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with the trauell and toyle of our iourney from Rome, we haue left our testimony in the hands of the venerable father the Exorcist, in the presence of the fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers that were present, and of many others. In truth whereof we haue subsigned our names. <hi>Borffartigues, Iohn Gallois, Gaudet, Audry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The same day in the euening were <hi>Louyse</hi> and <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene</hi> exorcised by the Dominican father, and at the beginning of the Exorcismes, <hi>Verrine</hi> discoursed of the paines of hell, and other matters in this manner.</p>
                     <p>The <note n="t" place="margin">Exclamation of the paines of hell.</note> paines of hell are so great and fearefull, that one alone Diuell with his hideous shape, were able to strike a man dead vpon the place, although he had a thousand liues. The diuels themselues might not indure the soules of the damned, were it not that hell were the place that is destinated for euerlasting torments. When the accursed soules of the damned come vnto vs, wee make very much of them, wee cause them to sit on a great chaire of flaming fire; we present vnto them balls of fire for their repast that are all very well sulphured: we giue them to drink a certaine liquor, bitter as gall or worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, and enforce also vpon them courtesies more bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more stinking then these. Their eyes are fed with continuall visions of Diuel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>; they haue for their songs and musicke, wherein they tooke their pleasure in their life time; vucessant blasphemies against God, cursing the time that they were borne, their fathers and their mothers, together wirh all other creatures great
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7439:35"/>
and small. We fling and tumble them sometimes in the fire, sometimes vpon the yce, sometimes in sulphure, sometimes in snow; and in exprobration of their trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions we say vnto them. Ha! accursed wretches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, <note n="u" place="margin">The repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of the damned.</note> behold the recompense for your pleasures and delicacies. You that would not obey your God, you that made slight to trespasse against his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, you that haue whored after <hi>Baal,</hi> and abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned your Creator, you doe deserue, you doe deserue to be thus tormented; you deserue to bee thus handled. Neuer shall you see God, but shall bee eternally depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of those celestiall ioyes, and in briefe, you shall here be tortured for euer.</p>
                     <p>Besides (said <hi>Verrine</hi>) we are cruell remembrancers vnto them of the fauours and blessings which they haue receiued from their Creatour, not hereby to giue them any comfort or refreshment, but to torment them the more abundantly. We say vnto them. Miserable cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifes as you are, you might haue gone to Paradise, you might haue beene filled with heauenly blisse, you might haue beene companions to the Saints of heauen; but the tide is turned another way. Behold, you are the bondmen of Sathan, the Gally-slaues of hell, and the food and nourishment of that vnquenchable fire. How wretched are you, who might haue had the liberty of the children of God, and doe now remaine in the thrall and seruitude of Diuels. If you suffer tortures, you doe well deserue them; yet are you not punished according to your misdeedes and demerits. Then making a great out-cry, he said.</p>
                     <p>O wonderfull miracle, O great misery! The Diuels speak against <note n="x" place="margin">The sorrow of <hi>Verrine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was constrained.</note> themselues, yea and against all hell; they disgrace their owne Countrey, and dehort men from trauelling thither, and from cohabiting with them; This is very strange. Let two men speake together of their Country, and it is not to be wondered at, if both of them be lauish in the praises thereof: but it is a great
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7439:35"/>
miracle that the Diuell an enemie to God and heauen, recommendeth vnto men that celestiall Country, and vilifieth the kingdome of hell. I further auerre, that men ride to hell easily in a Coach, and the horses and all the furniture thereof may passe in with facility: But to Paradise, you must goe a-foote, and enter in, stouping; the gates thereof are narrow, so that much labour and toyle is requisite for the attainement of the same, and hardly may you enter in without doing penance. I also say, that the fire of hell is so deuouringly hot, that put all the fire in the world together, and it is but a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in regard of it. Yet are there soules so desperate, and vnnaturall, that they runne at full speede into these gulphes of brimstone. Accursed Magicians, abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Witches, and relentlesse sinners, can all of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late vnto you such newes as this.</p>
                     <p>Then hee <note n="y" place="margin">Exclamation of the wicked Spirit.</note> cried with great and ghastly exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and with a rage and fiercenesse beyond ordinarie, and spake these words fiue seuerall times. For euer, for euer, for euer, for euer, for euer; alas shall the damned soules be depriued of the vision of God. You will tell mee perchance, that as yet I haue tolde you no great newes, it may be so: notwithstanding it is strange newes (as I haue said formerly) to heare a Diuell speake for God, and for the saluation of your soules.</p>
                     <p>All the assembly were so affrighted with these and the like words, and at the dreadfull passages which <hi>Verrine</hi> had, touching the paines of hell, that there gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed from their eyes abundance of teares, when they called to remembrance their offences which they had committed.</p>
                     <p>After this discourse, <hi>Belzebub</hi> who was in the body of <hi>Magdalene,</hi> cried out very <note n="z" place="margin">The maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous paines of hell.</note> hideously. <hi>Hola</hi>! I will acquaint you with the repose and contentation which the soules of the damned haue in hell. And then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Magdalene,</hi> he <note n="a" place="margin">

Thus (said hee) doe wee torture the soules of the damned, without allotting vnto them the least moment of relaxation.</p>
                     <p>Besides this that hath beene said, <hi>Verrine</hi> added, that <note n="b" place="margin">The will as a faculty of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retn euer that which is good.</note> God was so beautifull, that the Diuels would be content to vndergoe all the torments of the world, and all the paines of hell, so they might but once haue a sight of his beauty.</p>
                     <p>The same day after dinner, <hi>Magdalene</hi> wrote a letter to the blessed S. <hi>Magdalene,</hi> the tenour whereof en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth.</p>

                     <p>This was for certaine daies put in execution, when as he Exorcist not being able to write downe all for hast, <hi>Verrine</hi> did dictate vnto him word after word, that which hee had formerly discoursed: and that for eight daies after: And this was done by the vertue of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orcismes.

                     <p>After Masse, the Priest holding the blessed Hoast that <hi>Louyse</hi> and <hi>Magdalene</hi> might communicate, and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>(Ecce Agnus Dei) Belzebub</hi> began to cry, yes, yes, yes, hee is a Lambe for others, but vnto vs a roaring Lyon. Then the Dominican father said vnto him. <hi>Adora Deum tuum.</hi> To which <hi>Belzebub</hi> replied: Why should I worship this God? I will not doe it, I will not doe it. Ha God! in despight of thee, in despight of <hi>Mary,</hi> in despight of <hi>Magdalene,</hi> this <hi>Magdalene</hi> is mine.</p>
                     <p>Then said <hi>Verrine</hi>: Ha thou cursed and as abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as my selfe, thou hast nought to do with <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene,</hi> thou shalt come short of thy reckoning. <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene</hi> this is but to fright thee, feare not, be confident, and take God for thy husband.</p>
                     <p>Then answered <hi>Belzebub.</hi> No, no; shee is married to mee, I will make demonstration vnto you shee is mine, I haue the Bondes, I haue the Seales.</p>

                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:7439:37"/>Vpon these words the Exorcist said to <hi>Magdalene,</hi> beleeue not this deceiuer and father of lies.

                     <p>Then said <hi>Belzebub.</hi> No, I will make it appeare that in all equity she is mine. <hi>Verrine</hi> answered. No more then I am: thou diddest not create her, neither diddest thou redeeme her, and if thou hast lost thy pray, she is now become a sheepe of Christ Iesus.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Verrine</hi> said vnto him. Her spouse will strengthen and illuminate her, and will also giue assistance vnto those who haue charge ouer her, to confound thy cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and deceites.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Belzebub</hi> replied. They doe me wrong, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious in this particular vnto mee, because in all right shee is mine, and I will make proofe thereof by many speciall allegations; and if shee be the wise of Christ, where are her vertues.</p>

                        <hi>Verrine</hi> said vnto him: She hath made confession of all, and hath kept in nothing; <hi>Belzebub</hi> replied. That is true, but confession without contrition and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is nothing.

will conceiue very strange of it. I say this is a miracle altogether vnheard of: I further say, that when thou thy selfe (meaning <hi>Christ Iesus</hi>) didst preach, wert not thou truth it selfe? Vndoubtedly thou wast. Yet were there some found readie to gainsay thee, witnesse the Pharisie, and those that demanded signes and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. So that it is not to be admired, if I shall not easily be beleeued, because these things are plenteous in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, and hee who knoweth or seeth them not, can neuer without much scrupulousnes beleeue and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them, as he ought. But I haue said, that to beleeue it, you must humble your selues, and must not in a thing of this nature vse any curiositie, but say, that God is om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, and can at his pleasure out of basenesse worke great effects. Then did <hi>Verrine</hi> replie to God. What, Lord? If thou wilt work an vnusuall wonder, take some great Doctor, Philosopher, or Preacher, and then will men beleeue. To which God after an internal and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual manner replied. What? haue I need of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of men, much lesse the aduice of Diuels? <hi>Verrine</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him: I say vnto thee (O great God) that thou art most powerful, and yet there will <note n="p" place="margin">Exclamation against the proud and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</note> be found some so wretched, that will conceit, that all thy power, all thy wisedome, yea and the whole Trinitie with all perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions thereof, may bee comprehended and shut vp in their vnderstandings, as if they were of an able capacitie to conceiue all this. But in thy behalfe I tell them they cannot, and that they are so swolne with pride, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they humble themselues, they are not worthie to receiue that true illumination, which streameth and proceedeth from faith: for, say I, the haughtie and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious person is in the end deuoid of faith.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon I affirme, that if they be humble, they will acknowledge that thou art omnipotent, and that being so, thou art able to wring truth from the very Diuels, not from their free disposition and will, for we are all of vs accursed, but compulsorily and as constrained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7439:39"/>
by thy power. We are more loyall vnto God then many Christians, yet for all this we are still Diuels.</p>
                     <p>And heere <note n="q" place="margin">Reasons why the diuels may speake the truth.</note> must they denie the authoritie of the Church. Why is it, that those that are possessed be exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, if it bee not auaileable, and if the Diuell cannot speake truth? I say it is all lost labour; you may take your bookes (speaking to the Exorcist) and throw them all into the fire. Then he spake in a great rage to her that was possessed, and said: What thinkest thou <hi>Louyse?</hi> why doest thou suffer thy selfe to be exorcised, if neither by God, nor the tenents of the Church we are able to tell the truth? Ha miserable wretches! how many othes haue been taken in the vertue of the name of God by Exorcismes: all which must proceede from <hi>Louyse,</hi> if they must not be accepted of our part.</p>
                     <p>But miserable and abhorred wretches as you are, you deceiue your selues, you are exceedingly replenished and surcharged with vnthankfulnes, and mis-apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. You haue so good a God, that if it were needfull that hee should suffer death for you againe, he would willingly vndergoe it; more especially for two soules, which now I cannot name.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Magdalene</hi> it is true, that <hi>Louyse</hi> is for thy sake pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed, and will if it be requisite, lay down her bodie for thy soule.</p>
                     <p>It is true, all sinners are accursed, and obstinate. You will peraduenture say, that God doth loue much. And why Lord? Hast thou neede of Christians? No, no, thou couldest not bee God, and haue neede of the aide of any creature whatsoeuer. I say, the creature hath neede of thee. And it is a fixed truth, that the more miserable the creature shall bee, the more cleerely shall thy bountie shine and appeare in relieuing it. It is not so great a wonder that children should goe to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but this is the miracle, that sinners who haue a long time snored in their obstinacie, should repent and turne to God. I doe assure you who heare this, that if you doe

not treasure vp these things for your profit and health, we will be your accusers at the day of iudgement.</p>

                     <p>Hereupon the Priest held forth the blessed Host, that <hi>Louyse</hi> and <hi>Magdalene</hi> might communicate; and said, <hi>Ecce Agnus Dei.</hi> Which <hi>Verrine</hi> straight takes hold of, and saith.

                     <p>Then the Priest presented the blessed Host vnto <hi>Magdalene,</hi> and said: Receiue thy spouse <hi>Magdalene,</hi> the sonne of thy good mother. Vpon which <hi>Belzebub</hi> began to torture <note n="k" place="margin">

                     <p>Aye me! God doth enforce me to torment her thus, to present vnto your view the punishments of hell.</p>
                     <p>Then the Priest said vnto him; <hi>Belzebub,</hi> worship thou God with thy face on the earth. At this <hi>Belze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub</hi> began to yell and cry as if hee were enraged, and said: Ha miserable and accursed <note n="l" place="margin">

It is no wonder that a man preacheth vnto another man, that so they may attaine vnto a place, whither all men desire to come.

                     <p>It is no small matter, that the Diuels should occasion the Angels to reioyce, who in times past were their brethren, but are <note n="n" place="margin">When God permitteth them, they are vnloosed, and doe all they can against men.</note> now their mortall enemies.</p>
                     <p>Then speaking to <hi>Magdalene</hi> he said: Cursed be thy desire, which wrought in thee a liking to enter into the Order of S. <hi>Vrsula.</hi>

                     <p>O you of that company! you haue beene mis-prised, and set at naught, yet were you abashed at nothing. Therefore shal you hereafter be exalted, and that by the meanes of Diuels, to our infinite sorrow and confusion.</p>

                     <p>It is a great wonder, that so grieuous sinners as they haue beene in the world, should haue their soules so beautified in heauen. This is it that plungeth vs into despaire, and maketh vs runne outrageously madde. For let them commit ten thousand millions of sinnes, yea let them leaue no transgression vnpractised, yet shall they finde mercie, and out of the euill which they doe, there shall be drawne much goodnesse.

                        <note n="a" place="margin">The beautie of Paradise.</note> Paradise is so beautifull, that the walles thereof are framed of precious stones; as Carbuncles, Emraudes, Diamonds, Saphyrs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iacinths, which do all signifie some manner of vertue. He that will come thither, must build him a Tabernacle here, and that by good works. There is a mansion prepared for you in Paradise, but you must bring with you the stones that betoken vertues; and before your iourney thither, it is needful that you ioyne and set these stones together.</p>
                     <p>Euery bodie shall haue there a countrey more spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious then the whole earth: and notwithstanding all this beautie and riches of your God, how few are there that doe loue and serue him?</p>

The good <hi>Iesus</hi> hath many friends at his table, but very few on Mont Caluary.</p>
                     <p>Many lose their part in Paradise for their delights, others for gluttonie, and some for their curiositie: wee alwaies assault them where they are weakest and most <note n="c" place="margin">We must say with <hi>Dauid: Et obseruab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Before he sate at the right hand of his Father, he did endure so much, and did suffer such an ignominious death, as no Martyr did euer vndergoe the like. I say further, that not only no one Martyr, but all of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, did neuer endure so much as hee, although all glorie were alreadie his owne.</p>
                     <p>There is no ransome bee it of King or of Emperour, that can equall the price wherewithall God hath redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med you to be heires of Paradise: yet doe you reckon no more of it, then if it had cost him nothing. I speake generally as well for those that are heere, as for those that are absent. You regard it no more then if it had stood him but two Liards, or a Sons. No, no, it is not so cheape, he hath bought it with the price of his blood.</p>
                     <p>And when they came to <hi>Sanctam Ecclesiam, &amp;c.

                     <p>God loueth not, that men should endeuour to euade by excuses. If that <hi>Adam</hi> had craued pardon, God would presently haue forgiuen him: yea the very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that fell, if they had humbled themselues, should haue tasted of his mercy.

The eternall Father according to true iustice would haue him punished; but presently did the diuine word giue himselfe vp to be your pledge, saying that hee would be incarnated, and take your flesh vpon him, and would be euer readie to endure whatsoeuer the father would thinke fit to be inflicted. Then presented themselues the two daughters of the eternall Father, to wit, <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Mercie,</hi> and made them readie for the encounter.</p>

                        <hi>Iustice</hi> as the younger daughter said, that they were to be punished for their disobedience, and that they did very well deserue it. <hi>Mercie</hi> as the elder said.

As first, to what end haue you created a creature thus beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull? to cast him headlong into hell? There is a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to saue him. For there will come a woman called <hi>Mary,</hi> that will be more humble, then <hi>Eue</hi> hath beene proud after her transgression; and will bee more reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished

with simplicity, then euer <hi>Eue</hi> was with curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie. <hi>Mary</hi> will be more obedient then euer <hi>Eue</hi> was rebellious; and more prompt to say, <hi>I am the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid of the Lord,</hi> then euer <hi>Eue</hi> was to take and taste the apple.

                     <p>On the contrary part, Iustice pleaded that they did well deserue sharpest castigation, who doe yet stand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their iustification, although they are guilty of the highest treason, in rebelling against their Prince, yea such a Prince as their God is. That they knew the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of their King, yet would not obserue the same, and sinned not through ignorance, but through their too much knowledge, that brought them to their destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. To this the <note n="a" place="margin">The mercie of Christ Iesus.</note> diuine Word made replication.

                     <p>Afterward as they should haue communicated, <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene</hi> was vpon the sudden strangely tempted by <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub.</hi> But <hi>Verrine</hi> taking vpon him as her counsellor and admonisher, did lay before her the imbecilitie of the Diuell, and dismasked all his slights and subtilties. And it happened, that after <hi>Magdalene</hi> had receiued the holy Host in her mouth, <hi>Belzebub</hi> made shew, as if he would force her to spit it out vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth. In which fact, hee discouered that there was some <note n="a" place="margin">She had not confessed this sinne either fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obliuion or out of shame.</note> enormous sin in <hi>Magdalene,</hi> which was familiar only vnto those that knew the inward guilt of her conscience.</p>
                     <p>The same day in the euening <hi>Louyse</hi> and <hi>Magdalene</hi> were exorcised by Father <hi>Francis Billet:</hi> and <hi>Verrine</hi> began to speake in this manner: It is requisite first to passe the Altar of thornes and kniues, before you come to the Altar of Crownes. I tell you that <note n="b" place="margin">The martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of S. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> and the Virgins.</note> 
                        <hi>Lucia</hi> was a

poore woman, and of such base condition, to outward semblance, that a man would not haue bestowed a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vpon her: yet being betrothed, she abandoned all for the loue of him who had redeemed her, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of him vnderualued all worldly things whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. So must all they whom he takes to wife, they must forsake father, mother, brothers and all, and onely set their affection on him who doth so wholly deserue it. Hee will place them there where no person is able to sing the hymnes which they shall sing, and they shall follow the Lambe wheresoeuer hee goeth, to the great vexation of the Diuell and of all hell. <hi>Magdalene</hi> doth not sing at all, yet is she next vnto <hi>Mary:</hi> for in loue she doth surmount <hi>Martha.

                        <hi>Vrsula</hi> makes mee starke mad, both by their Christian doctrine, and by their holesome instructions: and the exceeding great labour which they take for the good of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, maketh hell it selfe to bee swallowed vp in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire. I doe not speake this to puffe them vp, let them be as humble as they will: but the truth is, that all the diuels doe straine their vttermost subtilties to worke their finall extermination. God is desirous to haue them proued, cursed be my words, they will cost me ful deare. <hi>Mary,</hi> why shouldest thou so affectionatly loue them? wherein haue they been seruiceable vnto thee? Wee haue sisted them all by temptation, to breede in them a longing to leaue their vocation. Wee suggested that their order of Religion was meere brocage, and their

vocation vnapproueable. This wee said to discourage them from that course, and distilled diuers other temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations into them against their Superiour, but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally against <hi>Cassandra</hi> their Superiour at <hi>Aix.</hi> Wee haue filled them with grudging and murmuring against their Superiours, perswading them not to obey or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue them, and haue baited both men and women with our temptations: the men gaue best heede vnto vs as those that were the prouder. We also hatched a conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie against <hi>Romillon,</hi> and the Order of the Doctrine, that they might be forsaken of euery one.</p>
                     <p>Whilest the Diuell was thus discoursing, there came to S. <hi>Baume</hi> Sister <hi>Catherine of Isle,</hi> with another of the same Companie. Whereupon <note n="d" place="margin">Experience doth teach that in matters of curiositie they doe laugh and make a lest of men.</note> one that was present said vnto the Dominican Father, whether hee thought the Diuell could presage of their arriuall: who being asked thereof, without seeing or hearing of her, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it was she.

                     <p>Then the Dominican Father softly rounded Father <hi>Romillon</hi> in the eare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and said, It is no wonder though he intermingle something of his owne, when men out of meere curiositie doe aske him questions.

It is strange, the very, beasts did bow downe their heads, thereby making recognition after their mariner of the benefits they had receiued, and therefore shall rise vp against men at the day of Iudgement.</p>
                     <p>In Hell we make wondrous much of men in requitall of their obedience which they carried towards vs. We say vnto them, <note n="p" place="margin">Discourse of Hell.</note> Damned and ingratefull as you are, you would not serue and acknowledge your God, and then we lay on loade as it, were with barres of iron, and doe intollerably torment them.</p>
                     <p>There are no gates for men to get out of Hell, but the gates to enter in are very large and spacious.</p>
                     <p>The repast and fare which they haue in Hell are Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, Toads, Scorpions, and whatsoeuer else is filthie and abhorred: the drinke is brimstone, wormewood, rhew, and all bitter and distastfull liquours.

Vpon the earth they eare white bread, but here they must gnaw vpon crusts, and that without their teeth.</p>
                     <p>In stead of perfumes wee stuffe their nostrels with stinkes and loathsome fauours, and in stead of delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some songs wee fill their eares with derisions, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and cursings, saying, Cursed be the God that hath created thee, cursed be the father and mother that haue begotten thee, cursed bee the ayre that thou diddest breathe, cursed bee the foure elements, cursed bee the creatures that haue any way obeyed thee.</p>
                     <p>And to adde vnto their torments, we set before them Heauen, together with the glorie and those pleasures which they haue lost, because they haue transgressed through malice, not through ignorance, and remained obstinate in the same.</p>

                     <p>And as the hangman doth his office when hee tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureth a malefactor that is condemned by the Iudge, so the Diuels are not nice to performe their charge they haue to torment soules.</p>
                     <p>The torments of Hell are torments indeed, and the greatest tortures of the world which are inflicted vpon malefactors, compared with these, are but as flowers and roses.</p>
                     <p>They shall bee damned euerlastingly, euerlastingly, euerlastingly, without hope of intermission or end, euerlastingly, euerlastingly.</p>
                     <p>The Diuels shall binde you hand and foote, and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus manicled, they shall throw you into a boyling chauldron: and after you haue been burned in these flames, you shall be engulfed in a sea of ice. None can resist the Almightie when hee hath a purpose to doe a thing.

Then <hi>Verrine</hi> said, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an hundred thousand times sup in Hell, then haue giuen you such a supper, as by this discourse I haue done, and withall swore, that hee had vttered all, which is aboue mentioned, for the glorie of God, that all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from God, and that the Diuel was forced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto as a slaue or a captiue in the galleys.</p>
                     <p>Then he said to those that were there present: This <hi>Baume,</hi> this Rocke, these leaues will rise vp against you at the day of Iudgement, if you make not your aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of these things. Your God loueth you so well, that if it were behoofull for you, hee would at this very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant returne to Mount Caluary.</p>
                     <p>The same day, this dialogue chanced to be betweene <hi>Verrine</hi> and <hi>Belzebub. Verrine</hi> said, You that heare Masse doe say, I beleeue that my God is there in blood and bones, and that in the Chalice, both his flesh and bones, his Humanitie and Diuinitie are present. But you must conceiue, that you are there as poore malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors before your Iudge: pray therefore vnto your Iudge and he will heare you, for hee giueth grace vnto the humble, and casteth downe the proud of heart.

                     <p>Cursed be the wound that cost me so deere, because in it all sinnes are swallowed vp: Cursed be <hi>Long in us</hi> that made that wound.

Occasions of doing good are neuer wanting vnto the sinner: he hath the benefit of Preachers, of Confessours, and of Miracles, &amp; yet remaineth obstinate in his sinne, and still God is so fauourable in his behalfe, that he will at the last cast make vse of Diuels for his conuersion, <hi>Verrine</hi> replied, <hi>superbos humiliat,</hi> he is more powerfull to attract sinners vnto goodnesse, then are the Diuels in their malice to allure them vnto ill.</p>

Through maine compulsion art thou drawne to sweare, and although thou bee my Prince, yet at this present thou art but as a Fly. Where are thy braues and forces now? thou that but a while since diddest out-face hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, doest now humble thy selfe vnder the feete of <hi>Frauncis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Verrine</hi> setting his foote vpon <hi>Belzebub,</hi> said, I am thy vassall. Thou wouldest haue pluckt God from his Throne. Consider you that are here, whither <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur de Guyse</hi> your Gouernour would euer haue endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that a Lackey should braue him thus, as I doe now my Prince. And turning to <hi>Magdalene</hi> he said: En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure patiently <hi>Magdalene,</hi> for the remission of thy sinnes, and thinke thy selfe euen vnworthie to humble thy selfe; Resist thou <hi>Belzebub,</hi> for thou seest how I braue him, and yet there are heere fiue Princes in this body.</p>
                     <p>The Diuels would haue laid diuers foule aspersions and disgraces vpon the Companies of the Doctrine and of Saint <hi>Vrsula,</hi> but God is pleased to exalt them as it were by Pismires and leaues of trees. Labour therefore for the glory of God.</p>
                     <p>Then hee swore that whatsoeuer had beene by him deliuered, of hell, and of the mercie of God, and of those that were obstinate, was all true: by the obstinate, he tacitly meant those that were negligent in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions to Saint <note n="u" place="margin">These are the Patrones of the Country of Prouince together with Saint <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene,</hi> where their bodies lie interred.</note>

                     <p>And speaking to the Exorcist, he said, Encrease his paines, seeing he will not tell his name. <hi>Verrine</hi> said, We are of the ranke of Thrones, and doe yet yeeld our obedience, but here the men would be better then their Masters. That time is not yet come.</p>

Thou doest but lend thy tongue in the vtterance of these things, and hast now deliuered twelue seuerall discourses, by the which thou art much confirmed; Be content with this: You haue seene the beginning, the progresse and issue of this matter. <note n="y" place="margin">This was in that houre wherein the Sermon of the Aduent was ended at Aix, where he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched about e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuen a clock in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone.</note> O <hi>Michaelis,</hi> thou art now preaching, and hast said many things and that truly, but hast gained ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie little by the same. <hi>Louyse</hi> neuer studied, and yet hath in a summarie comprehended all manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>

Some go to heauen through repentance, others through innocence. <hi>Mary</hi> is in Paradise for her innocence, <hi>Magdalene</hi> for her repentance. <hi>Lewes</hi> King of Fraunce is the Patron of Kings. It is the good pleasure of God, that men of all conditions should be saued.

There are of all sorts in Heauen (to our confusion be it spoken) to the end that none might haue any pretension for excuse. God placeth those in Paradise which loue his Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mandements and keepe them, and doe not quench in themselues his good inspirations. Hee sets them at his

table: He causeth them to eate of his bread, and drinke of his wine: He doth not as the men of this world doe, vse their seruants as if they were slaues; Nay, there bee diuers that doe a great deale worse, who cherish and make much of their dogges, but doe euill entreate their seruants. Then he said that hee should not be abashed if God would elect Princes and not men of base condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yea, we could be contented to haue patience that he should chuse men; but that women should bee gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Paradise, that is it that maddeth vs. <note n="b" place="margin">In the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrologe the third of March.</note>

                        <hi>Margaret</hi> of Hungary was a Queene, shee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a Monastery, and became so humble that shee would not be called the daughter of a King but of a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen.

Then <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> continuing on his discourse, said: <hi>Barbara</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed by her owne Father, and presently the Diuell slew him vpon the place.

that haue committed folly and were great sinners, as were <hi>Pelagia, Thais,</hi> and <hi>Magdalene:</hi> which we speake without any preiudice to them or their glorie, it doth rather conduce with the glorie of God and his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, that he would vouchsafe to take them into blisse, who did a thousand times deserue Hell.</p>
                     <p>They that will not beleeue what is here spoken, will say that these two here be women, and haue had their lesson giuen vnto them: by which meanes these discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses will not proue vse-full vnto them, which doth put vs in great comfort. A Preacher is often wearied in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of one Sermon, and I haue already made fifteene discourses by the mouth of this woman here (meaning <hi>Louyse</hi>) and haue sometimes made two or three in a day of greater extent and length, then Preachers in their Aduents. Cursed be thy force, and cursed be him that hath bestowed it vpon thee. <hi>Belzebub</hi> at this discourse cried out. O power! Then <hi>Verrine</hi> said, it is the force which God giueth her. How strange is it that Diuels should preach the Commandements of God and his Counsels, and should teach the religious, Clergie men, Priests, and Seculars, and all sorts of people? I tell you, here are viands for all people to eate; Eate he that will. There are not a few of vs who are not well pleased with the sauce, but would rather chuse the sauce of Hell. You shall finde Notaries that for a matter of fiue sous will Register the Acts false, and breake their oathes. The Diuels are more faithfull vnto their Maister then you men are.</p>
                     <p>When the Diuels haue once sworne according to the purpose of God and his Church, being thus adiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto the truth they want ability to lye. Men haue their free-will, if they doe ill, they doe goe forth-with to hell; if good, they are straight admitted into heauen. But the Diuell is meerely constrained to speake the truth when God would haue it so: they haue no free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to doe that which is good, but are enforced, accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7439:61"/>
Fiends as they are, to deliuer a truth. Otherwise to what purpose scrueth the authority of the Church, if oathes haue no tye or power? or to what end are these bookes of Exorcisines published? For they that denie this, must denie the authoritie of the Church, and those that haue composed and allowed the said bookes. They must further say, that there was neuer any dispossessed after the taking of an oath. But they plunge into a gulfe, from whence they can neuer issue out, and either they must make search and inquisition, after the curious persons that are in hell, to make explanation of their curiosities, or after the Saints in heauen, to cause them to say, that all their writings are nothing worth: And so by a consequence they wil come to deny the Church, and so stand defiled with the infectious opinions of the Caluinists.</p>
                     <p>How wonderfull is this? that Diuels should preach of good intention, pure affection, puritie of conscience, simplicitie, humilitie, and resignation of the world, and teach men not to reserue the least loue of themselues: as also to shew the meanes toward the attainment of Paradise, and to discourse of chastitie and pouertie? The Diuels will be a meanes of the reformation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Monasteries, the Diuels will yeeld more furtherance hereunto, then their Bishops, Abbots, or Prelates are able; to their great griefe doe they reueale it: This must be the meanes of that reformation. Then he tooke an oth after this forme: I doe here sweare by that God, whom you worship, and who is your Creator and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, that whatsoeuer I haue here spoken is true, and that all is done for his glorie, the saluation of soules, and instruction of the Clergie, and Laytie, and all sorts of people; for the good and the bad, and for the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many Monasteries as well of men as of women; All which is most true. I sweare this according to the intention of God and his Church, which I neuer did before, and this oth I haue taken vpon the blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,

and without being spoken vnto by you; and haue sworne this with all the solemnities that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to a true oth, according to the intention of God and his Spouse the Church, that whatsoeuer I haue deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered was for his glorie, as also for the conue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And when I was to take this oth, I said, I doe sweare by the liuing God, which is the greatest oth that may be taken.</p>
                     <p>After this he said: Those that are so preiudicate as to say, these things are false and very vnsutable to truth, shall doe a wrong to God.

And in regard these euents runue in a course beyond ordinarie, there are many that will rather denie Gods power, then confesse that this is true.

And said, He doth vs wrong to take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs those who by so many meanes haue been knit and fastned vnto vs, and to the Art of Magicke. His bountie vnto them is so great, that, to the end they may be conuerted, he doth trauell them with great sicknesses, and by strange and violent tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: yet for all this they would not be conuerted.

not the first that haue offended God, but that there are many others as well as they: yet for all this God is so gracious that he euer knocks at the doore of their hart, that so at last he may win them home vnto him. <note n="f" place="margin">The compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and mercy of our Lady.</note>

He would desire to be forsaken of all Gods creatures, because he hath so grieuously trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed: he would thinke himselfe vnworthie to tread on the earth, yea vnworthie of eternall damnation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing and assuredly beleeuing, that the greatest grace that God can bestow vpon him, is to stirre vp all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels in Hell to punish, torture and giue castigation vnto his villanies, thinking that all this was nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of his transgressions. Furthermore, sinners would pray all that euer was created to aske mercie of God for them. But, Lord, sinners are so stuffed with pride and presumption, that they thinke much, when they haue transgressed, to reueale their sinnes to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor: but say, what will hee doe for vs, if wee should confesse our grieuous sinnes vnto him? And because (Lord) they are so loaden with pride and obstinacie,

giue, giue, giue them to vs; otherwise you doe offer vs exceeding iniurie. Thus being readie to retire and hide my selfe, I cried with a loud voyce in a great rage, for I was driuen into desperation, and deliuered this whole discourse with great furie, and was indeede besides my selfe. Finally, turning towards sinners, I said thus vnto them: Ha! sinners; thinke, thinke, thinke vpon the goodnesse of your God; saying vnto them againe, Ha, ha, ha! thinke vpon his goodnesse, and haue in your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance the mercie of your Redeemer, Creator, and Sanctifier. Goe your waies, and assure your selues, that if you make not your vse hereof, the wrath and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God will fall vpon you, and all hell will rise vp in iudgement against you.</p>

Doest thou alwaies (Lord) present thy wounds vnto thy Father in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of sinners? is this a bagge that neuer shutteth? Then he said, We that are Diuels doe thus torment the soules in Hell in the middest of the flames, sometimes wee tosse them of one side, and sometimes of another, and snatch them from the fire to throw them on ice. What say ye? will you goe into this countrey?</p>
                     <p>And speaking vnto <hi>Magdalene,</hi> hee said, Cursed be the houre wherein thou wert first possessed, which will cost me so deare that I shall haue cause to remember it for euer. O wisedome of God, too great! O infinite, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible, admirable wisedome!

grumble and to make a noyse: come, come, let vs march into the field, we must awake and rouse vp our people. Then said <hi>Verrine, Responde maledicte,</hi>

Hereupon it is that God saith, Whatsoeuer you shall doe vnto the least of mine (speaking of the poore) I shall take it as done vnto my selfe. And alleaging that place of the Gospel when your Lord reproueth <hi>Iudas</hi> of his auarice in blaming of <hi>Magdalene,</hi> he said, The poore you haue alwayes with you, but mee you shall not haue alwayes. And he bare record that <hi>Magdalen</hi> had done a good worke, saying vnto her, that she should be had in memory throughout the world, wheresoeuer this Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel shold be preached.

that Baptisme, Faith and Virginitie were sufficientlie powerfull to bring them to heauen. No, it not so: for your Lord did obiect, that they had no oyle in their lampes; vnderstanding thereby good works. And when they came to be admitted vnto the Supper (whereby is signified the day of Iudgment) and to be presented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their spouse, he said vnto them, <hi>Neseio vos.</hi> I am a bed, you cannot come in.

                     <p>Then I said, that the Angels were very beautifull, and dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the reason why such goodly creatures should for one sinne be throwne downe from heauen.

                     <p>ON this day in the morning, there chanced to arriue thither a religious person of the order of S. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis de Paul,</hi> a <hi>minime</hi> Fryer; who kneeling on his knees neere the steps, by which you goe to the holy <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence,</hi> there befell this dispute that followeth. When <hi>Belzebub</hi> began to cruciate and shake the bodie of <hi>Magdalene, Verrine,</hi> one of the Diuels that was in the body of <hi>Lonyse de Capeau,</hi> began to say: Feare not <hi>Magdalene,</hi> thou art very happy to be thus tortured in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7439:70"/>
this world, for they shall not haue power vpon thee in the world to come: So it is <hi>Magdalene,</hi> that God desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to make triall in this world of those whom he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth. Beleeue <hi>Magdalene,</hi> this is a certaine truth, and I am constrained to vtter the same, although my desire was to palliate and keepe it close. I know not what to doe, I am not able to withstand it. Then <note n="h" place="margin">The disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betweene <hi>Verrine</hi> and a Frier.</note> the said reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious person said vnto <hi>Verrine:</hi> Peace thou accursed spirit, thou art the father of lies and falshood. To which <hi>Verrine</hi> replyed: It is true, I am the father of lies, but being compelled therunto by the vnresistable working of the Almighty, I must of necessity deliuer the truth. The Frier answered: Pease thou damned spirit, thou canst not speake a truth, thou art the father of lies, and therefore art not capable to speake any thing truely. S. <hi>Thomas</hi> saith, that truth is no vertue in him that onely speaketh it, but when the person that vttereth the same, is thereby made vpright and sincere, then, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a vertue. 2<hi rend="sup">a</hi>e. 2. q<hi rend="sup">a</hi>e. 109. art. 1. He further saith, that <note n="i" place="margin">This is an annotation found there in the margent.</note> this vertue is no theologicall or intellectuall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but a morall; and therefore may be pronounced ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by one that speaketh truth, or by a lyar. Doctor <hi>Maldonat</hi> vpon the <note n="k" place="margin">That the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell may speake truth.</note> 8. Chapter of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> doth with great subtility obserue, that the diuell may speake a truth, For he spake the truth in confessing Christ Iesus to be the Sonne of God: and albeit it may be obiected that he doth this to an euill purpose, yet was it not so in this particular: for although it is to be coniectured that he spake by constranit, yet doth not this hinder but that he might speake the truth. Hee spake the truth in the third of <hi>Kings,</hi> 22. Chapter, when he said that hee would be a lying Spirit: as also when he alleaged Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to Iesus in the desert, although it was leuelled to a wicked purpose. Notwithstanding wee ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware how we beleeue what hee saith, if it be not cleere, that it is by coaction and in the vertue of the name of God by Exorcismes, and that he speaketh conformable
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7439:71"/>
vnto the Scriptures and the doctrine of the Church; and in this case wee are not to beleeue him, but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Then said <hi>Verrine,</hi> I will proue vnto thee that what I haue spoken is true, &amp; that the Diuell is able to speake truth. He replyed thou canst not, for thou hast no abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to doe good, thou art an accursed and wicked Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <hi>Verrine</hi> answered: It is true, I am an accursed, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and damned spirit, and am not able of my selfe to speake any thing but falshood, and to act nothing but mischiefe. It is true, that of mine owne free will I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe the thing that is good, but when I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained by Almighty God, there is a necessity laid vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me to deliuer the truth. Then the Frier hearing that Masse was begun, held his peace. And <hi>Verrine</hi> said, I will take Gods part, and since I am forced vnto obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I will serue him with more obedience then you. Then he cried out as loud as he could:<note n="b" place="margin">It is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, if God were not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine and put his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I say they may as wel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that God is omnipotent, and that there is no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Church, and that all the bookes of Exorcis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes are idle and of none effect. They must also denie and disapproue of all the oathes which Exorcists do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> cause the Diuels to take: for why do they demand it of them, and make them sweare to deliuer the truth, if they are disabled to speak the truth? Or why do they lose so much time which they employ about those y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are posses<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed, if they can draw nothing but falshood from them.</p>
                     <p>True it is (said <hi>Verrine</hi>) when the Exorcists are not circumspect and well aduised, it is likely the Diuels make their aduantages thereof, and so somtimes sweare falsly against God and his Church: but this is no fault of ours, it is the Exorcists fault, because they haue not had that circumspection as to cause them to sweare, as I haue done, according to the intention of God and his Church, and also according to the meaning of the Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cist: in which case wee cannot lye, but are constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to speake the truth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:7439:71"/>If this were not so, I should then say that the Diuell had more power then God. But it is cleere, the Diuell must acknowledge a subordination vnto God, not out of loue, but by compulsion, by which they are tied vnto obedience.</p>
                     <p>Then the Frier said vnto the Priests and other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious persons that were there: make this Diuell hold his peace, and himselfe said, peace thou cursed spirit, peace.</p>
                     <p>But the Diuell euer shewed himselfe more and more couragious to speake on Gods behalfe, and said reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly, that he would not obey him, for he had a Superior mightier the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he (meaning the Frier) yea more powerfull then the Exorcist that did command him. At this the Frier grew angry and said: peace thou wicked spirit, peace: get thee into Hell thou damned fiend; and spake to the assemblie: My Masters, you should make him hold his peace: this is a cursed spirit, and speakes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but lyes, and saith that God is his Redeemer.</p>
                     <p>To this <hi>Verrine</hi> answered, that hee lyed: for hee had said that God was his Creator and Iudge, but not his Redeemer. To which the Frier answered, that hee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood him so.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Verrine</hi> told him, that hee had no good eares, and vnderstood him amisse. Hereupon the Frier said: I do assure you, you ought to make him hold his peace: &amp; he himselfe began to threaten him saying: peace thou blasphemous beast, peace: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mest thou here to preach lies? Thou saiest that thou art sent from God to preach the Gospell: wee haue Preachers enow without thee. To this <hi>Verrine</hi> replied, thou lyest, and doest mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnderstand me, I said not so: thou knowest not the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of this businesse,<note n="l" place="margin">The Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall order of the Church doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, no not to good Angels.</note> and that maketh thee to speake so foolishly as thou doest. It is most true, I neuer so much as said that I was sent from God to preach the Gospell: I should lye to say it. I said that I was here in the bodie of this vnhappie woman, who hath begged
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7439:72"/>
from God that shee might bee humbled euen to the paines of Hell, for the saluation of her neighbours. I said, that God had permitted me to enter into this body for his glorie, and the conuersion of many soules, and in particular of these two, which thou curious fellow knowest not.</p>
                     <p>Thou art a proud arrogant fellow, and worse then a Diuell, except thou humble thy selfe, and I will proue it vnto thee that thou beleeuest not thy God to be om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent. Thou art worse then an Hereticke, except thou repent and beleeue what I haue spoken.</p>
                     <p>Get thee gon, get thee gon accursed spirit (said the Frier) I will not beleeue the Diuell. Then said <hi>Verrine,</hi> I doe adiure thee by the liuing God to come with me and sweare that all which I haue said is true. For thou deseruest to bee burnt aliue, if thou doest not beleeue thy God to be omnipotent. Why saiest thou thy <hi>Credo,</hi> if thou beleeuest not what I haue spoken? It is not to bee auoided: thou must either denie the puissance of God, or confesse that this is true. To this the Frier re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that there was a <note n="m" place="margin">There are many women possessed in <hi>Paris.</hi>
                        </note> woman in <hi>Paris</hi> much resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the condition of this woman, in whom was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered a great deale of knauerie and iugling, and that she did deceiue much people. <hi>Verrine</hi> told him that it was true: shee did indeede cousen many: but <hi>Louyse</hi> was trulie possessed. Let her life belooked into, and let her be turned ouer to the Examinations of the sharpest vnderstandings. Shee would bee readie euen to suffer Martyrdome to maintaine this auerment, if need did so require, because it would redowne vnto the glorie of her God. Then <hi>Verrine</hi> ingeminated that speech to go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> and sweare with him, and that <hi>Louyse</hi> could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate till they were both sworne.</p>
                     <p>The Frier made great resistance hereunto, and would by no meanes obey it, saying, that hee would not bee commanded by a Diuell.</p>
                     <p>Hereunto <hi>Verrine</hi> answered: it <note n="n" place="margin">We are not to obey Diuels.</note> standeth not with

reason to obey the Diuell: I command thee not from my selfe, but say vnto thee on Gods behalfe, that thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ome along and sweare with mee: it waxeth late, and <hi>Louyse</hi> is to communicate. Then the Frier said vnto the Priest which held the blessed Sacrament: Father, doe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Verrine</hi> also discoursed touching the reason of these present writings, in forme of a letter missiue: the tenour whereof here ensueth.</p>
                     <p>The men of these times are so curious, that God must bee as a Gardener vnto them, (witnesse <hi>Magdalen,</hi> to whom he appeared in the semblance of a Gardener) and fit diuers sorts of sallets vnto their palats, lest they should be disrelished; wherein he resembleth a good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who doth so affectionately loue his child, that he is euer asking him, What wilt thou eate childe?

What doth the father then? doth he fall a beating of him? doth he threaten and chide him? no; but goeth about and sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth after other strange victuals, which may chance to please them for their noueltie, as being such which hee

that the Diuell called <hi>Verrine</hi> should be the instrument of thy conuersion, not from his proper and franke will, but constrainedly and by enforcement, worse then any gally-slaue or captiue that euer was exposed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: being, terribly threatned thereunto, and hauing a desire to giue stoppage and hindrance to these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, obiecting if a man did well, hee had a ground whereon to frame vnto himselfe some hope of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, but that this man was in expectation of nothing but of his eternall damnation: For so will it happen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee if thou resist the Almighty. Make vse therefore of these admonitions, and put in practise the precepts comprised in these letters, for it is impossible for thee to palliate thy faults before God, as <hi>Adam</hi> and the Pharisie thought to doe. The Pharisie boasted of his good workes, and contemned the Publican, saying that he was not as that man, yet was the one of them wicked before men, the other before God: the one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed that he was not worthy to lift vp his eyes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and returned to his house iustified: the other was confident of his works, and hypocriticall countenance, and returned home like vnto the (Iewes) full of sinnes: but God wil receiue thee into grace, as he did <hi>Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> who was a Magician as thou art. Hee that is more desirous of your welfare then you your selfe are, sendeth this letter vnto you. Beware that hell open not her iawes to deuour thee, if thou neglect these letters, which are directed vnto thee by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and pronounced by a Diuell named <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> that now remaineth in the body of <hi>Louyse Capeau,</hi> as thou well knowest; Neither gauest thou him vnto her by thy charmes, with this intendment or purpose to conuert thee, although if thou bee not too wilfull in thy vnbeleefe, it will so fall out vnto thee.</p>

execution, to the glory of his sacred name, and saluation of soules. Come along with this Priest, and suffer him not to step a foot from you, but let your vigilancy haue an eye ouer him, as if he were a malefactor. For hee is in the Diuels clawes, you shall do well to binde him with a stole vnder the mould of the head, and bring along with you the booke of Exorcismes, and if you shall thinke it necessarie, you may doe well to exorcise him, forbidding <hi>Belzebub</hi> and all hell to hinder it. God grant you his grace to execute his will, and that you giue no stoppe vnto the same, that the said malefactor may be brought to S. <hi>Baume,</hi> where the miracle shall be wrought if he himselfe be no hinderance thereunto. the 16. of December. 1610.</p>
                     <p>Then hee dictated a letter for the father <hi>Gardian,</hi> as followeth.

                     <p>After this was finished, he dictated another letter to Madame <hi>Blanguart,</hi> as here ensueth, in the name of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Romillon.</hi> My daughter, I pray you for the loue of God, to lend a chamber vnto these men, who are come to treate of a businesse of great waight and importance; neither is it fit to make you as yet acquainted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall, it being forbidden me by one that hath power and authority both ouer you and me.

Shee that is most vnworthie to call you her mother, doth pray you for Gods sake, and entreateth you from your superiour, to obey<note n="k" place="margin">These sisters made dainty to send their gouernesse to S. <hi>Baume,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their superiour had sent for her.</note> him in those things which hee shall now impose vpon your performance, without any replication, gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saying, or contradiction whatsoeuer; and without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting or saying, How shall wee bee able to vndertake such a businesse? wee could not come if wee were all at home, and how shall we now (when wee are but few) venture vpon that which many would not dare to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe? It is the Diuels craft and wilinesse, euer to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and dispute against obedience, yea to cause grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and mutinies against superiours and gouernours; obiecting vnto you, that they doe many times impose vpon you such difficult and vneasie commands, that it is almost impossible to effect them. But remember that the most worthy mother of God is the gouernesse of this house; giue therefore the keyes vnto her, for the gouernment appertaineth to her, and she shall be more regardfull and studious of your good then your selues can possibly be; for she is not tied to those hinderances as you are, to your spirituall exercises, to your prayers, and to the holy Communion; neither is she filled with selfe-loue as you are. Vnder a shadow and pretence of good, many times religious persons doe withdraw themselues from the commands of their superiours, and commit many great and grosse incongruities, although not so much out of malice, as for the most part out of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and selfe-loue, which at some times wee are content to acknowledge, but for the most part our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued nature causeth vs to dissemble it, so that it lyeth hidden in the face of hypocrites. For (say they) how can the desire to receiue the sacrament often, to pray, and performe those exercises that conduce vnto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance proceed from the Diuell? alleaging that God hath spoken by his Prophet: Repent, for if you doe not repent, you shall die the death: Who dares say that this
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7439:80"/>
is not true? It is confessed to be a truth, but God loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth further, hee would haue a perfect <hi>Cassandra,</hi> a full humiliation, obedience, simplicity, and resignation of all things. Hee doth therefore let you know, that you are not to neglect the least word of your superiors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Louyse</hi> doth therefore pray you to embrace that councell which is very reasonable, and which at the time of her departure from you, you were pleased to lay close vnto her; which is, that she would endeauour to be obedient, and to put her selfe wholly in the hands of God. Which she taking in good worth, doth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise desire you to share in this aduice, and to enioyne the same vnto your spirituall daughters: exhort <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet Burle,</hi> and <hi>Martha d' Aiguisier</hi> to doe the same. It standeth with reason, that when the gouernesse is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, none of the rest should behaue themselues with any dislike or contumacie; For rebellion and diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is the daughter of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> as humility is the daughter of God, and should therefore be your sister. Come therefore accompanied with her, she is of a noble parentage, but yet doth so bow her selfe to obedience that shee is continually prest and actiue to doe the will of God her father. She will go with you to heauen, and will assist you to climbe that steep &amp; wearisome moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: Expect when you are come hither, things so full of strangenesse and admiration, that you would not for all the gold in the world but see, vnderstand, and bee made familiar vnto them. But hee that will haue profit must take paines for the acquisition thereof. <hi>No paine, no gaine.</hi> The subscription was, Your most vnworthy slaue, full of great boldnesse and presumption, sendeth this vnto you; you know my insufficiencie and want of vnderstanding, perfectly well: so that you will appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend with ease, that shee that sendeth this, had neuer that ability of iudgement to fashion such a letter, nor the boldnesse to speake vnto her gouernesse with so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle respect and ceremony.

                     <p>The superscription was, To sister <hi>Catherine,</hi> gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the house of S. <hi>Vrsula</hi> at Aix.

                        <hi>Ioannes Euangelista</hi> thou diddest tell thy maister, <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumus</hi>; and diddest indeed afterward prooue a Martyr; but it was a martyrdome of passion and greese, when thou wert with thy maister at the Crosse. He that will goe to heauen must honour God, and loue his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as himselfe: and be ready to depart with his goods for his neighbours body, and with his owne body for his soule: and if any shall remaine obstinate, they shall frye in those vnquenchable flames. It is true, many <note n="o" place="margin">There were publick sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, especially for the most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous: of which they haue of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the most need: and this was done for sinspast, present and to come.</note> Sacrifices haue beene offered vp vnto God in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of <hi>Magdalen</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> the Priest.</p>
                     <p>Thou <hi>Louyse</hi> diddest beg of God to suffer for his sake, and thou shalt suffer, and for the better support of thy patience, God will augment and double thy force vpon thee. And to show that this proceedeth from God he shall make thee obedient. Then <hi>Belzebub</hi> said, that <hi>Magdalen</hi> had giuen vp her keyes vnto him. <hi>Verrine</hi> answered, Thou lyest, God seeth more cleerly then thy selfe, thy aime is to ouerthrow her and make her perish, by impaciency and despaire. No, no, <hi>Belzebub,</hi> this soule belongeth vnto God: But put case she had made a bequeath of her soule vnto thee, I say that God may at any time take her home vnto himselfe; cannot a King enter into his owne Palace at any time that pleaseth

                     <p>Then said <hi>Verrine</hi> vnto him, Hee will enter either by force or loue, and will haue her to himselfe, although she had committed all the sinnes of those that are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in hell.

Thus should <hi>Magdalene</hi> humble her self, and should say, approaching to the seate of his mercie, Father, I haue sinned against heauen and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7439:84"/>
against thee, against thy blessed Mother, against the whole Court of heauen, and against all thy creatures, I am therefore vnworthie to bee called your daughter, nay your slaue, nay I am not worthie to lift vp mine eyes to heauen; but take mee vnto your mercie, (if it stand with your good pleasure) who am the most wretched and disconsolate creature that liues vnder the heauen, or vpon the earth. Then he added further: <hi>Magdalene</hi> be conuerted, and abandon thy sinnes: thou hast been hitherto gently led on in calmenesse and in softnesse: thou hast been priuilie reproued by secret inspirations, by preaching, by reading of good bookes, by many spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall instructions which haue from time to time been infused into thee, as well in the house of S. <hi>Vrsula,</hi> as by the fathers the Confessors, and other learned and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated personages, who haue giuen them vnto thee both for thy practise, and for a remedie against thy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries. He further said, <hi>Magdalene</hi> being rebelliously bent against her God, and the admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of his Spouse the Church, and God seeing her perdition so neere, and her selfe so obstinate in her sinnes, and hauing by all the aboue-named remedies profited nothing, hath permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that an vnworthie, yea thrice-vnworthie sister of the Companie of S. <hi>Vrsula, Louyse Capelle,</hi> who of her selfe is lesse powerfull then the leafe of a tree, a stone, or a pismire, yea who conceiueth her selfe to be vnworthie of the title or stile of one of Gods creatures, should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce these things by the appointment of God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, and a Diuell, named <hi>Verrine,</hi> should by her mouth dictate and deliuer all these writings.</p>
                     <p>Then hee made this remonstrance vnto <hi>Magdalene,</hi> saying vnto her in a great <note n="a" place="margin">
                           <hi>Magdalene</hi> suffered her selfe to be gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned away at times.</note> surie and chase, as if he had been mad, that God was infinitly angrie with her if she were not amended, or did remaine in a determinate kinde of obstinacie. And he for his part did speake with as great assurednesse from God, as euer the Prophet <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> did speake to the people of Niniue, when he said vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                     <p>He also said to <note n="b" place="margin">He meaneth that <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene</hi> had not as then shewed so great signes of her repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance, as that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels had left all hope to regaine her.</note> 
                        <hi>Magdalene,</hi> Art not thou an accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed woman, that the Witches Sabbath is kept here?

                           <hi>Francis Billet</hi> felt strange motions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himselfe, but resisted them, and called for the grace of God.</note> 
                        <hi>Francis</hi> himselfe hath taken in a charme whilest he was drinking.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Verrine</hi> further said vnto sister <hi>Magdalene:</hi> If God were capable of sadnesse, he would bewaile, <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene,</hi> the great vncertaintie and suspense wherein thou keepest him, touching thy conuersion. Then did <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> threaten her with more absolutnes and authoritie, then euer her Superiour did vse towards her, or any creature in the world beside. And good reason hath he for the same, because hee was to execute the will of the Creator, being (as hee himselfe said) as the Kings Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant, who speaketh in the Kings name and authoritie, and commandeth, saying, If you doe not put this in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and obey the King, you shall be grieuously pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, because hee that withstandeth his King, deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the most seuere punishment that can be inflicted. So the sinner that rebelleth, and growes obstinate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his God, not keeping his commandements, nor obseruing his and the Churches Counsels, he deserueth sharpe correction, yea tortures and hell it selfe.</p>
                     <p>Also he said: O <hi>Magdalene,</hi> conuert thy selfe, God is most gracious, and full of pitie. Thou art vexed <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene,</hi> to contemne and set at naught the delights of this world, and yet regardest not the pleasures of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</p>
                     <p>Then he said: <note n="d" place="margin">
                           <hi>Magdalene</hi> did at times wauer shrewdly, like to one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered of a grieuous and long sicknesse, and staggers when he offers to goe, and is readie to sinke for weaknesse, but then lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth &amp; staieth himselfe on his staffe.</note> Miserable, accursed, and damned as thou art, art thou not truly vnhappie, to beleeue that

which commeth from <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and giuest no heede vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me who am here from God? Art thou not vnhappie to beleeue that <hi>Louyse</hi> is the author and expresser of these things? O <hi>Magdalene,</hi> thou doest beleeue it, and this beleefe is exceedingly preiudiciall vnto thee. It is true <hi>Magdalene,</hi> and I must lay it close vnto thee, thou diddest double and hadst a false intention before God, and thy opinion was that <hi>Louyse</hi> spake these things from her owne head. And this is true, <hi>Magdalene</hi>; as for <hi>Louyse</hi> she is possessed, <hi>Catherine</hi> is also possessed, and so are the rest that are bewitched, but they know nothing of what is here deliuered; whereof thou <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> art the only vnhappy cause. It is true <hi>Magdalen,</hi> thou art proud and vngratefull, hauing a heart of stone, a heart harder then a Diamond: thou conceiuest that God is thy debter; O thou proud caitise, how willing wouldest thou haue been to plucke him, if thou hadst been able, from his throne of Maiestie. But be of good courage <hi>Magdalene,</hi> and humble thy selfe, thy God is so good, that although thou hadst runne through all the sinnes of the world, and of all the damned, thy God can shew thee mercie, yea and wil pardon thee thy offences, if thou humble thy selfe and be penitent.</p>
                     <p>The same day in the euening <hi>Louyse</hi> and <hi>Magdalene</hi> were exorcised by Father <hi>Francis,</hi> and <hi>Verrine</hi> spake in this manner: Who hath euer beheld the like, that a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill should enter the lists against a Diuell? wee are all damned for euer, and what we do, wee do by constraint, for there is no iot of charitie dwelling in vs. I auerre that this woman is possessed, and hath three Diuels in her bodie, for the particular conuersion of two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, and then for the conuersion of many others.

sake. Our Lord had many friends and associats that did beare him company at the Table at Easter, Whitsontide and Christmas, but there were few that receiued him worthily, and a smal number that presented themselues before him with due and serious preparation.</p>
                     <p>I take God to witnesse, his blessed Mother, and all Saints, that I doe now tell you, if you doe not repent, and acknowledge the benefits that God hath so plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully powred vpon you, you are not worthy to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of any Sacrament, nay you deserue to dye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the comfort of them.</p>
                     <p>Those that are curious, are liquorous of more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge then is expedient for them; which they make inquisition after in the pit of Hel, as doe the Caluinists, and all other Hereticks, who would interprete the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in holy writ, not according to Gods meaning, but interpose their owne giddy and priuate fancies, and reiect the meaning and exposition of the Church. Yong <note n="e" place="margin">Against youth</note> people bee you penitent, you pamper vp your flesh with such delicacies and nicenesse, &amp; let in al plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures with such a full scope vnto you, that you stand vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the arrest of high treason against God.

They doe also see the soules of the damned, who hauing in their first creation beene fashioned with much bewty, are now as hideous in their semblance as are the Deuils themselues.</p>

If you fast in this world, you shall feast in the world to come. The excellency of the choise delicacies of the world to come, doth breed a sacietie and disgust of the meats you heere enioy: and whosoeuer could but get a crumme or the least rellish in the world of those dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they are so exquisitely prepared, that they would cause all the viands of this world to bee loathed. Wee may talke of them, but wee shall neuer taste them, it is too late now to repent vs. That horse is not a horse of price and value that gallopeth not but when hee is spur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and hee who serueth God with an ill will, is of no reckoning.

I doe further adiure thee by <hi>Lucifer,</hi> that if thou canst take me tripping, thou doe directly tell mee
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7439:87"/>
wherein I lye. O cursed <hi>Belzebub,</hi> thou canst not reply against me, for I deliuer the truth, and that by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God. Thou art accursed, and as wretched as my selfe: speake wicked spirit if thou hast any thing to say. Then <hi>Verrine</hi> began to cry. All you <note n="i" place="margin">The people of Townes &amp; Villages there adioyning did flocke thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in great troupes.</note> here may obserue (speaking to the Assembly that was there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent) he is my Prince, but I doe not now acknowledge him to be so. It is true <hi>Belzebub,</hi> thou art my Prince, but I here renounce any superiority which thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendest to haue ouer me. I also renounce thee <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and the authority of all the Diuels in Hell, for wee are not powerfull to resist the Almightie. You, who take <hi>Lucifers</hi> part, can reply nothing of any moment or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, neither haue you more force then a sort of Flies. All this while did <hi>Verrine,</hi> in contempt, tread vpon <hi>Belzebub,</hi> saying: Thou proud Spirit, and full of arrogancie as my selfe, thou swellest &amp; art in the highth of pride. I hope there is no offence done, if that these proud creatures bee deiected and throughly dishat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Verrine</hi> said to <hi>Magdalene, Magdalene</hi> the gate of Heauen is opened, so is the gate of Hell, and there men may enter in at full Carroche, yea foure Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roches together may haue easie passage thither, and all foure may enter in a front: but the gate of Paradise is so narrow, that few passe in thereat, and much humiliation is expedient to enter in at the same.</p>
                     <p>Ouer this gate, <hi>Obedience</hi> is seated, and vnder it is <hi>Humilitie,</hi> on the one side standeth <hi>Charitie,</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Hope</hi>; and <hi>Perseuerance</hi> is the Porter that letteth in those that come thither. <hi>Humilitie</hi> represents the birth of the Sonne of God, and <hi>Obedience</hi> signifieth that the Sonne of God hath humbled himselfe from his birth, vntill the time of his death.</p>
                     <p>Sinne is more vgly and deformed then the Diuell. If a man-had a conuenient house of his owne, and a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable competencie wherewith to liue, and yet without
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7439:87"/>
cause should giue and cast himselfe into the hands of Turkes, and should from them receiue hard vsage and entertainement: if such a one should plaine himselfe, men would say vnto him; Friend, you were not well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised: you liued well in your owne house, and who is cause of this calamitie but your selfe? I say there is no man that would compassionate such a fellow: Euen so, euery man hath somewhat whereby hee is enabled to make opposition against the world, prouided that hee haue the grace of God: but if he will sinne and inuassall himselfe to the Diuell, who will pitty his case? He is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled in his braine, that enioyeth libertie, and doth vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily render himselfe vp to slauerie. Then hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed this speech with a solemne oath, and after said, to what vse and purpose are wholesome waters if there be none to drinke of them? you must frequent the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, that you may make your profit and aduantage of them. <hi>Magdalene,</hi> the iudgements of God are not to bee squared by the iudgements of men: you are to stoope and abase your selues in this world, if you will ascend to that which is to come. This which I haue spoken <hi>(Magdalene)</hi> was neuer hammered in the shop of Hell.</p>
                     <p>The Diuels haue at sundry times preached, and broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched diuers curiosities to the preiudice and perdition of those that entertained the same, but the things which I deliuer, conduce to the amendment of mens liues and conuersations.</p>
                     <p>The soules of men fall as thick into Hell, as the Corne doth from the Mill. Men goe to Hell by thousands, but they enter one by one into Heauen: though it bee not alwaies so. At times, there haue gone to Heauen 10000. Martyrs in one day, and 11000. Virgins in another day, and many other arriue there after sundry manners, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the good pleasure of God.</p>
                     <p>The same day <hi>Verrine</hi> was asked, why <hi>Magdalene</hi> was not yet endowed with vpright intention, since she
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7439:88"/>
followed his instructions, and the day before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception had hartely renounced Satan. To this hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that he is perfectly possessed with vpright inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that casteth no lustfull winke or glance of the eye on any creature; yet a man might haue an honest heart, although his intention doe fleete and wauer, and might be as it were placed in the middle, seazed vpon by nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party. Then he said, that he was not able to speake one word before another, but as he receiued them from aboue, so he spake them.</p>

                     <p>The same day after dinner <hi>Magdalene</hi> seemed to be much changed, being full of spirituall ioy, and ready to doe and leaue all for the loue of God. She said, that the day before shee had receiued many blowes, and much disgrace without any feare or trembling in her heart, although <hi>Lucifer</hi> endeauoured at the same time to make it appeare otherwise in outward shew; and that she had receiued and taken in good part those instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>She was also that day shut vp within S. <hi>Baume,</hi> and confessed, that the <note n="u" place="margin">They often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled in a place that is vnder the Church, and ioyning vnto the chamber where <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene</hi> lay.</note> Sabbath and assembly of Witches was kept in S. <hi>Baume.</hi> In the euening they were Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised by father <hi>Francis,</hi> and <hi>Verrine</hi> after his accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med manner began to say, They that make difficulty to beleeue that the Diuell constrained by Exorcismes may auow and sweare a truth, are worse then Hereticks, because they must deny the vertue of Exorcismes, the authority of the Church, and the Omnipotency of God. I could tell you all the villanies and sins you haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but I am tyed vp from doing mischiefe. Wee that are Diuels can doe nothing but that which is euill, and Angels can doe nothing but that which is good:
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7439:91"/>
but men are able to doe either good or euill, as being endowed with a free will, and yet, O God, there are of these creatures that doe rebelliously demeane them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues against thee, and are indeed worse then Diuels. The paines that men suffer in this world are as flowers and Roses in comparison of the paines of Hell, which are true torments indeed: I tell you the fiers of this world are imaginarie and painted in respect of the fiers there, and all furnaces are as nothing if they be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but to a sparke in Hell: Diuels are as wild and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenous beasts: they bite in their embracements. Wee promise much and performe nothing, because where nothing is nothing can bee expected. You that are <note n="x" place="margin">Vnto Priests and religious persons.</note> Priests bee circumspect and aduised in your calling, because it is no offence if a man neglect and turne from an Angell of heauen, to doe honour and reuerence vnto you. The Angels indeed doe incessantly behold the face of their God, but you with foure words doe make him descend vpon the Altar, and since herein the King obeyeth his vassall; how wretched must that Priest bee that doth rebell and mutter against his superiour: you lumps of clay, it will not go well with you, vnlesse you humble your selues and bee repentant. Disobedience was it that turned <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradise, and the same disobedience cast <hi>Lucifer</hi> headlong out of Heauen; If God were capable of sadnesse, hee would weepe when he seeth a rebellious and disobedient man, so highly doth that sinne displease him. Euery one ought to liue contentedly in his vocation. You that are Priests and religious persons ought to studie, preach, and search out the truth, for you are sequestred from this world to be seruants vnto the light. Many seeke truth and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find it, because they search after it with a dim and obscure lanthorne: other search it with a greater and fuller light, and they finde it. Faith is this light, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility the doore that openeth vnto truth. The curious walke vpon the brinke of Hell, and thinking alwaies
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7439:92"/>
that they shall finde out what they make inquisition af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they doe at last stumble and fall downe, the head first, and the rest of the body after: witnesse the <hi>Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists, Caluin, Beza, Luther,</hi> these were the heads of our new Hereticks, and all the body, to wit, those, that follow and adhere to their opinions doe fall into this gulfe, if they die obstinately in their fancies: this is it they must looke for vnlesse they be conuerted.</p>
                     <p>You that are in religious Orders attend seriously vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your vocation, and obserue the commandements and counsels of God, and know that your life is a light vnto worldlings, and a patterne or copie of their liues and conuersations: you must studie a new booke, a booke that hath but two leaues; the first leafe contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the manner of attaining vnto perfect humility in the birth of the Son of God; the other leafe containes the obedience which till his death hee euer practised. I tell you, that those who shall reade this booke aduised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and as they ought, I dare bee bold to promise them on Gods behalfe life eternall, because in this booke is comprehended the beginning and end of perfection. He that is humble is neither curious nor rebellious, but is apt for commands and full of obedience; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient cannot die but liue eternally: by obedience I vnderstand such a kind of subiection that shall no way be disagreeable vnto God or his Church, or the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of soules; for if I should say otherwise I should lie. And I say (turning himselfe to the Assembly) speaking vnto you in generall, not in particular, that our Lord had twelue Disciples, of whom one was starke naught: The Iewes were formerly the true children of God, but now they are a reprobate Nation: so I say, if you see a wicked priest, you are not presently to ground from hence that all the rest are like vnto him: if you see a wicked Frier or religious person, you are not by and by to coniecture that their religion is naught; But here is the great misery of worldly men, who when they
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7439:92"/>
see a wicked Priest, are presently ready to say, this is the conuersation of them all: I say vnto them that herein they doe bely them, and they are not to speake after this manner; for the wicked cannot preiudice or dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the good, and those that thus despise Priests doe it to this end that they may haue freer scope to liue in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and licentiousnesse. The booke of humility is hard to be vnderstood by a man that is not very intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, but when hee once shall know the interpretation of the same, hee will find all manner of vertues contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein: for she is a Queene that bringeth with her many Princesses and Ladies in her traine: and as in a chaine one ring followeth and dependeth vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; so doth humility vpon obedience: the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke of true perfection is humility, and the end is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. Great God for this cause wast thou borne, for this cause didst thou die; thou wert borne in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and died'st naked vpon the Crosse, and hast endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red death it selfe, yea a most cruell and ignominious death.</p>

                     <p>In the world all things goe by friendship and partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but it is not so with God; the Monarch and the begger; the faire and the foule; the lame and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect are all alike, if they be in grace alike. You of the lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty keepe the Commandements of God and his Church, and you shall be saued: Heauen was not made meerely and solely for religious persons: bee you onely carefull to loue God, and to serue and obey him. Such and so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall is the power of God, that he stinteth not himselfe
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7439:93"/>
to the praises of Angels or of his creatures, but goeth further, and commandeth the Deuill himselfe, (by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion and not out of loue) to glorifie him and to put his good pleasure in execution. Though all Angels, all men, and all Hell should incessantly enlarge and extend their speaches to relate at full the glory and perfections of God, yet could they neuer attaine vnto the same; it is an abisme whose bottome is inscrutable, and cannot be diued into by the greatest Seraphins, or the Mother of God her selfe, God is onely he who can comprehend it. Many curious persons conceiue their iudgments so able that they can comprise within the same all Gods power, all his sapience and goodnesse, and all his other perfections. Ha! how short commeth their vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of these mysteries; they must humble themselues if they will goe to Paradise, you cannot goe any other way; beleeue mee, this is the path that leadeth to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. <note n="z" place="margin">See the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere vnto the fifth Obiection to the doubts after the Epist. to the Reader</note> The same day <hi>Verrine</hi> bid Father <hi>Francis Billet</hi> to take the Stole, and the booke of Exorcismes, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him from God, &amp; in the vertue of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to command him to dictate this ensuing letter directed vnto a Preist of the Christian doctrine that was tempted to doubt of his vocation: the Exorcismes being performed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, he began to dictate in forme as followeth.</p>
                     <p>Dearest and welbeloued brother, I heere aduertise you that we assuredly know for a truth, that whatsoeuer your Reuerence hath conceiued against your vocation is nothing else but a meere suggestion of the Deuil, who is an vtter enemie to God and all obedience. He ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth to infuse into you rebellion against God and your Superiour, and would haue you to beleeue that your iudgment is able to comprehend all the secrets of God. But I assure you it would require and take vp all our time if we should endeauour to learne and enquire into the secrets of God. For his secrets and iudgments are so abstruse that none of themselues can bee certaine of the manner of them. Many there are that haue a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7439:93"/>
they know the will of God, and that their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is very perfitely illuminated: but for the most part they are beguiled. For wee see by daily experience, that they may be deceaued, and no question are decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, since euery day there are new wonders full of rare and admirable strangenes, discouered in this our God. And perceauing a burthen and pressure vpon my soule, if I should bee wanting vnto you in this office, I haue sent this letter vnto you to wishe you instantly to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch your selfe hither for S. <hi>Baume</hi> with as much speed as possibly you may. If you come before Christmasse, you shall vnderstand, as I conceiue, diuers passages so excellent in themselues and so aduantageous vnto you, that you would not for the world but bee made familiar with them, for they are so full of nouelty and strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that no man aliue did euer see the like. Knowe that <hi>Louyse Capean</hi> whom you haue formerly beene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted withall, one of the vnworthiest and meanest Sisters of the company of S. <hi>Vrsula</hi> that are at Aix, is bewitched and possessed by three Deuils that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her body. It was a Charme that gaue way to this pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of Deuils, which did befall her by the permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of God, and out of a zeale shee had to suffer Hell it selfe, and all the paines thereof (so that she might not be separated thereby from her God) for his glory and the saluation of soules. And being setled for many yeares in this resolution, and comming often times to blessed Communion, shee prayed still vnto God that he would take compassion vpon the soules of her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and this she demanded with such ardency of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, that it is almost impossible for any to attaine vnto the like. And being moued by him that internally spake vnto her and said: Whether, if it were expedient, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard thy body and to expose it euen vnto death for the saluation of thy neighbours, wouldst thou willingly vndertake the same? she accepted of it many times, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that shee was ready to endure all, and that it was
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7439:94"/>
fit to prefer the soule of our neighbour before our body or our owne life. Thus God out of his great goodnesse hath made choice of her for a worke which neither you nor I euer dreamed of, nor should euer haue beleeued, if wee had not seene the experience of the same: and those who haue not had the oportunity to behold it, may perchance heereafter at the least haue meanes to read this wonder. For euery one laboureth with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence that may be to make such vnhard of euents, and so strange a Miracle to appeare vnto the world. And I doe assure you, if you did but vnderstand it aright, you would leaue meate and drinke, nay your very studies to haue knowledge of that, which euery day offereth it selfe vnto our considerations. For Father <hi>Michaelis</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inspired from God, counselled Father <hi>Romillon</hi> to bring <hi>Magdalene</hi> from <hi>Palud,</hi> and to search out al other that were bewitched and bring them to S. <hi>Baume,</hi> that they might there make their vowes. Being there, <hi>Louyse Capeau</hi> came from Aix her selfe alone, accompanied with none of the rest that were possessed, where shee found <hi>Magdalene</hi> already arriued. Touching <hi>Louyse,</hi> she would by no meanes at the first heare tell of Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cismes, saying that she was not possessed, and that all might arise from naturall causes, or by the sleights and power of the Deuils that were in the body of <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene.</hi> She was at Aix when they <note n="a" place="margin">It was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine strange and vnusual ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures.</note> discouered themselues, and it was done in the time of Confession<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7439:94"/>
within the Church of S. <hi>Vrsula</hi>) and when he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed her at the time the Deuils began to bee discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, did reproue her, and say, <note n="b" place="margin">They did at first impure all vnto <hi>Louyse,</hi> but after the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery was made, it was iudged that the Deuils within her, made her speak in that manner.</note> How darest thou to speake thus before thy Superiour? She answered, that she would subiect her selfe to the command, neither of Gouernour, nor Gouernesse, neither would she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde or thinke of them: that shee thought her selfe more knowing, how to conduct her selfe in her owne behauiours and deportments, then they could be: that she would rely vpon her owne iudgment; and that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours did many times command things very vnfit to be put in execution. All this while did not she vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that this was a stratagem of the Deuils, to giue hindrance and stoppe vnto the worke which is now so well begun. And although the Deuill would haue shif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this off by sundry slights and collusions, yet in the end either by force or out of loue she was contented to be obedient; although she still was stiffe in her opinion, that she would not suffer her selfe to be exorcised. But God changed her intendment, and disposed her hart to embrace the good pleasure of God and of her Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and to renounce and disclaime her owne: so that she came to S. <hi>Baume,</hi> and there suffered her selfe to be exorcised. Whereupon one of the Deuils named <hi>Verrine</hi> began to speake and to tell his name, and after many adiurations where withal he was chained and bound vp, he reuealed the names of his companions; and vpon the continuance of the Exorcismes, he said and swore (taking a solemne oath with all the properties and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars there unto belonging) vpon the blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, saying these words. <hi>I sweare by the liuing God, that all which I haue spoken is true.</hi> And further, I sweare ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaning of God and his Church, that the Deuill and all Hell haue made a combination and solemne agreement to ruinate the company of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian doctrine, and the company of S. <hi>Vrsula,</hi> because there is a dependance of one vpon another, and by abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing

the one, the other will of it selfe fall to decay. Many other things he spake at this Exorcisme, and bade vs not from <hi>Romillon</hi> but from God to send and search after all <note n="c" place="margin">Some Preists of the doctrine were tempted to forsake their vocation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of these possessions, and grew factious at the last a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Superiour.</note> those that were tempted, and particularly one who is very high and haughty, and is too ful of conceite of his iudgment and of selfe-will, and to warne him, if hee bee wise to submit himselfe to the will of God, and to his obedience, that is, to returne to his calling, and that he come hither to plead for himselfe, For heere is (said hee) an Aduocate, that is so skilfull in matters of pleading, that he will quickly ease and disburthen him of all care and scruple, and of all those doubts which did stagger him in his apprehending of the pleasure of God: for hauing sought the same with an obscure and dimme lanthorne, it was not to bee wondered at, if hee were not able to finde it.</p>
                     <p>But God seeing him thus benighted, did send vnto him a bright and cleare burning flame, so that hee can now no longer shift things off with excuses; if hee bee wise let him come, that it may bee discerned what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth vnto the light and what vnto darknesse; what to lyes and what vnto truth, and what difference there is betweene his iudgement, and the iudgment of God. Come therefore hither with all promptitude and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and for-slow not your time, to bee informed in a point that toucheth you so neerely, and call to minde how earnestly you haue besought God for this very particular: and these prayers of yours God hath heard, so that you need not feare to be forsaken; as they haue beene a sweete sacrifice vnto him, so shall they prooue very profitable vnto you, if you wil but humble your self to his good pleasure. Remember what God hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that hee will giue grace to the humble, and resist the proud of heart. You are vnworthy to know his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, neither shall you euer vnderstand the same, if you doe not bow vnder obedience, and humble your selfe towards him. You may turne ouer as many bookes as
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7439:95"/>
you will; this is a new booke and very lately composed, and not yet published to the world: within this booke there are not aboue two words; and yet heere is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised the Epitome and abridgment of all perfection: this is our Philosophy and Diuinity, which wee are so seriously to study.</p>
                     <p>Call also to your remembrance, that they who will not read this booke, are very vnworthy to ascend vnto so great and sublime perfections. Come therefore, and trifle not with any studied or prepared delaies, for God expecteth you, that he may bestow vpon you that which with such ardency you haue besought at his hands, that is, to open your vnderstanding, that you may be made acquainted with his will. Remember what hee saith, Aske and you shall haue, seeke and you shall finde, knock and it shall be opened vnto you. Call to minde, how often you haue knocked at the gate of this King, and how he who had the key of this gate, to wit, <hi>Peter,</hi> hath said, yea, and interceded for you as for the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, saying, Lord, giue to this poore blinde man that which he demandeth (who would haue thought then that thou wouldest haue prooued so darke in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods will?) But God grew angry at these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessions and said, I doe not vse to cast away my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vpon a proud man. If thou say, that thou art not proud, then thinke thy selfe to be depriued of light, and that hee who conceiteth himselfe to bee humble, doth notwithstanding appeare in full pride before God. But if thou say that thou art proud, I also will confesse the same, and there is no hurt done, if proud men be taught and lessoned to bee humble. If thou tell mee thou art humble, I must bee bold to say that it suteth not with truth: for he that is humble indeed taketh no notice of his owne vnderstanding or will, but suffereth himselfe to be guided as a blind-man by him that leads him, and verely beleeueth that the other feeth better then hee: and if thou be blinde, then can it not bee hurtfull, that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7439:96"/>
he who of himselfe is depriued of light, should goe and seeke it of him who hath the same. And I doe assure thee thou shalt plentifully finde it, if thou obey the will of thy Superiour, and acknowledge thy selfe to be subiect vnto him: that is to say, to the Reuerend Father <hi>Romil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon. Louyse</hi> prayeth you for the loue of God to begg of God fiue things for her which shee hath long desired, and that you would also lay hold vpon them for your selfe, that is, an vpright intention, a pure affection, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie of conscience, simplicity and humility, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with obedience and resignation of your selfe in all things that may concerne the glory of God, for the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of soules, and for our good in particular.</p>
                     <p>She further intreateth, that you would be pleased to pardon her, if she hath beene too presumptuous to take on her to teach you; for it is not her intention so to doe, but the vrgent necessitie of the matter is such, that shee hath beene hold to make thus much familiar vnto you, which shee prayeth you to take in good part. Shee should be very sorry, notwithstanding any pride that may be in her, but to take all your counsels and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions with due respect, and to humble her selfe to him whom she knoweth to be inuested with so great digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as is the calling of Priests: for she desireth nothing more then to honour them as Gods on earth, and as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitteth so high a dignitie.

                     <p>Speaking of God, he said, yes I adore thee, <hi>Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus te Christe.</hi> And when they came to these words, <hi>Redemisti, &amp;c.</hi> he cryed out, You, you, not me, for he is not my Redeemer, but a seuere and terrible Iudge. Then he made an exclamation, and said, O great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle! although in saying thus, what noueltie doe I speake? for it is no new thing that the Sonne of God should yeeld obedience vnto a <note n="d" place="margin">When it is said, that God obeyed the voice of <hi>Iosua,</hi> the meaning is, that he granted him that which was desired of him, that is, he stayed the course of the Sunne.</note> Preist.</p>

He is so skilfull and gallant a Taylor, that hee cutteth out garments with much dexterity, and wants nothing but whom he may set on worke. Hee is well experienced to cut out your worke, you Ecclesiasticall men may doe well to employ your selues vnder him, because you that are priestes ought rather to lead the life of Angels then of men, and are to bee instrusted with the counsels and Commandements of God.</p>
                     <p>Then he turned himselfe to the Layity, and said; No no, the Priests haue not the world at will as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue: they must be humble, chast, and poore, and must chastice and mortifie themselues sundry waies, which is a point full of difficulty vnto those that are deuoid of charity. Then he spake to the <note n="g" place="margin">A discourse vnto the Monkes and religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> Monkes, and said: You that liue in Cloisters, haue an eye vnto your estate, for it is not enough to bee mued vp in your walls, and then to liue at your ease, no, you must rise at midnight, you must be very studious; you must bee humble, you must be modest. You should be a glasse vnto secular persons, and harmelesse and vnblameable in your conuersations: yet doe you worldlings thinke that religious persons doe liue in idlenesse and ease. I tell you, that the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of one houre at mens studies is a greater toile then the trauels of a labouring man that sweateth at his worke a whole weeke.</p>
                     <p>The good conuersation of religious persons is of ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimable vse amongst Christians, therefore obey God and his Church, and ten thousand soules will be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after your example. Say not wee are young: if you had a licence or warrant from another world, I might then perchance aduise you to delay your amendment: but thinke of death, and consider how suddenly men are surprised by it. Death is a theese, and stealeth vpon men when they least looke for it. Happie are they that

In Paradise there are Kings, and there are poore people: for some of all estates and conditions are saued. Doe not mutter and say, wee are poore, wee haue not wherewithall to liue: God will haue regard vnto your pouerty, and will saue you: but the great ones cannot excuse themselues: you that are poore haue reason to reioyce, when you shall consider that God became poore for your sakes.</p>

                     <p>Reade well the booke of the Crucifix, and you shall there find all variety of knowledge: if thou doest ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, I am not able to reade this booke, I tell thee thou liest, for this booke may bee read by men and women: yea by people of the most grosse and muddy capacity that may bee: you may reade it in Churches, in your houses, in your beds, and in the fields, and all manner of vnderstanding is treasured vp in this booke, that may any way concerne the saluation of your soules. Looke on this booke and reade it well, for in it you shall find all sorts of vertues: humility, pouerty, patience, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and whatsoeuer else may make full a mans perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Rich and poore, and people of all conditions, looke in the glasse of the Crosse, and behold therein a God so great, so humble, and yet so full of Maiesty: you shall there see your God poore, &amp; will you then hate or detest pouerty? If pride suggest these haughty thoughts into you, thinke that your God tooke man vpon him to humble himselfe to the death of the Crosse. It is a greater miracle to see God dwelling in the flesh of man, then to behold the creation of one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand worlds. The Word equall vnto his father hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

                     <p>If a King should haue a slaue, and would redeeme him by giuing 10000. Crownes for his ransome: this were a great summe and an extraordinarie fauour; but if he should giue a Million of gold, his grace and loue would shew it selfe the more by how much the more the summe encreased. But this would appeare but a slender curtesie, if hauing but one only sonne he would giue him away to redeeme and purchase back this slaue vnto him: how infinitely would men maruell at the cortesie of such a King? But all this is nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of your God who hath but one only Sonne, yet gaue him vp for you that are sinners: this sonne (I say) that is equall to his father in power, in wisedome, and in goodnesse, that is, the blessed Word.</p>
                     <p>O great wonder! that the Sonne of God should thus suffer for such vngrateful creatures, who make so little profit of the same. If stones were capable of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, they would expresse some action of acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if leaues could bee furnished with the same, they would also declare their thankfulnesse: but you are the most vngratefull of creatures, and doe not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the loue and tender care that God hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer you, whose greatnesse is such, that if you had but the least knowledge or side-long glance thereof, you would creep with your belly vpon the earth, and would esteeme your selues vnworthy of that deiection. God is a glasse, and blessed is he that taketh Christ Iesus, and the mother of God for his glasse to looke on. It is true, that whilest shee liued in the earth shee was contemned and held to bee a woman of meane condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but know you not that Gods custome is to abase the proud? you that are poore would very faine liue in the desert of this world, but you want money to buy drugges or confections of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries:

this want may easily be endured. Come and vnderstand what may more neerely import you, how you ought to be deuout to the blessed mother of God. I tell you those that are deuout vnto her shall neuer die in mortall sinne. <hi>Mary</hi> is the sinners aduocate. There is a great inditement betweene God and the soule, the blessed mother of God makes the report, the Angels and Saints are the Aduocates. <hi>Mary</hi> is the poore sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners refuge, and thou <hi>Magdalene</hi> hast obtained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of thy sinnes.

And as the cheese doth still remaine the same cheese, so doth the creature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine still the same creature: but he that hath refashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the same is Omnipotent, vnto whom all things owe subiection, and whom the Diuels themselues obey when they are constrained to execute his pleasure. The creature may for a short space resist, but God hauing
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7439:99"/>
waited a long time, and growing now impatient to stay so long without doores, saith these words. No, no, I will enter in, I am master of this house, and am come to fashion this Image a new, whom the Diuell hath so deformed. I am the <note n="l" place="margin">Iesus the Painter, <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene</hi> the picture and Image.</note> Painter; shall not I mend this pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture when it seemeth good vnto me? Witnesse my Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, when my holy and sacred face was couered ouer with spittle, but it was to make my countenance shine the brighter: I am content that in this world you should be despised and defaced euen by the Diuels themselues, for all creatures are my pictures: I am the Painter, and haue made them all: but the Diuels my mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies doe often come by stealth and disfigure these por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traictures, and do deface them after such an outragious manner, that I my selfe doe tremble to behold them. But remembring that they were my handy-worke, I take the pencell of holy inspirations with the colours of my graces, and come to this picture and giue him the first draught by contrition, and another by confession, and after that by satisfaction. I am content that the lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen cloth should still remaine the same, that is, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and the soule of the creature. Now God, who hath all manner of liuely colours in his hands, knowes well to dispense these colours as seemeth best vnto him: gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing men the white of Humility, the red of Charity, the orange of Patience, the greene and yellow of Hope, that he may one day take comfort in this-his pourtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and that this excellent peece may come and giue him thankes in that he hath framed him and fashioned him anew, when the Diuell in his malice had razed and disfigured him.

thou shalt not direct thy speech to her, it is I that will grapple with thee. Come neere, and aske what thou wilt. To this he answered I aske nothing.

You know full wel, that you pray for your Kings and Princes, and doe you conceite, that there is lesse charity in Paradise? I say no: for standing before the presence of God, and God being Charity it selfe, it falles not within the compasse of doubt, that Saints pray for vs. But the other said, that for all this hee was not yet satisfied.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Verrine</hi> told him, Thou art proud, yea and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in thy nature, thou deseruest not to haue fruition of the light, for thou dost not endeauour to search forth the same. Then they fell vpon the point of the blessed Sacrament, and the Huguenot said, that it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7439:100"/>
to beleeue that his diuinity onely was there, and not his humanity. <hi>Verrine</hi> answered that he was really and truely there, both in Diuinitie and Humanity, and alledged diuerse reasons for the same, saying, that who so denyeth that, denyeth the first Article of his Creede, Thou dost acknowledge (said hee to the Huguenot) in thy Creede, that God is Omnipotent, and yet dost now crosse that, and denyest heere his Omnipotency: for if hee be Omnipotent, then is hee of powerfulnesse to performe the same; which he also doth for his body and diuinity are in the blessed Sacrament, whereunto hee added, that Gods word ioyned with his power could not but take effect, and that when God had affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a thing, it was impossible for him to lye.</p>
                     <p>Then said the other, And I affirme that wee receiue him not but by Faith. <hi>Verrine</hi> answered, This (by Faith) will lead you all to Hell, if you bee not humbled, and giue way, vnto the truth. The other said, And how is the body heere, when it is said, that he sitteth at the right hand of God? <hi>Verrine</hi> replyed. It is true, hee is so: yet doth he not say, I can be no where but at his right hand, he said, when he made the first institution of this blessed Sacrament; Take, this is my body and my bloud, it is not said, this is by faith, but it is said, This is my body: as often as you doe this, you shall doe it in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of my Passion. Then <hi>Verrine</hi> added. You de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue your selues, in that you thinke that the body of our Lord doth fill or take vp any place. No, no, it is not thus, for his body is a glorified body, and is adorned with all the qualities of a glorious body, yea I doe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther say, that he being more perfect then all, hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a body so blessed aboue all other, that hee occupy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no place, but is couered and shrouded in a litle <note n="o" place="margin">He meaneth the visible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, and speaks accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the phrase in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> bit of bread onely.</p>

It is true (said <hi>Leuiathan</hi>) and I am heere, on the behalfe of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer.</hi> Then <hi>Verrine</hi> said, that is the very reason that thou art not able to say what I say, but onely tellest lies, thou art in the body of <hi>Magdalene,</hi> that thou maist de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy soules, but I am heere to saue them.

                     <p>Then <hi>Verrine</hi> told him that hee lyed, and that it was

the Church of Darknesse, wherein no truth was to bee found: and because they tooke not the help of a candle to direct them to the habitation of truth, but stumbled along with a dimme and darksome Lanthorn, what wonder was it if they miscaryed from their way, and could not attaine vnto it. <hi>Leuiathan</hi> said, No, this is the true Church, which is beawtified with the fair appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the reformed Church. <hi>Verrine</hi> replyed, I tell thee it is the Gulfe of Hell, because the curious tread dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously on the brimme of that Gulfe, and are euer la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring and digging neere the brinke thereof, and not being able to finde that which they search after, they doe at length tumble in: and when the head falleth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this pit first, the rest of the members of that body doe easily follow after: witnesse <hi>Beza, Caluin</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi> who alledged and said, that they were Preists and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious persons, yet did they despise all Religion, and all Ecclesiasticall Discipline. And although darknes issued from thence where light should haue remained, yet for all that, (said <hi>Verrine</hi>) men ought not to take away Preist-hood, or to abolish the orders of Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there are some wicked Preists, and ill-disposed Religious persons. For prooofe whereof he alledged, that in the company of our Lord himselfe, there was a <hi>Iudas</hi>: yet who would bee so foolish to conclude that the rest must be as wicked as hee.

To this he said, I am not yet satisfied in this point, but tell mee, how prooue you there is a Purgatory? <hi>Verrine</hi> replyed, yes. I will prooue it easily vnto you: I affirme that God hath said, that no defiled thing shal enter into the kingdome of Heauen. To this the other answered, that he was not content with his replications, because the Deuill is the father of lies. <hi>Verrine</hi> said it is true, wee are the fathers

The Huguenot replyed, hold thy peace, thou art not able to answere, and art indeed but a block head. <hi>Verrine</hi> answered, it is not words will bring men to Heauen, there must be an addition of some thing else: faith &amp; good works are to be thought vpon by those that will goe to Paradise.

O accursed wretch, said <hi>Verrine,</hi> thou doest not deserue the least glimse of light: for when thou spakest this, thou diddest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue thou haddest spoken vnto a creature not vnto the Deuill: thou miserable loathed, and abhominable cay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe: thou art worse then the Deuill: yea, thou hast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly resolued to commit some notorious sinne: get thee gone thou wretch, get thee gone.

For they are things of that high nature, that who so vnderstandeth not the bottome and foundation of it, will hardly humble his iudgement vnto the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

Come then, and doe not wonder if, I do so often inculcate this word (come) vnto you, for I doe assure you that it is a

matter of importance. Letters speake but once, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had reason to make frequent repetition of this word. Come then with all the speed you may. I should conceaue my selfe guilty of a great offence if I had not disburthened and cleared my conscience by writing this letter vnto you. You may obiect vnto me, that I am too easie of beleefe, but come and you shall see, that I am not alone of this opinion: If I am deceiued, there are others in the same case, whose iudgements I must beleeue to be more able and more piercing then mine owne. I doe assure you, that if you had seene and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued these things, you would receiue great contentment thereby, and would rest very well satisfied. For God hath permitted, that a sister of the Company of S. <hi>Vrsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> most vnworthy though shee be, to bee bewitched, hauing three Diuels in her body. Her name is <hi>Louyse Capeau,</hi> who hauing from her youth begged of God to set her in some course of life wherein shee might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine to his greater glory for the saluation of her soule, and the profit &amp; good of her neighbour: and being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into that vocation wherein now she standeth, in the first yeere of her nouiciatship God began to instill into her, strong and vehement desires to endure, for her neighbours, all temporall paine whatsoeuer: yea to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe the torments of Hell it selfe, if it might bee done without her separation from God; and hauing persisted till this time in her request, especially when she was to receiue the blessed Sacrament, at length she had her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and did accept with great patience all the said paines and torments euer saying these words: Lord I thinke my selfe vnworthy to suffer any thing for the loue of you. Shee made all these requests without ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any mans aduice, because shee euer conceiued, that it was no way within the compasse of sin, so that when shee found her selfe possessed, shee was much abashed thereat, and wondred with her selfe from whence it might proceed.</p>

                        <pb n="157" facs="tcp:7439:103"/>But God, from whom this was not hidden, did saue vs a great deale of labour, by laying his charge vpon one of the Diuels that were in her body to answere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Exorcismes, and to deliuer the truth what the end was, wherefore he remained in her body. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Diuell after many adiurations which the Exorcists made vnto him, seemed obstinate in his si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and would giue no resolution vnto any thing that was propounded; yet being commanded on Gods behalfe, and by the authority which he hath giuen vnto his Church, and by the vertue and powerfulnesse of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orcismes, hee did in conclusion roare aloud, as though hee had been outragiously mad, with such high and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightfull cries, that he was heard a great way off; and so turning to <hi>Magdalene</hi> of Palud, hee said three seuerall times, it is true <hi>Magdalene,</hi> it is true, it is true, <hi>Louyse</hi> is possessed for thy sake, and for thee doth she suffer this affliction. O <hi>Magdalene, Louyse</hi> is thy pledge, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated these words three times: her body shall bee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted particularly for thy soule, and by a consequent for many others.

If thou thinkest thou shalt be hurt thereby, thanke thy selfe, I cannot doe withall. Doest thou not know what is commonly said? harme watch, harme catch, thereby meaning the torments which shee had and was to suffer, saying vnto her, that she was not to vex her selfe, if these afflictions did fall heauie vpon her: for, said he, why wouldest thou then aske them?

that agreed thereunto, that these things should bee brought to so vnexpected an issue. Our intendment is alwaies sinister and mischieuous, to cause all villanies to be set on foote and acted, and to procure iudgement to follow on the necke of them: wee haue been constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from God to pronounce and declare him innocent, whom wee suggested vnto <hi>Louyse</hi> to bee the author of her troubles; wee haue opened and disclosed the name of the Magician by the vertue of Exorcismes, and haue cried aloud that he is such an one. Notwithstanding all this declaration of mine, yet will your apprehension come short of these things whose life consisteth rather in their action then in their relation. Afterward, vpon the day of the conception of the blessed mother of God towards euening there were diuers discourses vttered, full of excellency and vse, which hee promised should continue till Christmasse. Hee did in particular labour the conuersion of <hi>Magdalene,</hi> and in her the conuersion of many others: so that those who heard it twice a day at the time of the two seuerall Exorcismes returned from thence with full satisfaction, the whole assembly being filled with the admiration of it: Whereupon I will ingeminate this word vnto you againe, come if you be wise, and herein make declaration of your wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: for true wisedome is to harken and be obedient vnto the will of God.

(I meane your vocation.) Come and bee not fearefull to combate with his enemies, for now occasion doth present it selfe, the enemy is discouered, and you are to fight no longer in corners: and God hauing regard vnto their patience that haue suffered so much for his sake, will in a full measure recompence the same. The Diuell had sworne very solemnly, that all Hell had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to abolish and root out the Christian doctrine and the Company of S. <hi>Vrsula,</hi> to their vtter ruine and perdition; if their power bad been of sufficiency to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe the same, God himselfe permitting this for his glory, as he did tolerate the like practise vpon <hi>Iob.</hi> And to assure vs the better hereof, hee hath suffered the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel to reueale it, who hath been enforced to affirme that God would doe now as hee did by <hi>Iob,</hi> worke good out of these tentations, which the Diuell projected for euill purposes. God is very cunning to draw good out of euill, and is like a skilfull Surgeon who when hee obserueth a man to abound with more blood then is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for his health, hee launceth him, and draweth that vnnecessarie superflux of blood from him, not thereby to kill him, but as the Surgeon taketh some blood from him that is sicke, the better to prepare him to be cured, and this is done to preserue him from many inconueniences and dangerous maladies which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise would grow vpon him: so doth God demeane himselfe towards vs hauing permitted that we all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exempting any one should be tossed in this tempest. For the Diuell himselfe did affirme, that hee had left none of vs vnattempted, but said aloud, <hi>Francis,</hi> be not angry, thou hast had thy share in these tentations as wel as others: and so hast thou <hi>Iames</hi> (speaking to Father <hi>Rets.</hi>) It is true <hi>Romillon,</hi> it is true, all thy people haue been tempted, but be of good cheere <hi>Romillon,</hi> for thou shalt regaine them all. <hi>Peter Barmond</hi> hath been temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted likewise but you will recover him, and most vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie shall he be if he doe resist it. And hee charged vs to

He would not sticke to say, cursed art thou <hi>Belzebub,</hi> and you <hi>Balberith, Leuiathan, Asmodee, Astaroth,</hi> and <hi>Carreau:</hi> yea hee out-dared <hi>Lucifer</hi> himselfe, telling him that it was fit Almighty God should bee obeyed, and not <hi>Lucifer</hi> or Hell, or the rest of the Diuels. Hee would oftentimes cry aloud, <hi>Belzebub</hi> thou art my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and I am a vassall of thine when I am employed from <hi>Lucifer,</hi> but now I haue my abode here by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God: hence it is that I speake so arrogant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before my Prince, and doe braue all Hell, saying to <hi>Belzebub, Belzebub</hi> I charge thee in the name of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God that thou lie all along vpon the ground; and so treading vpon him, <hi>Verrine</hi> vttered these words full of arrogancy and pride: where are thy Princes now <hi>Belzebub?</hi> and you that are there abiding, what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of you now (speaking to the Diuels) you are all of you Princes, at the least fiue of you: if you haue any command or authority, I charge you answere me, I giue you leaue to call <hi>Lucifer</hi> to your aide, now hee hath an excellent occasion to shew himselfe. How now <hi>Belze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub,</hi> wilt thou suffer thy slaue to tread thus disdainfully vpon thee? Then crying to all the assembly hee said: These are my Princes, but now I doe not acknowledge them to be so, but I do this by compulsion not by loue, by constraint, not by grace. <hi>Belzebub</hi> answered him not a word, but stood full of shame and confusion, and was able to resist no longer. <hi>Verrine</hi> then began to speake aloud to those that were there present (for there was

Then the Company came and trod vpon him, <hi>Belzebub</hi> not daring to reply against it, or to mutter one word, but remaining exceedingly dismayed. Many other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses were deliuered by him, the relation of which would take vp too much time; come you if you please, and you shall bee more particularly acquainted with him. Your most humble and most affectionate seruant <hi>Francis Billet</hi> Priest of the Christian doctrine, hath written this letter. Then hee signed it, as did also <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscus Domptius,</hi> and a good distance below it was written. I <hi>Magdalene</hi> of <hi>Demandoul</hi> doe testifie and confirme that all which is written in this letter is true, especially that which mentioneth my repose of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. I find my selfe much changed, blessed be God and his sacred mother; for I assure you shee hath much assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted me. Pray vnto God that hee will giue me perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and his grace, that I may be a thankfull acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledger of his manifold blessings which in such plenty he hath heaped vpon me.</p>

But is it not true, haue not I humbled thee? No said <hi>Leuiathan,</hi> thou hast not been any cause thereof; I tell thee it was the creature whom thou hast humbled. <hi>Verrine</hi> said, thou liest, it was not that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7439:106"/>
whatsoever hath been done, hath been done for thy confusion and her conversion. Wretched caitiffe as thou art, I am heere an Embassadour from the living God, and thou an agent from <hi>Lucifer</hi>; darest thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this said <hi>Verrine</hi> to <hi>Leuiathan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Not I, said <hi>Leuiathan</hi>: then <hi>Verrine</hi> said, I am an Ambassadour from God, who hath sent mee hither to put his will and not mine owne ends in execution. To this <hi>Leuiathan</hi> replyed, are there not other Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours? There are Angels, and there are Preachers, is it not so? It is true said <hi>Verrine,</hi> but thou art not ignorant that when a King would employ an Ambassadour, hee hath choice of Princes, great Lords, and Gentlemen; yet if his pleasure be to send some Lackey; why, he is a King, and may command and doe what seemeth good vnto him; for he may vse small things to effect matters of great waight and importance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Leuiathan</hi> answered, there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them. True (said <hi>Verrine</hi>) yet if the Kings of the earth be invested with this power, how abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more shall the King of glory possesse the same. It is true, there are Princes, there are Angels, and great Preachers: yet if his pleasure be to command his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest slave, who shall hinder him to doe it, since hee is Omnipotent? yet is he not a whit the lesse King, or the lesse great, this doth not diminish or bring an ebbe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his glory: nay it is so different from that, that it is a touch of his greatnesse to bee able to force our will, for of our selves we are all wicked, but God is able to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our rebellious nature into obedience, yea to make thee <hi>Leuiathan,</hi> and thee <hi>Lucifer</hi> to stoope and double vnder the yoke of subjection; for hee is above you all and can easily force obedience from you. <hi>Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athan</hi> said, What? dost thou looke to draw mens at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention vnto thee? thou art but a Divell.</p>
                     <p>True (said <hi>Verrine)</hi> I am but a Divell, but being by God compelled to deliver a truth, I cannot but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7439:106"/>
it. Knowest thou not, that hee raised <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead, and that his all powerfull word in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a <hi>fiat,</hi> framed whatsoever seemed good vnto him? Yes, (said <hi>Leuiathan</hi>) but <hi>Lazarus</hi> did not hinder or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist that miracle that was wrought vpon him, but these creatures here doe impeach and stoppe (as much as in them lieth) the execution of Gods pleasure. <hi>Verrine</hi> answered, He is omnipotent, and changeth evill into good, nay, hee is of more force to attract and expresse grace out of sinne, then hell is of malice, to draw sinne out of grace: for he is king of the whole earth, and when he commandeth whatsoever suteth with his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, I see he is obeyed; because he that doth command it, is a King. God were not himselfe, if he were not more powerfull then his creatures, nay I affirme, that then the Divell would be mightier then God, for he can worke evill out of good, and cannot God worke good out of evill? You see how bold I am. <hi>Leuiathan</hi> said: God doth indeed call <note n="y" place="margin">Against sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> men vnto him by many secret inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, by the teaching and instructions of learned men, by the threatning of his judgements, and by the Angels themselves, yet for all this they are so hardned in sinne, and so grosse of heart, that although they see themselves hemmed in on all sides, and cannot avoid to be converted vnto their God, yet in their arrogancy and flintinesse of heart, they will not sticke to say, Lord thou art willing to receive me, but I am not desirous to come vnto thee, for I have nought to doe with thee. I had rather be a pray vnto the divels, and have a full fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of all sorts of pleasure, then bee received of thee, and casheere them.</p>
                     <p>It is true, said <hi>Verrine,</hi> that thou hast spoken. There be sinners of that improvident obstinacie, that they will remaine determinately setled for many yeeres toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their wickednesse, so that God is incited to a kind of anger, and would be full of impatiencie at it, if such passions could take place in God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="164" facs="tcp:7439:107"/>But I affirme, that they cannot reside in God, for they would argue an imperfection in him: but if God were capable of impatiencie, or if he could bee grieved, I say, hee would weepe when hee beholdeth those obstinate soules. But God is not subject vnto griefe: for they who affirme that the sinnes of men doe strike a sadnesse into the holy Ghost, are not to be vnderstood as if the holy Ghost were indeed grieved, it is a sinne to thinke so, but that he doth dislike and abhorre these abominations; yet being an excellent painter, he is able, when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, to correct any deformitie in this his portraicture. Thou knowest <hi>Leuiathan</hi> that this is true, and that I am here by the appointment of God, but am tied and bound from revealing of sinnes. <hi>Leuiathan</hi> said, Thou lyest, for thou hast divulged them, and art now convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of a manifest vntruth. It is true, (said <hi>Verrine</hi>) but this is done for the good of these sinners, neither could the miracle be manifested, if the sinnes were not divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Then turning himselfe to Saint <hi>Magdalene,</hi> hee said these words: It is true <hi>Magdalene,</hi> thou wert a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, neither doth it redound vnto the dishonor of God, or lay any disreputation vpon thee that thou wert so, nor is there any diminution of thy happinesse because thou diddest formerly offend. That is true, said <hi>Leuia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> but there is a great difference betweene this and that <hi>Magdalen:</hi> she needed no Divels to convert her, but was reclaimed by her owne care and industry, and therefore it is not probable that God hath sent thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this body for the conversion of these two soules, since there be many other meanes to bring this to passe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thy helpe who art the father of lies, and whom no man will scarce beleeve. Hold thy peace (said <hi>Verrine</hi>) accursed spirit as thou art, and give me audience. It is true, I am in this body, God having suted and fitted his pleasure to the desire of this creature: I am here expresse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie from Almightie God, for his glory, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> for the conversion of these two soules, and miserable
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7439:107"/>
shall they bee if they bee not converted.</p>
                     <p>Thou tellest me, that Saint <hi>Magdalene</hi> was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by the Divell, it is true, but wee live not now in that time when God came downe from heaven, and with his Humanitie and Devinitie did labour the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of soules: but I say withall, that he is still the same God; and therefore is able to give birth vnto those works, whose greatnesse may equall the former.</p>
                     <p>It is a truth (said <hi>Leuiathan</hi>) that God is not in the world as in times past, yet hath he bequeathed vnto his Church his Sacraments, Preachers, and many other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies which were not practised in those daies. But none did euer reade that God made Divels his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to convert soules, since they are the fathers of lies, and stuffed with all kind of malice and falsehood. Who without great difficultie would give credite vnto them? there is no man but would be readie to object, that God hath many other meanes to gaine soules vnto him, without taking the service and furtherance of the Divels.</p>
                     <p>It may be so (said <hi>Verrine</hi>) but tell me <hi>Leuiathan,</hi> are there not oathes whereby a truth may be averred. <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiathan</hi> answered, Knowest thou not that we<note n="z" place="margin">Of these false oathes, see the acts of the 18. of December.</note> never sticke to take a false oath? I am sure thou knowest it; witnesse the oath that was lately taken amongst the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchins, you know my meaning. To this <hi>Verrine</hi> said, Either make it appeare vnto mee that there is no oath that may bind and stand in full strength, or else thou art vanquished. For I say, that an oath taken according to the meaning of God and his Church, with all other due ceremonies and circumstances requisit thereunto, doth bind and is in force, and whosoever will deny this, must deny the omnipotencie of God, all the authoritie of the Church, and all the bookes of Exorcismes.</p>
                     <p>To what purpose doe men exorcise, and make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatories vnto diuels, if their replies be never conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant vnto truth? It were an idlenesse to be prodigall of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7439:108"/>
so much time, and to wast so many yeeres, if this were so. It were much better that Exorcists should spend their time otherwise, and take vpon them some other course of study. To this <hi>Leuiathan</hi> answered, I have affirmed, that all oathes are not true, because of the sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and perverse meaning and reservations of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels. I confesse (said <hi>Verrine</hi>) all are not true, because when the Exorcists are not heedy and well advised of what they goe about, wee are so mischeevous that wee reserve some secret and sinister intention, but when we are enforced like gally-slaves by the power of God, I tel thee wee must obey his pleasure; and therefore <hi>Leuia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> thou art consounded. For I my selfe, not from my owne will, but vpon constraint from God, haue lesso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and warned the Exorcists to apprehend aright all the intentions and ceremonies whatsoever that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite in the making vp of a true oath.</p>
                     <p>Then said <hi>Leuiathan,</hi> How darest thou speake thus in my presence, knowest thou not that I am mightier then thy selfe. I grant it, (said <hi>Verrine</hi>) thou art mightier then I to do a mischiefe, for thou hast more knowledge to doe it, thou being of the order of Seraphins, and I onely of the order of Throanes. I am one of your slaves, but let me tell you I doe not now respect any of you, (meaning the princes that were in the body of <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> every one of whom hee braved one after another.) What? (said he) answere you nothing? Are you such gallant doctors, and can you make no reply? Ha, you would answere now if you knew what. Come on, speake, speake.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">The answere vnto this blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie is set downe in the following dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</note> 
                        <hi>Leuiathan</hi> replied, knowest thou not that when sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are obstinate, they are vncapable of conversion: nay, God himselfe is not able to winne them vnto him; witnesse <hi>Iudas,</hi> whom our Lord could not convert. How canst thou then conceive, that a Divel should bring this to passe, when God himselfe by the practise of all his art and cunning cannot accomplish the same. <hi>Verrine</hi> said,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7439:108"/>
I have affirmed that God is omnipotent, and may make an alteration in the free will of man, and change it from evill to good. Knowest thou not that God is a cunning Painter, who can fashion and make vp a picture when it seemeth good vnto him, and is contented, if they doe but leave him the table to worke vpon. It is true (said <hi>Leuiathan</hi>) if the creature doe not hinder it; for God hath created man without his aide, but cannot save him vnlesse he co-operate and give assistance vnto it. <hi>Verrine</hi> answered, If the body and soule doe remaine together, it is all that God desireth, who well knowes when to take his pencels to correct and perfect vp this table. I affirme further, that if he will he is able to make it more beautifull and more goodly then ever it was before, which he may easily doe by laying on colours of more freshnesse and luster. Knowest thou not that hee is the father of the prodigall child? If the fathers of this world be thus loving towards their children, and doe cherish them, and yet doe sometimes threaten them, not to hurt them thereby but to make them wiser and better advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: how much more shall hee shake the rodde of his iudgements over them to preserve them from the hands of Iustice.</p>
                     <p>And when the child of God shall acknowledge his fault, then shall he returne vnto his father, and humble himselfe before him; for as the prodigall child did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his patrimony to be giuen vnto him, which when he had gotten from his father into his owne hands, hee wasted all in riot, and was at length driven to such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie, and extreame penurie, that he was forced to feed with hogges: so fareth it with sinners, God heapeth on them such plentie of his blessings, that they are even glutted with the multitude of them: yet when they have consumed all in the heighth of prodigalitie, this grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous father embraceth them, and taketh them vnto him, if they will not adde wilfulnesse vnto their wast. For if worldly fathers are so loving, shall not God who hath
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7439:109"/>
created them, bee much more gracious and good then they? I grant (said <hi>Leuiathan</hi>) that there are many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall children, but very few propose that first prodigall child for their imitation, that like vnto him they may returne to God. For when they have trifled and melted away all their goods, and have fashioned themselves to take the impression of all manner of impieties, yet doe they remaine in their obstinacie, and are still nailed fast to whatsoever savoureth of malice and mischiefe: and notwithstanding that God calleth vpon them by many inspirations, yet are they resolved to reply vnto these his holy motions; We will take our fill of all worldlie pleasures, whatsoever it cost vs. It is true, said <hi>Verrine,</hi> but yet when God will, he can worke good out of evill, for otherwise he could not be Omnipotent. It is no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie or imperfection that he is not able to sinne or lie; it is rather an argument of his Omnipotencie, and of his transcendent perfection. We are both of vs Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants, and doe both execute our commission, though after a different manner: for thou doest here fulfill the will of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> but I doe accomplish the good pleasure of the Almightie. Thou maiest thinke that I doe brave thee; I tell thee still that wee are Sargeants sent, as it were, from two severall parties, and doe the wil of them that sent vs: and although we doe not both execute the same co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, yet are we stil Sargeants. So if two preach, and both think they deliver truth: as for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the Church, and a Minister, although the action of preaching be commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto them both, yet doth it not proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the same spirit, because the Preacher of the Church vttereth the truth, but the Minister hath his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding perverted by errors, and doth interpret di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers passages of the Scripture according to the giddines of his privatfancy, and is so self-conceited (for they have al of them a touch of curiosity) that he doth imagine he is able to bound in the Omnipotencie of the Father, the wisdome of the Son, and the goodnes of the holy Ghost
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7439:109"/>
within the narrow limmets of his owne vnderstanding. But such come far short, and have their braine too much scantled, to comprehend God &amp; his infinite perfections. God is wise, for he is Wisdome it self, &amp; needeth not the advise either of Angels or men, much lesse of divels. I tel thee <hi>Leuiathan,</hi> that I am but the bare reporter of these things, and to effect this I doe thus trouble her that is possessed: for except God did put in vse his authoritie and force which he hath over Divels, he were not God. I am of opinion, that those who will not humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, might doe well to assault God, and take his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie from him, and translate <hi>Lucifer</hi> from hell to seat him in Paradise. It is a grosse errour to conceive that God is not more able to convert evill into good, then the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell is to change good into evill. I affirme that God is omnipotent, and therfore may do al things, and when he pleaseth to put his power in practise, he can force the Divel as a Gally-slave, &amp; as like vnto a Iudge, can make the malefactor to tremble before him, and can compell him to accomplish his will when it seemeth good vnto him. They that do not beleeve this, are accursed, &amp; want the first article of their Creede, which faith, that God is almighty. I submit my selfe to these things, because God himself obeyed his Executioners when they nailed him to the crosse. The Saints, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>they were lead to the place of their Martyrdome, obeyed the will of their executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, and yet thereby they did not intend any glory ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the hangman, or to the Divell, no more then did our Lord, vnto whom the vertue of obedience is most pleasing and acceptable: whereof I will now speake.</p>
                     <p>I resisted as much as I could, and said vnto our Lord, no, I will not deliver this truth: hee told me, thou shalt be inforced thereunto. I answered, No, no, they have bookes enough that doe plentifully declare this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but hee constrained me so that I must now begin with the vertue of obedience. Then <hi>Verrine</hi> began to say. What say you now to this point, learned Doctor
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7439:110"/>
(speaking to <hi>Leuiathan:</hi>) Thou art the Doctor of the <note n="b" place="margin">The places and offices of divels are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct.</note> Hereticks, come and deliver your opinion. And thou <hi>Belzebub,</hi> thou art that proud one, and doest fill men with curiositie, and cocker them vp in their arrogancie: And thou <hi>Balbarith,</hi> thou art hee that saiest, <hi>Hee that loveth God, will have him often in his mouth,</hi> and by this meanes makest me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to fort weare God: And thou <hi>Asmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,</hi> thou art he who doest corrupt youth with thy loose speeches, and lascivious lookes: And thou <hi>Astaroth,</hi> thou art he who assaultest men with idlenesse, especially you that are Religious persons: and thou <hi>Carrean,</hi> thou hardnest mens hearts, and thinkest to gaine all before thee: knowest thou not that with one poore word, with a <hi>Fiat,</hi> he can doe whatsoever seemeth good vnto him? doest thou not know that he is able to raise the dead? I tell thee it is very easie for him to doe it; witnesse the daughter of the chiefe Ruler of the Synagogue, when he tooke her by the hand and bad her rise; which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth vnto vs, that a sinne committed in thought, and only knowne vnto God and onely hurtfull vnto the soule alone of him that doth commit the same, is easilie pardoned.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Three sorts of dead men.</note> There are three sorts of dead men, as there are three sorts of sinnes: For there is the child of <hi>Naym</hi> the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, whom they carried out to be buried: thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating vnto vs, that there are some who are dead in vaine speaches, and they are carried out of the citie, that is: they flow from the soule into the mouth, and are there vttered, and the offence thereof commonly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the scandall of their neighbours. This is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented vnto vs by that young man, whom our Lord commanded to rise, and gaue him to his mother. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee gaue signification vnto sinners, that when they have offended, they are to be presented vnto their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is the Church, as God commanded to bee done by the young man, as you well know. There are others that are dead in works, who are, for the most
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7439:110"/>
part, those that dwell in their sinnes, and remaine obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in them 20. 30. 40. 50. yeeres, represented by <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> who had a stone laid over his graue. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why God commandeth to vnbind him is, that hee might declare how much authoritie hee hath bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed vnto his Church, and how much Priests ought to be had in honour and estimation; in reproofe of those who say they will not confesse themselves, obiecting, why should I humble my selfe before a Priest? is he not a man, nay, is hee not a sinner as well as I? why then should I declare my sinnes before a Priest? God is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and will pardon me without confession. Then <hi>Verrine</hi> began to speake of obedience in this manner. <note n="d" place="margin">Touching Obedience.</note> Obedience of all vertues is the most pleasing vnto God. Charitie is a great vertue, because without it there is no entrance into Paradise. Faith is also a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie vertue, for without faith it is impossible to please God. Hope also holdeth the same ranke, because it is our guide to heaven. Humilitie also is the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke of all vertues. To bee briefe, all morall vertues are profitable, good and praise-worthie: for I doe not affirme that a man may attaine vnto heaven without Humilitie, and without Charitie and other vertues; but I averre, that hee who stands possessed of obedience, is garnished with all other vertues whatsoever. Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is the most excellent of all vertues, I meane perfect Obedience, for he that is perfectly obedient, is humble and charitable, he is confident, and persevereth vnto the end: nay, I say further, he that is truely obedient can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not die, I meane an eternall death. For some may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto me, that <hi>Isaac</hi> was very obedient vnto his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet did he finish the course which nature had proportioned for him, and died. I say no, for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that those that are blessed from above doe not dye, but saith they sleepe as it is true. <hi>Isaac,</hi> thou sleepest, and shalt bee awakened at the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If thou have the integritie of Obedience, there
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7439:111"/>
will be no opposition against thee: consider this well you that are Religious persons, and haue vndertaken the vow of Obedience. Remember that your God was obedient euen vnto the death, I say vnto the death of the Crosse: he did not murmure against his Father, and say, Father this Mountaine is too steepe and vneasie to come vnto (meaning Mount <hi>Caluary</hi>) no, hee said not so. He did not speake vnto his Father that he should so prouide that he might suffer death in a Chamber or in a Hall, because this mountaine was so loathsome, and so full of displeasing obiects that it seemeth a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of noysome sauours. No, no, with a full desire and free acceptation hee embraced death for the loue which he bare vnto you.</p>
                     <p>You that are religious persons learne to obey your Superiours when they impose any thing vpon you, and say not my Superiour commandeth mee things of such vneasie performance, yea, almost so impossible to bee done that I know not how to turne mee vnto them. A religious person will not stick to say: Ha, my Superiour commandeth mee to declare my fault openly before people: this will edifie my neighbour but a litle. Let his Superiour command him to goe to Rome, and hee shall say, I know not the way thither: let him inioyne him to fast, and hee will say, Ha, my father, I am of so tender a constitution that if this pennance bee imposed vpon me, I shall be sick: how harsh and vnpleasing is it to be put to weare shirts of hayre. My Superiour is so froward that he is not to be endured. If the Superiour shall say vnto him, thou shalt vndertake to murther one of thy brethren, and the other not knowing the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Superiour, who speaketh this from his mouth not from his heart, onely to prooue him, will gaine-say him, he is not obedient, and therefore not humble: for obedience is the daughter of humilitie, and hee that is truely humble is alwayes obedient.</p>
                     <p>Learne you that are Monkes and Fryars, and read in
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7439:111"/>
this excellent booke, that is to say, vpon the tree of the Crosse: It is your God who hath obserued his three vowes carefully, and as he ought: the vow of Chastity, for hee is puritie it selfe, and surpasseth all the Angels and creatures whatsoeuer as one that is immaculate and without blemish.</p>
                     <p>Touching the vow of Pouertie, he hung naked vpon the Crosse. He might haue beene accompanied with his traine of Princes (which are the Angels) hee might haue had garments to couer him, and whatsoeuer else was needfull, yet hee despised all, to demonstrate vnto you that are Religious, that you ought to surrender your purse and treasure vnto him, and suffer your Father to prouide for that which is necessary for his children.</p>
                     <p>Touching the vow of Obedience, he hath been more obedient then euer any was, I speake this to you Preists and Monkes: behold your selues well in this glasse, and read ouer this booke aduisedly, it consisteth but of two leaues, and yet containeth all perfection: there are but two words within this Booke, Obedience and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, yet if a man be rightly informed how to draw out the quintessence of this Booke, he shall there finde all sorts of vertue that may any way further or yeeld con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement, to the attaining of so high and sublime a perfection. To what end doe you exhaust your selues with studying, and doe so painefully imploy your selues in reading of bookes? Be but conuersant in this booke and you shall be able to performe the will of God.</p>
                     <p>If a seruant obey his Master, how much more ought a childe so to doe? Wee that are Deuils are as ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants or rather slaues, and doe nothing but constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly and by compulsion: but you that hope for an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage in Heauen, are bound to loue and serue him. I further say, that God hath three sorts of seruants: There are that serue him onely by constraint, and those are such as onely feare Hell, and if that stumbling block were away, they would not care to drench themselues
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7439:112"/>
in the puddell and pollution of any sinnes whatsoeuer. Others serue like hirelings, as doe those whose scope and aime is the attainement of Heauen, saying, God hath promised vnto vs <hi>Paradisus</hi> therefore we shall doe well to obey him. But there are a third sort more adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, who doe not make either Paradise or Hell their scope, but doe the wil of their father purely out of loue, and haue not their end mixed with any secondary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of recompence: they set their confidence in God with their whole heart, and beleeue his prouidence in preparing for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whatsoeuer is necessary: for (say they) if his care descend to birds and beasts, how much more will this his care extend to vs? God heerein behaueth himselfe like a Marchant who separat's farthings from sous, crownes from peeces of fower, setting euery sort a part by it selfe against the time he shall haue imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for them, yet doth he not contemne his other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. So fareth it with God, hee taketh Religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and those whom hee hath marked foorth for his seruice, and putteth them to his vse and imployment, that they may performe some seruice of importance for his glory: yet doth he not despise the lay-men, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth them all if they walke in his commandements, as doth the Marchant all the rest of his money. Those that are refractary would haue their Superiour to bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient vnto them and not they vnto him: this is not well. No, they must be obedient beyond others, for know you not that they are tempted by the Deuill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond others? If a great Prince or a great Lord offer to appropriate himselfe to the seruice of God, presently doe wee oppose and affront this his godly designement, we tempt him and say, Sir you leaue at ease in your own house, you haue thus many Pages, and thus many Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that waite vpon you, besides many groomes and Lackies: you are able to liue plentifully and neuer trouble your selfe: besides you are of a great house: Sir, doe not slaue your selfe when you may liue in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7439:112"/>
You shall haue a Superiour of base parentage, will you euer endure to obey him? You must beare the scrip vp &amp; downe the towne: you must weare a shirt of haire, and must discipline your selfe. Ha Sir, this is too great a burthen, you will neuer be able ro hold on this course: diuert this resolution, beleeue mee (saith the World) and they are not a few that beleeue and follow these perswasions. The childe in reason ought rather to obey his Father then the slaue his Master. The Master and Mistresse, when they haue disobedient and stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne seruants, doe presently pay them their wages, and say vnto them, you are not for our turne, you are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part and goe forth of our doores: so should a Superiour demeane himselfe to his inferiours when he seeth them inclined to contumacy and rebellion, Get you gone, goe foorth of doores, for you are not to be heere to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low your owne fancy, those that behaue themselues vnduetifully are not to abide heere. But they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect that it is lawfull to propound vnto the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Superiour some kinde of commands whose lawfulnesse may be questionable, and say, Father, in my opinion such a thing may be better done this way. No, beware of replications, for such a one ought to submit himselfe and thinke that his iudgement may easily goe awry. I grant, that in some cases hee may modestly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend his Superiour, but alwaies in great charitie, not by way of reprehension but by way of aduise, saying. Father, it seemeth vnto mee that you haue done such a thing, or haue vttered such a speach, which in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion might better haue beene done or spoken after this manner. But this is to be done in great humilitie and feare, as if he were to speake before God. Because Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours are Gods on earth, and those that yeeld vnto them obedience cannot doe amisse, prouided alwayes, that the thing which is commanded bee not <note n="e" place="margin">In what case the Superiour is not to bee obeyed.</note> against God or the Rules of his order or against himselfe: for in this case he is not tyed vnto obedience. Nay, I say fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7439:113"/>
he is bound to slight him, to oppose him, and to reprehend him if hee should command any thing that might directly derogate from God or the good of his neighbour, that is to say, he is to speake home vnto his Superiour, to open his fault and lay it before him if the fault be publick, as if he should command any one to preach heresies, or to doe something contrary vnto his Vowes, I affirme that in this case it is lawfull for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to reprehend his Superiour.</p>
                     <p>In the euening, <hi>Louyse</hi> and <hi>Magdalene</hi> were exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised by Father <hi>Francis,</hi> and the Priest who exorcised them recited many appellations of God.</p>

                     <p>If thou saiest, that then by a consequent they must deny thy power, the authority of thy Church, and the vertue of Exorcismes, I answere, that they doe already deny the communion of Saints and the Sacraments.

                     <p>Confession followeth contrition, and before Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion euery one ought to examine himselfe, and say, O my God! what am I, that I should receiue such mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold blessings at thy hands?

I tell you, you are not with such curiosity to pry into the meanes. Beleeue simply that hee is a glorified body, and taketh vp no place, and therefore may easily lie hidden vnder the <hi>species</hi> of bread.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="183" facs="tcp:7439:116"/>Hauing spoken thus, hee said vnto the Priests that were there present: You that are Priests, how could you dare to touch your God, if hee were there visibly and not vnder the forme of bread? I tell you, you could not be so hardy as once to approch vnto so great a light: for his sacred mother on the day of his natiuity, dared not as it were to touch his hands, although she had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him nine moncths in her wombe. Know ye not that <hi>Moses</hi> when hee came downe from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and had spoken with God, was faine to couer his face with a vaile; for otherwise the people could not endure to speake with him, so brightsome was the light that beamed and proceeded from his face? Then he sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly turned to <hi>Leuiathan,</hi> one of the Diuels in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Magdalene,</hi> and said, Hola! you that are such an illuminate doctor, what is it you now say? pleade now thine owne cause (O Doctor) in a close corner of Hell, as heereafter I my selfe may chance to doe, but now I am a partisan with the Doctor of doctors, who is also wisedome it selfe. Then againe hee turned his speech and said, Beware, beware<note n="r" place="margin">Of the holy Communion.</note> you that approch vnto the holy Communion, how you receiue God in your harts, whom the heauen of heauens cannot containe. If the King of France (O man) were desirous to come to thy house, wouldest not thou presently say, Ha, sir, my house is too little to giue entertainment or harbourage vnto your Maiesty; I beseech you sir, spare your paines to visit my poore cottage, and haue respect vnto my wants and pouerty. To this some or other will answere, It is the Kings pleasure to haue it so, hee is wealthy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and will cause whatsoeuer is necessarie to bee conueyed vnto thy house, for hee hath his Pages, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and traine, that will take care of these things; he hath no need to borrow thy goods, or any thing else that belongeth vnto thee, it shall suffice that thou lend him thy house; and because where the King is, there is the Court also, by a consequent the King honouring
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7439:117"/>
thy house with his presence, it shall put on the nature and appellation of a Palace. So doth God when hee commeth to thy soule, if thou doe but bequeath vnto him the habitation of thy will, he will hang the roomes thereof with the rich Tapistrie of all sorts of vertues. The holy Communion is the table of the King of glory, yet do you carelesly venture vpon the same, as if it were the common boord of an Inne, or as if it were a may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>game, and place to dance in. The Pages and seruitours of this table are the Angels, yet not regarding all this, you giue a thousand occasions of scandall in the Church, to wit, by thoughts, words, and other misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours which I will not speake of, yea you there act diuers villanies and vncleannesses, where of the Turkes would blush to be found guilty. Aske therefore those sweet fruits, the seven guifts of the holy Ghost, and so shall God water you with the dew of his grace in this world, and cloth you with eternall glory in the world to come. How easily would you loath all the pleasures of the world, if you had relished your mouthes neuer so little with the delicacies of your God. You that are poore are many times riotous, and spend in an howre all that you haue gotten in a whole weeke for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of your families.

                     <p>The least blessing that God bestoweth vpon a man is of more worth, then if a mighty King would make a free donation vnto him of all his dominions. And what thinke yee?

                     <p>After this, <hi>Verrine</hi> by a most solemne oath confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all which is aboue rehearsed, and in honour of the fiue wounds he said fiue seuerall times, <hi>Adoramus te Christe,</hi> &amp;c. and towards the end saying this word, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demisti,</hi> he subioyned <hi>Redemisti,</hi> that is, you, and not vs Diuels, who are in hell.

                     <p>This day in the morning the Dominican father did exorcise; and assoone as the Exorcismes began, one of the Diuels which was in <hi>Louyse</hi> asked him say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, In the name of God, why dost thou exorcise mee? who gaue thee authority to doe it? the Exorcist answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, God and his Church.

To this <hi>Verrine</hi> said, Beleeue it not, for we are all the fathers of lies. True (said the Exorcist) you are the fathers of lies when you speake from your selues and that which is your owne; but when you are constrained by Almighty God, I affirme that then you may speake truth. <hi>Verrine</hi> replyed vnto him. Tell me if there bee any power or authority in the bookes of Exorcismes to force vs to take a true and a binding oath, answere mee now to this? It is true, that we may take a true oath? as for example, when you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogate vs in the name of God Almighty, and by the authority of the Church, tell me if in that case God hath giuen that power vnto you, to force vs to take an oath that bindeth, to wit, according to the purpose of God, and the meaning of the Church. It is a truth (answered the Exorcist) that God hath bestowed this power vpon his Church, and vs. <hi>Verrine</hi> replyed; I spake this in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of those that auerre, that Diuels cannot speake truth: I tell you that such doe in effect deuise the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie of God; and therefore they may saue a labour in saying their Creed: and if they doe say it, it is after the Hereticks cut, that say their <hi>Credo</hi> without a <hi>Credo</hi>; for they say it with their mouth, and deny it in their heart. I therefore auow, that since God is omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,

he may easily constraine the Diuell to execute his will.</p>

Thou art faine to say this (said <hi>Verrine</hi>) because thou hast not wherewith all to oppose or thwart that, which on Gods behalfe I haue deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. <hi>Leuiathan</hi> answered: God doth not vse to send diuels abroad to preach.

                     <p>Then said <hi>Leuiathan,</hi> If I did see here any one whom I might call mine, (meaning Heretickes) I would not make daintie to speake.

thee who art but as it were a lackey. It is true (said <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>) I am but as thy lackey, yet mightest thou answere if thou hast any courage residing in thee. But thou art a very illiterate doctor, and those that follow thee, must needs stumble in the darke, so full of obscurenesse and falsehood is all thy doctrine. Darest thou sweare that thy doctrine is consonant vnto truth, as I wil sweare that whatsoeuer I haue here deliuered, proceedeth from the liuing God? <hi>Leuiathan</hi> answered, Yes, I affirme, that it is all true. <hi>Verrine</hi> replied, Accursed spirit, darest thou sweare as I will? Yes, that will I, said <hi>Leuiathan. Verrine</hi> answered him, thou canst not without reseruing some priuate and malitious meaning. <hi>Leuiathan</hi> then said. Well, let vs breake off this discourse. To which <hi>Verrine</hi> answered: If thou mightest be let alone, I doe easily conceiue thy inclination to sweare falsely; and the reason is cleare, for thy doctrine is false, and if thou <note n="a" place="margin">God is neuer a witnesse vnto falsehood.</note> shouldest take thine oath, thou wouldest sweare false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and not according to the intention of God and his Church, Not so (said <hi>Leuiathan</hi>) I tell thee I wil sweare according to the meaning of the Church. Wilt thou sweare according to the meaning of the Catholicke, Apostolicke and Romane Church, said <hi>Verrine? Leuia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> replied: What neede all these cautions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictions. They doe declare (said <hi>Verrine</hi>) that thou are vanquished: for thy intendment was to haue sworne according to the Church that is called the Reformed Church; and is the Church of <hi>Caluin, Beza, Luther, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and the like Heretikes. You may doe well (said <hi>Leuiathan</hi>) to beleeue this babler, you may perhaps find him to be a great Prophet. <hi>Verrine</hi> said: It is true, I am of my selfe a<note n="b" place="margin">
                           <hi>Verrine</hi> in all his discourses confessed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to bee a Diuell.</note> miserable Diuell, as thou art, but after much resistance, and long disputation against God, I was at last constrained to speake the truth: for God is the Prophet of Prophets, and hee it was, that made <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laams</hi> Asse to speake. <hi>Leuiathan</hi> answered: What? doth God interchange commerce of language and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7439:119"/>
with a Diuell? Yes, that he doth (said <hi>Verrine</hi>) but by a secret kind<note n="c" place="margin">Obserue, that it is by intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.</note> of intelligence, and we resist (as much as is possible for vs) his commandments, yet at length we are of necessitie tied vnto obedience. Then answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Leuiathan:</hi> For mine owne part, I frequent no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, but the societie of braue and worthie fellowes. Accursed spirit as thou art (replied <hi>Verrine</hi>) knowest thou not that when God doth worke, hee worketh not for the bodies sake, but from his regard vnto the soule? I tell thee, the soule of a pesant that is endowed with the grace of God, is as pretious before his Creator, as is the soule of a great King or Monarch. It cannot bee denied but they are poore, yet God is able to inrich them, and to store vp much grace within them. Speake now <hi>Leuiathan,</hi> It may be thou shalt gaine some one or other vnto <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and shalt not loose all thy labour. <hi>Leuiathan</hi> answered, Ha <hi>Verrine,</hi> thou knowest well, that I gaine more vpon great personages, then vpon pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly and base people. It cannot bee gaine said (quoth <hi>Verrine</hi>) but that a man of note and qualitie is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred to cleere himselfe of euill, and to applie all his actions vnto good, then is a poorer man: yet may an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest plaine Countrie man be a cause of much good; as a clowne of a wicked disposition may bee apt enough to practise a great deale of mischiefe. Poore and rich are indifferently equally in Paradise, for there is no distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in that place betweene them. And least any one should mis-understand mee, and conceiue that there is an errour in my words, I do explane my selfe; I do not say, that there shall be no diuersitie amongst them in the seuerall degrees of glory, for who so in this world is stored with most grace, shall in that other world attaine vnto a great portion of glory: as appeareth in <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene,</hi> who hauing loued much, had much sinne remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto her; and therefore she is the second person af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the<note n="d" place="margin">There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant hereunto why this should not be so.</note> mother of God, and so is it also decreed and ordered by the Church in the Letany.

thou art my mortall enemie, and art now dwelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Thrones, and holdest that place, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly did appertaine vnto me: I say not that thou art there as an Angell, but as a Saint blessed for euermore: for as there fell Angels of euery Order some, so God to fill up the seates that were void by the downefall of Angels, hath placed the soules in them, diuiding vnto euery one that place of glory which he iudged they had deserued. Then said <hi>Leuiathan,</hi> What haue I to doe with this preacher? <hi>Verrine</hi> answered, I came not to preach, and those who vnderstand me, cannot say that they haue heard a<note n="f" place="margin">

                     <p>Then <hi>Verrine</hi> spake to the Exorcist, and said: Why doest thou not command <hi>Leuiathan</hi> to speake. Vpon this the Exorcist said, <hi>Leuiathan,</hi> why speakest thou not. <hi>Verrine</hi> answered, because hee hath nothing to replie. Then said <hi>Leuiathan,</hi> I doe warrant it vnto you, that my doctrine is the truth, &amp; not the doctrine of the Church of Rome. True, said <hi>Verrine,</hi> according to thy perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and cursed intention. I tell thee, that although the Bishop of Rome should leade an vngodly and a vitious life, (which yet I affirme not, for I touch vpon no man in particular) but suppose that it were so, yet should not the authoritie and the power that God hath delegated vnto his Church be hereby diminished or impaired: for the power is alwaies the same, as in the Church the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is alwaies the same be the Priest good, or be he bad that doth sacrifice: for the Priest deriueth his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from God, not God from the Priest.</p>
                     <p>Then he cried, <hi>hola Lucifer,</hi> come hither, for I will dispute with thee of the Masse, of Purgatorie, and of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation of Saines: my doctrine issueth from a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine which is neuer dried vp, to wit, Iesus Christ, who is the light of the world, as saith <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangelist.</p>

                        <hi>Leuiathan,</hi> among the supreame Seraphins, thou wert the third after <hi>Lucifer:</hi> What sayest thou now learned doctor? Darest thou affirme, that in the Sacrament of the Eucharist Christ Iesus is not really and truly there. I my selfe am able to tell thee, O doctor without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that God being Omnipotent, may make his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die descend vpon an hundred thousand seuerall Altars. Doest thou vse thus to baite mens soules with thy faire speeches, steeped in all alluring sweetnesse?</p>
                     <p>And<note n="g" place="margin">The distinct offices which Diuels haue in tentations.</note> thou <hi>Balbarith,</hi> who doest make the Gentrie to beleeue that it is a peece of vallour to sweare and blaspheme the name of God without intermission, speake if thou wilt.

Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this <hi>Verrine</hi> turned him to the assembly and said: Looke you obserue the commandements of God, and of his Church, which is not subiect vnto errour: for Christ Iesus her Spouse is euer with her, and guideth her by that cleere light which euer streameth from him. Bee attentiue vnto Sunday and Holi-day Masses, for those that obserue them not, hauing no maine or cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall impediment to hinder them, doe sinne mortally. The Church is more solicitous to instruct you then a naturall mother can be ready to succour her child that is in danger. There are who goe to heare Masse as a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring man goeth to his worke without preparation, or as if a man would goe to Plaies or Reuels. Consider, consider these things that are so full of admiration; I <hi>Verrine,</hi> as I am a Diuel, would rather chuse to suffer the paines of hell 20. 30. 40. 50. yeeres, then to tell you one word sutable vnto what I now speake: and if this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture here were of force and strength sufficient, I would crie so loud in her, that men should heare mee halfe a
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:7439:121"/>
league off. Conceiue of me as of one that is nothing else but a fire-brand in hell, not worthie to be burned in that fire: and in these contemplations thinke of your selues, and the paines of that other world, as a malefactor would doe that waiteth hourely for the sentence of his death. I tell you that this expectation is many times more grieuous then the torment it selfe, and doth oft preuent punishment by hastening on of death.</p>
                     <p>Say vnto your soule, Soule remember thy worth, and consider how God hath created thee capable of eternal blisse. How expedient then is it, that thou walke in the commandements of thy God, and that the Bride should be obseruant of her Spouse? Al that thou canst performe is not able to ballance the least of his mercies; yea, hee should shew compassion towards thee, in punishing thee with the tortures of hell.</p>
                     <p>You that goe to Church to heare Masse, are to say, Soule whether goest thou? Thou goest to receiue either thy saluation or damnation. I doe not say (said <hi>Verrine</hi>) that sinners offend God afresh in going to heare Masse, but I affirme that they are like vnto those, who when a shower of raine falleth, stop all the spouts and conduit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipes of their cisterne, for feare left the water should be conueied into it. If those are not watered with the dew of Gods grace, the Priest is no cause thereof but they themselues, whose heart is fashioned out of stone, not composed of earth which is apt to bring foorth fruit.</p>
                     <p>Say further: Soule, let vs goe and craue pardon of God: for being a wretched malefactor, and worthie of condemnation, it is reason the soule should prostrate it selfe and implore his mercie. Yet fareth it not with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners as with malefactors, who appeale vnto the Court and Counsell of the King at Paris, for oftentimes, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding their delaies and paines, they loose their life, and the first sentence of death is ratified against them. But your God doth inuite you vnto him, saying:

Come vnto me and I will refresh you: aske and I will giue you. Notwithstanding, the requests which you present vnto me, must be of vertues and of spiritual bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings which concerne the saluation of your soules, not of earthly goods, or of riches, or of knowledge, or of any curiositie whatsoeuer. Search after the light of your soules, for God doth communicate it to all the world, to rich and poore, to noble, and to men of base conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Your memorie <note n="h" place="margin">Touching the blessed Trinitie.</note> resembleth the eternall Father, your vnderstanding the Sonne, your will the holy Ghost, and all your soule the sacred Trinitie. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther saith vnto you, call to mind the benefits which I haue diuided amongst you: the Sonne saith, in these benefits which you haue receiued from your God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template his power, and his mercie, his wisedome and his iustice: the holy Ghost pusheth you on to the feare and loue of your God. The memorie, the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and the wil are three things, and yet but one thing: the Father; the Sonne, and the holy Ghost are three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and yet but one God. When you heare Masse, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you into a deepe meditation, and say thus vnto your selues: Infinit God, and Saint of Saints, I do not know but this may be the last Masse that euer I shall heare: for you are to take a strict account of your conscience, as if your last houre were pronounced against you, since that death doth threaten you all, at all times, and in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But alas, what man thinketh vpon these things: the Angels tremble before the Maiesty of God, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors are lulled asleepe in their stupide repose and securitie: the first borne do honour their Creator with all awfull reuerence, and the seruants go on in their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euen courses without any feare at all.</p>
                     <p>Then he cried vnto God, saying: of a truth thou art the God of might and puissance, and makest thy selfe to bee obeyed by men and Angels, yea, by the Diuels themselues, as it plainely appeareth at this instant. Herein thy Omnipotencie doth make full declaration
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:7439:122"/>
of it selfe, and amazeth the world with this new won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: for, O great God, thou doest not esteeme the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of this world, but al they that humble themselues shall participate of thy light, and those that are puffed vp shall remaine obstinate in their pride.</p>
                     <p>You should demand three things from your God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things else whatsoeuer: first the glory of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, then whatsoeuer appertaineth to your saluation, and thirdly the good of your neighbour.</p>
                     <p>You are also to beg of your Creator in humility of spirit, that hee will make you prosper and grow by the dew of his grace, and this you are to doe as malefactors vpon your knees with an halter about your necke, and must say: My God and my Lord, grant me thy light to consider &amp; confesse my sins, implant within me a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and broken heart, that I may bewaile my offences, and haue my sinnes in detestation, that so I may bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted worthy to receiue absolution from the Priest. If thy body may stand thy brother instead to saue his soule, doe not delay to bestow it vpon him, or if his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy haue need of sustentation by thy goods, thou art not to deny them vnto him: for it is not the will of God that you should giue a soule for a soule, or a body for body, or goods for goods, but that you should preferre the saluation of a soule before the life, and the life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore goods and worldly possessions: not that you should alwaies be tied vnto this but that hee who put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it in practise doth doe the will of God: for God hath said, thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe, but how few are there that doe this?</p>
                     <p>Then he cried out, and alleaging an example answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable vnto what he formerly spake, he said, Ha <hi>Thomas,</hi> thou wert not ignorant of the death of thy master: thou knewest well that hee was to rise againe, yet diddest thou say, except I touch the prints of the nailes, and put my hand into his side, I will not beleeue. I doe not speake this to disgrace thee; but I say, that if thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:7439:122"/>
beene more pregnant to beleeue, thy Sauiour had not reproued thee: neither shouldest thou, as afterward thou diddest, haue had experience of thy frailty, yet wert thou named in the roll of the Apostles as well as the rest, and diddest afterward constantly suffer death in confirmation of that truth whereof thou haddest for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly doubted. God pardoned <hi>Dauid,</hi> that you might know he hath power to remit sinnes: hee did eate with the Publican, to declare that hee came not meerely for the iust: nay, I say further, that your God doth make narrower search and inquisition after the lost sheepe, which is the sinfull soule, then after that soule that stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in her sanctity and innocency. O great God, thou art that true shepheard who hath laid downe his life for the saluation of his wandring flocke: thou hast search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and at last found thy sheepe, which stragled away from the pasturage of their shepheard.</p>
                     <p>The same day <hi>Magdalene</hi> said, that there came a certaine Diuell from abrode to speake with <hi>Carreau,</hi> who was one of those that resided in her body, saying, come quickly, for <hi>Belzebub</hi> calleth for thee, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Carreau</hi> flew forth from her like lightening. She also said that <hi>Belzebub</hi> was departed from her body all that day, and had neuer stayed from her so long. And that she saw <hi>Belzebub</hi> to returne, while she was reading a letter, that made mention of the mother of God.</p>
                     <p>The same day also, father <hi>d'Ambruc</hi> sub. Prior of the Couent of S. Maximin came to S. <hi>Baume,</hi> to informe himselfe touching <hi>Louyse,</hi> because many gaue out that she was not possessed. And the same day towards euen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were the two women exorcised by Father <hi>Francis Billet,</hi> whereupon <hi>Verrine</hi> began to speake in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                     <p>What <hi>Belzebub,</hi> art thou returned? <hi>Belzebub</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whence had'st thou notice of my returne? <hi>Verrine</hi> said, the seruant knoweth his master: and added, The head draweth after it the whole body, so that if it fall
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:7439:123"/>
into a pit the body must of necessity follow after. The flocke of sheepe goeth after the shepheard, witnesse vs accursed spirits who haue beleeued <hi>Lucifer</hi> as our head, and as our shepheard. I haue been desirous to gaine thus much vpon the beleefe of <hi>Louyse</hi> that shee would conceit her selfe not to be possessed, and that I am heere by the appointment of <hi>Lucifer:</hi> for this day haue wee compassed her in with these tentations, telling her, that shee of her selfe gaue life to all these actions and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures, and that a woman might of her selfe deliuer all such discourses as these. There are those that say, put case that God would conuert a soule, or reueale some truth vnto his Church, is it probable that hee would make the Diuell his agent in an employment of so high a nature?</p>
                     <p>But I auerre that the Church hath receiued the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uestiture of authority from God, whereby it is enabled to command Diuels, and to enforce them in the vertue of Exorcismes to deliuer truth, and that the Diuell by his oath may giue assurance of the truth, if so be hee bee forced thereunto by the power of God communicated vnto his Church, and by the vertue of Exorcismes, and that all the conditions and ceremonies of a solemne oath be performed: yet for all this there is a religious person who faith, that I am not able to speake a truth: I answere him, that as I am a Diuell I cannot speake truth indeed, but am herein of his opinion: yet as I am sent from God who is able to draw good out of euill I am constrained to deliuer truth, and to take an oath for the further ratification thereof. He must deny the first Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of his faith, and in stead of <hi>Credo,</hi> say <hi>Non credo,</hi> if it be false that the Diuell may be forced to vtter a truth: for God hath giuen all his authority to the Church to command Diuels, and to constraine them to obey the charge which is laid vpon them. But I am not a whit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bashed, if this woman stand doubtfull whether shee bee possessed or no, when the religious persons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7439:123"/>
make question of the same.</p>

                           <hi>Verrine</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to speake.</note> Then he spake to God and said, I could endure with more ease the torments of hell 50 yeeres together, then to pronounce thy name onely one time; yet doest thou force from my mouth speeches of reuerence vnto thy Saints, which is much against the nature and custome of Diuels. Giue this charge to thy children who looke for a share in thy heritage, and expect a recompence for their obedience vnto thee. They haue so many famous and notable Preachers and many bookes furnished and fraught with al variety of learnings, and wilt thou haue me then to speake to men of all sorts both wise and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, who waite for no other retribution but the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell? It is no wonder if the Diuels seeke to withstand God, when his very children who haue a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Paradise declare themselues heady and refracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry against him.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Dominicke</hi> I hate thee as I doe the plague, and I should take more contentment in that externall darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the bottomlesse pit of hell, then in these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses

which I lauish thus vpon thy praises.

He that will bee beloued by the blessed mother of God must serue <hi>Dominicke</hi> in feruency of spirit: you are first to craue the mediation of the mother, and then to make your redresse vnto the Sonne. There are many who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout to their Creator but few vnto the Virgine, yea there are not many amongst women themselues that consecrate their deuotions vnto her: and yet hee that will gaine eternall life must make his approch vnto this <hi>Mary, Mary</hi> is the <note n="m" place="margin">
                           <hi>Scala Coeli,</hi> so <hi>Fulgentius</hi> calleth her in his Sermon of the Virgins praises: for without the fruit which she carried there had been no ladder for vs to mount vp into heauen, and the tree was as a lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whereby we were ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to plucke this fruit.</note> ladder of heauen, &amp; the Saints are the steps of this ladder, so that hee who will enter into the Pallace of the King must first ascend by these staires.

more deuout &amp; addicted vnto thy Order then euer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they haue been, because thou art the Virgins darling, and art able to preuaile much with her in mens behalfe.</p>
                     <p>You will tell me, that God hath created heauen not for beasts, nor for Turkes, but for Christians; I grant it, yet for all this your deuotion must not coole within you, neither must your life bee bestiall, nay worse then the conuersation of Infidels.</p>
                     <p>The Saints who are full of charity and all perfection will obtaine sanctification for you, if you direct your prayers to them for that purpose, and doe not make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession for these temporall and momentary commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.

Be euer carefull of your saluation, and say vnto him, O my good Angell that takest charge of me, lend me thy hand and bring me the directest way vnto the Court of this King; and doe me this fauour as to make my introduction vnto some grace with your Prince. I tell you that all Saints are Kings and Princes,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:7439:125"/>
and haue great authority and power in the Court of that Soueraigne King. The body of a man is not more different from the soule, then is the Court of this world from that celestial mansion. If you had but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted the delicacy of the wine of loue which was broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Mount of <hi>Tabor,</hi> without doubt you would despise all things in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison of it. This wine is at one time both delicate and pure; but the wine of voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse is mingled and sophisticated with water, and retaineth no sweetnesse or sauour. Who so drinketh of the wine of heauen, shall quench his thirst as <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene</hi> did, who dranke at the feet of our Sauiour.</p>
                     <p>The Court gates of the King of glory are very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and euery one that will, cannot enter in thereat. For first a man must knocke at the gate of mercy, taking an Angell for his guide, and humility and obedience for his two companions; for you can haue no admittance into the kingdome of heauen if you bee not associated with these two vertues. The Sonne of God is the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor thereof, who died obediently vpon the Crosse: nay more in being obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto his executioners he was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient vnto the instrument of the Diuell, &amp; may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in right now challenge obedience fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. He who shall deuoutly serue the mother of God, and <hi>Dominick,</hi> shall bee sure to obtaine plenary remission for his sins.</p>
                     <p>After, all this, <hi>Verrine</hi> confirmed all with an oath which he tooke very solemnly, imprecating the wrath of God vpon himselfe and all hell. Then hee said three seuerall times, but with a great deale of resistance, <hi>Aue Maria,</hi> and in saying of <hi>Ora,</hi> he added, <hi>Orapro illis mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seris peccatoribus nunc, &amp; in hora mortis,</hi> to the honour of the mother of God and of <hi>Dominicke.</hi> And then hee cried, O <hi>Dominicke,</hi> neuer diddest thou receiue so much honour from a Diuell, but thou dost merit this and much more; and turning to the Sub-prior, he said: cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed bee thy comming hither, which hath brought such shame and confusion vnto Diuels.</p>

                     <p>This day in the morning the Dominican father did exorcise; in the beginning whereof there happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a disputation between father <hi>Peter d'Ambruc,</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prior of the Couent royall of S. <hi>Magdalene</hi> at S <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> of the order of S. <hi>Dominicke,</hi> and the Diuell <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> who was one of those that possessed <hi>Louyse Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peau.</hi> The said Sub. prior affirmed, that hee could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue no true proofe or demonstration, to induce him to beleeue, that the said <hi>Louyse</hi> was possessed. <hi>Verrine</hi> answered him, Thou pleasest me well in not beleeuing it, and in affirming that all these extraordinary actions and gestures doe expresly proceed from her selfe. The said Father said, I will neuer beleeue her possession. I perceiue well (answered <hi>Verrine</hi>) what thou beleeuest, thou saiest <hi>Credo,</hi> and non <hi>Credo,</hi> and art indeed irreso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and doubtfull. Thou maiest tell mee that thou art bound to beleeue it, because it is an Article of faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but what commendation is this vnto thee, when thou doest not beleeue it? The said father replyed; thou art not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to speake Latine: to which <hi>Verrine</hi> answered, God will not haue it so, but constraineth me to speake in the vulgar tongue. Then said the father, Thou lyest in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so. I lie not (said <hi>Verrine,</hi>) I tell thee againe, God will not haue it so, that <hi>Louyse</hi> may be the more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly humbled, and that wee might haue the greater power to tempt her concerning this point; that so shee might for a time giue easie credit vnto those, who tell her, that either this which shee doth, proceedeth from God, or from the Diuell alone, or that all these strange deportments, and discourses, are made and counterfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by her selfe. No no, Gods pleasure is that she should be deiected; for it is no matter of difficulty to beleeue that which a man beholdeth. Then replyed the said fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, It is false, and thou giuest my ielousies no satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:7439:126"/>
                        <hi>Verrine</hi> answered, What desirest thou to build and firme, in thee a beleefe that <hi>Louyse</hi> is possessed? Doest thou beleeue it, or doest thou not? I doe very well perceiue that thou are not hasty to beleeue; yet is this a very vnusuall accident, neither is shee possessed after the ordinary fashion of many, who striue to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse themselues with eloquent and affected phrases, and so make a cheate vpon mens beleefe and vpon their soules also: but I am heere on Gods behalfe, to conuert soules, and not to deceiue them.</p>
                     <p>Then the Exorcist holding the Booke of Exorcismes in his hand, commanded him in the Name of God to answere vnto such things, as hee would demand of him. But <hi>Verrine</hi> snatched away the booke by violence, and threw it to the ground, saying, What? Wilt thou exorcise <hi>Louyse,</hi> when shee is not possessed? Then hee said vnto her that was possessed. No <hi>Louyse,</hi> doe not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thy selfe to be exorcised any longer, thou art a foole, and art not possessed. If thou permit them to exorcist thee, I will cry aloud, that thou art giuen over vnto the Diuell; but I will take heed how I sweare this. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this, the Exorcist gaue not ouer to exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise and to adiure him that he should answere.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Verrine</hi> then said vnto him, What wouldest thou haue mee answere vnto? Afterward hee turned to the Subpriour, hauing first made answere vnto certaine La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin words in the exorcisme, and said. Thou art well skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in latin, is this latin of the vulgar kinde or not? <hi>Louyse</hi> vnderstandeth all this passingly well, her Father and Mother haue brought her vp to speake a great deale of latin, haue they nor?

will not answere to any thing, but am resolued to resist as long as I am able, and when I can resist no longer, I will prostrate my selfe on the earth, and will withstand God with all the force I haue. This he spake in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame fury and violence, making semblance as if hee would flee from his place of abode. Then <hi>Verrine</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to speake vnto God, saying, No, no, I will doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I will oppose my selfe against thee with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test reluctancy that I possibly may, I haue no stomach to praise and doe honour vnto mine enemy. <note n="o" place="margin">S. <hi>Dominick</hi> an aduersary vnto <hi>Verrine.</hi>

Then the Sub-priour said, Are not we to commit any mortall sinne by our Rule? <hi>Verrine</hi> answered, No. And being asked if the Order of S. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> might beare a mortall sinne. <hi>Verrine</hi> said that it might: as might also the Order of <hi>Claire.</hi> Then he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned, that the Diuell did more cast about to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent a man that was in a Religious Order, then to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and get the victory of a thousand others: because (said he) wee priuily vndermine the wordlings of these

times, and doe manage them as wee please, and as the mother would doe her childe: wee suggest vnto yong women, that they should not be so strict in obseruance of the Masse vpon Sundaies and Holydaies, but should bequeath that time to the decking vp and imbellishing of themselues, and to other vanities. To yong Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen wee say, thou art yong, now or neuer thou must abandon thy selfe to thy pleasures, make much of thy selfe, and frequent Tennis-courts, and publick meetings for dancing. Thus doe we take them off from deuout meditations, and quench in them any motion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be present at Euening-song, or to doe that which is the duety of a Christian to performe; but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise wee doe present vnto them a thousand occasions to commit villany. But when wee labour to seduce a Religious person, wee vse more warinesse and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection: <hi>Astaroth</hi> is he that then bestirres himselfe, sometimes suggesting, that hee neede not make such haste to say Masse; sometimes endeauouring to make him carelesse in his deuotions, and telling him that it is a matter of slender consequence, and that he should not make it so haynous, to bee wanting sometimes in the obseruation of these petty duties. Much cunning is to be spent in hooking in one of these, wee must knock at his gate, and at his windowes, that we may get entrance into his mansion: yet are wee for all these attempts of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes crossed of our designement, so surely doe they shut vp all the passages that lead into them.

                     </p>
                     <p>Hereunto hee added, that if hee had power hee would disgorge all his curses against him, who first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the reformation, and against all his inspirations.</p>

                     <p>I am not abashed, that there are many who beleeue not these things, for it is the maner in all new miracles of God, to finde some stoppe and contradiction, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the miracles of Christ Iesus, and in those which were afterwards wrought by the Apostles, as also in those that were of olde performed by the Prophets.</p>
                     <p>The workes that proceed from the Diuell are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained gladly; so that when a great euent befalleth, and receiueth no <note n="r" place="margin">This for the most part fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out to be so.</note> affront or repugnancy, it is an argument that it commeth not from God. Great God, thou hast many friends at thy table, but how is their number di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished when thou commest to suffer on the Crosse? The Kings of the earth vse to eate alone, but the King of glory with company. <hi>Peter,</hi> when thou did dest deny thy master, then diddest thou begin to suffer with him.

                     </p>
                     <p>O blessed Mother of God, thou wast conceiued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out originall sinne, and hast alone liued without <note n="s" place="margin">Original, actuall and veniall.</note> any spot or taint at all. <hi>Martha</hi> did follow thee in thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of virginity, and is a great familiar of thine; as <hi>Magdalene</hi> is of thy sonnes. Miracles doe euer meete with some opposition, as appeareth heere in this: for this is a new miracle, &amp; an euident demonstration of the Omnipotency of God, the like whereof hath not been wrought since the first being of the world, and yet can God worke a hundred and a hundred miracles, fuller of astonishment and rarenesse, then this is. This miracle was wrought by God, at the particular instance and solicitation of the Virgin, of <hi>Magdalene</hi> and of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick,</hi> and intended primarily for the reformation of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:7439:128"/>
his order. And cursed bee him that doth reforme it, for they are not few that will redresse all disorders both in themselues and in their fellowes, especially in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Dominick</hi>: and whosoeuer shall remaine vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to this reformation, shall be in great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger. Some will say, I haue nothing to doe with the reformation; another will obiect, I am of a tender and delicate constitution: another will excuse himselfe with, Father, I am too yong, and this is too hard for me to vnder-goe. Neuerthelesse, many shall take vpon them the Order of <hi>Dominick,</hi> because his Rule cannot tollerate any mortall sinne, and because of the Reformation of his Order. And they will make choice of this Order, when they shall vnderstand what great immunities and priuiledges <hi>Dominick</hi> hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined for it at the hands of the sacred Mother of God: vnto whom he was euer exceedingly deuoted, and is beloued againe by the Virgin for his continency and puritie. Many also shall enter into this Habit when they shall heare of the perfection of this Order, and what a sweete sauour it rendreth vp vnto the Almightie. In like manner shall the Congregations of the Christian Doctrines and of <hi>Vrsula</hi> floorish and spread their bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, yet without any preiudice vnto other Orders, and the Reformed shall liue in puritie as the Angels of God. At the end of the Exorcismes it was held fit that <hi>Verrine</hi> should solemnly sweare vpon the blessed Sacrament, for confirmation of that which he had aboue spoken.</p>
                     <p>And first they asked him in what manner he had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Conception of the Virgin: to which hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered in these words. Those who are heere present are of different opinions. The Exorcist commanded him to expresse himselfe distinctly and cleerly, if it were the will of God that he should vtter the truth herein, and if God had reuealed any thing vnto him concerning this point. Then he plainly told them that <note n="t" place="margin">Touching the conception of the Virgin.</note> she was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate from the beginning. Then did the Exorcist
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:7439:128"/>
command him againe, that hee should more amply dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of this point before them all: whereupon he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to speake in this manner. I affirme that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Father when hee was resolued to send his Word vpon the earth to repaire the breach of mankinde, and that the Word was ready to doe the will of his Father, then did he determine to create a creature particularly for that purpose, to be the blessed Mother to his Sonne: who being also that King of power, was able so to fit all things, that his Mother should co-operate together with those blessings and guifts which he would endow her with all; which was iust and agreeable vnto reason. I say, that when hee saw and knew (for hee is the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of his Father) that his blessed Mother would not oppose against that which hee had decreed to doe in a matter of such consequence and importance, as was the Coniunction of the Diuine nature vnto the nature of man, he iudged it fit and expedient that shee should be for euer exempted from the vassalage of sinne, whether it were originall, actuall, mortall or veniall: hence it commeth, that she neuer did trespasse against God her Father. And if <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> and <hi>Ieremie</hi> were sanctified from their mothers wombe, how much more should the sacred Mother of God out-shine them in puritie, when amongst al the creatures that were euer fashioned by the hands of the Almighty, shee is the most eminent and perfect, next vnto the humanitie of her Sonne. And as in God there is no time either past or to come, but all is present with him, and being besides a cleere and spotlesse cristall, that is neuer misted ouer or made dimme by darknesse, he fore-saw in this Idea or glasse, that his blessed Mother should in the whole race of her life gently submit her selfe to his good pleasure, and obey the Angell when hee came vnto her. For if <hi>Eue</hi> had her creation exempted from sinne, it standeth with reason that the second <hi>Eue</hi> should haue a greater dowry of integritie then euer the first had. And as the first <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
                        <pb n="208" facs="tcp:7439:129"/>
being the type and figure of Iesus Christ, was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without sinne, and from a mould of earth that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was mingled with vncleannesse; how much more shall this second <hi>Adam</hi> surmount the first in the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his humanitie. And as God tooke from the first <hi>Adam</hi> when hee was a sleepe one of his ribbes, and thereof created <hi>Eve,</hi> so God the Father while the second <hi>Adam</hi> that was to come slept in his bosome, <note n="u" place="margin">By his eternal knowledge &amp; foresight into things.</note> tooke one of his ribbes and framed <note n="x" place="margin">By his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate graces which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a creature. And it is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphore bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the ribbe of <hi>Adam</hi>
                        </note> another <hi>Eve</hi> from the same, that is, the blessed Mother of God. The Father contributed thereunto his power, the Sonne his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and was content that shee should haue a greater portion of wisedome then the Seraphins or any other creature whatsoeuer, next to his humanity that was to come, and manifest it selfe vnto the world. And the ribbe which Almightie God tooke from <hi>Adam</hi> when hee slept did prefigure and fore-shew what I haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue declared. In like manner the holy Ghost did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his goodnesse vnto her, not that essentiall goodnes which is co-eternall with him, but a goodnes of that proportion and magnificense as could possibly be bestowed vpon a pure and immaculate creature. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this discourse, <hi>Verrine</hi> did dictate the forme that was to be held, to giue testification that all this was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and vnderstood in this manner.</p>
                     <p>Wee whose names are vnder-signed haue heard and seene all that which hath beene spoken by the mouth of <hi>Louyse Cappeau</hi> who is possessed by three Diuels by some witch-craft that together with them was giuen vnto her: and further we haue heard one of the Diuels named <hi>Verrine,</hi> after much resistance and renitency a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God and the Exorcismes, yet being at the length forced by God vnto the same, to deliuer all that is heere written touching the blessed Mother of God and the Eternall Word, to their glory and the saluation of Soules.</p>
                     <p>He further confessed in a great agony and chase, that
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7439:129"/>
there was no saluation out of the Church of Rome: that there was but one God, and one holy Baptisme, and therefore by a consequent but one Church.</p>
                     <p>Afterward he said that al these acts were, to confirme that which he had formerly touched, concerning the Order of <hi>Dominick,</hi> and to show how agreeable his rule was to God, and his blessed Mother, and that this Miracle was wrought in fauour of that Order. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue heere, that this was spoken, after that <hi>Verrine</hi> had said that this Miracle was wrought for the glory of God, and for the honour of his blessed Mother, <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene</hi> and <hi>Dominick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then to confirme whatsoeuer he had aboue spoken, he tooke an oath the strongest and most binding that a Diuel possibly could take, and if euer an oath had power to tye, it was this oath. And added, that there were some of opinion, that no oath was of validitie before God; yet when hee said vnto his Apostles that they should cast out Diuels, and foresaw that these Diuels being full of all iniquity, would not by their good will obey the commands of the Church, vnlesse they were adiured in the Name of Almighty God, hee gaue his Church authority ouer Diuels, to bee able to constraine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the vertue of Exorcismes. I affirme therefore, that the oathes of Diuels are in force whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are discreetly ministred vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And the oath now inquestion is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with as great solemnitie as possiblie may be in such a case, I hauing sworne vpon the honoured and blessed Sacrament in the Name of the Father Almighty, in the name of the Eternall Wisedome, which is the Sonne; and in the name of that infinite goodnes, which is the holy Ghost. It is also taken according to the intention of the whole Church militant and triumphant against the meaning of Hell, and any sinister or reserued pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose whatsoeuer, whereof the Diuels many times make their aduantage if the Exorcist doe not looke about him with great warinesse. And after hee had taken this
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:7439:130"/>
oath, hee called for the wrath of God, of the blessed Trinitie, and of the whole Church militant and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant to fall vpon him. The like imprecation he made against all Hell, and that in the presence of the whole Assembly.</p>
                     <p>You may heere behold the list of those that were present and heard that which is aboue spoken, and who signed their names vnto the same, Frier <hi>Peter Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruc, Francis Billet</hi> Priest of the Christian Doctrine the Exorcist, <hi>Romillon</hi> Priest vnworthy, <hi>Godam</hi> Doctor in Diuinity, Frier <hi>Peter Foruer,</hi> Vicar of S. <hi>Baume, A.

                     </p>
                     <p>Then in confirmation of whatsoeuer he had spoken, <hi>Verrin</hi> was constrained to worship the holy and blessed Sacrament, and to say three times, <hi>Adoramus te Christe, quia per Sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti hos, non au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem nos.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the said oath, hee said as hee did the day before three times, <hi>Aue Maria</hi>: and then he said other three times, <hi>Oraproillis Sancta Mater Dei</hi>: and againe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three times, <hi>Ora pro illis sancta Magdalena:</hi> and other three times, <hi>Ora pro illis sancta Martha:</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three times, <hi>Ora pro illis sancte Lazare.</hi> But in the Salutation of the Virgin he refused to say <hi>Mater Dei,</hi> because (said hee) it is a name of the greatest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and perfection amongst all the attributes of her praises.</p>
                     <p>After dinner in the presence of the Sub-Prior afore named while he was speaking to <hi>Magdalene, Belzebub</hi> returned &amp; entred into the body of the said <hi>Magdalene,</hi> &amp; bad <hi>Leuiathan</hi> come forth, who presently <note n="y" place="margin">Thus did <hi>Magdalene</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</note> performed the same; he said the like to <hi>Asmodee,</hi> who came foorth like a flame of fire mingled with sulphure: hee further said to <hi>Astaroth,</hi> come thou foorth likewise, and he flue out of her with extreame stinke of rosen &amp; sulphure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="211" facs="tcp:7439:130"/>Afterward, as <hi>Verrine</hi> did dictate the disputation that happened betweene him and the Sub-prior afore said, <hi>Belzebub</hi> came and demaunded to haue the two Diuels that were with <hi>Verrine,</hi> to wit <hi>Gresill</hi> and <hi>Sonneillon. Verrine</hi> told him they will doe you no good, for thou seest that the Princes who are with thee are able to stand thee in no stead. <hi>Belzebub</hi> said vnto him, come thou also along with me. <hi>Verrine</hi> told him, I cannot yet leaue my master, let it suffice thee that I bestow my seruants vpon thee, and immediatly <hi>Gresill</hi> and <hi>Sonneillon</hi> came out of the body of <hi>Louyse,</hi> and shee sensibly felt that they came from her in the manner of winde. Yet did not <hi>Belzebub</hi> leaue intreating of <hi>Verrine</hi> to goe with him. <hi>Verrine</hi> answered,<note n="z" place="margin">He speaketh of <hi>Lewes</hi> the Magitian.</note> Why doest thou thus intreat mee? I cannot goe, and if I should goe, my <note n="a" place="margin">See the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere vnto the 5. doubt after the epistle to the Reader.</note> presence would preiudice your dessignement. <hi>Belzebub</hi> said, speake not thus, for we are companions. Not altogether so (said <hi>Verrine</hi>) the Diuell hath seduced her and the Diuell shall bring her home to the confusion of all Hell. Then said <hi>Verrine,</hi> wel, I must goe then, but it shal be to conuert the Magician, and bid the Exorcist to <note n="b" place="margin">They that were thus pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed felt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues much lighter and in greater ease, when the euill spirits departed from them.</note> take the booke of Exorcismes, and to command him in the name of God to goe thether, which the Exorcist did, and presently <hi>Verrine</hi> came foorth, saying, I goe against <hi>Belzebub.</hi> Then did <hi>Louyse</hi> feele his departure from her like vnto a winde. But as he was comming foorth, hee said, I doe not leaue thee altogether. Being departed from her, <hi>Louyse</hi> remained in her ordinary temper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting onely the paines that proceeded from the witchcraft.</p>
                     <p>The same day in the euening were these two women exorcised by father <hi>Francis</hi> Priest of the Doctrine, and <hi>Verrine</hi> began to speake as followeth.</p>
                     <p>Souldiers follow their Captaine, and when <hi>Belzebub</hi> departed wee went after him. God would winne vnto him the soules of such as are growne stony in their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy: his desire is that you would shunn that which
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7439:131"/>
is naught, and apply your selues vnto that which is good. Wee haue been at <hi>Marseille,</hi> and haue diuerse times knocked at his gate, and <hi>Belzebub,</hi> obserue how slender thy forces are when thou doest demand for help of my seruants. <hi>Belzebub,</hi> thy affaires runne in a low ebbe, and this is the reason why thou art now so sad and dumpish, <hi>Belzebub</hi> thou art at thy wits end what to follow. Then he spake to <hi>Magdalene</hi> and said, <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene,</hi> let not thy courage be abated for those few tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which thou now endurest, for the paines of Hell are farre more grieuous. After this hee spake vnto the Diuels, and said, come all yee Diuels of the aire, all yee Diuels of the earth, and all the Diuels of hell, come all to helpe and succour <hi>Belzebub</hi>; but your comming wil be to no purpose, and your assistance not worth your comming, for all of you are in comparison, but as leaues of trees.</p>
                     <p>Then turning to <hi>Belzebub,</hi> he said: be of good cheere <hi>Belzebub,</hi> knowest thou not, that where thou loosest one, thou shalt gaine tenne: ha cursed spirit, oughtest thou not to consider, that these soules were not created by thee? Doest thou not see, that God will take them vnto himselfe? Thou hast inueagled thousands from him, and thinkest thou that hee will euer dissemble this?</p>
                     <p>If <note n="c" place="margin">An inuectiue against the Magician.</note> it were possible that leaues of trees could weepe, they would shed forth teares of blood for this wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed sinner, so vast are his offences before God.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Verrine</hi> turned his discourse to God, and said: great God! how good, how bountifull, and how sweet art thou? I am tortured and tormented, and haue not the patience to behold thy great goodnesse towards the grossest sinners, especially towards this man whom I am forbidden to name. O all powerfull God, why doest thou not vntie and let out those heapes of water, or hurle downe thy lightning from heauen to destroy this wretch, and to bring him to vtter perdition, who sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:7439:131"/>
soules to hell more in number, then the haile that falleth vpon the earth? I tell you, God can dissemble this no longer, neither will he any more indure his execrable villanies: but his pleasure is, that he be either conuerted or punished. The impatiencie which God taketh at the losse of these and other obstinate soules, is not such a kind of impatiency as may any way darken or preiudice his perfections, but it is rather an argument in him of vnblemished goodnesse: for God in iustice should dart downe lightning from heauen to destroy them, or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the earth to gape and swallow them vp, who haue better deserued this punishment then <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biran,</hi> whom the earth deuoured vp for their rebellion. O Lord God, he cannot flie from thee; whether he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to hel, for according to thy essence thou art there, or whether he doth imagine to stray from thee by wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring like a vagabond vp and downe the world, for thou seest all, and art euery where: or if he would ascend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen, for there the gates are shut against him. So that if he be not repentant, hee may perchance flie, but he cannot euade.</p>
                     <p>Great God, thou hast made reseruation of three things to thy selfe, and wouldest not that sinners should intermeddle or dip their fingers in them, to wit, thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, iudgement and vengeance.</p>
                     <p>And because the guidance and gouernement of things is most proper vnto him, you must let him alone in his course of gouernement, for he knoweth wel when to take the cause of innocencie into his owne protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. What? thinke ye that God will suffer this iniquitie to branch vp higher? I tell you he is wearied with his long sufferance; and therefore wil see the end of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditement, and howsoeuer this busines shal fal, he wil be sure to fashion and shape it to his glory, &amp; the saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of soules.<note n="d" place="margin">A prediction that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian should be burned.</note> I say further, that if he be not conuerted, he shal be burned aliue: if he wil needs perish, God will leaue him to himself, for this good God for his part was

not wanting to him in any thing. God resembleth a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of many children, who are all stubborne and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious against him, and will not obey him neither by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements, nor by threats: then doth this father say vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that they deserue to be punished, because they are disobedient to their father, and will not harken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, neither for hope of inheritance, nor for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther admonitions or inducements that may bee laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, but doe continue on in their contempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</p>
                     <p>It is a thing full of astonishment, that God should prouide this great remedy for you miserable and accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed sinners, and yet the number of those that lay hold vpon it should be so small. There are some that conceiue that God is indebted vnto them, thinking with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, that hee hath promised Paradise vnto them, and that heauen was not destinated to intertaine beasts or Infidels, but for Christians. It is true, God is vexed with a holy kind of impatience, when he considereth the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuous and malitious purposes of men: he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased their soules at an high and inestimable rate; for the satisfying of which paiment, it was expedient that diuinitie should be vnited vnto a humane nature. Thou also, who art the powerfull mother of God, did'st suffer much for their sakes, and wert vnder the Crosse, and neere vnto thy Sonne: yet for all this, do they renounce thy Passion (O God) the nailes, and al other instruments of thy torments; and doest thou still hearken after them, and willingly subiect thy selfe to death, to saue them? Why art thou so fond ouer them; is not thy blessed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heauen with an infinite number of Saints and Angels? If all the drops of water in the sea, all the leaues of trees, all the Starres of heauen were capable to sound forth thy praises, they would all blesse thee, O God, and giue thee thanks for those manifold benefits which thou hast conferred vpon men: yea, the blessing of their creation alone doth challenge euerlasting giuing of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:7439:132"/>
thanks. Besides this, he hath giuen his Angels charge ouer you, who doe euer intercede on your behalfe, and say, they will be conuerted, they will be conuerted, you must haue a little patience. The Virgin <hi>Marie</hi> is also euer mediating for you, yet are you regardlesse of all this, especially this wretch, who shall either be burned, or be conuerted: for God can no longer suffer or looke on villanies of so soule a nature; and this will be the end of this businesse.</p>
                     <p>The messengers of the King haue been at his gate and haue diuers times knocked there: I my selfe also was present, but not any way to further the proiect of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then he spake to <hi>Belzebub,</hi> and said: Accursed feind, thou diddest imagine that I would combine with thee, but thou art deceiued: for I cannot swarue from the commission of my Master. I did indeed suffer my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to giue thee assistance, but for my selfe I tooke part against thee, and made that iourney of set purpose to declare vnto him, that as the Diuel had seduced him, so the Diuell should bee an occasion to set him right in the true way. Then hee tooke a solemne oath, that whatsoeuer hee had now vttered, was agreeable vnto truth.</p>
                     <p>The same day, when <hi>Verrine</hi> was dictating that which hee had formerly deliuered touching the imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate conception of the blessed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God, he was asked what he meant in saying, that the humanitie of the Sonne of God did repose it selfe in the bosome of his Father, and that then God did forme his blessed Mother out of one of his ribs. To this <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> answered; You may here cauill and say, that then this proposition must bee true, the Sonne is before his Mother. I tell you, that the humanitie of Christ Iesus (as all other things whatsoever are) was alwaies present with his celestiall Father: for with him nothing can bee said to bee past, or to come, but all is present: the Sonne
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:7439:133"/>
is before his Mother, <note n="e" place="margin">That is, with the eye of his grace.</note> because the Father did first <note n="f" place="margin">Because of his dignity.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the humanitie of his Sonne, before hee beheld his mother: yet for all this you cannot properly say, that the one precedeth the other, for in God all things are present.</p>

                     <p>Notwithstanding, God would yet deale fauourable with thee, if thy selfe giue no stop thereunto.</p>
                     <p>Ha you Capuchins! you shall bee punished with temporall calamities, because you did vary from the forme which was prescribed vnto you.

                     <p>Then said <hi>Verrine</hi> to the Dominican Father (who euer wrote what hee deliuered) I must goe thither the third time; consider how God loueth this soule: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christmas you shall see the bottome of this sacke emptied, there was neuer such villany seene, neither was there euer the like miracle, or the like remedy. <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> also said vnto the Dominican Father, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the aboue-mentioned Sub-prior. <note n="h" place="margin">See the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy vnto the 5. doubt.</note> Take the booke of Exorcismes, and enioyne me in the name of God to goe the third time to <hi>Marseille,</hi> to solicite and

When <hi>Verrine</hi> issued forth, <hi>Gresil</hi> who held his place, declared that he would speake to the Magician in another manner then he did to <hi>Magdalene.</hi> And as <hi>Magdalene</hi> at the first would not beleeue, because the Diuell busied himselfe in the cause of God; or rather because <hi>Louyse</hi> did take vpon her to teach and instruct her, or else some Diuell in her (as was reported) so should not this Magician regard any thing which should be spoken for his refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
                     <p>The same day in the morning the Dominican Father did exorcise, &amp; <hi>Verrine</hi> began to speake in this manner,</p>
                     <p>The will that is guided by the grace of God is able to compasse any thing, and is mightier then the powers of hell it selfe. How Idle then are they that say, I cannot be conuerted? It is vnbeseeming to adde excuses to your sinnes, it was the old dotage of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adam</hi> thou haddest sufficient grace to keepe thy selfe vntainted, but thou diddest suffer thy selfe to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused, as many wretched sinners doe euery day.</p>
                     <p>The soule is the mistrisse, and the body as the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bermaid: yet when the soule shall say, let vs rise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to pray and serue God, the body will forthwith oppugne it, and say, I am yet but young, let old age first approch: we shall haue leisure and time enough before vs, to be repentant.</p>
                     <p>The memory will say, let vs call to mind the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings which are showred vpon vs from aboue: the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding will thereunto adioyne, let vs contemplate the goodnesse, wisedome and power of the Creator in these his blessings; and the will is ready to push vs on, to loue and feare this good God, because he is the sourse and first originall of all your happinesse.</p>
                     <p>The soule will say, I will heedfully obserue thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine inspirations, and will bequeath my selfe vnto thy seruice, I will endure no longer that my seruant should inuade the gouernment of my house. To which the

chambermaid will reply, Ha mistrisse! what meane you to doe with your selfe? take compassion of your ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse, you are of too delicate a composition, to bee martyred with such austere courses of life: you haue time enough to repent you, solace and glut your selfe with delights, whiles occasion is offered, and vse your goods with freenesse and profusenesse, that you may va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and runne through all manner of pastimes, whiles the time will giue this liberty vnto you. Then <hi>Verrine</hi> said, My words (you see) sauour of the spirit, and doe maintaine, that the soule is and ought to be the mistrisse of the body. It is certaine that where the chambermaid holdeth the raines of gouernment in her hands, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily will soone sinke and fall to decay: therefore it ill beseemes the body to beare sway, because it resembleth a woman, who wanteth discretion to gouerne her selfe; and God will not exact a reckoning from the body, but from the soule, and the soule shall haue the precedency of the body both in the reward and in the punishment; because the soule ought rather to beleeue him that fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it, then the seruant. A blind man is vnfit to raigne, and why? because he is blind. <note n="i" place="margin">The soule compared to a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</note> The soule is a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and if the conscience bee in quiet, all the rest is the more peaceable: Hence it is that the soule should gouerne and not the body, because it is deuoid of all true apprehension of the misery which it may suffer. <hi>Eue</hi> spake but once in excuse of her fault, but the body grumbles and kickes perpetually.</p>
                     <p>Your God hath an armory garnished with all perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and can euery day present new graces, to those that demand them of him, for hee keepeth them in his storehouse to bestow them vpon his children.

The two discourses in Latine and French did containe this relation heere word for word: so that we dared not to change one title hereof, as we haue for borne the like altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through the whole frame and body of this history.

                        </note> The King of France lately deceased did worthily esteeme of this nobilitie; he did humble himselfe, and call vpon his God, demeaning himselfe in his presence as a malefactor, and oftentimes heard Masse with much deuotion and effusion of teares. I tell you, many Priests doe not so attentiuely meditate vpon the greatnesse and excellency of God, as he did; therefore was his death a kinde of martyrdome, because hee would rather suffer death for the regard and reuerence which he bare vnto his God, then giue credit to that which the Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had foreshowne vnto him, and in dying hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the word <hi>Iesus,</hi> and recommended his soule into the hands of God. Hee had offended his God, as <hi>David</hi> had done before him, and was guilty as hee was, and they were both Kings of mighty Nations: but this had been infected with heresie, as thou <hi>Louyse</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly wert: yet O <hi>Henry,</hi> it is a truth, thou art now in Paradise. Be glad <hi>Marie</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi> for thou hast the honour to haue wedded a King, who is now a Saint in heauen: and if thou shalt imitate his godly end, God will inuest thee with the same honour: and thou <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi> now a young tender King, bee thou an imitator of the rare indowments of thy father, who was so solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to giue thee vertuous education. And doe you all loue this Prince, for he well deserueth to beeloued by

Blessed Mother of God, thy Sonne was impatient to be inclosed vp so long in thy flesh, not for that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in thee any thing which might distast him, but because his desire was to come into the world, and to yssue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> foorth from thy holy prison with all the speed hee might, to giue light vnto the world that remained darke, and to make his brightnes communicable vnto his creatures. Of a truth <hi>Mary</hi> thou art the Moone, and thy Sonne the Sunne of this world: the Saints are also the starres that shine in the same.

Wonder not that I haue often said, that this was a worke of admiration: for Kings haue their Pallaces and bedds furnished euen to prodigality, but good God, thou couldest scarce finde a place to bee borne; yet mightest thou haue built for thy selfe a Paris, or haue chosen the cittie of Rome in her greatnes, or haue caused some Royall Palace to bee prepared for thee, for thou art wisedome and goodnes it selfe, and hast created heauen and earth of nothing: Neuerthelesse, though the guide and prouidence of all things depend of thee, yet wouldest thou not make

For it is most certaine, that who so hath but a tast of the sweetnesse of Heauen will haue all the pleasures of the earth in no estimation. Great God! all things are subiected vnto thy will, for doe thou but speake the word, and what is there that dareth resist thee? Hence it is that thou mad'st choice of a poore and contemptible Virgin to bee thy Mother, because thou wouldest paterne and square foorth from thy selfe, a perfect example of humility vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others.</p>
                     <p>Who would euer haue affirmed, that such a one as shee should bee the Mother of Almighty God? Who would euer haue thought that her Sonne which she car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in her armes had beene the liuing God, Creator of Heauen and Earth?</p>
                     <p>In like manner diddest thou yssue foorth from that chast wombe of thy blessed Mother, without any taint or corruption of thy integrity, as a Sun-beame passeth through the glasse without breaking of the same, but rather maketh it more cleere and brightsome.</p>
                     <p>Great God, thy blessed Mother and <hi>Ioseph,</hi> when they were at <hi>Bethlem</hi> were forced to vse an vnknown stable for their dwelling place.</p>
                     <p>I am much displeased at this thy too great humility, when I obserue the haughtines which swelleth man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: I meane not Kings and Princes, but I speak of baser and more subordinate fellowes, who are indeed very shrubbs and flyes, yet if they faile in their expectation of the smallest commoditie that may befall them, they presently fall a murmuring, and thinke thou doest them

wrong, although it be nothing so, and that these cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are miscreated in them by errors &amp; the wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mis-apprehension of things.</p>
                     <p>O <hi>Ioseph,</hi> thou diddest enquire after some lodging wherein you might retire your selues, but there was no roome in the Inne, and why? because they knew you not: for if they had had aduertisement who you were, they would assuredly haue lodged you in their house.</p>
                     <p>But God was content to take harborage in a poore beggerly lodging, being almost vntiled and open euery where, and not being locked and made sure for their safety. You therefore that are poore can haue no place for excuse of your intemperatnesse and impatiency, but you are to be contented if you haue but where-with-all to intertaine your life and soule together. You are not without a stable and a cratch wherein to lodge the King of glory, the stable is your soule, and the cratch your heart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> accepted of the stable, although Christ for his part could haue beene contented to bee borne without doores in the open fields: but hee made election of a stable, not because hee had need of it, but in regard that it had need of him, that so it being ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by his presence, might bee a place of more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noume then all the Kings Palaces of the world. If God had permitted the ordering and determination of this affaire to the will of the Seraphins, or Sages of this world, I tell you they would haue runne a cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary course vnto that which God had ordained. But good God, thou diddest by inspiration put it into <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephs</hi> heart to chuse the stable, because thou wouldest publish vnto the world, that thou doest not despise the soule of any man, that so, all pretext and shadow of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse might be taken away from those that would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise obiect, I am too poore, I am not fitt to lodge my God: for the soule of a poore man is as acceptable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him as is the soule of a King, if it stand established in
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:7439:138"/>
the grace of God. The place where God was borne, is no more a stable, it is a Palace, and a Church, and many account it a great happinesse to behold it: so thy soule shall no longer remaine a stable, but shall become a Temple and a Palace when God shal take vp his lodge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the same. Prophane not therefore this stable with mortall sinne, but rather sanctifie it, and make it more venerable then this <hi>Baume,</hi> into which no man may enter but bare-footed.</p>
                     <p>Bid sinne and Satan, when they labour to thrust themselues into that place, to depart from thence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a stable reserued onely for God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to come and take his repose therein. Then will your God come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you as a little childe, wrap him vp charily in his swathling bands, make much of him, cherish him, and handle him with gentlenes and deuotion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mary</hi> brought him forth into the world, yet did she not dare once to touch him, much lesse would you be so hardy to handle him if you were acquainted with him: but feare without loue is fruitles and vnprofitable, and if loue should not surmount feare, what man is hee that would haue the boldnesse to appeare before him? Thou that art his Church, how vngratefull a Spouse shouldest thou be, if thou diddest not make acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of thy husbands benefits towards thee. Art thou ignorant what the Lord said to <hi>Peter?</hi> Feede my sheepe, for you that are Preists could not be true Shepheards, vnlesse you were carefull to feede and giue sustentation vnto your flocke. I doe not speake this, as if I would haue you conuey them into some fat pastu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of this world, but my meaning is, that you should communicate the Doctrine of their God vnto them.</p>
                     <p>It is true <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangelist, that thou wert priuy to many mysteries, and hast not buried thy Talent nor fed vpon these royall viands alone, but thy resolution euer was, to make distribution of the same to others: and dare you, proud and haughty wretches, conceaue that

These are not worthy to heare the word of God, and deserue to be shut vp in the dungeon of Hell, because they will not harken vnto Gods word, whereby they may be nursed vp to saluation.</p>

                     <p>At dinner also <hi>Verrine</hi> spake of sundry subiects, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding much to edification: and amongst the rest he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed, that the soules in blisse did more thirst after the saluation of our soules, and the enioying of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with them in Paradise, then Hell and all the Diuels together could after their ouer-throw and perdition; for the power and efficacy of the Saints in Heauen, farre

He further said, When you sit downe to eate, imagine that those blessings which are set before you doe point out vnto you three things, <hi>Accipe, Redde, Time. Accipe,</hi> take thy refection; <hi>Redde,</hi> giue thanks vnto God; and <hi>Time,</hi> beware how thou bee found vngratefull for such manifold blessings.</p>
                     <p>In the meane space some or other had giuen part of a honny-combe to these two women, which they had found lying on the ground, and was blowne downe from a tree by the winde.

At that time was <hi>Magdalene</hi> lulled, and as it were, benummed with a heauy slumber, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the Diuell, and indured all the time that Masse was saying, and the Masse once ended shee retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againe to her accustomed temper.</p>
                     <p>The same day, and houre aforesaid, the Dominican Father did exorcise <hi>Louyse</hi> and <hi>Magdalene</hi>; and then <note n="b" place="margin">Spirits doe goe and come with incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble celerity.</note> 
                        <hi>Verrine</hi> began to speake in this manner. Hee that will come to the knowledge of his God, must looke for him vpon the earth, and make inquiry after the litle childe which lieth in the stable: as hee is your Iudge, you must looke vp to Heauen, and tremble at his Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but as hee is a litle childe, you must intertaine him
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:7439:140"/>
in your affections. According to his Humanity he is but litle, but according to his Diuinity hee is a great God, and worthy to be praised. Euery one may (if hee will) dedicate his seruice vnto this litle childe, neither can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excuse himselfe from the same, for there is no man but hath an Oxe and an Asse; the Asse signifieth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the Oxe the soule; for the soule resembleth the Oxe, that easily knoweth his masters cribb. This Oxe and this Asse must vngrudgingly beare the yoak that their master laieth on them, that is to say, all mortifications, afflictions and troubles, and whatsoeuer else hapeneth vnto a man by the will of God, all which may bee said to be the yoake of the Lord. This yoake is sweete, and this burthen light to all those that doe perfectly loue him: you must not therefore say, I am not able to beare it, for God commandeth nothing that is impossible. It is a truth, that hee indeed was loaden with a yoake that was very combersome, and with a burthen exceedingly heauy, for his Crosse did ouerlay him with an intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable pressure; yet did hee not call vnto you, behold my Crosse, carry you it as I haue done: No, hee saith not so, because hee knoweth your debilitie will easily sinke vnder the same; but hee saith, carry my yoake, because the burthen thereof is very portable, to those that loue God and serue him as they ought. God hath his troopes of Angels and Saints about him, neither is it to bee wondred that Angels obey him, and that men put his will in execution, but that Deuils, who are already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the Gallies of Hell should yeeld him their obedience, heere is it that doth amaze vs with astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and admiration. Great God, why doest thou not cause these things to be deliuered by some Seraphin, or some learned Preacher, and not to bee divulged by the mouth of this silly woman? Or why should I bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to disclose my name, in an action that is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preiudiciall vnto Hell, and to my great griefe, that am forced to pronounce it? Then he said, many beleeue
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:7439:141"/>
not this; but I answere them, they haue not seene God nor Paradise, and yet they beleeue both the one and the other. Certainly <hi>Thomas</hi> thy God (vnto whom it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that hee should tell a lie) hath said, that hee would rise the third day: and what? did hee not rise the third day? Certainly hee did, but because thou diddest not see it, thou wouldest not beleeue it, but diddest say, I will not beleeue it, except I may touch the prints of the nayles. There is none among you that euer saw him die in person, yet doe you beleeue that he suffered death for you. Know you not what God said to <hi>Thomas,</hi> bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are they that shall not see these things that thou seest, and shall beleeue. There is no neede of faith in those things which wee manifestly and plainly see: as if I should tell you that this Priest is standing at the Altar, I imagine you would beleeue mee, neither should this faith of yours containe any great matter of merite, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you see this together with mee. All the fruitlesse sciences and speculations of <hi>Cicero, Plato,</hi> and the other Heathen Philosophers, to what purpose serue they, but to trauell and consume the spirits of a man by imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary contemplations? These waters cannot appease the thirstinesse of the soule, and by consequence are not powerfull to yeeld due and conuenient refreshments: but the smallest delights of a spirit indued with vertue, doth surpasse all worldly delectations: and cursed may they bee, who for the fruition of momentary pleasures heere, hazard the losse of that eternall felicity. Your God is a cunning Surgeon, and of the choisest esteeme amongst those that are most famous: hee well knowes when to serch the wound, and forecasteth how it may be healed: and apprehending the meanes, he presently commeth furnished with such salues and medicaments, as hee conceiueth most proper for the cure. God is Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto two daughters, Mercy and Iustice; but mercy obtained the right of eldership in the house of God, and you know those that are the elder haue a kinde of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:7439:141"/>
prerogatiue ouer the other. Mercy is sister vnto Christ Iesus, and shee it was that said vnto him, that it was fit that he should suffer al those torturings and contempts, which afterward he subiected himselfe vnto in his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. And although both these sisters proceeded from the same father and mother, yet is it a certainty, that the one is in more grace and neerenesse then the other. For God the Father was more indulgent vnto mercy then iustice, yet are they sisters, and both daughters vnto him; because he is no lesse iust in exercising his iustice, then he is gracious in declaring his mercy. It is no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of imperfection in God, that he powreth down the viols of his wrath vpon the wicked, and rewardeth the good endeauours of the iust, it is rather a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of his omnipotency, to render vnto euery man according to his workes.</p>
                     <p>Of a truth thy inward parts (O mother of God) are as the shop of an Apothecary full of fragrant and aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall odours, which the holy Ghost hath furnished with all varieties of perfumes and spices; that is to say, with his fruits, and with the adundance of vertues and graces. I further say that <hi>Mary</hi> is an inclosed garden, and the holy Ghost is the gardener, who could well tell how to manure this blessed plot of earth, sowing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all kinds of beautifull flowers, and ingraffing goodly and vernant trees, charged with excellent flowers and fruits. Thou (<hi>Mary</hi>) art also a tree, thy holy cogitations are the leaues, thy seruent desires are the flowers, and thy little Iesus is the fruit that was brought forth for your saluation. The nature of this fruit is admirable, so that it was accounted worthy to bee made a Present for the eternall Father, on the tree of the Crosse, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of your sinnes. Let your memory recall into your remembrance these blessings of your God, and let <hi>Ioseph</hi> who signifieth your vnderstanding, bow his knees in a corner of the stable, and take in so high a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery with his most attentiue contemplation. <hi>Mary</hi> as
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:7439:142"/>
hauing a greater portion of light, is of more neerenesse, and figureth vnto vs the will: the vnderstanding labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to comprehend him, but the will shunneth such wild conceptions, and demeaneth it selfe like vnto the mother of Christ Iesus, who dared not at the first to touch him, but at length <hi>Mary</hi> who is the will, taketh him in her armes, and beareth him vp and downe; for loue at the last ouercommeth feare. Take therefore the Child Iesus, play with him, and wrap him charily in his swathling bands, hee is but a little one, and therefore very tractable; endeauour then to bee diligent about him, bring with you little bands to roule him in; and to be breefe, prouide your selues of whatsoeuer may bee needfull for him. Hee is a little child, and yet a great God, as it is written, Vnto you a child is borne, and vnto you a sonne is giuen. Hee is young and tender, his hands are swathled vp, so that hee cannot strike, come therefore and draw neere vnto him; but withall consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that he is also a seuere Iudge to those that refuse to obey his will. If <hi>Abraham</hi> should haue reasoned the case with God, when hee commanded him to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice his well-beloued sonne <hi>Isaac,</hi> and should haue said, how or in what manner is this possible to bee done? I tell you, he had not merited to bee the father of the faithfull. Bee you humbled therefore before this God, and beleeue that he is yonder in the blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for his body is a glorified body, and taketh vp no place.</p>
                     <p>I say further, that it, is not enough to haue this child Iesus wrapped vp and swathed in his clours, but you must warme him with the milde heate of perfect deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is a permanent and standing seruency of the blessed spirit.</p>
                     <p>He also spake many other things; to wit, that those that were most humble are most high in Paradise, as Christ Iesus and <hi>Mary</hi> doe well exemplifie vnto vs, that loue allayeth and extenuateth labour, for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:7439:142"/>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">As a man that being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately set and bent on a thing, will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked asunder in peeces, then be beaten off the same.</note> failing in the point of loue, are more grieued and extremely cruciated in saying an <hi>Aue Maria,</hi> then in suffering the torments of ten thousand yeeres in hell. It standeth also with reason (said hee) that if Princes bee forced vnto obedience, the inferiour seruants doe not stand out in defiance. Hee further said, that if a man could but see the soule that standeth in the state of grace, and haue a full view of the totall beauty thereof, he would sinke downe and die for ioy and admiration, thinking that he beheld the glorious Deity: but this is a request not fit to be demanded. If thy body complaine of thy hard vsage, say vnto thy soule, Soule, thou must not groane and sinke vnder this burthen, take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of thy owne worth, how thou art created to sway and haue dominion: be thankfull therefore vnto him that hath framed thee, God is not like vnto men, for a man doth many times omit to doe a good turne to him that hath deserued it from him, and is ingratefull for those benefits which hee hath receiued: but your God foresaw the ingratitude of men, and heard with his eares their sinnes that cried loud for vengeance, yet for all this his resolution was firme to giue his Sonne vnto you. Your Redeemer was borne at midnight, receiue him in to you: your body is the stable, your soule the cratch to entertaine him: and although hee bee a King, yet doth hee not disdaine so meane a place as a stable: There is no man therefore that can excuse himselfe. You are to warme this little child, and doe not say, I haue no fier to warme him by, for the holy Ghost is a burning furnace, and will let you haue fier enough if you will but lend him fuell, that is to say, your sinnes, whom hee will cast and consume in the neuer-dying flames of his loue. After all these and many other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses in a great rage and violent agitation, hee made this abiuration as followeth.</p>
                     <p>I <hi>Verrine</hi> in the name of all Magicians of both sexes, forcerers, and forceresses doe renounce and disclaime
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:7439:143"/>
all the abiurations which they haue made against the power of the Father, the wisedome of the Sonne, and the goodnesse of the holy Ghost: I do further renounce all the abiurations by which they haue disclaimed and forsaken the blessed Virgin, all the Angels, and all the Saints in Paradise. I also renounce all their abominable impieties through which they haue made choice of hell for their eternall habitation, and haue told God that they did not regard his inspirations and graces, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired an euerlasting sequestration from him and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. Then in the name and right of all Hell hee cried, I disclaime all donations and schedules which they haue made vnto the Diuell. Afterwards he said, Beleeue me, God is so powerfull, that hee is able to cause the Diuels to bring together in this Church the bodies of all Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers and witches, that they may heare their sentence and iudgement pronounced against them. I speake in generall, not in particular. Then <note n="d" place="margin">Why a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in this worke, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible and slauish caitise.</note> he added, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God would not vse the ministerie of an Angell, because if hee should come inuisibly, men would say that hee was a Diuell: but if hee should appeare in the forme of a man, they would say, This is but a man, and would not regard his message. God herein resembleth a King, who hauing many Princes, subiects and seruants waiting on him, taketh one of a more ordinary and cheape condition, to bee employed in his ambassage: and this hee doth, not so much to honour this seruant of his, but rather to manifest and magnifie his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; for he needeth not the countenance or authority of his Ambassadour, because all the power and splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour where withall hee goeth is deriued vnto him from the King. So God would not chuse any Prince or great subiect of his Court, but was pleased to serue his turne with the most sordide and base slaues hee could thinke vpon, who are the Diuels, not thereby to honour them with the same of his employments, but to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish the more his greatnesse and absolute command, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:7439:143"/>
to the world. For God compelleth the diuell to bee the instrument of effecting his will, and giueth him au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to bring that to passe, which hee shall adiudge fit, to his greater glory, and to the vtter confusion of all hell. Hence it ariseth, that God is pleased to make experience of a new remedy, for the conuersion of soules, and for the more ample expression of his bounty. When <hi>Verrine</hi> bad done, <hi>Gresill</hi> his companion made the like abiuration, as afore-said, &amp; that was also made by the mouth of <hi>Louyse</hi> whom he possessed. After him the third Diuell, that was in the same body, and was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Sonneillon,</hi> made his renunciation like vnto the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and added, that when the Magicians and witches were there present, they were mightily dismayed to see and heare these things: and that this would turne either to their greater condemnation, or else to their conuersion, if they would apply their wills thereunto.</p>
                     <p>Then did they all three confirme that which they had auowed by a solemne oath, and added, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or other they were to discourse of, at the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of euery Masse.</p>
                     <p>At the morning Masse, the Dominican father began to exorcise, and <hi>Verrine</hi> spake in this manner,</p>
                     <p>Man is the head and chiefe of his family; it is a thing vnsightly and full of indecency, that the gouernment should bee put into the hands of a woman, for women are to bee subiect vnto their husbands. It therefore is proper vnto the head to gouerne, and vnto the master to command: the soule is the head, the body but the woman: the soule is the mistrisse, and the body but the chambermaid: yet doth the body euer grudge and grumble against the soule, saying, Why doe we disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et our selues with this early rising? we should now take our repose, and make vse of the creatures for our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and contentments, while wee haue time to doe it; and in the declination and setting of our age wee may haue leisure enough to thinke of our conuersion. If the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:7439:144"/>
mistrisse bee discreet and well aduised, shee will keepe this chambermaid no longer, that taketh thus vpon her to prescribe and giue directions, but will turne her out of her house. Thus ought the soule to demeane it selfe towards the body, when it complaineth, and ought to say, <hi>Flesh,</hi> thou art but the chambermaid, and not the mistrisse; it is thy duty to serue, not to command. I tell thee, if thou wilt eate hereafter with me of those choice and rare delicacies, whose plenty knoweth no satiety, thou must not now grudge and repine at labour. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou not, that it will bee said vnto me, Soule, render me an account of what thou hast done, thou wert' the mistrisse, and shouldest therefore manage thy gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with discretion. A man that chanceth vpon a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber discreet wife, is in reason to intrust her, and not his seruant with the domesticke and home-businesses of his family: but thou hast done cleane contrary. You that are men are iust of the same humour and say. Wee are tender and of a delicate composition, and must a little cherish and make much of our selues. Others will say, let vs bee frolicke, I can liue without working; I haue many goodly possessions; I am noble in my blood, and am descended from such a race: I am able to keepe thus many horses; maintaine thus many gentlemen in my attendance, and bee waited on with thus many Pages and Lackeies. Another will complaine of his old age, and how vnable hee is to vndergoe the burthen of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance at those yeeres. For this cause do those families perish and lie buried in their ruines, where this cursed chambermaid beareth sway. Do not you resemble those that as the Prouerbe noted of them, are facete and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant abroad, but sullen in their owne houses. Then <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> speaking to the assembly said, you promise Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise vnto your selues; but thinke you not to attaine vnto it without much sufferance and aduersities in this world; for <hi>the seruant</hi> is not greater then his master: And if God was first to suffer, and then to haue admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:7439:144"/>
into glory, would you expect to enter into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen on horse-backe, or in your Caroach? I tell you nay; but you are to come thither on foot, and to bee besides loden with store of good workes: otherwise it will be told you, <hi>I know you not,</hi> you cannot come in, for <hi>I and my children are in bed.</hi> Whereby you are not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that these beds are beds of doune and delicacy, as some lazy persons might apprehend it; No, these words shall be spoken to the stuborne and obstinate sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that hateth to be conuerted. If you will bee saued, you must not abandon your selues vp to wantonnesse, which doth emasculate and weaken all vertuous desires in you. You all stand charged with the heauie burthen of your sinnes, prostrate your selues before this little childe, which lieth in the manger, and come vnto him with the full burthen of your transgressions, that hee may vnload you. If you say vnto mee, you haue no sinne; I must tell you, that it is false, for all men are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Sinne is like vnto wood, pile it vp and lay it on a heape, that when the holy Ghost commeth, hee may set fire to the same, I meane the fire of his loue, which searcheth still for stubble, and other such combustible matter, that it may consume and burne it. What man can heere excuse himselfe? hath not euery one a staffe in his hand, whereon to leane and support himselfe, which is the will? whatsoeuer you haue besides, you owe vnto God, but this will is your owne, since God hath made it ouer vnto you; and therefore take this staffe vnto you: For God is the shepheard and you are the sheepe of his pasture, whom if the woolfe come to rauin vpon and to deuoure, hee will take the staffe of your will, and will swinge him so soundly, that hee shall neuer returne for his prey, but to his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.</p>
                     <p>Then did <hi>Verrine</hi> inuite all the creatures of Heauen, all the Quires of Angels, all Saints, especially the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed mother of God, as also the whole Church trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:7439:145"/>
and militant, to praise God for the repentance of sinners, especially of those that were obstinate, as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians and Witches, Sorcerers and Sorceresses, in these words. <hi>Verrine</hi> in the name of al Magicians &amp; Witches, Sorcerers and Sorceresses, and by the appointment of that Soueraigne God saith, O yee foure elements praise yee the Lord, all creatures reasonable and vnreasonable praise the Lord, whatsoeuer hath grouth or motion laud the name of God: Earth, Sea, Aire and Fire, trees and starres praise ye all the Lord, &amp;c. I tell you, that if all the creatures of the world could make their eies gush foorth with teares of bloud, they would bewayle as much as in them lyeth the impieties of Magicians and Witches, so abominable are their courses before God. All these things were pronounced by him whilest the Priest held the blessed Sacrament in his hands to giue the Communion to <hi>Louyse</hi> and <hi>Magdalene.</hi> After this he renounced those abiurations of Magicians and Witches, Sorcerers and Sorceresses, as he had formerly done at midnight Masse. <hi>Gresill</hi> and <hi>Sonneillon</hi> did also the same three seuerall times, once when the Crede was said in the Masse, another time at the eleuation, and the third time at the Communion. In like manner these three Diuels confirmed by oath all that was aboue mentioned, in the same manner as at the midnight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The same day the Dominican Father wrote a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to father <hi>Michaelis</hi> in answere vnto one of his, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the 13. of this moneth, wherein hee intreateth him to come to S. <hi>Baume.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The same day <hi>Verrine</hi> said vnto the Dominican Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, command mee in the Name of God, and by the authority of the Church triumphant and militant to goe foorth about an imployment which God hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed vpon mee: then hee called father <hi>Romillon</hi> and father <hi>Andrew Godan</hi> of the Order of S. <hi>Dominick</hi> to be witnesses hereunto and then departed.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, there happened a very memorable acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:7439:145"/>
on the same day, for <hi>Belzebub</hi> began to speake in this strange manner as followeth. <hi>Verrine</hi> not long agoe cryed out that all Hell was constrained by God to renounce whatsoeuer the Magicians and Witches had proiected; and I <note n="e" place="margin">
                           <hi>Belzebub</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to make an abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> 
                        <hi>Belzebub</hi> cheefe of the Diuels that are in the body of <hi>Magdalene,</hi> am compelled by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to make the like abiuration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in effect, contrary to my resolution, and the greatnesse of my pride. <note n="f" place="margin">Before the tribunall of God all things are so exactly waighed in al the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances that the Diuels haue nothing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply against it.</note> Yes, yes, yes, in despight of my selfe, and against my custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary pride and rebellion in the name of all my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, I renounce. I renounce, I renounce, I say, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer I haue suggested vnto <hi>Magdalene,</hi> as well for the time past as for thetime to come, both against her God and conscience: Yes, yes, yes, I reuoke it all, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne and disclaime it now at this very instant.</p>
                     <p>The same day at high Masse were the two women that were possessed exorcised by the Dominican father, and <hi>Verrine</hi> began to speake in this manner. Thou God of power, cause now an Angell to descend from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, vpon this Altar that these men may beleeue. what meanest thou to doe? Wilt thou vse the ministry of a Diuell in a businesse of this importance? Thou hast here Doctors able and ready to say the same that I say, men will euer bee saying that <hi>Louyse</hi> is not possessed, cursed be her folly, I could endure Hell better then her.</p>
                     <p>Then <note n="g" place="margin">The tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vsuall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> the said <hi>Verrine</hi> began to scoffe at <hi>Belzebub</hi> and his Princes in this manner, What <hi>Belzebub,</hi> art thou the master of Pride, and doest thou now slinke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in this sort? Thou art he that doest suggest vnto the Nobility: What sir? will you yeeld to him, you are noble and of an ancient stock, why will you abase your selfe before a fellow of such cheapenesse? You must not doe it, it doth detract from your nobility. Miserable <hi>Belzebub,</hi> was it not thou that wouldest haue throwne God from his seate of Maiesty? How art thou now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based, hauing nothing to reply, and being swallowed vp in shame and confusion. And thou <hi>Leuiathan</hi> the

Arch-Doctor of <note n="h" place="margin">The tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vsuall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</note> Hereticks, art thou not hee that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowest vpon them the apparance and shew of light? But thy light is nothing else but darknesse, for no man can giue that which hee hath not. Thou bringest an itch vpon the curious, to dispute of this place, and of that place of Scripture, because it is not interpreted as it ought to bee; and seing them to bee proud beyond measure, thou diddest by this course hinder them from humbling themselues. I tell thee that the proud and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious shall not enter into Paradise vnlesse they become humble and lay aside their curiosity. What answerest thou vnto this, thou art a iolly doctor, and very preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in replyes; but I see thou hast litle to say for thy selfe and giuest sufficient proofe of thy insufficiency. There bee heere very able men that would gladly heare thee argue, but it appeareth that thou art confounded as much as thy companion.</p>

Thou doest also suggest vnto them; what sir? doe you not meane to defend your reputation? Can you endure such an affront? Remember such and such speaches, and how he thus and thus belyed you: hee is a base fellow, and in an vnder-ranke vnto you; I tel you you must reuenge yourselfe vpon him, and call him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to single combate. Thus though they be forbidden by God, excommunicated by the Church, and prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Kings Edicts, yet are they transported be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their temper and reason, and doe desire nothing but to come to blowes: neither lyeth it in the power of man to giue preuention vnto these mischances.</p>

                     <p>I affirme that God is able to take away the stone from the heart of an vnrepenting sinner: but hee must confesse himselfe &amp; receiue absolution from the Priest, according vnto that authority which God hath giuen vnto his Church: and in this manner is the dead raised vp to life.</p>

                     <p>Then <hi>Verrine</hi> said, I <hi>Verrine</hi> doe renounce, &amp;c. as is before mentioned at midnight Masse.

Then he said, <hi>Belzebub,</hi> thou tormentest <hi>Magdalene,</hi> yet let it not trouble thee <hi>Magdalene,</hi> for it is now our custome to doe thus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause wee were guided neither by reason nor counsell.

Wretched sinner if thy body say vnto thee take and eate there is no offence in it, thy soule as Mistrisse of the body must giue checke vnto it, and say, I will not venture vpon it, for God himselfe hath prohibited it: And if thou chance to be so sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, beware how thou follow the dangerous tract wherein <hi>Adam</hi> walked, but humble thy selfe without asking <hi>quare &amp; quomodo,</hi> but rather confesse thy selfe to be vnworthy to suffer euen the paines of hell for thy sinnes.

But let it suffice, that I doe sweare by the liuing God, that whatsoeuer I haue aboue spoken is most true, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let this satisfie you; which being spoken he accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly tooke his oath. <note n="i" place="margin">This oath containeth foure remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able points and obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> Hee further said, I will also sweare that the Church will approue of all this, and that neuer Diuell spake in the presence of his Princes as I haue done: hence it is that I shall <note n="k" place="margin">See the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy vnto the doubts, the 10. obiect, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet the Epistle to the Reader.</note> receiue an abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and mitigation of my torments.

                     <p>He further said, consider heere the goodnesse of your God, whose manner is to set first before you those things that are worst: for you know that hither-vnto, the viands which were serued in vnto you, haue not been very pleasing, because wee did nothing but inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate your offences.

                     <p>The riches of this world are but trash and of-scow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in comparison of Paradise. You will heere obiect: What, is there silthinesse in Paradise? I say vnto you, that there is not, for no vncleane or imperfect thing can enter into heauen, but I call riches trash, because the Elect make no account of them, and the blessed Saints doe not esteeme of siluer, gold, precious stones, and all the riches of the world.</p>
                     <p>The seruant is not greater then his master: the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster entred not into heauen on horsebacke, but naked, and hanging vpon the tree of the Crosse.

And this standeth with reason; for if a King to grace his Queene will make expression of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he beareth towards her by new gifts and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments,

how much more shall God being more great and good then the Kings of the earth haue both ability and will to enrich his Church with new immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and endowments. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangelist, thou art an Eagle and hast soared higher vpon the wings of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine wisedome then any other: and although many my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries haue been reuealed vnto thee, yet diddest thou not vnderstand all of them, for the Armory of God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrutable and full of hidden perfections, and hee may from thence, when it seemeth good vnto him, bring forth many strange nouelties.

                     <p>After dinner, <hi>Sonneillon</hi> vttered many things tending to edification, that Vertue was ascended vp to heauen, and in her ascent had let her <note n="q" place="margin">The mantle of impiety.</note> mantle fall, which, Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that remained vpon the earth, tooke vp and clothed it selfe therewithall: vnder which couerture and maske it commeth abroad to deceiue men, who otherwise would decline the rock of such seducements.

                     <p>The way of life vnto death is a broad and beaten way, but the way to returne from sinne to grace is full of mistakes and windings. It is not Gods manner to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the seruice of those that are drenched in mortall sinne, when hee would bring about some important worke for the aduantage and good of his Church: as also the Diuell doth not effect any great matter for the aduancement and augmentation of the kingdome of

Hell when he vseth the ministry of one that is setled in the grace of God. For there is a sympathie and consent betwixt God and his creature, whom hee employeth in his businesse.</p>
                     <p>God being omnipotent can easily out of vnfruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, nay out of a straw worke plenty of wonders, yet is it requisite, that this straw do not let or giue hinderance thereunto: for the reasonable creature hath free will gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him by God, that by doing well he may merit, as by stooping to that which is nought, hee may be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</p>

It consisteth in this, to possesse no other thing but God and him alone, for there are many poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the estimation of the world, who are rich enough in their ambition, and yet are there many Kings, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Noble personages, who are owners of nothing but of God and themselues: For riches are amongst in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things, neither hurt they those that make good vse and appliance of them, according vnto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, <note n="z" place="margin">Consolation vnto the poore</note> Then <hi>Verrine</hi> turned to the poore that were there, and said, There is not one amongst you, but is better accommodated for his necessities, then was the Sonne of God when he lay in the manger, you should therefore say vnto him, when hee profereth his kingdome vnto you. Good God, I am not capable of such a blisse, and still you are to acknowledge your owne infirmitie: you must also descend downe as it were to hell, which you are to doe either in this life, or after you are dead: when therefore you are afflicted with aduersities say vnto him, I am ready to suffer with my Redeemer, for I haue deserued much more, yet doth he compassion my tottering and distracted estate, and cheereth me vp with the beames of his mercy. I assure you, that both I &amp; you haue to do with a seuere Iudge, therefore humble your selues and you shall enter into the kingdome of heauen. Grudge not that God hath made such an one rich and thee poore, or that hee hath endowed such with wisedome, and hath left vnto thee nothing but foolishnesse. For hee created the Angels and marshalled them in their orders, there are the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins, The Cherubins, and the Thrones, &amp;c. euery one in their seuerall ranke and station, and although there bee such variety and diuersity amongst them, yet you cannot say that they are subiect to confusion. If you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and leuell your actions by an vpright intention,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:7439:162"/>
that is to say, if you square all your doings by the rule of Gods glory, the saluation of your soule, and good of your neighbour, Satan will easily flee from you. Let your soule be furnished with three things, with vpright intention in your memory, with pure affection in your will, and with sincerity of conscience in your vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. The memory by calling to remembrance some wicked thing, offendeth not God; the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by considering thereof, incurreth no mortal sinne; but when the will interposeth it selfe, then is there a consummation of the sinne.</p>

downe vpon the same, ascending and descending til the day of doome shall aproach: all which I would esteeme as easie as to tread on flowers and Roses, and should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thereof as of a high and singular fauour.

Then he said, will you not suffer mee to talke, who am an instrument in the discouery of these witches? And <hi>Belzebub</hi> being asked what they were that were lately come thither, and from whence they came, he answered I am bound to silence. Whereunto <hi>Verrine</hi> said, do not wonder that he speaketh not, it is by reason of your vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe; would you haue God come downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and leade you vp and downe by the hand. You haue the Prince of Magicke in your hands, will not this satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie you? But you are so blind you will beleeue nothing. then he cried with a loud voice, Magicians &amp; witches, God confound the whole rout of you: what seeke you heere in this Church? this is not a place for your cursed Synagogue: but I see your <note n="e" place="margin">The superiour Diuels doe tye and binde vp those that are inferiour and in subordinati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on vnto them, as amongst men the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger bindeth him that is weaker, and maketh him to hold his peace.

Then hee tooke his oath that the Diuels in <hi>Magdalene</hi> were bound, and could not speake, and that hee was free from the same, and therefore (said hee) you ought to listen vnto mee who am of a contrary faction vnto them. Vpon this hee was bid to discouer the ambushments of the Diuell: whereunto <hi>Verrine</hi> said, since you will needs haue mee to expresse and explaine vnto you what I formerly had said, listen vnto me. It is the pleasure of God, that all men know what I haue said this morning, and not the confessors of <hi>Louyse</hi> onely: for God will now make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of his exceeding bounty. The truth is <hi>Magdalene</hi> is not throughly conuerted, but is perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally vexed with the Incubi, who commit a thousand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:7439:174"/>
with her. It is true <note n="f" place="margin">We were yet in indifferen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy, and were at that time making inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry after these things.</note> 
                        <hi>Michaelis</hi> that God will bee offended with thee, vnlesse thou take some order that this be redressed: and doe not thinke that I speake it for her behoofe, or for the sake of her heere, whom I now possesse: for if shee bee not possessed, why doe you exorcise her, were it not better to send her backe into the kitchen? She would be contented with such a place, as she was formerly before she came hither. What think you, why doth not <hi>Magdalene</hi> harken now vnto mee: The reason is, because I speake the truth and shee is not yet throughly conuerted: shee obeyeth not her supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, and confesseth her sins with nicenesse and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation like a Player. <hi>Magdalene</hi> you must not confesse them so, but you are to reueale them vnto the Priest with much penitency and compunction. Then <hi>Verrine</hi> was commanded to speake lower; for he cried as loud as possibly the forces of a woman could giue assistance thereunto. Vnto which <hi>Verrine</hi> answered, when I speak low you despise mee, and when I talke aloude you put me to silence. <hi>Sodome,</hi> neuer were such abominations spoken by thee; nor in the time of the flood did there euer happen so strange a fact as this is, yet were they drowned in the waters, and burned with the fire.

Afterward when some or other had told him that hee was to obey the Church as the spouse of God, hee answered that this spouse also was to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble her selfe before her husband.

But we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to doubt no longer of him when he once prayed for his enemies, after they had at my instigation (said <hi>Belzebub</hi>) so blasphemously reuiled him, whom also I animated, to cast him downe headlong vpon the stones as a blasphemer.

They fastned the Crosse with cords, and in setting it vp in the hole which was forced into the rocke, by the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and shogging of the same they opened againe all his wounds, he was nayled with<note n="l" place="margin">Some Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors are of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that he was fastned with foure nailes.</note> three long nayles, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing one foote nayled ouer the other to augment the greatnes of his torment: and in crucifying him they turned the Crosse and his face towards the earth, to fitt and fasten the nayles on the other side. This Crosse (said he) was very high, of the height of the Crosse
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:7439:182"/>
which you haue below at the comming in vnto Saint <hi>Baume,</hi> if you adde the height of a foote thereunto, and was two foote broader then that. The forme of this Crosse was not made in the manner of a [T] but it had a beame of wood aboue, and the Iewes turning the Crosse downe on the other end did hoise vp his leggs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue his belly.</p>
                     <p>Of a truth (said he) your God hath suffered more for you then you imagine. After hee was dead, hee visited the fathers in Lymbo, and all hell trembled at his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> were the first that presented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnto him, who came with great contrition, and hartely prayed him to pardon their sinnes that had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned those manifold torments which he suffered. He deliuered, like a great King, all the soules aswell of those that were in Lymbo, as of those that were in<note n="m" place="margin">Some schoole-men do hold, that he did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer all the soules that were in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, but all those that were in Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo, otherwise called <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> bosome.</note> Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, but the bodies which he had raised did vpon this deliuerance dye againe. When <hi>Belzebub</hi> had said this, vpon the sudden hee blew out the candle which stood on the table, whereat we were somewhat aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, for it was night: and crying with a loude voice, he said, <hi>Lodouice veni, veni,</hi> for the Magician was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed come, as <hi>Magdalene</hi> who sawe him when he came, recited vnto vs. And <hi>Belzebub</hi> said to <hi>Magdalene,</hi> thou hast not seene him since he hid himselfe behind the bed, when thou wouldest haue done him some outrage, but he went away as he entred in, and was carried from hence through the chimney.</p>
                     <p>After this we went to the Church to say Matines as our maner is, which being ended, father <hi>Romillon</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised vs that <hi>Belzebub</hi> played strange horse-play in the chamber, and would not suffer <hi>Magdalene</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse her selfe, nor to kneele vpon the Earth.

there all night long, then suffer her to bee confessed. Yet at the presence of the blessed Sacrament which was shewed vnto him, and by the holinesse of the place, hee was so dispirited and his forces so farre spent, that shee confessed her selfe in that very place to father <hi>Michaelis</hi> with great contrition and deuotion to the singular comfort of her soule: and performed diuers actions of humility and submission to all those that were there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, especially to father <hi>Romillon</hi> whom shee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in her chamber, and so remained reposedly, and in good quiet that night till about an hower after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night: at which time <hi>Lewes</hi> the Magician came againe vnto her as she afterward auowed, and cast a caracter vpon her head to trouble her imagination, memory, and other faculties of her soule, that they might stand her in no steed against him in the accusations of the crimes wherewith he was burthened.</p>

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:7439:183"/>

                     <p>After this <hi>Verrine</hi> speaking by the mouth of <hi>Louyse,</hi> said: the last Euening, when at the time of Exorcismes you heard a great cry aboue<note n="o" place="margin">Great cries heard on the top of the Church.</note> vpon the Church, it was a great number of Magicians that came thither; some because they beleeued not that <hi>Magdalene</hi> was conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, others to listen what was said, others to spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad their charmes and so to deceiue her, others to see a thing so worthy of admiration, that <hi>Verrine</hi> an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Deuill should braue <hi>Belzebub</hi> who was his superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. Then <hi>Verrine</hi> began to barke like a hunting dogg, saying: that the Wolues were come againe, thereby meaning the Magicians whom hee saw carried thither by the Deuils.</p>
                     <p>Then said <hi>Verrine,</hi> The world is turned vpside downe, for the Deuils do now labour to preserue men, and to pleade for them as their Aduocates and Proctors: so that it is now no wonder, if God, the Angels, and the Saints do succour and giue assistance vnto them: And added, that this was like the time of Antichrist, when Nations should rise against Nations, so do now the Deuils bandy themselues, against Deuils.</p>
                     <p>Then he inueighed against Magicians &amp; reprehended them for their great folly to combine and oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues against God: Then he turned to <hi>Belzebub</hi> and said: I am not ignorant that thou <hi>Belzebub</hi> with thy companions haue determined to torment and beate me greeuously when I am once departed out of this body, but I regard it not as long as I do my duety, and for the time to come, let it hap as hap will.

                     <p>Then he said, there are at <hi>Marseille,</hi> and elsewhere, many persons of good ranke and place, that go to Masse, and do neuerthelesse traficke with the Deuill: yet if they will be conuerted, God is not desirous they should be punished or burnt, and doth therefore force the Deuils to carry them heere to S. <hi>Baume,</hi> that they might heere vnderstand our discourses: And then hee added.

                     <p>Whereupon <hi>Belzebub</hi> said (expressing a sensible ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture in euery part of the body, iust when it came to bee named, as stamping with the feete, when they were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and lifting vp the knees, when they were pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and so of the rest) There are charmes in euery part of her, he that wanteth any, let him come to <hi>Palud,</hi> for shee hath them in abundance.</p>
                     <p>At the same Exorcisme <hi>Verrine</hi> cryed, and tooke on very terribly, when the Exorcist set his hand on <hi>Louyses</hi> head, saying, take of this hand (which hee repeated di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers times) you should torture rebels, such as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub</hi> is, and not mee. And added, I onely am tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and not my two companions <hi>Gresill</hi> and <hi>Sonneillon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="319" facs="tcp:7439:184"/>Being exorcised, and adiured, to speake, why he was tormented, he said, that the last night he was exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly importuned by <hi>Lucifer,</hi> to take his part, which hee <note n="s" place="margin">Out of his commission we might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily conceaue him to bee a true Deuill, when hee was left to his owne nature; the iudgement of God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting this to happen, least otherwise men might mistake, and beleeue him to be no Deuil.</note> had promised to do. He had also tempted <hi>Louyse</hi> to pray no more for <hi>Magdalene,</hi> and had made her fall into a mortall sinne by procuring her consent; hee also had made <hi>Louyse</hi> to say, that one of the fathers was a proud fellow: and shee had deceiued her Confessour, with a confession which himselfe counterfeited, and was not made by <hi>Louyse</hi>: for all which delinquencies (said hee) <hi>Dominicke</hi> my aduersary hath procured from God, that I should receiue due chastisement.</p>
                     <p>Being commanded by Exorcismes to sweare as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouesaid, hee answered, with all my heart, I will take mine oath, for <hi>Dominicke</hi> hath also obtained this fauour from God. Then the Exorcist commanded him to put both his hands vpon the words of the consecration of the Chalice, and presented vnto him the Canon of the Masse in folio. <hi>Louyse</hi> who was altogether vnlearned, did neuerthelesse put both her hands vpon the said wordes. Then did the Exorcist command him againe to put them vpon the second prayer, which the Preist had said before the Communion, which he accordingly did, and withall added, what art thou yet satisfied? and so beginning his oath he said.</p>
                     <p>I sweare vnto thee by the power of the Father, by the wisedome of the Sonne, and by the goodnesse of the holy Ghost, according to the intention of the Church triumphant &amp; militant, and according to thy meaning, and the meaning of all these heere, without reseruation of any sinister intention whatsoeuer, that what I haue now said is true, to witt, &amp;c. repeating that which hee had before deliuered.</p>
                     <p>The same day at the Euening Exorcismes <hi>Belzebub</hi> did shake <hi>Magdalene,</hi> as hee was accustomed, alwaies drawing backe her head, when the Exorcist would make the signe of the Crosse; and snatching the booke
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:7439:185"/>
of Exorcismes out of the Exorcists hands, he threw it to the ground, and cryed, get you gone, and open the doore for <hi>Romillon,</hi> for he would come in; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they found to be true.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">They try the Deuils, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</note> Being asked, which of them two was the greater and of most authority, himselfe or <hi>Verrine,</hi> hee answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, It is a friuolous question, and sauoureth of nothing but of impertinency, and is not worth an answere.</p>
                     <p>When the Exorcist was naming all the parts of her body, as is already declared, mentioning the reines, the Deuill did strangely shake and stirre the same, saying: That the day before <hi>Blanche</hi> a Witche of <hi>Marseille,</hi> had laide a charme made of golde and siluer, and other ingredients, vpon <hi>Magdalen's</hi> reines, and had cast an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other through a trunke vpon her eyes, that vpon whomsoeuer <hi>Magdalene</hi> should looke, he should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to her to be the Magician <hi>Lewes.</hi>
                        <note n="u" place="margin">Charmes cast into the eyes of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene.</hi> Saint <hi>Clement</hi> in his recognitions reciteth the like of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who thought, that she had euer <hi>Simon Magus</hi> before her eyes.</note> And <hi>Magdalen</hi> being at her good times questioned vpon the same, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, that it was the greatest torment vnto her that could be, to haue that obiect and apparition of <hi>Lewes</hi> euer before her eyes, when any one came in her sight, although it were her Confessour, or the Priest at Masse. But this charme wrought not on her aboue 8. dayes, through the assistance of God and by the efficacy of her frequent receiuing of the Communion, which they ministred vnto her euery day: for this is the soueraigne remedy to scape, or to take away the force of charmes, as the Deuils themselues in the vertue of Exorcismes would not sticke to confesse: and did further affirme, that the Priests which did celebrate the Communion e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day, could not be charmed.</p>
                     <p>The same day <hi>Verrine</hi> said, <note n="x" place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the knowledge of God.</note> wee vnderstand and know God better then you, but in loue vnto him, I must confesse you do out-strippe vs; but if you knew God as well as wee, you would be fond of him.

                     <p>Being asked, whether hee had borne the name of <hi>Verrine</hi> from the beginning, he <note n="z" place="margin">From whence the names of Deuils haue their originall. <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, <hi>Ibi nomen, vbi pignus.</hi>
                        </note> answered that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils haue no names, for they know one another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well, but they then take a name vpon them, when they enter into a body; and it is for distinctions sake: they do also change their names as they please, when as they enter into other bodies. To conclude (said hee) I am a spirit of the aire, and therefore lesse malicious then those that are lower in hell: the most malicious of vs all is <hi>Lucifer,</hi> who although hee be <note n="a" place="margin">

                     <p>Being demanded, how <hi>Lucifer</hi> could vnderstand all the occurences of things if he bee thus chained vp, hee began to laugh, and said, you are deuoid of sense, and ordinary apprehension: doth not a King that abideth in his Palace, know whatsoeuer passeth in his kingdome, by meanes of Ambassadors, messengers, and Postes? So the Deuils go to hell, (for they are there very speedily) and take instructions from <hi>Lucifer,</hi> who is more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of greater command then them all.</p>

Vnto whom <hi>Verrine</hi> audibly made answere, that hee would not go; saying, that hee had sworne alleageance vnto God, and did not therefore feare the paines which they threatned him withall: that hee might go thither him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, if hee had any fancy thereunto: and that since hee would needs boast his greatnesse and command, hee should do well to try his forces. But as for mee, and my companions (said hee) God hath hired vs yesterday morning, as a man will hire a labouring man to dresse and trimme his Vineyard: so that thou commest to late to hire vs to thy seruice: thou wert lazy and diddest slip thy time, I do not meane to worke at thy request: for when I haue industriously wrought for thee, what reward canst thou giue me but the paines of hell? thou hast no other thing to bestow.

O what braue Princes you are, that do neither defend nor go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne your people any better!

                     <p>After Masse <hi>Belzebub,</hi> being departed from the body of <hi>Magdalene,</hi> as it seemed to go to <hi>Marseille</hi> for the

                           <hi>Verrine</hi> deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he is a preacher. See the 1. doubt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Epistle to the reader.</note> Thou lyest, I neuer said that I made sermons, or that I was a Preacher. Goe to thou cursed lyar, remember that I euer maintained, that I was sent from God to publish and disclose a truth, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maske thy knauery. Diddest not thou (said <hi>Belzebub</hi>) affirme that God hath promised Paradise vnto thee? Thou lyest (answered <hi>Verrine</hi>) I neuer said so, onely I did auow thus much, that God by <note n="c" place="margin">The absolute power of God.</note> his absolute and boundlesse power hath granted vnto me diminution of my torments. Then he said to <hi>Magdalene,</hi> be of good cheere, for God hath hyred thee and the three faculties of thy soule, to be imployed about his seruice. No (said <hi>Belzebub</hi>) shee is hyred by me. <hi>Verrine</hi> answered, thou lyest, and shalt not gaine that for which thou now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendest. And if it were not for feare of <hi>Michaelis,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of this place, I would lay open such a throate, as the whole frame of this house should tremble. Thou bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest <hi>Magdalene</hi> in hand that thou wilt cure her, I pray thee, take thou no thought for her health, for shee is sufficiently prouided of good Phisitians of her owne, let her (a Gods name) beleeue her Confessours.</p>
                     <p>It was obserued by some, that shee vsed a particular kinde of gesture and motion with the finger of her hand, on which shee did weare a ring of siluer; and thereupon <hi>Verrine</hi> said, Take <note n="d" place="margin">A charmed ring.</note> away that ring from her
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:7439:189"/>
for it is charmed: but when they endeauoured to pluck it from her finger, they were not able, by reason that her finger was swollen so big, that they were faine to cut it asunder with a paire of sizers. And we found that in the middest of the ring within side, there was engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the head of an Owle in a circle, and right opposite against it, there was engrauen the name of Iesus: which was cut in peeces and cast into the fire.</p>
                     <p>After dinner, it was thought fit, to take aduantage of the time, and to purge the soule of <hi>Magdalene,</hi> from those leprosies and pollutions, where-withall it was tainted, and by this meanes to delude <hi>Belzebub</hi> and his adherents. Whereupon the Friers together with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the doctrine came priuatly into <hi>Magdalens</hi> chamber, hauing in their company an ancient Matrone of S. <hi>Vrsula's</hi> order, called sister <hi>Catherine</hi> of France, and another that was an associate or coadiutor there. And as we exhorted her to name all the witches which she had formerly seene in their Synagogue, the Diuell spake vnto her, when shee was opening her mouth to reueale them vnto vs, and said, If thou offer to prate of this, I will strangle thee. Yet for all this, shee began to speake, where-upon <note n="e" place="margin">
                           <hi>Magdalens</hi> throte seased on by the Diuel.</note> the Diuell came vp about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a toade, and seazed her throate in so terrible a manner, that hee was like to choake her, in so much as she lost her speech, and turned vp the white of her eies, as if shee should instantly haue died. But herselfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring to make the signe of the Crosse, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orcist saying that part of the Gospell <hi>In principio erat verbum,</hi> and the whole assembly addressing themselues to prayers, the Diuell at last was forced to quit her, after the space of a quarter or halfe a quarter of an houre; and then he would returne to racke and torture her: which <note n="f" place="margin">The tortures which <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> suffered.</note> cruell handling indured the space of the three weekes, wherein the examination of these things was to passe vnder the censure of the fathers. When shee came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to herselfe shee followed on her discourse, as if
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:7439:190"/>
shee had felt no hurt, and had receiued no interruption. But when the Magician saw her resolution to stand in that steddy course of repentance, he sent vnto her many Sorcerers and Witches, which were sensible vnto her and not vnto vs, who came to cast their charmes vpon her, that shee might loose her memory or wits: they came in at the chimney as <hi>Magdalene</hi> reported; and when the charme had seazed her, she remained a long time, as if shee had been in a trance, or were halfe dead. But this being also blowne away by the power of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orcismes, shee was then asked, what was the cause of these trances: whereunto shee made answere, you shall perceiue how this comes vnto mee, when as I open my mouth. It is the <note n="g" place="margin">Charmes cast into <hi>Magdalene</hi> which she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealeth.</note> Diuell that causeth this in mee, to force mee to take those charmes, which they blow into mee through a cane; which you might obserue by my sneezing and coughing, as though there were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing sticking in my throte which I would faine ridde my selfe of. All this happened againe presently after that she was questioned touching another confederacy so that father <hi>Peter Fournez</hi> an ancient graue man, and Vicar of S. <hi>Baume</hi> being close vnto her, and seeing her to begin to gape, hee put his hand ouer her mouth, and the charme was seene to fall visibly vpon the apron of her that was possessed, which father <hi>Michaelis</hi> tooke vpon his knife, and shewed it to all that were there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, to their great astonishment and admiration. The charme appeared to bee a glutinous kinde of matter, as it were a mingle of hony and pitch.</p>
                     <p>When all the fathers that were there present had seene this, and knew for a certainty that these were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and not shewes, they determined to furnish the house with <note n="h" place="margin">Either to beat vp and downe in the aire with them, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues against such attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> swords and halbards to defend themselues against these wicked assaylants. And the same accident happening againe not long after, a valiant gentle-man called <hi>Monsieur Gombert</hi> kept close to the chimney with a sword in his hand, euer beating and thrusting
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:7439:190"/>
into it, and others betooke them to their halberds, striking and laying about them ouer all the chamber. But vpon the sudden <hi>Magdalene</hi> cryed out, Alacke poore <hi>Mary,</hi> what makest thou heere? and made an out-cry like vnto a woman that seeth one man murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another, beating her thighes with her hands, and plucking her selfe by the haire. When this was passed ouer, she was asked the reason of her out-cry, who made answere, that a companion of hers whom shee loued the best of al the Synagogue (for she was of a very gentle and courteous disposition) called <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> came into her chamber with a seruant of hers named <hi>Cecile,</hi> to bring her a loue-letter from the Magician, which she refused to receiue. And they being fearefull to returne through the chimney, were carryed vp and downe the chamber by the Diuels, skipping and flinging about for feare of being wounded. <hi>Mary</hi> (said shee) was stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ouer the breast with a halbard, and also hurt on the left side, and <hi>Cecile</hi> was wounded in the back, and I feare me, <hi>Mary</hi> is dead. Being asked why they had not broken through the leaues of the <note n="i" place="margin">O the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God that will not so much as suffer the Diuell to force through a casement of paper.

                     <p>Vpon Sunne set, wee heard through the window a <note n="k" place="margin">The doleful cry of one gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vp the ghost.</note> lamentable voice of a woman that seemed to be ready to giue vp the ghost: and as we thought, it came from an adioyning mountaine iust ouer against S. <hi>Baume,</hi> these lamentations continued for a long season, so that we called for <hi>Magdalene</hi> to vnderstand of her what the matter was: who when shee came to the window, shee
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:7439:191"/>
said, looke, looke, doe not you see <hi>Lewes</hi> the Magician that holdeth <hi>Mary</hi> vpon his knee to comfort her? For shee is ready to dye, and her father and mother with much other company are very busie about her.</p>
                     <p>About nine of the clock at night, the fathers with certaine women there present did see in the aire great store of <note n="m" place="margin">Torches seene in the aire.</note> torches and candles burning very bright, and carryed in manner of Procession towards Marseille.</p>

In conclusion, being constrained to answere, he said, that it was a young woman which was wounded: whereupon it was demanded of him in what part of the body shee had receaued this wound; vnto which, after many refusals, he made answere that it was about the heart: then they asked him whether the wound were mortall or no: at which question hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to laugh, and told them that she was already dead. Being demanded where shee dyed; hee answered, in yonder adioyning hill that is opposite vnto S. <hi>Baume.</hi> Being asked, what time she dyed; hee answered, about eight of the clock at night. Being questioned where they had buried her, hee made answere, that shee was cast<note n="n" place="margin">The sea the graue for Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers.</note> into the sea behind the Abbey of S. <hi>Victor</hi> at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seille,</hi> where all the Magicians and Witches were as<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sembled at her buriall. Beeing asked of whence this young woman was, hee answered, that she was a Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian, and her fathers name was <hi>Henry Alhponsus,</hi> a gentle-man dwelling neere the Louure vpon the left hand. Being asked whether she were damned, he laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and said, I beleeue she is so. Being asked if any other had receiued hurt, hee replyed that the chamber-maide of the same <hi>Mary,</hi> whose name was <hi>Cicile</hi> was hurt in
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:7439:191"/>
the back, but the wound was not mortall. After <hi>Belze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub</hi> had deliuered all this, hee came forth through the mouth of her that was possessed, and in his issuing forth he made a noys<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then he was demanded, who it was that issued forth of her body: he made answere, that it was <hi>Belzebub.</hi> Being asked, if hee would sweare &amp; auow that which <hi>Belzebub</hi> had said, he answered that he would, and to that purpose had receaued commission and leaue from him to doe it: so causing him to put both the hands of <hi>Magdalen</hi> vpon the holy Gospel, he swore thus.</p>

                     <p>Then hee was againe questioned and adiured to tell, whether any other besides them, which <hi>Belzebub</hi> spake of, were hurt or no. After many refusals and impositions of a thousand degrees of paines, and by as many Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs as euer suffered since S. <hi>Stephens</hi> time, he answered that one <hi>Briget</hi> of Marseille had some dayes since re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued a hurt on her right side, but was now recouered of the same. Also a woman of Carpentras was wounded on her left side, but hee made dainty to tell her name, saying, that shee dwelt neerer to them then Paris: but they imploring the aide and assistance of the sacred Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, S. <hi>Magdalene</hi> and of the Angels especially of S. <hi>Michael,</hi> and hauing shut vp <hi>Magdalene</hi> within the holy Penitence, and put the holy Pix vpon her head af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much adiuration and charging of him, at last hee spake disdainefully, and said, shee is called <hi>Cecile</hi> of

                        <hi>Monts:</hi> whereupon wee presently dispatched away a messenger thither to enquire the truth thereof, but some were of opinion that there should no enquiry bee made after these things, for feare least tho Diuell should accuse some body wrongfully, and so bring many inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents into danger.</p>
                     <p>After dinner about two of the clocke in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone <hi>Magdalene</hi> was questioned touching the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and fashion which they held in their Sabbath, who answered, Since my conuersion there is a Sabbath held euery day, but before, it was kept but three times in the weeke, beginning at eleuen of the clocke at night, and continuing till three of the clocke after midnight, sometimes more, sometimes lesse: the alteration of the place is day by day appointed by the Prince of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, and the witches are gathered together by the sound of the Cornet which is winded by a Diuell. And this found doth tingle and ring in the eares and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings of Sorcerers in what part of the world soeuer they be: then the Sorcerers by the power of a certaine oyntment which they vse are carried in the ayre and brought close vp to the Prince of Sorcerers, who is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in the aire by Diuels in the mid-way, and passing by him they bow vnto him and make him reuerence, and so are hurried to the Synagogue at the place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed: where being assembled, First the hagges and witches, who are people of a sordid and base condition, and whose trade and custome is to murther infants, and to bring them to the Sabbath, after they haue been bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in their graue, are the first that come to adore the Prince of the Synagogue who is <hi>Lucifers</hi> lieftenant, and he that now holdeth that place is <hi>Lewes Gaufridy:</hi> then they adore the Princesse of the Synagogue who is a woman placed at his right hand. Next they goe and worship the Diuell who is seated in a Throne like a Prince. In the second place come the Sorcerers and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceresses, who are people of a middle condition, whose
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:7439:192"/>
office is to bewitch and spread abroad charmes, and these performe the same kind of adoration with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, kneeling vpon the ground, but not prostrating themselues as doe the other; although they kisse the hands and feet of the Diuell as the first likewise doe. In the third place come the Magicians who are Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and people of a higher ranke: their office is to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme God as much as they can, and are possessed with a madnesse like vnto the raging of a mad dogge; these are full of a diabolicall hatred, fretting and fuming when they cannot plucke the Deity in peeces, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the precious humanity of Christ Iesus. Their duty al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is to renounce the sacred Trinity, their Baptisme and all inspirations which God may infuse into them, as also all the Sacraments, Preachings, Prayers, Confessions, and whatsoeuer else God might vse as the meanes and instruments of their saluation. Euery one of these haue their seruants or chambermaids to disperse abroad their charmes: for at euery Sabbath the Prince of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue (vpon the suggestion of the Diuell who roun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him in the eare) commandeth and appointeth what charmes euery one shall haue to throw about the next day, which euery one performeth in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, except the Magicians who leaue the execution hereof to their seruants and chambermaides.</p>

Other charmes are spred to mooue mens passions, as ambition, hatred, reuenge, carnall lust, and to set men head-long after these affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and when a christian perceaueth that those pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are beyond measure, irregular and altogether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary he ought to feare, lest they be wrought by charmes and inchantments, and in such cases hee ought to haue recourse to the vse of his free will, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation of Gods grace, by meanes of which (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> speakes) he is enabled to doe what he doth.

The Synagogue adored the picture of <hi>Magdalene</hi> as of a Princesse, which was set in the same place where her selfe was wont to sit in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, and al reuerence was performed to her supposed presence, as if she had been really present all which was done to mooue her to returne vnto them, considering the honour which they did her picture. Farther it was confessed that euery night they held a meeting about S. <hi>Baumes</hi> church to that purpose, and euery night shee was inchanted to hinder her from confessing and the exercise of those vertues which were inioyned her, and to draw her to the hatred of them, and to cause in her a wearisomnesse of praying vnto God and speaking of him, together with a delight to be talking of the Diuel.</p>
                     <p>Being demanded what company there was in that assembly, he answered, they came together from many quarters, as <hi>Paris, Lions, Marseilles, Turkie.</hi>

                     <p>Being demanded how it came to passe that he trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled not, nor made any adoe during the exorcisme (as hee had wont to doe formarly euer since hee was first exorcised) he began to make it very dainty, and after many shiftes and much resistance, and many punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments imposed vpon him, being inforced hee at length made answere, My pride it was to dissemble the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I suffered, and in so saying, he feched a deepe sigh turning his neck and scratching his head.</p>
                     <p>Afterward going out of the Church, and being fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by company, would you know (faith hee) where the Synagogue was held?

                     <p>AT the morning Exorcisme <hi>Verrine</hi> began to cry out against those who voluntarily offend God, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing themselues to the Diuell of their owne accord.

Magician replyed, that hee would vndergoe the third part of the torments which were imposed on him, and oftentimes hath <hi>Belzebub</hi> spoken to father <hi>Michaelis</hi> when he imposed punishments on him, impose them on the Magician who is the cause of that which I doe, and oftentimes they haue confessed in their Exorcismes that the Magician suffered inwardly so great tortures, that he would willingly haue taken his bed vpon it, had it not been for feare of discouering himselfe, and yet notwithstanding was hee euery day more obstinate then other.</p>
                     <p>During the Masse father <hi>Michaelis</hi> came from the Cloister to the Church, the doore of the cloister being shut, at which <hi>Belzebub</hi> cried out, behold father <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelis</hi> is come, and instantly the said father opened the doore and entred into the Church to the astonishment of all the beholders.</p>
                     <p>The same morning <hi>Belzebub</hi> discouered another peece of businesse as strange as the former.

As soone as they were once entred the Church, <hi>Belzebub</hi> began to cry out, turning himselfe towards the husband, and saying, you haue wel sought your wife, she walkes through the cloudes in the aire, and was heere two or three dayes since in company of some others, and there-with-all comming neere him, hee touched him, saying againe, you haue well sought your wife? haue you not?

cause, in as much as Saint <hi>Bartholomew</hi> was the Saint contrary to <hi>Astaroth,</hi> who was but of the order of Thrones, and Saint <hi>Francis</hi> to <hi>Belzebub,</hi> who was of the order of Seraphins; whereupon <hi>Astaroth</hi> instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie mounted vp into her tongue againe, and said: <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew</hi> is mine opposite, because he defaced the Idoll of <hi>Astaroth,</hi> and since that time he hath alwaies oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed himselfe against me.

                     <p>Being demanded why the Magician so often ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the window of the refectorie where he abode, and that in the midst of Winter he answered, because that sometimes their assemblie is held aboue on the top of the house, and then hee had commerce with the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, calling vpon the Diuels for fauour and saying: <hi>Diabolos venite in adintorium meum</hi>; being reprooued for his in congruitie of speech, he answered that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the words of the Magician, in the same sort as he pronounced them, for he can not speake Latine, said he.</p>
                     <p>Being demanded wherefore he went so often to the garden next the refectorie, hee answered, that all the while he stayed at Saint <hi>Baume</hi>: the assemblie of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches was alwayes held the neerest they could to the place where hee was, to the end they might the more easily haue conference with him.</p>
                     <p>Being demanded whence it came to passe, that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with vs in the refectorie, hee left vpon his trencher all the meate that was giuen him, he answered smiling, is he a man fit to seede vpon your fish? he eates of the flesh of pies, which wee bring him from the assemblie inuisible.</p>
                     <p>Being demanded why hee walked so often with his head hanging downe: hee answered, that he then wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with the witches.</p>
                     <p>Being demanded wherefore hee being inioyned to lie all night in the holy house, could not abide there but a litle while: hee answered, that it was because the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:7439:203"/>
assembly could not be held there, which he must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity be present at.</p>
                     <p>At night at the second exorcisme <hi>Belzebub</hi> being demanded and adiured to tell how it came to passe, that so great a number of Princes were in the body of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene:</hi> hee answered, shee is a Princesse and deserues well to be honoured of Princes.</p>
                     <p>Being demanded whether the punishments impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on the Magician were not of force to bring him to some grieuous disease or to death: he answered, yes for that he suffered from the head to the foote, as if he had been in a continuall fire. <note n="k" place="margin">
                           <hi>Magdalene</hi> reported vnto vs, that in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flouring of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, hee had this end &amp; scope, to be the father of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.

                     <p>IN the morning <hi>Magdalene</hi> being willing to present her selfe for confession (as shee was wont) to father <hi>Michaelis, Belzebub</hi> would not suffer her to kneele, but ran diuers times towards the Church doore; yet at length the forenamed father imposing on him very grieuous punishments, if he suffered her not to confesse. Hee replyed, impose all these punishments on the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician, who commanded me to doe it, and command him also to forbeare me, if I shall suffer her to confesse. Which when the said father had performed in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Gods name, and the bloud of Iesus Christ, <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene</hi> returned to her selfe, and being in her sound and perfect sense made her confession.</p>

                        <hi>Acoules,</hi> and cast forth gentle soft cries as he was taking the confessions; and being demanded by the women whose confessions he tooke, why he did so: he answered that hee found himselfe some-what ill, but in very deed his greatest torments were the punishments imposed on him by the Priest. Being adiured diuers times in the name of God, to shew the meanes how the Magician might be inforced to render back <hi>Magdalens</hi> obligations, he would answere nothing, remaining as

it were dumbe: at last after many grieuous punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments imposed, he answered, that they should neuer be rendred, vnlesse that he were either conuerted or puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by iustice, or dead of a naturall death, and yet (said he) after death they cannot be restored neither, being buried deepe in the earth.</p>

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:7439:204"/>
that it was because shee had submitted her selfe to her superiour. Afterwards <hi>Belzebub</hi> himselfe was sorely tormented, in so much that he cried out aloud for very paine: and being demanded why he did so, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that the Angell <hi>Michael</hi> and <hi>Cleare-sight</hi> the gard Angell of the Exorcist, and <hi>Fortitude</hi> the gardian of <hi>Magdalene</hi> tormented him, and added force to the flames in which hee fried, because some daies since hee had hindered <hi>Magdalene</hi> from her confessions, and had made her insufferable to her superiour, and all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorted vnto her, whereof although he had receiued ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse prohibition from God, yet did he rather desire to obey the Magician then the Almighty.</p>

Afterwards taking her by the throte, hee would haue strangled her, but hauing an hundred thousand degrees of punishments imposed on him, if hee forsoke not his hold, he let goe his gripe, and mounted into her tongue.</p>
                     <p>Being adiured to tell why he tormented her so vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently, after many refusals, he answered, it is to gaine that from her by torments, which cannot be compassed by other meanes: and besides, the chiefe of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians commands me to doe so, who is heere present in the Church, but not to bee seene of you: hee now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to <hi>Magdalene</hi> so filthie a thing, that shee is forced to turne her eies aside, yea euen at this instant hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth vs to torment her yet more grieuously. And turning himselfe to the Magician, hee said, what wilt thou that I doe? Her body is so weakned already, as she can indure no more.

Being commanded to sweare vpon the third prayer of the Canon, which the Priest saies after the Communion, without any more adoe he laid his hand on the booke, and swore with
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:7439:207"/>
the conditions required. adding farther, I sweare that we will not goe forth hence till the Magician <hi>Lewes</hi> be either conuerted or dead, for by this meanes God will root out al the Synagogue of Magicians and witches, such is his will, and so hee hath reuealed it vnto vs.</p>

                     <p>Being demanded whether the Magician knew the will of God in that behalfe, or vnderstood what had then been sworne: he answered laughing, yes, for hee is euen now here present, but skornes all that hath been said, affirming that hee will liue a Magician in despite of God.</p>

                        </note> Friar <hi>Honore Lyon</hi> (who was newly come thither) &amp; turning towards him he said: his good Angell is called <hi>Agilitie</hi>; and (quoth hee) if thou wert so nimble to serue God and to obserue his Commandements, thou wouldest be a braue fellow.</p>
                     <p>Being demanded wherefore that Euening hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted so many outrages, laughing and playing of tricks: It is (quoth he) because this day which is Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, <hi>Lewes</hi> hath offered great iniurie to the Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted host in despight of Christs passion, of which this day is a commemoration: he farther added, that <note n="b" place="margin">This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction fell out afterward to be true.</note> all the Nunnes of Saint <hi>Vrsula</hi> should bee deliuered, either from the Deuils which possessed them (there being fiue of them possessed) or from their inchantments, but that <hi>Magdalene</hi> should not be deliuered till the whole processe of the Magician was ended: but yet she should not be so tormented as now she was.</p>

vnderstand that <hi>Lewes Gaufridy</hi> was prince of the Magicians; and he would be so lowde, that they should be very deafe if they heard him not.

Or lastly, <hi>Belzebub</hi> going foorth of <hi>Magdalene,</hi> would take vpon him the shape of a man (because that function belongs not to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) and going vp into the pulpit would preach pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely in the Church of <hi>Acoules,</hi> where the said <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fridy</hi> abode, that <hi>Lewes</hi> Preist of <hi>Acoules</hi> was the Prince of Magicians, and would withall lay open all his knaueries and inchantments, which hee had practised since the time he first tooke that profession vpon him.

                     <p>He farther said and swore vpon the Canon of the Masse, laying his hands (being first commanded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto) vpon the prayer made after the offering (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the <note n="f" place="margin">The triall of the Deuill.</note> Exorcist shewed him another to trie what he would doe) that the last night as the Magician was

This did <hi>Belze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub</hi> when hee went out of her, report to the Magician and to his adherents, who sawe not the miracle, which as soone as they heard they began to weepe, foreseeing their ruine: notwithstanding they came againe to <hi>Magdalene</hi> and prayed her to receiue the Host, in as much as shee was conuerted, and that it might be shee had some vision, which was but an illusion, yet she still refused it, and though the diuell opened her mouth by force, yet had not the Magician the power to put the Host into it. But after that shee had long resisted, at length the foresaid child shut her lippes. <note n="h" place="margin">We must not consent or giue way vnto the Deuill in the least thing that is: so that if he come and demand but a rush of vs, wee are not to giue it vnto him.</note> After this the Magician desired an haire of her head, which she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to giue; knowing that that were to do homage to the Deuill if any thing were giuen him: after that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine he demanded halfe an haire, which when shee refused to doe, he then caused her to suffer grieuous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, in so much as she rested not all that night, nor fiue dayes after during the Exorcismes; which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding shee indured with great patience, for the loue of God, and the remission of her sinnes.</p>
                     <p>The assistants who watched with her all the night, witnessed that shee lay still as one in a dreame not able to speake so much as one word, and <hi>Magdalene</hi> her selfe confessed that it was all true which hath bin

He saw besides this another e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident proofe, which was that <hi>Belzebub</hi> held himselfe in the former part of her head, making there a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all motion, and heauing vp that part in such sort that a man laying his hand on it might easily perceaue it.

of one <hi>Miserere,</hi> he presently left her, issuing sensiblie out of her mouth, and thereupon instantly the motion of her head ceased, as the said President found by laying his hand on the place.

                        <hi>Lewes</hi> answered, what should I doe? shall I goe any where from hence?

Yea, but said the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician, they will put mee to the rack. <hi>Belzebub</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I will take order that thou shalt haue no feeling of that.

After this day the wicked spirits began to put <hi>Magdalene</hi> to the rack, turning and wresting her armes and legs, lifting her vp on high, and laying on her many tortures three or foure times a day.

there is great difference betwixt a blow or a stripe, and a marke; the blow is giuen for correction, the marke in token of subiection: the slaues of Turkie carry their masters marke in their forehead, burnt with an hoat yron, but it is another matter when their masters whip them till the bloud come.

<pb n="381" facs="tcp:7439:215"/>
So the Magicians haue in their heart a participation of the obstinacy of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> vnto whom they haue dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated themselues: but this is not by any infusion, for that were impossible, but by adhering and consenting to the ceaslesse batteries and temptations of the Deuill, by which they are endarkned and remooued from the beame of grace.</p>

Then they applyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vnto her the lesser skull of the two, where-upon

he said: <note n="y" place="margin">In the Acts of the Apostles the 19. chapter.

                     <p>The said <hi>Monsieur Garandeau</hi> Vicar generall of the Arch-bishopricke, commanded a Priest of the Church called Master <hi>Claude Meffredy</hi> to bring a skul from the Church-yard, which being applied as the former <hi>Belze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub</hi> laughed at it, and suddenly issued forth being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (as it seemed) by the Magician as he was wont.</p>

At that time Father <hi>Francis Billet,</hi> and Fryer <hi>Anthony Boilletot</hi> did walke in the said gallery, and <hi>Magdalene</hi> stood at the window looking downe into the base court and leaning with her hand vpon the window: as soone as the thrust was giuen she went vnto the said fathers, and shewed them the blood which still dropped from her finger, and they saw three dropps of blood vpon the window. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing astonished herewithall, they acquainted <hi>Monsieur Thoron</hi> the Commissary and <hi>Monsieur Grassy</hi> a Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, who were in the Hall, with this accident. This blood was drawne from her to make a charme therewithall against her, because her loue to the Magician grew cold: which charme did worke the next day so vehemently, that it caused her to leape and skipp with great violence, so that foure men could not hold her in: and being got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vp vpon an high place, if she had not beene by fine

                     <p>The next day in the morning about 7. of the clock, she was desirous in token of her obedience, to sweepe the Church: but the Diuell being impatient to see this her humility, did grunt and grumble, crying, the Diuel take him that is the cause of this, and so she began to be at quiet, and remained very well comforted.</p>

                        <hi>Carreau</hi> said, wee were at such ease, and were such goodly creatures, that wee would not bee in subiection vnto man.

Then (said the father) True, but it must be according to our high Soueraignes intention, and the obedience which we owe vnto him; <hi>Lucifer</hi> did not create thee. I grant it (said <hi>Carreau</hi>) but let a man all daies of his life treasure vp a multitude of impieties for the wrath of God to take vengeance on, yet doth he euer finde mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and <note n="c" place="margin">He returneth to his first speech where he complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of God.</note> we committed but one sinne, &amp; were forth with damned.

                     <p>VPon Sunday at morning Masse, there came a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked spirit sent from the Magician, and entered into the body of <hi>Magdalene,</hi> his name was <hi>Aurey,</hi> and he said that hee was the sixth in the order of <hi>Seraphins,</hi> who laughingly and in ieasting manner told them, that he would not leaue her tongue vntill hee had executed his commission. Being adiured to tell why hee laughed so immoderatly: because (said he) yesterday about 12. of the clock, it is iust 15. yeares agoe since <hi>Lewes</hi> gaue himselfe vnto the Diuell, and to day this very houre it is so long agoe since hee made vnto vs his first schedule written with his bloud, drawing the same from the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar of his left hand where the veynes of his hart do lye.</p>
                     <p>This being done, hee began to make his renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the name of <hi>Lewes,</hi> as hath formerly beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, crying aloud so that hee was heard a great way off: and when they applyed vnto her back a crosse of gold, he said, take away this, there is a crosse behind me, and touched one of the nayles of the feete in the said crosse. After dinner there was a man brought to <hi>Marseille</hi> who was much doubted to be possessed. And as soone as he entred into the chamber, the Diuels that were in <hi>Magdalene</hi> began to bussell a litle, and at last
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:7439:222"/>
fell a bellowing, one of them saying, this man hath 15. Diuels within him, and a legion that watch him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: if he bee not looked vnto, he will within these 15. dayes bee vtterly vndone. Hee was possessed vpon the feast of S. <hi>Michael</hi> 1610 they that gouerne and are the cheefe within are two, <hi>Garanier</hi> and <hi>Sandrié.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is to be noted, and we haue had experiment of the same, that the Diuels who are in diuers bodies cannot indure to be together; if they doe, they <note n="d" place="margin">Like vnto sundry theues that are posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with diuers towers, euery one standing vpon his owne guard: or like two doggs snarling one against the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when they both are gnavving of a bone.</note> grumble one against the other, and seeme to be ready to deuoure one another, like wolues and hogs. Hence was it, that wee were forced to separate <hi>Magdalene</hi> and <hi>Louyse,</hi> which proceeded from their pride and malice.</p>
                     <p>Vpon holy Munday in the morning <hi>Magdalene</hi> was shrewdly tempted to deny Confession vnto her owne Confessor father <hi>Francis Billet,</hi> and this temptation continued from the morning till eleuen of the clock, when the Diuell-being ouercome by the patience and perseuerance of the said Priest, did giue ouer his assault, and shee acknowledging her fault, confessed her selfe vnto the said father, although shee had before protested that she would more willingly confesse her selfe to any other.</p>
                     <p>Where by the way wee may note, that to change our Confessors is many times a temptation of the Diuell. About this time, he of <hi>Marseille</hi> that was possessed was brought vnto the chapel, where-upon the Diuels that were in <hi>Magdalene</hi> began to bellow so hideously that they were forced to constraine him to goe out of the Chapell. Heerein the Diuell behaueth himselfe like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a tyrant, who cannot indure to haue a great Lord dwell neere him: so high is his heart swollen with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and arrogancy.</p>
                     <p>After dinner <hi>Belzebub</hi> made <hi>Magdalene</hi> take a knife and set it against her breast, tempting her to kill her selfe with her owne hand. When the knife was taken away, hee caused her to lay hold on her owne
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:7439:222"/>
throate, and would haue strangled her, if they had not hindered him.</p>
                     <p>About two of the clock in the after-noone <hi>Belzebub</hi> cryed so hideously, that father <hi>Michaelis</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion heard it into their lodging, which was on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side of the Arch-bishops house a great way off: which when they heard, they ranne thither, and being adiured by the said father to tell what the reason of this so terrible an out-cry was: he answered, I cannot but bee mad that <hi>Magdalene</hi> doth thus surrender vp and make <note n="e" place="margin">Behold the consummation and perfection of true contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>abneget semetipsum.</hi>
                        </note> resignation of her owne will.</p>
                     <p>Vpon this day Monsier <hi>Thoron</hi> the Commissary did relate vnto vs, that the Saturday last past beeing Palme-Sunday eue, the court, as their manner is, went in visitation of the prisoners, where <hi>Lewes Gaufridy</hi> to excuse himselfe said vnto them, that hee did giue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe wholy to the Diuell, if hee were not innocent, which is agreeable vnto that which <hi>Aurey</hi> said on Palme-Sunday when he laughed, and was so merry that the Magician had giuen himselfe vnto the Diuell. Then the said Monsieur <hi>Thoron</hi> said vnto him Speake not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, for hereby you doe but settle and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme your sin with greater assurednes. Vpon holy Tews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in the morning <hi>Carreau</hi> whose imployment is to harden mens hearts, did withhold <hi>Magdalen</hi> from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, so that the combate continued till twelue a clock against him, and when the Exorcist did impose more punish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

much affection. Then <hi>Belzebub</hi> turned himselfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him and said, Pray for thy selfe and let her alone. Whereat this Counsellor was much abashed, for hee prayed with great silence.</p>
                     <p>On this day <hi>Magdalene</hi> was asked by the two aboue named charitable Capuchin fathers (who tooke the paines to remaine all night in prison with the <note n="f" place="margin">Oculos suos statuerunt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinare in terram.</note> Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, to see if they could conuert him) what the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was that the Magician did so often fix his eies vpon the ground when they spake vnto him. Where-unto she answered, a Magician may be knowen by his eies when hee looketh fixedly vpon the earth, and cannot endure to settle his eies vpon those that looke vpon him. They are also knowen (said she) when they stoope downe to the ground and take vp a straw, for then they aske ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the Diuell, and doe homage vnto him by bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for this straw. Which being once obserued by the said Capuchin fathers, they found that the Magicians custome was to doe so.</p>
                     <p>Vpon holy Thursday the Diuels did torment and vex themselues during the time of Exorcismes, tossing the woman that was possessed heere and there to her great disquiet. After the Communion was ended, shee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently sound ease.</p>

ignominiously, so that the Magician was determinatly bent to make confession of his witch craft vnto Iustice, as afterwards he accordingly performed. This Crosse is the instrument, and this death of Christ Iesus is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cause of the remission of all our sinnes, be they neuer so enormous or numberlesse.</p>
                     <p>As <hi>Magdalene</hi> was hearing the Passion sermon at a window of the Arch-bishops house, otherwise called the Chapter-house, father <hi>Michaelis</hi> who was at that time the preacher did inueigh against Magicia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Belzebub</hi> began to say aloud, there is no small number of them in the citty of <hi>Aix,</hi> and afterward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, there is a Frier in this assembly that is fallen a sleep, and indeed they found that one of those, who was wont to watch with the said Magician in prison, did at that time slumber a little being sate amongst the people.</p>

In the morning when I did so turmoyle my selfe at Masse, the reason was, because that<note n="i" place="margin">O notable Miracle being performed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the blessed day of Easter at the time of holy Masse, &amp; by the vertue of the worthy receauing of the body of Christ Iesus: al being wrought by the power of God, who is alone able to enlifen that which is dead, the Diuel ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no power to quicken the least branch of a tree, after it is once withered vp and dryed.

                        <hi>Fortitude</hi> did lay his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand vpon mee, offering to force mee to take off my markes from <hi>Magdalene,</hi> which I was constrained to doe presently after the Communion. Question her, whether shee did not suffer great anguish and paine in euery part about her, vpon which these markes were branded, when I tooke them off from her: which the woman confessed, but did not then know any reason of the same: the places also where these markes remained were searched, which then had sense and feeling, and were able then to yeeld bloode, whereas before they were deaded vp and made insensible, and not a drop of bloud would fall from them, but would rattle and make a noise like parchment, when it is pierced with a knife.</p>

And that this was true, <hi>Belzebub</hi> tooke his oath with all the circumstances and ceremonies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing there-unto, and without reseruation of any malicious meaning what-so-euer, as experience it selfe hath since declared. For at the beginning of dinner they tortured her halfe an houre, and so againe at the end of dinner; and in the middle they did euer disquiet her with continuall plunges of her head towards the ground. And at supper they tortured her after the same manner for the space of an houre, wreathing her armes and leggs backward, and making a generall dislocation of all the parts of her body: they did also make her bones to crack and clatter one against the other, and did displace her bowels and turned them topsie turuy (as she her selfe afterwards reported) so that the sound of these vnnaturall motions was easily heard. When these tortures were ended, then did they cast her into a
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:7439:226"/>
dead sleepe or lethargie, so that shee seemed stark dead: and when she came to her selfe, and for obedience sake offered to eate her supper, they caused these strange motions of her head towards the ground to bee put in practise as before. The same was likewise done after the two Exorcismes euery day, making her to cast her head towards the ground forward and backward, with which violent agitations, her face became as read as a coale of fire. In this fashion continued these torments till our departure from <hi>Aix,</hi> which was the fiue and twentieth of Aprill.</p>
                     <p>On Saturday the ninth of Aprill, they caused her iawes to wag by extraordinary and vnnaturall motions, as <hi>Monsieur Fonteine,</hi> a learned and skilfull Physitian, who was there present did obserue.

                     <p>Where-upon <hi>Belzebub</hi> being asked what it was, he readily made answere, It is an optick glasse to make a man see that which is not: which saying of his was found agreeable vnto truth, for it caused men to see Woods, Castels and Arches in the aire of all manner of colours and other things of the like nature.</p>

                  <p>IN the moneth of Iuly, father <hi>Michaelis</hi> was aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised by letters from father <hi>Romillon,</hi> and father <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Billet,</hi> who had beene both Exorcists vnto <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> as also from the Gardian of the couent of Capuchin fathers at <hi>Aix,</hi> and of another of the Capuchins; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they declared diuerse admirable occurrences, which by the permission of God did befall <hi>Louyse</hi> and <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene,</hi> since his departure from them. And also, that the very same day vpon which the Magician was burnt, sister <hi>Margaret Burle,</hi> a very honest woman, and of the company of S. <hi>Vrsula</hi> was deliuered from three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, and from the charmes which she had in her body. After certaine dayes, there was another woman, and after her there was also another freed from the like sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery, who had been formerly possessed by the force of charmes and witch-craft.

                  <p>It was further aduertised in these letters, that <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene</hi> had a vision of the state of <hi>Lewes Gaufridy,</hi> how he was continually tormented in hell, with more extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie then euer was <hi>Indas.</hi> And that this vision was the cause that shee became an vnfeined penitentiary: for shee would goe along to the wood with the poore wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Carpentras</hi> (whether she was fled) bare-footed, and would gather bundels of sticks, and would sell them in the market place, and would giue the money that did arise from hence vnto the poore, besides that which shee daily sent to bee giuen at the porch of the great Church.

                  <p>They farther aduertised, that <hi>Verrine</hi> began already to be wray the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plices and asfoclats in Magick by their names and sur-names: and amongst others a woman called <hi>Honoria</hi> that was blind of both her eies, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apprehended had the markes found vpon her, and was conuicted of witch-craft and so burnt, although she died with great contrition and sense of her sinnes.</p>

Notwithstanding the Theorick and contemplation of these things is not vnnecessary vnto vs that are Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, because we are expresly commanded by Christ Iesus, in the persons of his Apostles, to cast out and chase away all wicked and vncleane spirits by the powerfulnesse of his name: for his pleasure is, that wee should be in direct oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition against Magicians, who doe call vpon them and wooe them to appeare vnto them by their softest and sweetest supplications.

                     </note> that it was necessary that Christians should haue a greater knowledge of Diuels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (as experience did well witnesse) none but Christians had authority and power to cast them out with violence and in despite of them. For as a Lord, or Master who is euer labouring to tame his slaue that is refractary and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious against him, hath occasion to know his peruersues more thorowly then other men: euen so fareth it with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in respect of vncleane spirits. <hi>Daemonia itaque af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmamus esse, inquit, sane quasinon &amp; probemus, qui ea soli de corpore exigimus.</hi> Hence wee may make this deduction, that for the readier way to dissipate and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe the kingdome of Satan, this kinde of Science is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily required in Church-men: as the knowledge of Heresies is necessary vnto Catholick Doctors, that they may the better confute them,<note place="margin">

I doe heere desire, that in a subiect of this nature, there might bee a methode obserued in our manner of speaking, as the Stoicks anciently did in their discourses of the world, esteeming it as a great abuse to call things that in themselues were odious and filthy, by honest names, or things that were vertuous and honest, by filthy names: but insteed thereof, euery thing was to be expressed by words and appellations apt and proper to figure out the same. For vertuous actions were to bee expressed by termes that should breath and sound forth nothing but a decent and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall commendation, but vicious and discommendable acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were to be set forth with such fit and conuenient epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetes, as might breed an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

filthinesse. Neither doe I desire this without iust cause, since that the malice of our times hath mis-applied the names of things that are Sacred to that which is base and ridiculous: and contrariwise, those things which are stayned with pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions much vnworthy of Christians, are many times graced with goodly and glorious appellations. Hence it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth, that many haue so farre ouer-shot themselues, that they hold those for barbarous and illiterate fellowes, who in speaking of the Diuell doe vse the proper Greeke name, <hi>Diabolus,</hi> or the Hebrew name, <hi>Satan,</hi> or the word bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the Latins, <hi>Malignant,</hi> which signifieth an aduersary, a back-biter, and one repleat with all malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse: names so proper and proportionable vnto their nature, that the holy Scripture doth sundry times vse the same: yet is the vse thereof so discontinued in these times that we finde no mention of them in any Bookes. Euery one doth contend to sound forth no other name then the goodly appellation of <hi>Daemon,</hi>

                  <p>After this discourse touching their names, I come now vnto the fact. I am not ignorant, that many haue formerly trauelled their spirits and pennes in this Argument of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers, so that I might quit this labour, and repute my selfe vnworthy to publish my gleanings after their baruest: yet may I iustly vse the excuse of <hi>Lactantius Firmianus,</hi> who crauing pardon in that hee had vndertaken to write against the Gentiles in fauour of Christian Religion, since that such great and learned personages, as <hi>Iustin, Origen, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> and <hi>Arnobius</hi> had formerly written of the same; I haue done it (said hee) as it were vpon constraint, and to giue rellish and contentment vnto the variety of mens wills, because wee are bound to fit and accommodate our selues both to the learned and vnlearned, for the aduancement of the common good. Some (said he) haue written against the Gentiles, meerly from the grounds and authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in which they giue no satisfaction vnto the Gentiles, in that they doe repudiate the same, but doe onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the Christians and partly the Iewes. Others haue argued the case, and grounded the iudgment of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions vpon naturall reason, wherein those doe finde a main and an extraordinary delinquency, who doe sagely and soberly prefer the Scripture, before all other humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whatsoeuer. But none (saith he) did euer mingle both together in any Authour, which is it that now remaineth to be done. And thereupon <hi>Lactantius</hi> concludeth, that if
<pb facs="tcp:7439:238"/>
hee did make a hansome medlie or mingle of all these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities, he hoped to giue contentment to euery body, euen downe to the Atheist. All which I apply vnto my selfe for my lawfull excuse. For some haue intreated of Sorcerers onely by way of a bare collection of Histories, and of the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall proceedings against them, together with the relation of their owne auerments and confessions.

And such kindes of admiration (saith <hi>Aristotle</hi>) haue been the seed-plot, and head of all Philosophie: for those spirits that had a

touch of generousnes and industrie, did presently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to comprehend the cause of those vnusuall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents. The like course of proceeding is here to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, and the rather, because it seemeth so much the more admirable and incredible by how much the more distant the knowledge and experience thereof is from the best and soundest part of men. We are therefore to diue into the causes, which when we once shall steddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comprehend, it will easily bow and incline our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings to the beleefe of those things, and make vs conceiue them not only to be possible, but of a more ordinarie frequencie then hath hitherto bin beleeued. And in regard that Spirits are the cause of these euents; wee are first to know, whither there are Spirits, or no. There are three sorts of men that haue denied Spirits: the first are Philosophers; the second are the Sadduces, and the third are Atheists. Touching <hi>Aristotle</hi> the prince of Philosophers,<note place="margin">Lib. 8, Physic.</note> hee is of opinion, that there is one supreme cause not tyed to the pressure and incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of a bodie:<note place="margin">Lib. 12. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph. text<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 48.</note> And he sets downe 47. Spirits subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to that supreme cause, according to the number of motions, which he obserued in the celestiall Orbes of heauen, thinking with himselfe that those heauenly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies could not so ordinately moue, vnlesse they were animated and quickened thereunto by some Spirits of life. Now whither hee had stolne this out of the holie Scripture, (or at the least had borrowed it from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Plato,</hi> who might take it from thence) because it is said in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezech. 1.</note> speaking of the celestiall bodies, which are there called wheeles, <hi>Spiritus vitae erat in rotis</hi>; or whether hee had inuented the same by the collections which his experience had made from his frequent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing of them, I cannot tell; but surely he said truth, except where hee seemeth by exclusion to shut out the rest, as if there were no more then those that he recited. Wherein he might consider,<note place="margin">S. Thom. lib. 2. cont. gent. c. 92</note> that if those Spirits were necessarie for the vniforme and vncessant motions of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7439:240"/>
the Spheares, and by a consequent for the seruice of man, <hi>Qui est quodammodo finis omnium,</hi> much more is it conuenient, that this first and supreme cause, whom hee calleth the alone Prince of all things,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. Metaph. &amp; lib. 2. de anima.</note> should be waited on with an infinite number of them, for his owne vse and seruice. Whereunto agreeth that of <hi>Daniel,</hi> who teacheth vs, that <note n="a" place="margin">Dan. 7.</note>

                        <hi>Mercurius Trismegistus,</hi> as S. <hi>Thomas</hi> recites him, doth determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately denie that there are good Spirits, except those who wheele about the heauens: And in this he agreeth with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> although hee was a better Diuine then the other, because he yeeldeth, that God did make and create them, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> seemed to deny, who fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to himselfe an eternitie euen of thistles and but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-flyes:<note place="margin">S. Thom. 1. p. q. 115. art. 5. Psell lib. de energia Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monum, c. 14.</note> but touching the number of Spirits they are both of one opinion. <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth deny that there are wicked Spirits; whose authoritie Physitians did follow and adhere vnto, as <hi>Psellus</hi> witnesseth, intending those that were not Christians, or which had apostated from the true Religion. This sort of men doth ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily fall into two grosse errors; the one against the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie of the soule, as it is recited in the 2. of Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, saying,<note place="margin">Sap. 2.</note> that the soule doth altogether resemble the flame that is nourished from the lampe: the other is against Spirits; for when they are shewed the effects wrought really by the Diuell in the bodies of those hee doth possesse, they do adiudge of it more meanely then <hi>Aristotle</hi> did, and affirme, that these incongruities doe happen through the indisposition and depraued tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of humours and vitall spirits. And thus as they doe by the immortalitie of the soule, so heere also they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7439:241"/>
change an immortall and incorruptible spirit into a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit more earthly: and which they would haue to bee quintessented from the temperament of naturall quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which indeed is nothing else but a blast or smoake. Hence it is that S. <hi>Augustine</hi> doth to this purpose fitly alleage the historie of a Physitian,<note place="margin">August. epist. 100. ad Euo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</note> who, saith hee, was constrained to confesse the immortalitie of soules by a vision which hee had when he lay asleepe, wherein hee saw, although the casements of his eyes were shut vp; and heard, although his sense of hearing was tied vp and possessed by sleepe, his good Angell speaking vnto him, and making him to consider, that his soule of it selfe without the aide or seruice of the bodie, or any of the organs thereof, did see and heare. And this is the reason why such kinde of people doe relie and leane too much vpon Philosophie, and causes in nature. The Sadduces also may be ranked with them,<note place="margin">Act. 23. Matth. 23.</note> because they also denie Spirits as it is recited in the Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles: from thence they fall into another inconuenience, and that is, to deny the immortality of the soule: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it followeth of necessitie, that they must deny the resurrection of the body;<note place="margin">Iust. Apolog. 2. haectria vnico medio probat.</note> which three points are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vnto Atheists, and all those that deny Spirits. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers there are, that are not so frontlesse and grosse in their opinions, as the former, but grant, that as there are good Spirits, (for the motion of the heauen doth force from them that confession, in that so good and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie a worke cannot proceed but from a good agent) so there are also bad Spirits, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> from them many actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of villany and naughtinesse doe proceed. Of these <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiry</hi> maketh mention <hi>in Epistola ad Anebuntem,</hi> cited by S. <hi>Thomas,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">S. Thom. lib. 3. contr. gent. cap. 107. &amp; 108. &amp; August. lib. 10. de Ciuitat. cap. 11. &amp; Euseb. lib. 5. de praeparat.

is in the highest region of the aire, as birds haue their abiding place in the low and middle region, and fishes in the water: but they doe heere intermingle many absurdities, as wee will declare heereafter. To conclude, none haue euer perfectly knowen the nature of Spirits, but those that haue receiued and vnderstood the holy Scripture. Now against Philosophers and Pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims wee haue experience:<note place="margin">Tertull. de pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script. heretic. Helias in This<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi dictione Qua rain. S. Thom. cont.

S. <hi>Thomas</hi> in his third booke against the Gentiles doth solidly and learnedly dispute against all the arguments of the Philosophers, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that when any prodigie in nature did happen, it was to be attributed to the influence of celestiall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which are able to bring forth many things that are hidden and buried from our knowledge. It is true (saith hee) that nature is able to doe much, yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is bounded in and limited so strongly, that for the most part it is tyed to the production of one manner of effects, either from the property of the efficient cause, or from the impotency or vnaptnesse of the matter which hath no capacity but to bring forth one thing: as the Sunne, and all the heauens cannot in the sapp of a vine shape vp or bring forth any other thing but grapes, nor from an apple tree any thing but apples.<note place="margin">Mercurius Trismegist. in Asclepio.</note> Whereupon it must bee granted, that there are many effects which are against and aboue the power of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: as Oracles which were nothing else but statues that did speake and giue resolution vnto those doubts that were propounded vnto them, and did vnfold ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things that were absent, hidden, and to come: as also that some men haue suddenly,<note place="margin">Lactan. lib. inst. &amp; Aug. lib. de ciuit, . 6.</note> and without any study or paines taking therein, spoken Hebrew, Greeke and Latine, Syriac, Chaldey, and all other languages, citing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7439:242"/>
sentences of Poets and Orators, although they neuer were conuersant in them or in any other kinde of lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature: that Oxen and Asses should speake, and other prodigious accidents should happen, against the power and course of nature; that a vestall Virgin, being suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of light behauiour and wantonnes, should in wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of her chastitie cary vp and downe before the Romansa sure full of water. <hi>Claudia</hi> also vpon the same occasion did draw a great ship after her with her girdle, and <hi>Actius Naeuius</hi> did with a rasor cut a whet-stone in peeces.</p>
                     <p>It hath been found true by experience, and mention is made of the fame in the lawes of the 12. Tables, that a certaine Island did fleet vp and downe from one place to another. It is also knowen by obseruation, that they who practise such things as these, do vse certaine words, characters, prayers, protestations, and other manners of behauiour, which cannot without folly and vanity be presented vnto any, but vnto substances that haue vnderstanding and reason. From whence hee draweth this conclusion, that it is euident that al these prodigies doe proceed from Spirits, and therefore there are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. And if the authority of the Scripture may heere take place (which they may admit of at the least as any other History) it is impossible to conceiue, that the course of the Sunne should be stayed, and that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen should goe backward in the time of <hi>Iosua,</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore it is plaine, that those euents proceed from some thing else then from the motion of the heauens: and it must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be granted, that prodigies ought not to be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7439:242"/>
to the motion of the heauens, but to some other secret causes, which stand involued with much ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity and mistinesse. <hi>Mercurius Trismegistus</hi> would indeed haue answered that argument touching Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, in saying, that it was true that God did create as many Spirits as are in nature, yet it was the art of men to make the Oracles to speake, by sitting thereunto certaine influences of the heauens: for (saith hee) such statues might be so aptly accomodated to certaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects of the heauens, as that they might speake, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, and foretell, and might strike men with diseases, and heale them againe, and might in breefe worke mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. But it fareth heere with him, as it doth with <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Plutarch. lib. de taciturn. oracul.</note> who endeuouring to giue a reason why Oracles did cease to doe those wonders, which they were wont, (letting slippe the true reason, which was the comming of Christ Iesus in the flesh, by whom the kingdome of Satan was vtterly ruined) he maketh a booke expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly to shew the reason of their cessation and silence: but hee falleth so short in his discourse, that hee allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth no reasons but such, whose insufficiency and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse may bee easily confuted, nay which is more, the most of them are ridiculous, and vnworthy of so great a Philosopher: in so much as he is driuen to say, that they were nourished by exhalations drawne vp from the earth, which when they ceased and were exhausted, those Oracles were famished, and dyed for want of their accustomed sustenance. In the same maze wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <hi>Trismegistus,</hi> when hee would yeeld a reason of their ouerthrow: for it may be easily demanded of him, first, why men in these times may not doe the like (as those of former ages haue done) by the same obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the heauens, since now they are more skilled in their motions, then formerly they haue beene: and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now our modern Astrologers haue conuicted both <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> of many errours.

And if it be replyed, that there must bee a concurrence of the heauens influence vnto such a worke, I answere, Why may not the like influence as well happen vnto a man, as vnto a statue of wood? Nay, why should it not rather agree vnto him, as being more capable of reason, speech, and all other actions, then a statue? Since then it was neuer knowen that a man was an oracle, we may conclude, that this reason is most insufficient; for it is certaine that in all ages there haue beene some, who would not haue desired a better purchase, then by this meanes to bee esteemed Gods, wherein they retaine a remnant of that poyson, wherewith the Serpentinfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted our first parents, telling them, <hi>Erit is sicut Dij;</hi>; and <hi>Gregory,</hi>

Now there is nothing more discerneable, then that this was no vnreasonable beast, that spake from his owne braine and apprehension, because nothing is more disproportionable and auerse from beastes then speach and reason: Heereupon it is that Orators doe properly tearme them <hi>Animalia muta,</hi> because speech
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7439:244"/>
is the expresser and interpreter of inward reason, and can proceed from no cause but from thence. But put the case they should bee so stupide as to say that in those times beastes could speake, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> seemeth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate in his booke which is intituled, <hi>That beasts are not deuoide of reason,</hi> and as some grosse capacities conceiue of <hi>Aesops</hi> fables, and the like,<note place="margin">S.

But touching this the Scripture speaketh nothing, for besides the ridiculousnesse of such a conceite, it would breed a manifest repugnancy in the Scripture, which saith that God created liuing creatures, but hee afterwards made man after his owne image and likenesse, which similitude lyeth onely in this pointe, that hee framed him with the indowment and vse of reason, whereby hee might direct himselfe and euery other thing, as God doth guide and gouerne all things by his wisedome and prouidence. And this is it (as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> hath notably obserued) which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently there added, <hi>vt praesit piscibus maris,</hi>

This could not be a man, as we haue declared, and must therefore be a Spirit. There is also frequent mention made of the Angels of God, who appeared vnto men, as vnto <hi>Abraham, Lot, Iacob</hi> and others, foretelling them of things, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the compasse of mans knowledge, as that an olde barren woman should conceiue; that <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morra</hi> should be destroied, and the like.

S. <hi>Thomas</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pureth against it,<note place="margin">S. Thom. cont. Gent. vbi supr.</note> and saith that it cannot be defended. For first, if they had bodies made of aire (as <hi>Apuleius</hi> dreamed) they could not bee immortall, but would in the end fall into corruption, as we doe: because what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is compounded of elementarie qualities, must of necessitie be framed of contrary and repugnant natures, which in the end by their perpetuall opposition and fight do ruine one the other; and this truth is beyond exception. Secondly, the aire is a body, which the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers terme <hi>homogeneall,</hi> that is, whose least part is of the same nature and condition with the whole, as euery drop of water is water, as well as whole riuers or the sea: from whence this absurditie would follow their opinion, that the whole bodie of the aire must be one immense Angelicall substance. Thirdly, the men bers of a liuing bodie, must haue seuerall organes fit for the performance of those functions, whereunto nature doth ordaine them, which cannot be true of the aire: and if they were made of aire, they may the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be dissolued and melted into water as the clouds are, they should also be hot &amp; moist like vnto the aire; as if they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>posed of fire, then must they burne. All which absurdities doe euidently shew, that they are said to bee airie only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they abide for the most part in the aire. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writing vnto the Ephesians, who were great Philosophers, and much addicted vnto Magicke, (as S. <hi>Ierome</hi> obserueth) giueth them to vnderstand,<note place="margin">Hieron. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7439:251"/>
whom they were to combat: insinuating thereby, that they may in this sense bee called airie, if thereby wee meane that they are Spirits, without flesh and bones. <hi>Non est nobis</hi> (saith he) <hi>colluctatio aduersus carnem &amp; sanguinem,<note place="margin">Ephes. 6.</note> sed aduersus principes &amp; potestates aeris hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius:</hi>

Psal. 8.</note> In this sense doe the Hebrewes call birds the fowles of the heauen and of the aire, and men are by them stiled terrestriall: not that birds haue bodies of aire, or men of earth, but because they doe inhabite in the aire and dwell vpon the earth. For conclusion of this point, let vs hearken what the holy Scriptures say; and for the old Testament, King <hi>Dauid</hi> calleth them Spirits where he faith,<note place="margin">Psal. 103.</note> 
                        <hi>Qui facis angelos tuos spiritus:</hi> as if he should haue said, Lord thou hast ordained that those whom wee call Angels, should be Spirits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now there is a contradiction and Antithesis betweene a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and a spirit, so that the consequence by negation doth necessarily follow one vpon the other: as if such a thing be a bodie, it will be negatiuely inferred, then is it not a spirit; and contrariwise if it be a spirit, then is it not a bodie: which conclusion Christ himselfe maketh vnto his Apostles, when after his resurrection they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued him to be a spirit:<note place="margin">Luke 24.</note> Touch me (said he) and looke what I am (being risen with my true bodie) for a spirit hath neither flesh nor bones, as you see I haue. So that this were sufficient to proue, that a spirit hath no body, although there should bee no other place or text to strengthen the same. And lest wee should fall into the opinions of certaine Stoicks, who maintained diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of kindes in Angels, and that some had bodies, and others had not, S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth direct vs vnto this generall Maxime, which is without exception, when hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth this sentence:<note place="margin">Heb. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Omnes sunt administratorij spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus</hi>; and in another place he saith, that amongst Gods
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7439:251"/>
creatures there are some visible, and some inuisible, such as are Thrones, Dominations, Principalities, &amp; Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: for confirmation whereof wee may adde that, which we haue alreadie alleaged out of the Epistle vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ephesians, where there is an opposition expressed between the things that appertaine to flesh and blood, and the things that belong vnto the spirit. Touching Diuels, they are also called Spirits; but to put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the good and them, there is euer sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned some restriction; as in the historie of <hi>Achab,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">3. Reg. 22.</note> one of them speaketh in this manner: <hi>Ero spiritus men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dax in ore prophetarum.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 12.</note> Christ Iesus often calleth them vncleane spirits, or the Diuels angels; conformable whereunto S. <hi>Paul</hi> termeth them the angels of Satan,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.</note> which must be vnderstood to proceed from their imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, not from their creation. But it may be obiected, that they haue a body,<note place="margin">Tertul. de carne Christi.</note> and are tyed so really vnto the same, that <hi>Abraham</hi> washed their feete, they tooke <hi>Lot</hi> by the arme, and by strong hand drew him forth out of Sodome; and <hi>Iacob</hi> wrestled a whole day with them. It is true indeed, they are supported sometimes by a body, for otherwise they could not be seene, because of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith) they are inuisible: yet wee are not to detract from the authoritie of Scriptures, that do cleerely teach vs that they haue no bodies of their owne: for wee must affirme with <hi>Tertullian:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tertul. de car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Christi.</note> 
                        <hi>Habere corpora peregrina sed non sua:</hi> They haue bodies (saith he) which they borrow, but haue none in their owne nature. Wee know that a Spirit did appeare vnto our grandmother <hi>Eue</hi> in the forme of a Serpent: yet was there neuer any of so blunt &amp; earthy an apprehension, that would affirme that this body of a Serpent was the body of an Angell. Wee are then to say, that this body was framed of one of the foure elements, not of fire, for it would burne: nor of water, for such a body would easily fleet away and be dissolued: nor of earth, for that would remaine sollid vnto the view, and should after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7439:252"/>
also bee found: it must therefore necessarily bee framed of aire, both because Spirits haue their places of abode from aboue, the good Spirits dwelling in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and the bad in the aire, as also for that this element doth easily take the impression of all colours &amp; formes: as we see what great variety of colours are in the raine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, and what diuersities of shapes and semblances bearing the formes of Dragons, Serpents, and the like, are represented vnto vs in the clowds. And these formes are dissolued into that from whence they were exhaled and drawne,<note place="margin">Tertul. lib. de carne Christ.</note> faith <hi>Tertullian: Eadem ratione species illa intercepta est, qua &amp; edita fuerat, si non fuit initium vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibile, nec finis.</hi> By which it appeareth that the Doue, that descended from heauen and lighted vpon Christ Iesus,<note place="margin">Matth. 3.</note> was fashioned of aire, and not of earth: for it is said, <hi>Descendit spiritus sanctus corporali specie sicut co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumba in ipsum.</hi> The like may be said of the firy tongues, that sate vpon the Apostles at the feast of Whitsontide:<note place="margin">Act. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Factus est repente de coelo sonus tanquam aduenientis spiritus vehementis.</hi> So that it is cleere that these appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances are framed of aire, as the cloud out of which God the Father spake to his Sonne in his transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which vanished into aire, as did <hi>Moyses</hi> also, whose body in that apparition was composed of the same element: and whiles the Apostles eyes were fixed on these obiects it vanished, and they saw none but Christ Iesus alone. So when the Angell appeared to <hi>Manoah</hi> the father of <hi>Samson,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iudic. 13.</note> he mounted vp into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in a flame of fire, and in his ascent was visibly seene of him: but by little and little <hi>Manoah</hi> and his wife lost the sight of him, because his body began to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue into the first matter whereof it was framed. Thus did the Angell that accompanied <hi>Tobias</hi> in his iourney, It is now time (said hee) for me to returne to him that sent me; and presently hee vanished from them. And for addition vnto the truth hereof, some alleage expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, saying, that if a man should cut such airie bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,

                        <note place="margin">Psell. lib. 1. de energia Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. c. 7. &amp; 23.</note> who in the seuenth chapter of his booke, maintaineth that they haue a naturall body, yet in the 23. chapter he granteth, that such bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing smit asunder, doe ioyne againe, as doth the aire when it is diuided; whence he might easily haue colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that these bodies must bee made of aire, and not proper vnto Angels. For touching the reason which he bringeth, that if they had not bodies, they could not be tormented with fire, it is certaine, that the diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence may easily bring to passe, that a body may real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worke vpon a spirit, and likewise the contrary: which no Christian can deny, to bee by diuine prouidence wrought in the Sacrament of Baptisme, where the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as the instrument of the diuine bountie, doth really and truly wash and purge the soule that is a spirit: and experience teacheth vs this truth in nature, for imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, which are corporall things, doe depresse the soule and make it heauie euen vnto death, as Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus himselfe said. Besides, by this reason we should say, that the soules of the damned being departed from this world, are not cast into hell-fire because they haue no bodies, and must therefore bee impassible: And so wee shal fall into their heresie, that maintaine that the soules lie sleeping till the day of iudgement, which doth dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly oppose the holy Scriptures; which shew vnto vs, that the soules of good men returne vnto God who hath created them, to be at quiet in his hands and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his protection; as S. <hi>Stephen</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Act. 7.

                        <hi>Domine suscipe spiritum meum:</hi> and S <hi>Paul</hi> wished for death to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, but to be with Christ, <hi>Cupio, inquit, dissolui &amp; esse cum Christo:</hi> which is confirmed by S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the Reuelation,<note place="margin">Apocal. 14.</note> saying, Henceforth doe the soules rest from their labours, for their good workes follow them; and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7439:253"/>
death (saith S. <hi>Paul</hi>) shall be a gaine vnto me: on the other side they teach that the soules of the reprobate are tormented in the flames of hell, as appeareth in the Gospell by the rich Glutton, and by the saying of Saint <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> who told the Pharisies, that the axe was alreadie applied vnto the roote of the tree, and euery tree that brought not foorth good fruite, should bee hewen downe and cast into the fire. This S. <hi>Iude</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth is already happened to the Sodomites,<note place="margin">Iud. in Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic.</note> as also to <hi>Chorah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiron</hi> with their complices, and that they went quicke downe to hell.</p>
                     <p>But here may an obiection be made, how Spirits are able to frame vnto themselues such bodies at their own pleasure? S. <hi>Augustine</hi> answereth, that Spirits by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine agilitie and naturall power can bring to passe whatsoeuer may be done in nature: for they doe perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly know not onely the effects of nature, but the causes also; which proceedeth from the refinednesse and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitie of spirit, wherewith they are indowed: which they so well know how to manage and applie, that whatsoeuer nature maketh successiuely and at leisure, they doe the same in an instant. We see the aire diuers times being disposed thereunto by certaine causes, is variously depainted with colours and diuers semblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and in the sommer wee sometimes see toades and frogs fall with the raine, which proceedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the aire, from whence also butter-flyes and catterpillers, and the like vermine are ingendred; all which is produced from the successiue operations of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The like effects may bee produced by Spirits, by vniting of causes, whereupon the effects doe necessarily follow. Thus we reade that the Diuell tooke vpon him the forme of a Serpent, which cannot be denied; as also that <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Magicians, by the assistance of Satan, did make serpents and frogs appeare before the people: and surely they may in the like manner shape and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit any other figure, yea of a man himselfe, as is cleere
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7439:253"/>
by the apparitions recited in the book of Genesis. From whence we must draw this necessarie conclusion, that it is contrary both to naturall reason, and to Scrip that Spirits should haue bodies, but that they are incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall and inuisible. The resolution of all this discourse may bee had in the booke intituled, <hi>De Ecclesiastic is dog matibus,</hi> which is amongst the workes of S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi> where in the 11. chapter he saith: We beleeue that God is inuisible and incorporeall, because hee is euery where, and is present in all places, yet not bounded in by any place: but we beleeue that intellectuall substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are corporeall, because they are circumscribed in a place, as the soule within the body: and hence it is that they are called corporeall, because they are limited in their substances. It remaineth that wee endeuour to know when they were created, since <hi>Moyses</hi> maketh no mention of it; and from whence it proceedeth, that there is a difference betwixt Spirits, so that some are good and some bad.</p>

themselues doth yet make no mention of Angels: whereupon the ancients haue endeauoured to giue a satisfying resolution heereunto, as S. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> S. <hi>Athanasius,</hi>

                        <hi>Theodoret</hi> and others. S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> particularly in two passages doth determine this point. I know well (saith hee, speaking vnto the people) that you are accustomed to demand, why it is not said, <hi>In principio creauit Deus Angelos &amp; Archangelos,</hi> as well as it is written, <hi>In principio creauit Deus coelum &amp; ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi> especially since Angels and Archangels are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly compositions of more noblenesse and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie then heauen or earth. You are to know (saith hee) that the holy Scripture is nothing else but a letter mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue, which God by his Ministers doth send vnto vs:<note place="margin">2. Paral 21.</note> no lesse then when wee read that <hi>Helias</hi> was sent from God vnto <hi>Ioram</hi> king of Israell with a letter missiue to reclaime him from his faults, and to instruct him in the will of God. Now when a great Lord writeth his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters missiue, hee doth accommodate the stile and matter of them vnto the qualitie and capacitie of the person vnto whom he doth addresse them: for hee must write to a Prince after one fashion, and after another fashion vnto a Philosopher, and in a different maner from these, when hee writeth to his wife or to his children. Now the first letter missiue, which God in his goodnes sent vnto man, was the fiue bookes of <hi>Moses,</hi> which hee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the people of Israel. This people of Israel, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom the letter was addressed, was a rude and an ignorant people, because they were newly infranchised from the slauery and seruitude of <hi>Egypt,</hi> where they had been for the space of 400 yeares very cruelly oppressed,<note place="margin">Exod. 1.</note> being all of them constrained to apply themselues to manuall trades and workes, as to gather straw and clay, &amp; to carry great baskets vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their shoulders ful of such stuffe, wherof they were afterwards to make bricks, and then to carry them where the Cities and Pyramides of <hi>Aegypt</hi> were a building: and this they daily did, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7439:254"/>
leasure to breath or to serue their God one day, as may be easily seene in the beginning of Exodus so that whatsoeuer was said of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> may very appositly be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied vnto this people: <hi>Diuertit ab oneribus dorsum eius,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 80. Arist. Polit. lib. 5. Socrat. lib. 3. Hist Eccles. cap. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>manus eius in cophino seruierunt.</hi> Which was the cause that they were a rude nation, &amp; altogether vnacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with good literature. And this is the peculiar slight of tyrants (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> writeth in his Politicks) who will not permit their subiects to study and attaine vnto learning: which was the practise of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostata against the Christians. They were all then very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant except <hi>Moses</hi> who was exempted from such rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, because he had his education in the Kings Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,<note place="margin">Act. 6.</note> and was the adopted sonne of King <hi>Pharaoes</hi> daughter, and this S. <hi>Stephen</hi> well obserueth, saying, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat Moses doctus in omni scientia Aegyptiorum:</hi> for he had skill in Astronomy, Geometry, and the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, but the rest of the people were exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant, and could not conceiue of any thing but what they could see with their eyes, which is the ordinary fashion of illiterate people, who are not able to eleuate their spirites higher then the earth, and laugh at Philosophers when they dispute of the roundnesse of the Sunne, of the height of heauen, and of the sphericall forme of the sea and earth: and heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it is that <hi>Moses</hi> saith to God, alas Lord,<note place="margin">Exod. 3.</note> I assure my selfe that they will not beleeue that which I shall say vnto them, for when I shall speak of thee Lord, what fashion shall I hold in my discourse to make thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty knowen vnto them, since their apprehensions doe sauour so much of earth and dulnesse. But God answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, it shall be sufficient for thee to tell them, that hee <hi>(who is)</hi> hath spoken vnto thee: for hee would not that hee should speake vnto them in a higher straine then of his being onely, which is a thing common and agreeable to the least creature of the world, although if these words bee vnderstood by nature, not by partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7439:255"/>
they haue a high and mysterious meaning: but this distinction was not mentioned vnto them, because he would fit his discourse to their vnderstandings. And this is the very opinion of S. <hi>Dydimus,</hi> who sheweth, that according to the diuersitie of tymes and persons there came Prophets and others in the name of God:<note place="margin">Dydimus lib. 2 de Spiritu S.</note> some with the name of him that was Almighty, others with the name of him that was replenished with all goodnes, and others with the name of vnappeasable ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and iustice. And thus (saith hee) was <hi>Moses</hi> sent vnto this rude people with the name of him <hi>That is,</hi> for God would at that time exact nothing from them, but that they should vnderstand that the God of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers is, and was not like the false Gods of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who indeed were not, because they had not so much as an existence which is the least that any thing may haue. In like manner when Christ Iesus did addresse himselfe vnto the seauen Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 3.</note> hee set downe diuers attributes of his Maiestie in the beginning of those let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters according to the diuersitie of persons. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> preaching at <hi>Athens</hi> among the Philosophers did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely decline to make particular mention of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but thought it sufficient to expresse vnto them that there was a God who created heauen and earth: <hi>Deus (inquit) qui fecit mundum,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>&amp; omniae quae in eo sunt coeli &amp; terrae 'Dominus, non in manu factis Templis habitat.</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> also in his first sermon to the Iewes, doth not at the first cast plainely expresse that Christ Iesus was the true God, but accommodating himselfe vnto them hee is contented, if at the first he may winne thus much vpon their beleefe, that Christ Iesus was a holy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent man sent from God,<note place="margin">Act. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Iesum (inquit) Nazare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num virum approbatum a Deo signis &amp; virtutibus:</hi> but afterwards he speaketh vnto them in a higher straine, hauing once prepared them for more diuine instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And so heere likewise in processe of time did God manifest vnto this people, that there were Angels, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7439:255"/>
that they had their creation from him, as wee shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently see. Which is also more expresly vnfoulded in the new Testament, at what time men grew more familiar and better acquainted with the secrets of God. This is S. <hi>Chrysostoms</hi> reason which is very probable and fit to be admitted.<note place="margin">Athanas. 41. ad Annoc. princip.</note> S. <hi>Athanasius</hi> yeeldeth another reason saying that this people was exceeding ready to beleeue and admit plurality of Gods, which in processe of time they tooke from the superstitions of the Egyptians: which conceite being once growne into an habite and custome, it did at length become almost naturall vnto them, and brake out openly in the desert,<note place="margin">Exod. 32. Deut. 6.</note> when they said<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n the plurall number, <hi>Hi sunt dij tui Israel quite eduxerunt de terra Aegypti.</hi> And hereupon God tooke occasion to insist vpon the explication of this in the first commandement of the Law, (which saith, <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Deus tuus Deus vnus est)</hi> longer then vpon all the rest of the commandements,<note place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> because the people were so much inclined to this plurality of Gods, and had then lately made and worshipped a Calfe. Which they may doe well to obserue, who because it is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards said, Thou shalt not make any likenesse of any thing that is in heauen or in earth, doe conceite that this is the second commandement, and aske the cause why Curats doe not so pronounce the same in their seruice, not vnderstanding that the Curate doth pronounce but a short summary of the commandements of God, and that this whereof they complaine, is not properly a commandement, but a more ample exposition of the first commandement, against which the people had for a long time most transgressed. Therefore doth S. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius</hi> well obserue, that it was not safe to mention Angels vnto them, because they would presently haue thought them Gods: which <hi>Carpocrates, Basilides,</hi> and other disciples of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> also did,<note place="margin">Iren. lib. 1. Tertul. de prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script. baeret.</note> as S. <hi>Ireneus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> haue written. Whereunto we may adde a third reason drawne from the more moderne diuines,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7439:256"/>
and that is,<note place="margin">Iacob. Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politanus E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscop. in Psal. 81. Rom. 10. Heb. 2.</note> that Christ Iesus was the end and scope of the law, who was to take vpon him the flesh of <hi>Adam,</hi> and not the nature of Angels as S. <hi>Paul</hi> noteth, <hi>Finis legis Christus &amp; nusquam Angels apprehendit, sed se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Abrahae apprehendit.</hi> Since then Christ Iesus was not to be the Redeemer of Spirits, but of men. <hi>Moses</hi> did with good reason passe ouer Angels in silence, and bounded his discourse with the mention of visible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ouer whom man had dominion, that in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion hee might inferr that man alone had the priuiledge to bee made after Gods image and likenesse, that in the end hee might be deifyed and made a partner in the diuine nature thorow Iesus Christ. By which hee thought to leade and conduct man the more easily vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the knowledge of the grace of God towards him, since that he had more remembrance of him then of the Angels themselues, who were iustly passed ouer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mentioning, if wee consider hou much our humane nature was honoured by the diuine word: so that hee who is God adored by all, is a man as wee are; being as absolutely man as I am, and being as truely man, as he is truely God. And this is the conclusion which S. <hi>Paul</hi> maketh against the Iewes when he speaketh of Angels: <hi>Nusquam Angelos apprehendit, sed semen Abrahae.</hi> It is also manifest that the old Testament maketh no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the sinne of <hi>Lucifer</hi> and his adherents, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly and by glances, as when the haughty minded men are compared vnto him, so in <hi>Esai</hi> the 14. chap. where mention is made of <hi>Nabuchodonosor</hi> King of Babilon,<note place="margin">Esay. 14. Ezechiel. 18.</note> and in <hi>Ezechiel</hi> 18. where the King of <hi>Thir</hi> is described, both of them being meruailous proud and presumptuous against God; they are (saith the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) like vnto <hi>Lucifer.</hi> But of set purpose there is no relation made hereof except it bee incidentally,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> and (as wee say) <hi>per accidens.</hi> For Christ Iesus did pay no ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some for wicked Spirits as he had done for men, but he hath clearly declared himselfe, that hell fire is from all
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7439:256"/>
eternity prepared <hi>Diabolo &amp; Angelis eius.</hi> But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Moses</hi> did not make direct mention of them,<note place="margin">Genes. 1.</note> yet did hee tacitly insinuate the same, when hee saith of the seauen daies, that they followed one the other, and that the heauens went on in their course, making day &amp; night, euening and morning, which could not possibly be without the ministry and helpe of Angels. Moreouer when he concludeth <hi>Igitur perfecti sunt, coeli &amp; terra &amp; omnis ornatus eorum,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Genes. 2.</note> by the perfect ornament of heauen he meaneth Angels. For that excellent ornament which addeth such grace vnto the heauens is their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without which (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> himselfe well knew) the heauen could beame downe no influence vpon the earth, as is intimated by S. <hi>Iohn</hi> when hee saith,<note place="margin">Apocal 10.</note> 
                        <hi>Iurauit per viuentem in secula quod non erit ampllus tempus.</hi> For if wee should say, behold a perfect man, this speech doth import that hee hath a soule, and that his body is disposed and fitted for those motions which are naturall vnto man.<note place="margin">Chrysost ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. in Genes.</note> Whereupon S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> admonisheth that by this ornament wee are not to vnderstand the light or starrs onely, but many other perfections, both of higher and baser consideration. But because this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of speaking is very obscure, S. <hi>Athanasius,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Theodoret in Epitom diuin. decret. lib. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi> and S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> moue the question, whether the Scriptures doe directly say that the Angels were created by God or no: and their resolutions are that they doe so say. First King <hi>Dauid</hi> maketh vs an expresse Psalme touching the creation of the world, where hee speaketh generally of all creatures, Spirituall, rationall, sensible, terrestriall; as also those creatures who haue their being in the water and aire in the 103. Psalme,<note place="margin">Psal. 103.</note> where he beginneth to speake of the Maiestie of God in this manner, <hi>Confessionem siue maiestatem &amp; deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem induisti, amictus lumine, siout vestimento:</hi> next hee speaketh of the heauens saying, Thou hast stretched them our ouer vs like a tent; then doth hee adioyne the Angels, <hi>Qui facis Angelos tuos Spiritus,</hi> who makest
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7439:257"/>
(saith he) thy Angels Spirits. Where by the way wee may obserue for our better information in this and the like places of Scripture, that the Hebrews haue but three tenses in their verbes, the Praeter-perfect tense, the present, and future tense; and haue not the vse as the Greeks and Latins haue of the praeter-imperfect and praeterpluperfect tenses, whence it ariseth that the present tense with the Hebrewes may (as the sentence will beare it) bee translated by the praeterimperfect tense, as also by the praeterperfect, and by the praeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluperfect tense. And this is practised by the Hebrewes in this very passage of Scripture, as if they should say in latine, <hi>Quifaciebas Angelos Spiritus</hi>; that is to say, Lord in the time of creation thou diddest make and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion these Spirits, to bee the messengers and ministers of thy good pleasure. By which place <hi>Dauid</hi> doth not onely shew that God created Angels,<note place="margin">Hierom. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistol. ad Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum. S. Thom. 1. p. q 61. ap. 3. Psal. 148.</note> but also, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the opinion of the Greekes and Latins, that the Angels were created, when God made heauen and earth, and not as some would say, many thousands of yeares before: so that it is not chancefully done, that he first made mention of the essence of God, and then of Angels, and last of all of other creatures. The same methode he obserueth in the 148. Psalme, where he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiteth all things to praise their Creator, and doth not omit the Angels, but placeth them in the first rank, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Laudate eum omnes Angeli eius, laudate eum om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes virtutes eius,</hi> and concludeth that God fashioned and created them as hee hath done all other creatures; <hi>quoniam ipse dixit &amp; facta sunt, ipse mandauit, &amp; crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta sunt.</hi> The same order is obserued by the three men that were cast into the firy furnace at Babilon, who in their thanksgiuing doe inuite all the workes of Gods hand to blesse their Creator, and descending to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they bring in the Angels as the excellentest cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures of all, harmoniously to sing and say, <hi>Benedicite omnia opera Domini Domino,</hi>

                        <hi>&amp; inuisibilia, siue Throni, siue dominationes, siue principatus, siue potestates, omnia per ipsum &amp; in ipso creata sunt.</hi> And this doth vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly confute al the Manicheans, Marcionists, and other sectaries and disciples of <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> So that wee may from hence conclude, that God did create all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels good at first, that is, perfect in all goodnesse both of nature and grace: for whatsoeuer God made, he saw that it was passing good, as <hi>Moses</hi> expresseth it: and towards the end of his Bookes hee giueth a reason of the same vnto the people, saying, <hi>Dei perfecta sunt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera:</hi> Whereunto agreeth the wise-man,<note place="margin">Genes. 2. Deut. 32.</note> who giueth vs to vnderstand, that God made all things in number, waight and measure,<note place="margin">Sapient. 11. Ioan 8. August. lib. 11. de ciuit. cap. 18.</note> in which the most captious can not finde the least discord or blemish. And Christ Iesus himselfe doth assure vs, that the Diuell did not persist in the truth, that is, in his first integrity wherein hee was created: and that hee was once in heauen, but was fallen from thence like lightning. S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Iude</hi> doe giue the reason of this fall,<note place="margin">Iud. in canon. 2 Petri. 2.</note> because, say they, hee
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7439:258"/>
sinned against God, which sinne being folded vp in the pleates of malice and obstinacy, was without the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of remission and pardon. The same meaning hath <hi>Iob</hi> in the 4. chapter,<note place="margin">Iob. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>In Angelis suis reperit pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitatem.</hi> And although there were no other text sutable vnto this purpose, then that which is alleaged in Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> where Christ Iesus doth foretell, that he will cast the Diuell and his Angels into hell fire, yet would this bee an argument sufficient (as <hi>Theodoret</hi> well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth) to prooue that he was created in perfection and goodnesse,<note place="margin">Theodoret. lib.

Hence it is that S. <hi>Augustine</hi> doth worthily reprooue <hi>Porphiry</hi> the Philosopher, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his assertion was, that there were a kinde of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, who from their first nature were originally euill and deceitfull. This proceeded not from their nature (saith he) but from their will. It remaineth now, that we declare what manner of sinne it was, whereof they were conuicted.<note place="margin">August. lib. 14. de ciuit. cap. 3.</note> S. <hi>Augustine</hi> giueth vs the resolution heereof, saying, Since they are Spirits, wee are not to conceiue, that they were fornicatours, drunkards, or addicted to any of those grosse vices, which haue their sting in the flesh: but we are to obserue, that there are two sorts of sinnes; the first are spirituall, because they are proper to spirituall substances, such as are pride, and enuy: the other are carnall, and proceed from the flesh. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> spake not this of his owne head,<note place="margin">August. lib de ciuit. 15.</note> but grounded it vpon the Scripture, which specifying the sinnes that are peculiar vnto Satan, maketh mention of these;<note place="margin">Esay. 14. Ezech. 18.</note> as <hi>Esay</hi> and <hi>Ezechiel</hi> when they would exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the great ouer-weening and pride of the Kings of Babylon and Thir, he maketh a comparison betwixt <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer</hi>
                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:7439:258"/>
and them. And our Sauiour when he saw his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to be a little pussed vp and swolne in spirit, because at their words and commandement the Diuels were cast out, Reioyce not (saith hee) in this,<note place="margin">Luc. 10.</note> for I saw Satan fall from heauen like lightning: by which words hee insinuated thus much, that the downe fall of the Diuell proceeded from pride. S. <hi>Paul</hi> also in his admonition vnto Bishops that they should be humble,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. cap. 2</note> doth charge the Bishop not to bee pussed vp with pride, least hee should fall into the same condemnation with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell. Touching the sinne of enuy, it is also written <hi>Inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia Diaboli mors intrauit in orbem terrarum.</hi> And the reason why mention of mankinde is made heerein, is, to giue vs to vnderstand, that the Diuell fell not into the sinne of enuy, till after the creation of man, and that pride was his peculiar sinne, for the which he was thrust out of heauen. Now whether it were, that by reason of his great endowments of nature, hee did so farre ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance his owne worth, that hee might conceite that hee was able to make himselfe an associate and partaker in the diuine nature (which is the highest degree whereunto an intellectuall substance may aspire) and that by his owne naturall and peculiar forces (as <hi>Esai</hi> and <hi>Exechiel</hi> doe seeme to imply) or whether he would not acknowledge Christ Iesus the Mediatour of men and Angels for his head, which mystery might by reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation be proposed vnto him, (as it was afterwards also vnfolded vnto <hi>Adam</hi> and all the fathers of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament) it is most certaine that from his owne will, and in the pride of his heart, he rebelled against God, so that there was a battell fought in heauen, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that Spirites combat one against another, by a strong renitency and resistance of the ones will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the others, euen as wee also fight against them. But the good Angels would by no meanes adhere or fauour that damnable attempt, but resisted it with all their forces, accomplishing that which is written of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7439:259"/>
them.<note place="margin">Psal. 102.</note> 
                        <hi>Benedicite Domino omnes Angeli eius potentes virtute, qui facitis verbum eius, ad audiendani vocem sermonum eius.</hi> Thus were the euill Spirits thrust out of heauen for their pride, whereas the good Spirits were still made blessed in the participation of the vision and presence of God. This did Christ signifie vnto his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, when out of pride they demanded of him, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them should bee the greatest in the kingdome of heauen: hee tooke a litle childe by the hand saying, if you become not like vnto this litle childe,<note place="margin">Matth. 18.</note> yee cannot enter into that kingdome: and beware how you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend one of these litle ones, for their Angels doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes see the face of my Father which is in heauen: whereby he giueth to vnderstand, that children by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their naturall humility are like vnto Angels, which Angels by this meanes doe see the face of God. Since this great reuolte in heauen, there hath euer been a contrariety and warre betweene the will's of good and bad spirits, and betweene good and bad men also: as between <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Cain: Isaac</hi> and <hi>Ismael: Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau.</hi> And this is it which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> speaketh of in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalypse,<note place="margin">Apoc. 12. Iudic. in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonic.</note> that there was a great battell in heauen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels, &amp; the Dragon with his Angels: and S. <hi>Iude</hi> bringeth in the same <hi>Michael,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputing and chiding with Satan. Since therefore hee is full of wickednesse, and altogether depriued of the grace of God, he can doe nothing but what is naught, and because hee cannot wreake his malice vpon the Saints in Paradise, hee conuerteth his fury against man, that is made after the image of God, and is heere seated vpon the earth, that hee may worship his Creator, and acknowledge and serue him with his whole heart, that so he may at length participate of that diuine glory and felicity, which the Diuell by reason of his pride is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly depriued of, as we haue already alleaged.

And although we had no other proofe, then that generall rule of Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> it might sufficiently euince the same: for these are his very words; <hi>Omnium doctorum opinio est, quod aër iste,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hieron. lib. 3. in Epist. ad Ephes. ad cap. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>qui coelum &amp; terram medius diuidens, inane appellatur, plenus sit contrarys fortitudinibus.</hi> Since then there was neuer any Doctor of the Church, which made scruple of the truth hereof, wee must thinke that they had good warrant for the same from the Scripture. They did no doubt consider, that our Lord in the parable of the seede, did by the birds of heauen, which deuoured the corne,<note place="margin">Luke 8.</note> vnderstand and also interpret it to be the Diuels, whom he calleth the birds of heauen, thereby meaning the aire, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the vsuall Hebrew phrase, and agreeable vnto our maner of speech also, who commonly say, the raine falleth from heauen, when the meaning is, from the aire. For as S. <hi>Ierome</hi> hath well obserued, all Philosophers doe agree in their opinions,<note place="margin">Hieron. vbi supra.</note> that the clouds (by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluing of which the raine is engendred) are not drawne vp aboue two miles at the most from the earth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the distance betwixt heauen and earth is incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably

greater. And this is S. <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning, when hee telleth the Ephesians,<note place="margin">Ephes. 6.</note> that our fight is not chiefly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst men, but against the princes of this world, which are the wicked spirits, that haue their abode aboue in high places: and as himselfe explaneth all these autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities in the second chapter of the same Epistle, by these high places he meaneth the aire: <hi>Secundum seculum mundi huius</hi> (saith hee) <hi>secundum principem potestatis aëris huius, spiritus qui nunc operaetur in filios diffiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Luke 8. Matth. 8.</note> where it is related, that the Diuels besought Christ Iesus, not to send them out into the deepe, but rather into the heard of swine: and they doe likewise complaine vnto our Sauiour, saying, <hi>Vt quid venisti ante tempus torquere nos?</hi> As if they should haue said, we are assured of our totall and vtter damnation, but the time thereof is not yet come, for this shall bee put in execution at the last day of iudgement, which being not yet present, thou maist doe well to leaue vs in these parts, vntill that time approch. The like may be said of that place in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation,<note place="margin">Apoc. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>Vah mari &amp; terrae, quia descendit diabolus ad vos, habens iram magnam:</hi> and it is againe declared in the same booke, that our aduersarie the diuell was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone. And that wee may resolue, what the difference is betweene the diuels that are in hell, and those whose abode is in the aire, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though S. <hi>Ierome</hi> maketh daintie to meddle with it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he conceiued it to be from the matter, whereof he
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7439:260"/>
intreated,<note place="margin">Hieron. lib. 3. comment. in epist. ad Ephes.</note> as also for that hee feared (as himselfe excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it) lest hee should trespasse too farre vpon the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders patience, in dwelling so long vpon this argument; yet will we speake somewhat of the same, because this present discourse doth demaund it. It is an infallible truth, that there are great multitudes of wicked spirits, who abide in that gloomie region of the aire, and come also lower and neerer vnto vs, which God in his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath and doth permit. First, because himselfe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth these his creatures, although it be in base and seruile offices; as a King or ciuill Iustice are accustomed to condemne certaine malefactors not vnto death, but vnto the performance of some worke, which aduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth these offenders nothing at all, but is onely charged with laboriousnesse and toyle, and tendeth meerely to the publike good. Thus were many in times past ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, or confined to some Isle or mountaine, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and digge in the Quarries of Marble, for the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces profit and behoofe, and did euer carrie their chaines of iron on their feete, and had a good guard to watch them. The like is done vnto those that are slaues in the Galleys. Secondly, for our exercise,<note place="margin">Bernard. Hieron. Ioco citato. &amp; Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust. contra Faust. Manich.</note> as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> hath it, and it is also the obseruation of S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth this vnto the Iebusites, Philistins, and other bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous people, that by diuine permission were left in the borders and skirts of the land of promise, to exercise the people of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes, who otherwise would haue spurned at Gods commandements: and these were the type and figure of those wicked spirits, that Christ Iesus after his death and passion, was to leaue in the aire, to exercise vs in whatsoeuer is good and praise-worthy: as sand which of it selfe is fruitlesse and barren, yet serueth very fitly to scoure and make bright the vessels of gold or of siluer, which are carefully looked vnto in the great house of a father of a familie. Thus was <hi>Iob</hi> exercised, and thus haue all good men been tried, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> witnesseth of himselfe and saith,<note place="margin">Iob 1. 2. Cor. 12.</note> that hee endured the buffetings of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7439:261"/>
Satan:<note place="margin">Ephes. 6.</note> and doth conclude in the Epistle aboue cited, where he mentioneth these things, that Christ our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, doth by the merits of his death and passion lend vnto vs all, a compleate armour, that so we may be the true champions of God. The sword is the word of God (saith he) the helmer, hope: the corslet, charitie: and the shield,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.</note> faith, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>Cuiresistite fortes in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de.</hi> To be briefe, if wee be thus armed, the Diuell shall haue no power ouer vs,<note place="margin">August. lib. de natura &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, cap. 58.</note> as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> obserueth. First, because as soone as wee brandish these spirituall wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons against him, hee presently turneth his backe and flieth from vs, which S. <hi>Iames</hi> also witnesseth, <hi>Resistite</hi> (saith he) <hi>Diabolo,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iames 4.</note> 
                        <hi>&amp; fugiet à vobis.</hi> Secondly, because he can doe no good vpon those that doe resist him, and onely gaineth on those that make no preparation to stand against him, <hi>Non vincit nisi volentem.</hi> Being ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering so neere about vs, they haue yet a curbe &amp; snaffle to restraine them, and that is Gods prouidence, which either by the ministerie of good Angels, or otherwise as it shall seeme good vnto him, doth hold in their rage and malice with so strong a hand, that they haue no power to do that which is within the compasse of their naturall forces,<note place="margin">Tertul. lib. de fuga in perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut.</note> and like slaues they are faine first to aske leaue of God, before they dare attempt any thing. Thus we see the Diuell asked leaue of God to afflict <hi>Iob</hi> in his person and goods;<note place="margin">Iob. 1.</note> and the Diuels mentioned in the Gospell dared not to enter into the swine, vntill they had gotten particular license from Christ Iesus,<note place="margin">Matth. 8.</note> as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> sheweth at large. Of this curbe S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, when he saith,<note place="margin">1. Corinth. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>Fidelis Deus qui non patietur vos tentari supra id quod potestis.</hi> He permitteth Satan to do many things, but with such limitations, that those assaults wherwithal he would force vs, are neuer aboue our abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of resistance. We are not therefore to dispute, and aske the reason why God afflicteth one man more then another, and that by such diuersities of temptations, let it suffice that he knoweth, when a young man like
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7439:261"/>
vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> hath both courage and force to encounter with the Giant <hi>Goliah,</hi> which attempt would haue crushed in peeces the strongest men in Israel, as flesh and blood would haue conceiued. The Diuell doth thus trie and exercise vs, both out of malice which hee beareth towards God, and out of enuie which hee car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth vnto vs; by which hee doth daily make full the measure of his punishments. For wee are to note, that those Diuels, who after their creation offended most by their pride, malice and ingratitude, were cast into the deepest dungeon of hell, and are already tortured with all the extremitie that may bee; but they that did not transgresse in that heighth of wickednesse, fell no lower then the aire, and do there acquire vnto themselues new damnation, not in their depriuation of the vision of God, for that is common to them all, but in the acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and increase of paine in the pit of hell. And this the Doctors of S. <hi>Ieromes</hi> time were wont to relate,<note place="margin">Hieron lib. 1. comment. in Matth. cap. 5.</note> saying, that if a Christian did resist the Diuels tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he doth not only aduantage himselfe thereby, but doth doe a good turne vnto the Diuell his aduersarie, because by this meanes hee is not punishable with so great torments, as if hee had ouercome the Christian: whereas else he should be plagued for the same, in that he was the cause of that sinne. Hereupon it is that the Diuels were afraid to be sent into the deepes,<note place="margin">Luke 8. The chaine wherewithall they are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</note> after they had a long time tempted and tormented the poore Iew. This prouidence of God hath in like sort withheld it selfe from casting them all into the lowest bottome of the pit of hell, although they are tied vp for the most part in some quarter of the world: which is nothing else, but when God commandeth them not to budge from a certaine set place, and restraineth their workings elsewhere. And this ligation, or chaining vp, is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test torment vnto them that may be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that wee are to conceiue, that by this restraint and confinement they are as it were cooped vp in a cage; and are not able to flie vp and downe to execute their purposes, by reason of this compulsorie detainment: but are infinitly vexed at this commandement which God imposeth vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thus must the passage in the booke of <hi>Tobias</hi> be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,<note place="margin">Tob. 8.</note> where it is said, that <hi>Raphael</hi> tooke the Diuell <hi>Asmodeus</hi> (which in Hebrew signifieth a banished man) and banished him into the desert of the vpper Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt: and in like manner that passage in the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse is thus to be interpreted,<note place="margin">Apoc. 20.</note> where it is said that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan was bound and loosed againe: which importeth nothing but this, that all his power and actiuitie was for a time taken from him by God, and was afterwards restored vnto him againe. For in the last daies of the world he shall be vntied,<note place="margin">Apoc. 16. &amp; 2. ad Thess. 2.</note> and shall haue full permission giuen vnto him to powre foorth all his rage and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome vpon the children of God, yea so farre shall the authoritie of <hi>Antichrist</hi> gaine vpon the world, as that they shall be able to worke miracles, as to make fire vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly to descend from heauen, and such like wonders, described at large by S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the Reuelation.<note place="margin">Apoc. 20.</note> But the Diuell is now tied vp from doing of these things, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in his owne nature he be able to doe as much mischiefe as hee did in <hi>Iobs</hi> time, and as hee will doe, when <hi>Antichrist</hi> shall bee borne. Hee was confined and chained vp by the death and passion of Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, from speaking any more by Oracles, as appeareth by the Apocalypse, and as experience it selfe teacheth vs: but when the end of the world shall approch, hee shall speake vnto men in a more familiar manner, and shall appeare vnto them in a visible shape. All which discourses are epitomized in a word by Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi>

It also plainly appeareth by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which the good old father <hi>Anthonius Monachus</hi> had thereof,<note place="margin">Athon. in vita Anth.</note> whose history is written at large by Saint <hi>Athanasius</hi> for in that discourse it seemeth, that this good man was selected by God himselfe, expresly to indure the assaults of Satan both sensibly and visibly so that we may learne from him what the subtilties of the Diuell are, and what meanes we haue to keepe vs from his snares and ambushes. Touching the first visible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition of Satan, which is described in the third chap. of Genes.<note place="margin">Genes. 3.</note> it thereby appeareth that he may take a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble body vpon him, and so appeare vnto men, not that it is in his power to take a body vpon him when hee pleaseth,<note place="margin">Chrysost hom. 4. de Lazaro. August. lib. 2. de gene. ad litt. S. Thom. 2.2. q. 165. art. 2. ad 2.</note> for the confusion and danger that might grow thereby would be exceeding great. <hi>Repraesentaret enim se vxori tanquam maritus, seruo tanquam Dominus, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligioso tanquam Praelatus, poenitenti tanquam Confessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, &amp; sic nullus esset securus, &amp; tentaremur suprae id quod possemus,</hi> 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10. <hi>Et esset contra prouiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam Dei.</hi> He is therefore inhibited and restrained by the omnipotencie of God, as both S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and S. <hi>Thomas</hi> doe notably shew: but God doth sometimes permit the same, partly to force a beleefe vpon our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, that there are wicked spirits, which pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise nothing else then how they may destroy vs, and partly to informe vs how foule and vgly these vncleane spirits bee, since the time that they were chased from
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7439:263"/>
God, and tooke armes against him. For now the Diuell appeares in a fearfull and hideous shape, as in the forme of a Serpent, or some such deformed beast. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the beginning of the Bible he is set foorth vnto vs like a venomous snake, which is agreeable vnto the second reason, and in the beginning of the Gospell preached by Christ Iesus, he is described to be one full of talke and pratling (which-answereth the first reason) but he hath no other end in this talke then to snare vs, and to breake our neckes. And from the abundance of his cunning, his custome is to accommodate and fit himselfe vnto the humour of those whom hee would circumuent; wherein he sheweth himselfe to bee Gods ape, who doth descend vnto our capacitie and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and doth practise that saying of <hi>Paul: Omnia omnibus factus sum,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>vt omnes lucrifacerem.</hi> Thus when the Diuell commeth vnto a silly woman that hath little knowledge, but what by nature and sense is prompted to her, he wil straight begin to derogate from God, and to make it questionable whether those things that are affirmed of him be true, or no. And because he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that this sex is very liquorous of honour and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, he will not stick to make large promises vnto them. And in the third place, beside the exquisite meates and drinkes, he further promiseth vnto them all sensuall and fleshly pleasures whatsoeuer: all which temptations are easily discerned in the assaults which hee vsed, to tempt the first woman,<note place="margin">Genes. 2. 2. Cor. 11.</note> who representeth vnto vs all those that forget God and his blessings. For it is a certaine truth, that if hee had applied himselfe vnto <hi>Adam,</hi> hee would haue laboured his subuersion by more couert &amp; guile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes then hee vsed towards the woman. And therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> attributeth the glory of this conquest to haue proceeded from a womanish simplicitie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding in these words: <hi>Ne sicut serpens seduxit Euam, ita seducantur sensus vestri à simplicitate quae est in Christo Iesu.</hi> But when he was to tempt Christ Iesus, he
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7439:263"/>
tooke another course, for without any derogation from God (because a man of a setled vnderstanding and faith doth abhorre such grossenes, and stoppeth his eares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it) hee beginneth with that which seemeth to haue no apparancie of euill, but rather to haue bin vsed by holy men, as <hi>Moyses</hi> did by his prayer change the blood of the riuer into water, and made the rocke to gush forth with fresh and wholesome streames, as it is written: <hi>Qui conuertit petram in stagna aquarum,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 113.</note> for then the people were in great extremitie for water. So he laboured to perswade Christ Iesus to make the stones bread,<note place="margin">Matth. 4.</note> when as it might seeme hee had neede of suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and was in the desert as <hi>Moyses</hi> was. Secondly, knowing that Christ Iesus was conuersant in the holie Scriptures, and would be most attentiue vnto them, he alleageth diuers passages from thence. And being able to doe no good that way, he offereth vnto him the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie of the world; knowing, that science puffeth vp those that haue no charitie, and maketh them beleeue that they are able to sit at the sterne, and gouerne the whole world better then any other whatsoeuer. To conclude, he resembleth the Crocadiles of Aegypt, who when they perceiue a traueller neere vnto Nilus, they begin to faine the voyce of a man, weeping and taking on as if they had great neede of succour, and when the poore man shall simply make his approch, he is sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deuoured. S. <hi>Athanasius</hi> reciteth, that on a time the Diuell did thus plaine himselfe,<note place="margin">Athan. in vita Ant.</note> neere vnto the Cell of of that godly Father <hi>Antonius,</hi> who demanding him what he was, hee answered (when hee saw that hee was discouered) that he had iust cause to complaine, for all the world did taxe and burthen him to be the author of all the villanies that were done, although he were very innocent and free from any such matter. And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hee would sing Psalmes, the better to insinuate himselfe vnto him; but hee stopped his eares against him, and would take no heed what the Diuell did sing,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7439:264"/>
practising that which is written,<note place="margin">Psal. 37.</note> 
                        <hi>Ego autem tanquam surdus non audiebam.</hi> At other times he presented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe before him with great glorie, transforming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into an Angell of light; but he shut his eyes, and would not gaze vpon the beautie of Satan: so that when hee perceiued that he could gaine nothing by all these baites and allurements, (for by his often prayers, weeping, and fasting, hee had obtained the gift which S. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth <hi>discretio spiritum</hi>) he then came vpon him with a hideous noise to affright him,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.</note> sometimes appearing in the semblance of a Dragon, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the shape of some other dreadfull beast: and then he would stand before him like a man, but of such an enormous and vast size and stature, that he seemed greater then any giant, and did touch the cloudes with his head, although his feete stood vpon the ground. Then would hee make a great noise as if the Cell had been inuironed with horses, chariots, and armed men; but he euer recommended himselfe vnto God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded not these collusions of the Diuell, remembring that which is written:<note place="margin">Psal. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>Hi in curribus, &amp; hi in equis, nos autem in nomine Domini nostri inuocabimus.</hi> The Diuell forgot not to cast wedges of gold in his way by which he was to passe, that so he might baite him with auarice, yet at the signe of the crosse (saith S. <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>) they all presently vanished. He also appeared vnto him in the shape of a woman to tempt him vnto the sin of the flesh; and when by none of these meanes hee could preuaile against him, hee then began to exhort him to watch,<note place="margin">Vide Aug. lib. 2 de ciuit. c 26.</note> and spend the whole night in prayers, to fast often, and to practise all other spirituall exercises, that so hee might either breed a disgust of these things in him, as being perswaded thereunto by the enemie of nature, or at the least, that hee might seeme to do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at his request: but this holy man, who might well say with S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Cor. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>non ignoramus astutias eius,</hi> did not for all that, disaccustome his holy exercises, but rather
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7439:264"/>
encreased his deuotion, not because the Diuell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it, but because Christ Iesus taught it both by word and example: knowing well that whatsoeuer the Diuel saith or doth, it is for an ill purpose,<note place="margin">Luc. 4.</note> and therefore by how much the lowder hee was in his confession, that Christ Iesus was the Sonne of God, by so much the more did Christ check his speech, and commanded him to silence. The last way which hee vsed was in chiding him for his austerity of life, shewing vnto him that this was a rigorous, strict &amp; burthensome way, and it would be a means to hasten his destruction being one of Gods creatures, rather then to enable him for his seruice, and that it was no sin to vse the creatures of God freely with thanksgiuing, so that there were no excesse or gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundizing in the same. Lastly, hee threatned to beate him and to kill him by breaking his neck. But hee was readily answered, that since hee could not hurt the least sheepe that <hi>Iob</hi> had,<note place="margin">Iob. 1. Matth. 8. Luc. 8.</note> nor enter into the heard of swine without leaue, much lesse could he endamage a man who is sheltered vnder the wing of Gods protection, and who hath the haires of his head numbred, so that not one of them can fall to the ground without the expresse will of God.</p>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7439:265"/>
from two plentifull fountaines. Therefore as at the first he,<note place="margin">Esa. 14.</note> together with his Angels did sinne thorow pride, and would iniuriously inuade God, and share with him in equality of glory, so doth he still persist in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersenes, and remaineth hardned thorow the great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency and obduratnesse which swayeth in him, in somuch that he doth not yet forbeare to say in his heart, <hi>Similis ero altissimo.</hi> This he practised from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for if we behold what manner of conference hee held with the woman, it is easily seene, that hee did driue all vnto this head, that she would worship him as a God. When a tyrant would by vsurpation take vpon him another mans kingdome, hee laboureth to eclipse the naturall Prince, and to perswade all men that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe ought to be receiued and acknowledged for their true soueraigne: so when Satan would perswade <hi>Eue,</hi> that God did grudge and enuy them, and would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much grieued that they should bee aduanced vnto that height, whereunto their owne excellency did car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them, the conclusion and inference that was to bee made thereupon, could imply nothing else but that they were to conceiue that this God was not the true God, because the true God like a true father wil straine his vttermost endeauours, to set his childrens fortunes high and in the top of honour: and further, since he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to bee thought such a one as did long for nothing more then their aduancement, and seemed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to appeare, and to speake familiarly vnto them, although hee was of an inuisible nature, and of a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance more refined and excellent then theirs, yet did he make shew that hee was willing to direct and guide them to the supreamest felicity, euen to bee like vnto God; from thence be might easily conclude that he was the true God, and therefore as the true God was to be worshipped by them. Neither was his purpose wholly frustrated, for many nations haue since conceiued, that the Serpent, which spake by the Serpent, was the true

All this digression tendeth to no other end, then to declare that the true intendment of that old Serpent the Diuel, was, to make himselfe to bee adored as a God, which doth clearly appeare in the whole progresse of those temptations which he vsed against Christ Iesus: for the last assault he reserued these words, which were indeed the very marke and scope whereunto he leuelled all his temptations,<note place="margin">Matth. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Si cadens adoraueris me.</hi> From hence it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth that he hath caused Temples to be built for him, Altars to be erected, feasts to be ordeined, Priests to be interteined, and Sacrifices to bee presented vnto him, because he seeth that God hath ordeined the same for his seruice; not (as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> well sheweth, that hee is pleased with the smell of the rost proceeding from these creatures or the like, but because hee is much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted that the honours which are due vnto God should be mis-applyed vnto him. Wherein he seedeth himselfe with a fantasticall shew of contentment to see himselfe in apparence honoured for a God, although he be damned and tortured for euermore. <hi>Daemones non cadauerinis nidoribus</hi> (saith S. <hi>Augustine</hi>) <hi>sed diuinis honoribus gaudent.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Aug. lib. 10. de ciuit.</note> To maintaine himselfe in this state and greatnesse, he could not deuise a readier way then to speake familiarly to men, and to tell them those things which were secret and hidden;<note place="margin">The Diuel is ignorant of things to come Genes. 2.</note> and this hee doth by way of Oracles, the first whereof we may tearme the Oracle of the Serpent speaking vnto <hi>Eue.</hi> For what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth it whether hee entered into the body of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, or into a statue of marble? This hindereth not,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7439:266"/>
but that a man may well say, that the first Oracle was, when hee spake vnto the first woman. And therefore doth <hi>Tertullian</hi> iustly place the first woman in the first catalogue of hereticks,<note place="margin">Tertull. de prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrip. haeret.</note> because to speake so familiarly vnto the Diuell, was an apostacy. After the stood, Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles began to be more frequent, and had their originall from the posterity of <hi>Cham</hi>: whereupon it came that the most auncient Oracle which wee find in Authors is <hi>Oraculum Hammonium,</hi> as if we should say,<note place="margin">Genebrar. in Chron.</note> 
                        <hi>Oraculum Chammonium</hi>: for the name of <hi>Cham</hi> is written in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew with a strong aspiration, and therefore our trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latour rather maketh it <hi>Cham</hi> then <hi>Ham,</hi> although it be all one in sense, and the very name doth sufficiently shew that the antiquity and originall of Oracles after the flood came from <hi>Cham,</hi> who was cursed of God, and of his father: and this inuention of worshipping the Diuell was found out by him to build vp the city of the Diuell, as <hi>Cain</hi> had formerly begun to oppugne the city of God built by <hi>Abel</hi> and continued vntill <hi>Noah.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">4. Reg. 1.</note> We also see in the Scripture that wicked Kings did send vnto the Oracles of the Gentiles, as vnto <hi>Acharon</hi> and other places to haue their doubts and questions resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and answered. Thus Satan hath not forgotten his old wont, but as hee would at the first haue inuaded Gods honour, by predictions of hidden and future things vnto the first woman, <hi>Apperientur</hi> (saith he) <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi vestri &amp; eritis sicut Dij scientes bonnm &amp; malum,</hi> so now also would hee continue his cosenage amongst men who haue a naturall desire and curiositie to know secret and future things, which they drew from <hi>Adams</hi> depraued nature, who desired to become as God, knowing that the property of God is to diue into all hidden euents, especially to vnderstand mens thoughts and things to come. The Scripture teacheth vs these two points: the first in <hi>Ieremy,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ierem. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>Inscrutabile est cor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis, &amp; quis cognoscet illud? Ego Dominus probans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; corda.</hi> And for the second point <hi>Esay</hi> saith, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciate
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7439:267"/>
nobis quae ventura sunt, &amp; dicemus, quia dij estis vos.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Esay. 41.</note> So that if we shall more narrowly sist into the passages of histories, we shall find that Oracles tended to no other end then to beget an admiration in men, and to relish and giue contentment vnto that pride which naturally is rooted in them. Yet the truth is, that the Diuels neuer vnderstood either the one or the other of these points of knowing things hidden or to come: which we will a little enlarge, that the curious of these times may know how much they abuse themselues, in thinking that they are able to attaine vnto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of these two things, either by a secret league or familiarity with the Diuell, or otherwise by supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Magick. For the first, Diuines haue learnedly laboured in the same, grounding their discourses vpon that sentence of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> and vpon the saying of S. <hi>Paul, Nemo scit quid sit in homine,</hi>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7439:267"/>
who familiarly conuerse with men, can by no meanes vnderstand that which is hidden in mens hearts: but in the end <hi>Daniel</hi> gaue the resolution of it, saying, <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterium quod Rex interrogat, sapientes, magi, areoli, &amp; aruspices nequeunt indicare regi, sed Deus est in coelo reuelans mysteria, qui indicauit tibi Nabuchodonosor quae ventura sunt nouissimis temporibus. Dydimus</hi> Saint <hi>Ieromes</hi> master doth of set purpose handle this pointe, proouing that the holy Ghost is therefore the true God, because he entereth into the chamber of the heart, and openeth the most secret cogitations there. And hee giueth the naturall reason of this, for the soule hath no quantity or corporall dimensions, but is a pure and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual substance, not bounded in by any limits whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, but only by that natiue purenesse wherin it was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, so that it must needs follow, that if any thing doe penetrate this substance, it must bee the very vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded substance of the soule, or that quickning ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which was able to put life into the fame: so that there are but these two things absolutly simple and without mixture in the soule. The Diuel the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can neither be the substance, nor the life of the soule, and therefore cannot penetrate into it: but God it is who giueth this vertue of life vnto the soule, and without whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence the essence and life of the same would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently be consumed to nothing, and be as it was before the creation of it: whereupon <hi>Dydimus</hi> saith, <note place="margin">Dydim. lib. 2. de Spirit. sanct.</note> 
                        <hi>Imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipabilis Diabolus est non creator sed creatura subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stens, introiuit ergo in cor Iudae, non secundum substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam, sed secundum operationem, quia introire in aliquem increatae est substantiae.</hi> Heereupon hee concludeth,<note place="margin">Ios. 13.</note> that whereas we finde that the Diuell entred into the heart of <hi>Iudas,</hi> it must bee vnderstood of <hi>Iudas</hi> his will: and whereas he is said to fill the heart of <hi>Ananias,</hi> the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that he filled it with his suggestions of malice, of auariciousnesse, and the like enormities: which can not enter into a man, vnlesse he set his heart open, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7439:268"/>
giue consent to these temptations. And the very word (to tempt) importeth nothing else but an essay or triall of something. Satan then doth endeauour to informe himselfe of our goodnesse or naughtinesse, and if hee may coniecture, that there are some feeds of goodnesse in the heart, hee imployeth all his forces to shake the same by those obiects and deuises which hee daily pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiseth.<note place="margin">Hieron. lib. 2. comment. in Matth. ad c. 15.</note> S. <hi>Ierome, Dydimus</hi> his scholler hath learnedly opened this point, and as it were commented vpon that which his master obscurely deliuered. They that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite (saith he) that wicked thoughts proceed from the Diuell, and not rather from their owne depraued will, are worthy to bee sharpely reprooued: for the Diuell may suggest and occasion wicked thoughts in men, but cannot be the author of them. Hee is indeed an Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diary, and setteth our flesh on fire with burning sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alitie, yet can he not reach the inward part of our heart, but doth coniecture of the same by the habite and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour which hee obserueth in vs: as when hee seeth a man gazing often vpon a woman, and applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe wholly vnto her, he presently from hence doth sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, that he beginneth to commit adultery in his heart, whereupon hee doth forthwith minister vnto him oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of incouragement, putting many fancies into his head, which when hee reiecteth not, but rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth to entertaine them still, of himselfe and from his owne freewill he sendeth them vnto his soule. The Diuell abuseth those that are made to beleeue, that hee knoweth the secresies of the heart; hee may peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture haue some coniecturall knowledge, but because it is in the liberty of mans freewill to abandon and giue ouer such fancies when hee pleaseth, the Diuell is oft cousened of his aime, and prooueth a notorious lyar. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> hath made a treatise of this very argument, intituled,<note place="margin">August lib. de scientia dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monum.</note> 
                        <hi>De scientia daemonum,</hi> where hee largely handleth the same, and concludeth, that they can no more foretell of things to come, then they are able to

discerne the thoughts that are within vs. Yet would the Diuell seeme to make predictions of future accidents,<note place="margin">4. Reg. 1. &amp; 1. Reg. 28.</note> by the answeres of Oracles. The king <hi>Ochosias</hi> did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely send messengers vnto them, to vnderstand whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee should recouer his sicknesse, or no: and <hi>Saul</hi> did the like, that hee might bee informed, what should be the yssue of the battell which he was to fight against the Philistims, whereby they offended against the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse word of God, which saith, <hi>Non aocedetis ad Magos, neque ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There be two things (saith he) which neither the good nor the bad Angels are able to vnderstand, and they are, the secrets of the heart, and things that are to come. It is true (saith hee) that sometimes Magicians (whom I tearme the liuing oracles of the Diuel) doe foretell that which doth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards happen, by the fore knowledge and reuelations of Diuels, but their predictions are of euents that are already happened in other places; as for example, when they see it raine in <hi>India,</hi> and that the weather is fit and likely to carry those cloudes towards <hi>Egypt,</hi> he maketh his oracles to foretell, that it will very shortly raine in <hi>Egypt:</hi> so when he obserueth the abundance of snow that lieth vpon hills, is melted, or beginneth to melt,

Therefore Saint <hi>Athanasius</hi> doth conclude. Resolue with your selues to do something, whereof none can haue the least coniecture, and then go vnto the Deuils Oracles, who are the Magicians, and aske them if they can informe you of this which you haue determined to do, and you shall finde them vtterly ignorant, and vnable to satisfie you.<note place="margin">Athanas. in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Anthon.</note> Saint <hi>Athanasius</hi> had heard <hi>Anthonius Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> discourse of this argument, and it is probable, that he had most of his resolutions from him, as from one that had the best experience heereof of any man in the world:for we finde that hee heere reciteth all most the very same sentences which hee did formerly alleage in the discourse of <hi>Anthonies</hi> life: where hee addeth, that the Deuils do no more, then one that rideth post and aduertiseth vs of some things that are done farre from vs; or as a Physitian who by feeling a mans pulses, will shew him that hee is likely to fall into a feauer: or as a husband-man who seeing a glutt and ouerflow of waters, will foretell a scarcity of corne to ensue: to conclude (saith he) they know what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is already done, not what is to come: yet from hence did Idolatry and all those newe Gods of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then take their beginning, and they were esteemed by the simple people to be the true Gods. And this asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is so waighty, and of such importance, may be strengthened both by Scripture, &amp; by prophane au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors also: for the most famous Oracles that euer were,

Now when the Deuils were thus armed, they then began to foretell that which they had stollen from the Reuelation of Prophets, and to deliuer the great euents of things. But if a man did offer to decline from these paths, and did question them of lesse affaires, and of particular businesses, whereof they could haue no knowledge or coniecture, they did so mince and perplexe their predictions with ambiguous speeches, that whatsoeuer should happen, they would still haue a hansome shift and euasion. Many graue authors both amongst the Greekes and Latins, haue handled this pointe, and amongst the Latins,<note place="margin">Lactant. lib. diuin. institut.

It is reported, that a good vnderstanding man, who was desirous to trie the blockishnesse of a Magician, or Chiromantick, did shew him his left hand, to haue his fortune told him; and as the Magician was attentiuely vewing the lineaments of his hand, hee strooke him with his right hand a sound boxe on the eare saying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, if thou knowest things that are to come, why

dost thou not first learne that which doth concerne thy selfe? this saith Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> of Oracles. Where by the way we may see, how grossely they are abused, who make any compacts and bargaines with this vncleane Spirit, vpon promise to vnderstand from them those euents that are afterwards to follow: as also how gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously they offend, who addresse themselues vnto such kind of people, which is no lesse then to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnto the Oracles themselues, as the Idolaters of former times did, since the Deuill is he that speaketh both in the one and in the other: And this is that feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Apostasie from the faith, which is so frequently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the law of God.<note place="margin">Athanas. de vita Anthon.</note> But saith this good father <hi>Anthonius,</hi> what good shall a man get in suffering himselfe to bee palpably cousened, and in stead of a Carkanet, to buy a bracelet of cockles? especially since this is the way to estrange him from God, and to make him sell his poore soule vnto the Deuill for meere lies and gulleries. But put case, that hee told vs truth, yet should we not labour to get this knowledge from the enemy of God and mankinde, for feare he conuey poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son into this hony, as hee did vnto our first parents.

It is certaine, that the greatest exorbitancy in this sinne is, that they who practise the same, do apostate from the true religon of God, and adore the Deuill: which is cleerely prooued in the Scriptures, for they do not much aggrauate this obliquity with any other great inforcement, then that they commit idolatry, which is a sinne directly against the Maiesty of God, and not against our neighbour.

For when from worshipping of an inuisible substance, these kinde of people do adore the Deuil, when he presenteth himselfe before them in a visible forme, it is manifest that in this he would rob the Sonne of God of his glory, who made himselfe visible, that he might be visibly adored. When <hi>Samuel</hi> would aggrauate the sinne of rebellion and contempt, which <hi>Saul</hi> committed against the Diuine Maiesty, he telleth him, that this sinne is like vnto the sinne of Sorcerers and Magicians, he could not compare this disobedience and rebellion to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sinne, then that of Witches and Magicians.

happened by reason of his grand-father <hi>Manasses,</hi> who did alwayes intertaine Magicians and Witches in the kingdome of Israel, and himselfe also was of that trade. <hi>Non est auersus</hi> (saith the text) <hi>Dominus ab ira furoris sui magni, quo iratus est furor eius contra Iudam propter irritationes, quibus prouocauerat eu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Manasses.</hi> The abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of <hi>Manasses</hi> are described in the 4. booke of Kinges the 21.

Touching the meanes, which such kinde of people vse in their witchcrafts, there can bee no certaine number set of them, for they are infinite, and the Diuell is so craftie and malicious withall, that (as it is said of a naughty fellow) <hi>Habet mille technas, mille nocendi ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi> He inuenteth euery day new deuises, the more to please him, whom hee most desireth to hold fast in his gripe: and seeing that some are delighted with one thing, and some with another, he fitteth all according to their seuerall humours. And put case that these seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall manners of Charmes be not hurtfull vnto the body, yet doe they defile and staine the soule of the Sorcerer, because they are euer tyed vnto superstition, which is a kinde of Idolatrie. Neuerthelesse, the Diuell striueth as much as hee can, to practise those charmes which are hurtfull vnto men, as bloodshed and murther: but when he meeteth with any (as sometimes he doth) whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences are scrupulous to commit murther, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to hurt mens persons, hee then is contented to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie himselfe vnto them, that at the least hee may gaine vnto him their beguiled soules. And it is probable (since there are so many diuersities of them mentioned in the Hebrew Bible) that as the Diuels in the Scriptures take their denominations from the effects that are obserued in them, so haue the Sorcerers their diuersities of names from the diuersities of effects and charmes, which they ordinarily practise. Thus the Magicians of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to make their charmes more powerfull, besides the roddes which they had in their hands, to shew themselues e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall vnto <hi>Moyses,</hi> they also vsed (whether secretly or openly it is not expressed) certaine plates of red-hot iron, newly forged; and their charmes in the 7. chapter of Exodus are called by the word <hi>Lahatim,</hi>

sort of people is when they see any strange specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, yet did shee so strongly represse her passions, that shee would not so much as come vnto the window to see him, whereof she not long afterward died. It shall also be sufficient to select from ecclesiasticall histories that example which <hi>Theodoret</hi> relateth of the Matrons of Rome,<note place="margin">Theodor. lib. histor.</note> who when they saw that their husbands the Senators and others, dared not to intercede to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour in fauour of <hi>Liberius</hi> the Pope of Rome, whom he had causelesly banished, for that hee would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the bringing in of Heresie, they resolued among themselues to goe vnto the Court, where with their cries and importunity, they neuer left vntill the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had called back their chiefe Pastor from banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Scripture also is plentifull in these examples. <hi>Iudith</hi> and <hi>Hester</hi> will sufficiently exemplifie the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of women that loue God; and <hi>Iosephs</hi> mistrisse with <hi>Iesabell</hi> will fully declare the violence of those that abandon themselues to euill. And as we see by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience euen in these daies, that sober and vertuous women, although in their nature they are most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense vnto compassion, yet they are they that cast the first stones against Sorcerers, and cry louder then the rest to haue them burnt: so contrariwise, Sorceresses are more obstinate, and more addicted vnto witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts, and doe with lesse remorse of conscience plunge themselues into the most execrable facts that may bee, then men: so that it is certaine that women are imployed to strangle children, and to carry and present them to the Diuell, and to make a kind of oyntment of their grease; but Sorcerers and men Witches doe sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or neuer dip their fingers in these bloody actions.

And this appeareth by the history of <hi>Saul,</hi> who when he had formerly put to death all manner of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Witches; yet at the last, seeing himselfe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken of God for his iniquities, hee resolued to resort vnto the Diuell, and to that purpose hee demanded his seruants whether there were any woman witch left or no: Looke me out (saith he) one that hath a Spirit that I may goe vnto her, and may by her procurement bee aduertized of what I desire to know. Where we are to obserue that <hi>Saul</hi> did not aske whether there were a man that was a witch, but whether there were any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man witch: as if he should haue said, that notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all that he had done against them, it could not be but that there remained yet aliue some woman or other of this occupation: and in truth it is almost impossible to discouer them so easily as men. The conclusion was, <hi>Saul</hi> was not deceiued in his expectation, for his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, who doe oftentimes make their repaire vnto such people (as the custome of them is) did redily name one vnto him, vnto whom when <hi>Saul</hi> came, shee began to make her protestations that she was an honest woman, and would for no good attempt such a thing, which was prohibited both by God and the King: but being a little foothed vp with faire promises, shee quickly made the Diuell to attend this seruice: and therefore the Hebrewes are not contented to tearme them by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations common vnto them all, both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which we haue particularly collected in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter, but would marke them out by a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar attribute, which properly is to be vnderstood of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as may be seene in <hi>Helias</hi> the Leuite in his <hi>Thisby,</hi>

who reporteth according to the traditions of the Iewes, that there are women whom they call the Diuels mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and tearme them by this word <hi>Lilith,</hi> which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued from another Hebrew word signifiing the night, because they vse to goe secretly and in the night. And this haue the Latines imitated or borrowed from the Hebrewes, calling them <hi>Striges</hi> or <hi>Lamiae,</hi> which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth monsters and stranges birds that vse to goe in the finight. And the said <hi>Helias</hi> further saith, that a great Lord hauing asked the question of the ancient fathers of the Synagogue, how it chanced that young children that are but eight daies old were so often times found suddently dead, they answered him, that they were <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lith</hi> who put them to death: which is the appellation of Sorceresses, for the Hebrew word is of the feminine gender, as appeareth more plainely by the participle and feminine adiectiue which is ioyned with the word <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lith,</hi> and also because hee saith that they were <hi>Nashim,</hi> that is to say, women. And the Iewish women are so fully perswaded of the truth thereof (for they are the most superstitious women of the world) that they vse to make foure circles with chalke, or with a cole on the outward parts of the chamber walles where they vse to lie, and vpon euery side or quarter of the chamber they make a circle, writing in one of them the name of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> in the other the name of <hi>Eue,</hi> in the third the word <hi>Huts,</hi> which signifieth (without) and in the fourth the word <hi>Lilith:</hi> as if they should haue said (as I conceiue it) <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> are the first Parents and Progenitors of mankind, and therefore get you hence all witchcrafts whatsoeuer. Within the chamber they write the names of the Angels, whom they thinke to bee protectors of their children: to wit, <hi>Senoy, Sansenoy,</hi> and <hi>Samangue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loph,</hi> saying that <hi>Lilith</hi> did teach the Iewish women to doe this before shee died: where it is to bee supposed, that this was the name of some great Sorceresse, heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore much renouned amongst them, whom therefore
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7439:279"/>
they called <hi>Lilith,</hi> because shee commonly went in the night: and it is probable shee taught her daughters or some others all the superstitions and art she had, before her death; and afterward in processe of time such kind of women were called <hi>Lilith.</hi> Howsoeuer it be, this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of <hi>Helias</hi> the Leuite doth sufficiently declare the antiquitie of Sorcerers, that goe by night and strangle young children, and hee doth there assure vs, that these things are no fables. Which relation would receiue strength and accession of authority, if wee will allow that <hi>Iesus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Sirac</hi> did make that discourse, which doth at large mention all these things, and is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed vnto him in the Hebrew booke. We also finde the word <hi>Lilith</hi> in the Scripture, and particularly in the foure and thirtieth of <hi>Esay,</hi>

By this meanes he wrought our first pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents destruction, perswading them as himselfe had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready practised, to make themselues as God, well knowing that this was the true cause of his expulsion out of Paradise, to make themselues as God, well knowing that this was the true cause of his expulsion out of Paradise, for hee had said in his heart <hi>similis ero altissimo,</hi> and laide also this baite for the man and the woman <hi>eritis sicut dij.</hi> Thus doth he circumuent those, who would assume vnto themselues that authority,<note place="margin">Coloss. 1.</note> which is peculiar vnto God, not remembring that God is the author and creator of all things visible and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> well sheweth, <hi>ex ipso, &amp; per ipsum, &amp; in ipso sunt omnia, siue quae in coelis sunt, siue quae in terris sunt, visibilia &amp; inuisibilia, &amp; in ipso flectitur omne ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu coelestium, terrestrium &amp; infernorum.</hi> So that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Creator of all things, he may vse and dispose of them as seemeth good vnto him: and this he may doe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7439:281"/>
by the right of creation which hee hath ouer all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: by which right he is adored with a supreame and soueraigne worship which is called, <hi>Latria,</hi> proper and peculiar to him alone, <hi>Adorate Deum</hi> (saith S. <hi>Iohn</hi>) <hi>qui fecit coelum &amp; terram, mare &amp; omnia, quae in ijs sunt:</hi> yet would our Luciferians (for so may those that imitate <hi>Lucifer</hi> bee called) bee parellell vnto God and share with him in this worship, as if they had beene his companions in the creation of visible and inu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>sible sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, yea they would vse and dispose them to their behoofe and pleasure, without regard or consideration that God hath appropriated diuers things vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, which hee would not haue communicable vnto men; as is his glory, whereof he saith, <hi>Gloriam meam al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri non dabo.</hi> Of the same nature and condition is the knowledge of mens inward cogitations, the auenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon our enemies, the soueraigne power which he hath ouer all his creatures, in which number are wicked spirits, which are sustained, and haue their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence by his prouidence no lesse then the wicked men of this world haue, who doe heere mutiny and arme themselues against him. Another fault that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in their sophistry, is their not apprehending that the rule or ballance of all our actions ought to bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the word of God, from which we are not to decline neither to the right hand nor to the left, but the word of God doth strictly prohibite such trafficke and familiarity with Satan: yea, it commandeth that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer hee bee, that hath recourse vnto Magicians or witches, vpon what occasion soeuer, although he speak not directly vnto the Diuell, yet is that person to bee stoned to death without mercy. By which we are taught that this is direct Idolatry, since in our extremities wee leaue God to haue redresse and succour from his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, and to rely and haue confidence in him, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that whatsoeuer good betideth vnto vs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the Diuell, which is nothing else then
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7439:282"/>
worshipping him, and making him practise that which in times past hee said, <hi>Haec omnia tibi dabo, si cadens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doraueris me.</hi> And this did open the gapp vnto the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of <hi>Ochosias, Saul,</hi> and many others who might as well haue pleaded for themselues, as the Athiest and Magicians of our times in this manner. What danger is there, if wee serue our turne with them at our need, since God himselfe doth vse them when hee pleaseth. The third fault is, that they are so farre from doing as Christ Iesus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>id, that they doe cleane contrary vnto that which he practised. For Christ Iesus was so farre from euocating and calling Diuels vnto him, that hee forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and armed himselfe against their temptations by prayers and admirable fasting: and when Satan ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared vnto him vnsent for, he thrust him back behind him with hard language, saying, <hi>Vade retro Sathana, scriptum est, Dominum Deum tuum adorabis, &amp; illi soli seruies.</hi> And heereupon the Diuell departed from him, for he cannot indure to stay where he findeth resistance; and therefore Saint <hi>Iames</hi> glancing at this example of Christ Iesus, doth thus lesson vs, <hi>Resistite Diabolo &amp; fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giet à vobis</hi>: agreeable vnto that of S. <hi>Peter, Cuiresistite fortes in fide.</hi> Heere we may see what wee are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to doe after the example of Christ Iesus: wee are bid to pray, and to fast that hee may not come vnto vs, and in case that hee should present himselfe before vs, we are to resist him by faith, and to push him from vs with all eagernesse, as S. <hi>Martin</hi> hath done before vs, who as <hi>Seuerus Sulpitius</hi> reciteth of him, when he saw the Diuell close by him he spake, <hi>Quid hic astas cruenta bestia?</hi> And this charge was laid vpon man from the beginning of the world, to breed the greater detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Diuell in him. God did make a couenant of enmity betweene men and the Diuell, saying, <hi>Inimici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias ponam inter te &amp; mulierem, inter semen tuum &amp; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men illius</hi>: I will put mortall hatred (said God) between the Serpent and the seed of the woman: for this great
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7439:282"/>
guider and ouerseer of nature did well foreknow, that what faire pretext soeuer the Diuell might pretend, hee hunted after nothing more then after mans destruction, as wee haue already compared him vnto the Crocodiles of Egypt, who doe counterfaite the voice of a man that they may deuoure him. So that a man had neede to learne wisedome of the doggs of Egypt, who knowing their guile and bloody rauenousnesse, doe not tarry long to drink of this riuer,<note place="margin">Erasm. in Chiliad.</note> but if they are pressed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by thirst, they giue a lapp and away, keeping on their course without long tarrying. Thus ought a man to auoide all the temptations of Satan, and if at some times he haue wicked thoughts suggested vnto him, he must by no meanes giue way vnto them, but continue on his course, and disburthen his minde of such cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, otherwise if hee should giue the least passage vnto them, he will be in danger to be deuoured: for the Diuell neuer goeth any where but with a purpose to swallow vp all that lye faire for his mouth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Lord who knew well his bloudy malice would by no meanes permit, that he should confesse him to be the Sonne of God:<note place="margin">Luc. 4.</note> for he made not this confession (as S. <hi>Athanasius</hi> well noterh) for any good purpose, but to lay some defamatory suspition vpon Christ Iesus,<note place="margin">Athan. orat. 1. cont. Arrian.</note> and to abuse the world by this meanes. The fouth fault is, that men doe not marke what power Christ Iesus gaue vnto his Apostles and their successours ouer Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels: at first, this power was giuen by God to bruse the Serpents head: and to tread him vnder foote, as hee had foretold, that the seed of the woman should crush his venemous head: and the same doth Christ Iesus say vnto his Apostles, <hi>Dedi vobis potestatem calcandi supra Serpentes:</hi> which is also witnessed by S. <hi>Paul, Deus au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem conterat Sathanam sub pedibus vestris.</hi> In the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, this power was giuen vnto the Church thorow the merits of the precious death of Christ Iesus, with a charge to chase and driue him away. Thirdly,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7439:283"/>
this power was to be exercised in calling vpon the name of Christ Iesus, which two last points are comprehended in these words: <hi>In nomine meo Daemonia eijcient.</hi> But Sorcerers and Magicians doe not vse to resist the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell and bruse his head, but they flatter him and call him vnto them by a certaine bargaine or agreement, which directly importeth a subiection and dependan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: and to be briefe, they doe first worship him before hee will come vnto them. Againe, in steed of repelling him, they come vnto him for aduise, aide, or fauour, whereas Christ Iesus would not so much as suffer him to speake:<note place="margin">Origen. in Numer.</note> and this is not (as <hi>Origen</hi> obserueth) to force the Diuell, by inuocation vpon the name of God, it rather argueth a familiarity and intercourse which they haue together. So that if wee doe seriously consider all circumstances, they doe crosse and goe a contrary course vnto Christ Iesus and the Apostles. It cannot bee gaine-said, but that sometimes they will make a sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance as if they wept, although in truth it be nothing so.<note place="margin">August. lib. 10. de ciuit. cap. 11.</note> S. <hi>Augustine</hi> reciteth the history of a certaine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician, who boasted much what a command hee had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Diuels, saying, that when they were lasie to doe that he commanded them, he threatned to pull the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens with such violence that they should fall vpon the earth, and thereupon the Diuels would readily execute what he had enioyned them, for feare least they should be brused betweene heauen and earth, as corne is bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed betweene two milstones. But who seeth not that this is the craft and counterfaite weeping of Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles, that is to say Diabolical fictions framed for deceit and cousonage? For first, it is not the power of Angels to make the heauen descend and touch the earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause vnto them (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith) God hath not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected the round frame of the world: <hi>Non enim</hi> (saith he) <hi>Angelis suis subiecit Deus orbem.</hi> Nay it is so farre from being so, that it is not in the naturall power of all wicked spirits that are, to wheele about the orbe of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7439:283"/>
the Moone, which is the least of all the rest: for as God hath appropriated the natural operations of mans body vnto a reasonable soule, so that it is not in the power of an Angell to make this body to liue the life of plants, the life of beasts, or the life of man, although he can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at his pleasure into the same, as we see by experience in those that are possessed: euen so God hath limited the passiue power of the motions of the heauens, vnto cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Angels whom hee hath destinated thereunto, so that it is a ridiculous thing to conceiue, that Spirits may be brused or crushed in peeces. But they doe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in take the aduantage of mens simplicity and their owne craft, by infusing these fables into them, wherein they resemble naughty seruants that wait for an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to cut their masters throates. The fifth error that blindeth those Sorcerers is, because they haue a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite that the Diuell is very ready to doe them seruice: but how is it possible that the Diuell should inuassall himselfe vnto man, that is but a worm of the earth? since that thorow the excessiiuenes of his pride which broo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no equals, hee scorneth to bee the seruant of God, whom he knoweth to be his Creator. How can he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base himselfe to be mans Lackey, when hee did rather choose to relinquish his portion in Paradise, and to burne euerlastingly in hell fire, then he would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Christ Iesus for his better. For when it was laid before him that hee should become man, the Diuel said in his heart, no; before I will acknowledge a man and a worme of the earth, I will first be damned: as that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoute and auncient father S. <hi>Bernard</hi> hath well expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it. He doth indeed make shew of seruice vnto man, but to this end, that he may be his master: for if hee be delighted corporally to possesse a man, when hee hath gotten the mastery of his body, how much more is hee pleased when by his subtilties, and by taking from him the knowledge of God, hee getteth possession of his soule? For when hee possesseth the body, this affliction is
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7439:284"/>
many times the instrument of saluation, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Traedidi huiu smodi Sathanae,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Cor. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>vt spiritus eius saluus fiat.</hi> But when hee possesseth the soule, and withdraweth it from the grace of God, hee is then the instrument of damnation. And therefore the Scripture doth euer fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure out Satan vnto vs by things that are both dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and dreadfull vnto men, as by a Serpent, by a Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, and by a roaring Lyon, for feare least wee should say as Athiests doe, that the Diuell is not so black as men doe paint him: whereas contrariwise, he is so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and so dangerous that all the comparisons of <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taures,</hi> doggs with three heads, and the like mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters described vnto vs by Poets, fall farre short of his vglinesse. If then any one should be familiar with such furious beasts, might hee not well bee accounted mad and depriued of common sense? Yet Witches and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians do ordinarily expose themselues to these things And this horridnesse of Diuels was declared vnto <hi>Iob,</hi> who had partly experimented the rage and bloody ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of Satan: but hee tryed not all his forces, because God suffered him not to doe, all that he was willing to inflict vpon <hi>Iob.</hi> God then described Satan vnto him by the similitude of the most great and horrible mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the world called <hi>Behemoth.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hieron. aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus vigilant.

God further speaketh vnto <hi>Iob</hi> of this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: dost thou thinke to put a hooke into his nostrills as men take fishes, or when hee is before thee dost thou conceiue that he is affraide of thee? <hi>Nunquid multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabit

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7439:285"/>
acquainted with <hi>Antonius Monachus,</hi> a second <hi>Iob</hi> in the time of the Gospell, doth eloquently describe the sleights and subtleties of Satan. He dissembleth and hideth (saith he) that which he is indeed, appearing in a goodly shape, and gracing himselfe with some name of humour, which he shall perceiue to be most pleasing vnto our honour. Wherein hee resembleth Pirates, who when they espy any pretty children on the shore, they draw neere vnto them, and flatter them, speaking as faire vnto them as their fathers and mothers possibly could; they shew them apples, and cast vnto them other toyes, which they conceiue may please and stay these children: but when they haue enticed them a ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bord, they presently hoyse saile, and carry them farre e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from father or mother, selling them and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them slaues in a strange countrey as long as they liue. I would haue all those, who haue suffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be thus abused by Satan, to remember well this discourse of so famous a man; and with the prodigall childe to returne vnto the house of their father, and by some trick or other to make an escape from that bloudy and mercliesse tyrant, that setteth before them nothing but huskes to eate: that is, hee promiseth vaine, friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and vnnecessary things, full of deceitfulnesse and cousonage. But in case they will not returne, then must that be put in execution, which is set downe in the law of God, in the 20. chapter of Exodus, that is, to put them to an extraordinary death, which may strike a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour into others, and serue as an example for all kinde of people. This was religiously practised in <hi>Auignon</hi> in the yeere of grace 1582. by the diligence of father <hi>Florus Prouin,</hi> at that time Inquisitour of the faith in those parts, vnto whom I was an associate in the said Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where there were 18. men and women executed, who were conuicted and very deseruedly condemned, after they had by their owne depositions and mutuall accusations one of another, giuen sufficient proofe of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7439:285"/>
their guiltinesse, as shall appeare by the sentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced against them; the extract whereof ensueth next after this following chapter, to the end that euery one may see how farre these kinde of men are separated from the knowledge of God, and how iustly they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue to bee burned. For conclusion and resolution of this discourse, let vs onely marke that which <hi>Tertullian</hi> teacheth vs, to wit, that neither Christ Iesus, nor his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, nor any well deseruing sonnes of the Church, did euer call vnto them wicked Spirits, but rather did repell and driue them from them by the efficacy and power of Gods word. It cleerly appeareth in the Gospel that this was the practise of Christ Iesus: <hi>Erat Iesus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ijciens Daemonium; si in digito Dei eijcio Daemonia:</hi> so that whatsoeuer Christ Iesus did in this behalfe, he did it to this end to cast them out, and to make them odious and abominable before men. And as it appeareth in the ttenh of <hi>Matthew,</hi> the power that he gaue vnto his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles was onely to cast out Diuels: for it is there said, that hauing chosen them for his Apostles, he sent them forth with authority ouer vncleane Spirits, but limited and restrained vnto this, to repell and cast them out. <hi>Dedit eis potestatem</hi> (saith the text) <hi>Spirituum immun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorum, vt eijcerunt eos.</hi> And againe after his resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction he sent them abroad vnto all places of the world, and gaue them power ouer Diuels, but with the aboue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named restriction, to cast them out, saying, <hi>In nomine meo Daemonia eijcient.</hi> Read the Acts of the Apostles, and you shall finde that they did nothing else but cast out wicked Spirits, neither did any man of worth in the Church of God euer exceed these limits, and those who haue trespassed in passing further, doe shew that they are aliens from the Church of Christ Iesus, and are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples in the schoole of Satan. And this is it which <hi>Tertullian</hi> did well note, <hi>Nos non inuitatoria operatione, sed e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> (as Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> reporteth) made a Treatise in his time touching the nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of wicked Spirits: the which but that time hath bin so iniurious vnto vs, as to snatch and as it were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uish it out of our hands, would haue ministred vnto vs (as we may easily coniecture by his other writings that do yet remaine vnto posterity) very ample and cleere resolutions of this doubt, and would teach vs, that what is commonly spoken of Witches, is not fabulously giuen out, but assuredly verified to be true. For in his first Apologie which he made for the Christians, hee is bold confidently and resoluedly to affirme, that wicked Spirits haue had carnall knowledge sometimes with women and sometimes with men. And in his second
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7439:286"/>
Apologie he saith, that Deuils will seildome do what a man would haue them, except it be with certaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, as in Necromancy hee will haue a boy to bee brought vnto him, that is yong and tender of age. And in the 52. question which he proposeth vnto Christians, he wisheth all men to proceede warily and with all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised circumspection in this argument of wicked Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits &amp; of Sorcerers. In which he giueth vs to vnderstand that we are not to goe on inconsideratly in searching after two things, which are very strange vnto the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple people, and which we now will recite out of him: (for we ought to imbrace the aduise of so great a perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,<note place="margin">2. Thes. 2.</note> seeing Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe doth declare vnto vs, that the workes of Sathan shall bee set out with all signes and wonders, so that they shall exceede all our naturall forces) for resolution hereof wee must heere make a distinction, which many not obseruing haue runne and plunged themselues into many errors. The distinction is this: amongst all the effects that Sathan doth practise in the behalfe of those that owe their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice vnto him, there are two manners of working: the first doth happen vnto them when they sleepe; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is practised also when they wake. Hereunto wee might adioyne many sub-diuisions, but it shall suffice hereafter to alleage such as we shall adiudge necessary for this purpose. Now that this happeneth after these two seuerall wayes, the Scriptures in many passages doth confirme it: for numbring vp the workes which Satan practiseth for them, that haue made an expresse couenant with him, they do seildome faile of the one side to alleage the obseruation of dreames, and of the other side the abhomination of charmes; where we may obserue, that diuination from dreames is euer practised by sleeping, and charmes when men are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake. The first place that confirmeth the truth hereof may be taken from the 19. of Leuiticus, where it is said:<note place="margin">Leuit. 19.</note>

place is in the second booke of the Chronicles the 33. Chapter,<note place="margin">2.

                           </expan> mala operatus est.</hi> There is another passage in the 27. Chapter of <hi>Ieremy,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ierem. 27.</note> where God saith vnto his people: <hi>Vos ergo nolite audire Prophet as veslros, &amp; diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos, &amp; somniatores, &amp; Augures, &amp; maleficos.</hi> The fourth place is in the tenth of Zacharie, where it is said: <hi>Diuini viderunt mendacium, &amp; somniatores locuti sunt frustra.</hi> And this was the very practise of <hi>Balaam</hi> whose custome was first heedfully to obserue his dreames,<note place="margin">Num. 22.</note> and when he was awake to make his charmes, as you may see in the 22. Chapter of Numbers. I am not ignorant, that some may here cauil &amp; say, that those dreames were of a different quality vnto the dreames of the Sorcerers of our times: notwithstanding it doth sufficiently make for our purpose, if we declare by Scripture, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> among the wicked and prohibited workes, which Satan acteth in those that giue themselues vnto him, some are by way of dreames, and others are done waking, and are really true. And although the natures of dreames may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely varied, (a thing incident to all dreames, whether they be diuine,<note place="margin">Tertul. lib. de Anima cap. de somnijs.</note> naturall, or diabolicall, which is the full and complete diuision of dreames, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in his booke of the soule in the Chapter <hi>de somnijs</hi>) yet cannot these seuerall qualities or diuersities, make these dreames that they should not bee the reall workes of Satan, as in like manner the diuersity of them doth not hinder them, to be diuine or naturall. This distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth prompt vnto vs another, and that is, that those things which are dreames to some, are truthes to others, and this is also common vnto diuine and naturall dreames,<note place="margin">Iudg. 7.</note> for there is no repugnancy that one man may really practise that, which another man dreameth of himselfe: as in the booke of Iudges, we heare of a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier who dreamed that <hi>Gedeon</hi> came to assault and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7439:287"/>
force their campe, and at the same time, <hi>Gedeon</hi> did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede come vnto their campe, and did that which the other dreamed. I do purposely let passe diuers other, whether they be diuine, naturall, or diabolicall, which are recited by <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the place aboue alleaged: let it suffice to relate one discourse out of Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> very pregnant for the purpose now in hand:<note place="margin">August. lib. 18. de Ciuitat Dei cap. 18.</note> where he maketh mention of a certaine man of his time, who was very desirous to vnderstand the meaning of a passage in <hi>Plato,</hi> that was very obscure vnto him, and to that purpose did oftentimes addresse himselfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Philosopher, and repared much vnto his house to haue his opinion concerning the same, but he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnderstand the interpretation of it. At the last, as this man was vp late in his study there came vnto him, as he thought, this P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ilosopher and began to speake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him of the said passage, and in conclusion did so cleerely explaine and vnfold it, that he rested very fully satisfied. It chanced not long after, that this Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher came againe vnto him, whereupon hee demanded him, why he would not giue explication of the said passage at home in his owne house, but had rather inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it in the house of another man. To which the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher replied, I did indeede dreame that I had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded this passage vnto you, but the truth is I neuer did. From hence Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> inferreth, that the same thing which is a dreame to one may be a truth to another: for whiles the Philosopher was dreaming that he was expounding the said passage, the other receiued waking the reall words of that exposition. He also tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth of another, who hauing slept diuers dayes together, so that hee could bee waked by no meanes that they could vse vnto him; he told his seruants when he did awake, that hee dreamed that hee was changed into an horse, and that hee hid prouender in a certaine field which hee described vnto them, and it was indeede found that such an accident had happened. Vpon these
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7439:288"/>
two suppositions we affirme, that those things which are reported of Sorcerers might bee both dreamed and done, and that which was a dreame to one might bee a truth to another. And for the first, wee are to attribute vnto dreames, whatsoeuer is written in the 26. distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Decretals in cap. Episcopi,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Distinct. 26. cap. episc.</note> which is so often alleaged by those that hold all witch-crafts whatsoeuer to be nothing else but dreames, when as the particulars there recited are not onely false and fabulous, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant vnto Scripture, and impossible to Satan, such as is the raising of <hi>Herodias</hi> to life: this opinion wee ought to haue of the like sentences and authorities. In the second place we are to ranke all charmes and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked practises wrought by Sorcerers and Magicians, which the holy Scripture, the Fathers, and a cloud of Histories do mention, as things really put in execution. By which meanes we shall easily reconcile as well the Scriptures, and the Fathers, as Histories also, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise might seeme to crosse and contrary one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As for example, <hi>Iohn Baptista</hi> the Neapolitan in his 2. booke and 26. Chapter, reporteth that himselfe being curious to know the truth of that which witches do depose, he so ordered the matter that he beheld with his owne eyes that which they did, and indeede hauing gotten the consent of an olde witch, hee saw all their manner of proceeding thorow the chinke of a doare, and beheld an olde woman standing naked, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing her selfe with a certaine oyntment, which when she had done she fell into such a sound sleepe, that she could not be awaked by the most violent stripes that could be laid vpon her. At the last being awaked, shee affirmed that she had passed ouer the seas, and had seene diuers strange sights which shee recited in his presence, and in the presence of diuers others who together with him came to see the same. And when they shewed vnto her the markes of the stripes which shee had receaued when she was a sleepe, shee would beleeue nothing of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7439:288"/>
these things. <hi>Apuleius</hi> reporteth of himselfe, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing curious to see the fashions of witches, hee was brought by a chamber-maide to a secret place, where he might behold them, and looking in like manner tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the chinke of the chamber doore, he saw a naked witch besmearing of her selfe with an oyntment which she had, and while she was rubbing and annointing her selfe, she was transformed by little and little (as seemed vnto him) into an Oule, and at the last there appeared winges vpon her, and soone after she flew abroad through the window: of which strange metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis himselfe, as hee said, was the spectator. These two Histories reported by two men curious beyond ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to vnderstand the truth of these secrets, do well shew that both the one and the other might be true enough: for we ought not to giue more credite to <hi>Iohn Baptista</hi> the Neapolitan then to <hi>Apuleius</hi> the Affrican, since Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> himselfe dared not to affirme, that those strange things which <hi>Apuleius</hi> wrote were fables:<note place="margin">Apul. de Asino aureo.</note> hee rather sheweth how these things may bee done. Wee may therefore do well to yeeld both to the one and the other, and not from a particular fact to inferre a generall conclusion, as they doe who attribute all these things vnto dreames onely, which is against the rule in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke, <hi>à particulari ad vniuersale consequentia nulla.</hi> There might also be mistakes and mistes in the eyes, as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> teacheth in the booke and Chapter before cited: where relating the History of <hi>Iphigenia,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">August. de ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate lib. 18. cap. 18.</note> he saith, that she was not really sacrificed as all the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie did imagine, but there was a stagge conueyed in steede of her, which by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> charms of the Deuil did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare vnto the lookers on to bee <hi>Iphigenia.</hi> It may also fall out, that thorow the same impostures of the Deuill, men may thinke they see the body of a man, when it is nothing so, and hauing their eyes dazeled and disaffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they may mistake one thing for another.<note place="margin">Clemens in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognitionib.</note> And hereof there are many relations in Saint <hi>Clement,</hi> which
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7439:289"/>
he reciteth in his bookes of Recognitions, where hee also describeth sundry feates which he saw <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> to practise. Yet on the contrary part, it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies true that this happeneth thorow impostures and illusions, as the History of <hi>Hermotymus</hi> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His enemies would make triall of the truth hereof by cutting his throat, but as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ieastingly saith, his soule came not backe againe in time, so that he neuer waked after. Now if this had been done by charmes and delusions, hee had been in no danger to haue died, because they should not haue medled with his body, but with a seeming and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sititious body; but it being otherwise, it appeareth that it was his owne body. So that there are three man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of proceeding; for either they sleepe and dreame, or they goe thither really, or the Diuell putteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in their place, and carrieth them some where else. Thus may these sundry waies be all true, and such an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident may happen either meerely in a dreame, or really and indeed;<note place="margin">Caiet. in 2. m 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The difficulty then lyeth in the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing and discerning when such a thing really is acted, or when there is but an apparancy of the same by dreames and impostures.<note place="margin">August. lib. 18. de ciuit. Dei. cap. 18.</note> S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in that notable chapter aboue cited, doth if wee marke him well, giue vs the resolution hereof: for hee telleth vs, that in these cases there are three remarkeable rules, that present themselues vnto our obseruations. The first is, that you must iudge of these things by the experience and reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that ensueth thereupon; as if a man would know, whether there were the true and perfect reality of that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7439:289"/>
which was represented in the sacrifice of <hi>Iphigenia,</hi> the answere is, that there was not, but that there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther substance by a diabolicall art foysted into her place: for experience (saith he) did afterwards declare that <hi>Iphigenia</hi> was found in another country farre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from thence, whether she had been carried aliue by the Diuels, and liued a long time after this accident. By the like experience he concludeth, that the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of <hi>Diomedes</hi> were not turned into birds as was conceiued, because, the said birds did build their nests, and multiplyed their kind as other birds vsually doe. Now this propagation of their kind is a reality which giueth sufficient proofe to conclude, that these men were carried into other places by Diuels, and these birds were cunningly and suddenly conueied into their roomes: neither could these birds be meerely apparan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but they were truly as they seemed, and the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the reality of their nature doth blow away all suspitions of illusion. Besides, the Diuels impostures (as S. <hi>Thomas</hi> hath learnedly obserued) can haue no long time of subsistence, because they are not reall natures,<note place="margin">D. Thom.</note> but onely common accidents (as the Logicians tearme them) whose property is to bee easily changed by any naturall alteration. This rule giueth vs to vnderstand, that what <hi>Moyses</hi> did in Aegypt and in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse was not done by illusion;<note place="margin">Exod. 7.</note> for the fishes did die indeed in the riuer that was changed into blood, and the Caterpillers and other vermine that spoyled the corne, the barly, the vines, and trees of Aegypt were truly that which they seemed to bee. It also declareth that what the Diuell wrought against <hi>Iob</hi> was not seemingly done,<note place="margin">Iob. 2.</note> but really acted with a great deale of malice; witnesse the death of his children and seruants, and the downefall of the house vpon them. This rule we are to practise in the charmes of Witches, and to see if there be any reality in that which they giue out they haue done: which falling out so frequently true, we are
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7439:290"/>
no longer to question the verity of the same. There is a reality in their murthering of Infants; for it is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the report of their parents, that the children which they said they had strangled, were found stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled indeed, as they had themselues deposed. In like manner the dis interring of their bodies was a truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their bones were not found lying in their graues. There is a reality in the mark which they beare in their bodies, the which of all other parts is leprous, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid of sense, and which can bee found vpon none but vpon such as are said to be Witches. There is also a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the peece of their garment, which in signe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage they present vnto the Diuell, and wee haue seene with our eyes, that such a like peece was wanting in their garment, as they themselues had reported. There is a manifest reality in the charmes which they cast vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on man and beast, making them dull and almost dead, and by their words reuiuing and setting them in as good plight as they were before; not (saith <hi>Lactantius</hi>) that they can heale diseases,<note place="margin">Lactan. li. 2. diuinar. inst. cap. 16. Luc. 11. Luc. 13.</note> for this is not in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of the Diuels power, although it be in their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power to infuse an infirmity into any part of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing body, as appeareth in the history of the <hi>Demoniaek</hi> that was both dumbe and deafe, and of the woman that was crooked, so that shee could not lift vp her eyes to heauen; and therefore by taking away this impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they doe not really cure a disease, but withdraw the stop that hindered those operations of nature, God somtimes permitting him by his iust, though hidden iudgement to doe this, although further then this hee cannot passe,<note place="margin">August. lib. 2. cont. aduersa legis cap 12. &amp; lib. 22. cont. Faust. cap. 72. &amp; lib. de S. Virg. cap. 40. &amp; 42.</note> as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> often inserreth. So that it is apparant by the first rule, that the confessions made by Sorcerers are not alwaies dreames, but doe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times containe facts that haue been really practised.</p>
                     <p>The second rule drawne both from S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and from S. <hi>Thomas</hi> is, to obserue whether all that is spoken in this argument, doth lie in the naturall power
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7439:290"/>
of the Diuell.<note place="margin">August. lib. 1. de ciuit. cap. 18.</note> This S. <hi>Augustine</hi> obscurely noteth when in the history of <hi>Diomedes</hi> hee saith, that this transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was by a secret substraction and conueying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of their bodies, because it doth transcend the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall power of Diuels to change one body into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to their substance; and therefore it must needs bee that this collusion was by transporting and placing one body into the roome of another. S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> would not yeeld vnto the first, because as hee had already declared, it was aboue the naturall power of the Diuell: but he granteth the second, in regard that it is within the compasse of his force and working: <hi>Neque enim</hi> (saith he) <hi>daemonibus iudicio dei permissis huiusmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di praestigia difficilia esse possunt.</hi> And as hee expresseth it else where, the Diuell can do this when he will, &amp; how he will, if so be that God doth expresly command him, or doth leaue him to his owne nature: <hi>Quando volunt, &amp; quomodo volunt Deo vel iubente vel sinente.</hi> S. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> betaketh himselfe to this rule when he saith,<note place="margin">D. Thom. 1. p. q. 114. art. 4. ad 2.</note> that if the Diuell should busie himselfe in the resurrection of the dead. or in any other supernaturall workings, wee must be strong that all these things are meere illusions: for although God by his vniuersal prouidence doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy wicked Spirits vpon many occasions, yet doth hee neuer vse them in working of miracles, which he reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vnto himselfe, and to his, because Diuels haue no capacity to receiue such supernaturall endowments. This rule did distinguish the magicall workes of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> from those of S. <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Apostles,<note place="margin">Clemens in recognit. lib. 3.

which were in former ages accounted fables: although S. <hi>Augustine</hi> out of the great subtility of his spirit, and his deepe knowledge in holy Writ, would not venture to say that they were fables; hee rather sheweth that this might bee true either really or in outward appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.

Therefore it is plaine that the second rule doth positiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude that all these workings are not meerely dreames: and this is not repugnant to Scripture, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or Histories, much lesse vnto reason; and for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther verification of this second rule, obserue that which is written in the booke of <hi>Exodus,</hi>

Hippocrates lib. 2. de mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis, &amp; lib. de affection.</note> This generality gaue occasion vnto <hi>Hippocrates</hi> to speake diuinely, of those vniuersall and nationall diseases, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a generall plague cannot proceed from ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie causes in nature, but must bee attributed to come from God, and from inuisible causes. The same may be said in this theame of Witches, which is no lesse impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. It is a wondrous thing, that the Witches of France and of our times, should depose no more nor no lesse, then those of Germany, 60. or 80. yeeres agoe. And And whereas it may be said that they haue been traded in the bookes which haue been written either in Latine or in the vulgar tongue, by learned men, that haue set downe their behauiours agreeable vnto the truth of their owne depositions: yet wee shall find them to bee
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7439:292"/>
mechanicall persons, so deuoid of all shew of learning, that through the earthinesse of their vnderstandings, they rather seeme to be beasts then men. Hence we may inferre, that this generality and conformity of the facts, doth make a full declaration of the truth thereof, if wee will yeeld vnto probabilities and reason: which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ground that wee will propound to those that say, that there is a repugnancy in reason against these things. For how can that which happeneth vpon a set day, as vpon a Thursday, or the like, bee said to bee a dreame? if it were so, why might it not as well fall out vpon some other day? yet is it agreed vpon at all hands, that these assemblies of Witches are neuer held but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Thursdaies: whereupon we demand, why rather on this day then vpon any other? Againe, if it were but a dreame, how chanceth it that so many people, in such diuersity of places, and dwelling in countries so remote one from another, should in one and the selfe same time haue all one kind of dreame? Physitians hold, that the diuersities of meates, and their seuerall quantities, doe breed and cause the variety we haue in dreames: and is it likely that all those persons, doe at the same time vse the same kinds of meates, and in the selfe same quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they thus iumpe and concurre in dreames of the same chance and nature? They further affirme, that the seuerall complexions of men doe also beget a diuersity in dreames: so that the sanguine man dreameth of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant things: the melancholicke of sad accidents: the martialist of warre: in like manner, the dreames of young men are ordinarily different from the dreames of old men; and the dreames of men doe vary from those of women:<note place="margin">Arist. lib. de Som. Artemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. de Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior. interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatione.</note> wherein I appeale to <hi>Aristotle, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temidorus</hi> and others, who haue made set Treatises of this argument. Since then for the most part these kind of Witches are different in complexion, age, sex, and sect, how happeneth it that they should all dreame? or if they doe dreame, whence ariseth it that they should
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7439:292"/>
all dreame the selfe same thing, without variation in any circumstance one from another; and which is more, in the same day and houre? It will bee said, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell is assuredly the cause hereof. Be it so, now you come neere vnto the truth, since you grant that this doth transcend the forces of man, and that it must be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the working of the Diuell. Thereupon I demand, since that it is by them decreed vpon, that this is a true dreame, because it is in the Diuels power to effect such a thing, why are they so precise to acknowledge a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the fact, when it is also in the compasse of the Diuels power, to accomplish the same? Besides experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence confirmeth it, neither is it against Scriptures, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or Histories: nay it is foreshowen vnto vs, that at the end of the world, these things should bee more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent then euer they were before; as we will afterward proue. But it is not probable, that such a generality and conformity should bee a dreame foysted in by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell.<note place="margin">Iustin Mart. q 40. Didym. lib. 1. de Som. Thom. 1. p. q.</note> For first, one Diuell can worke but in one place at one time, as <hi>Iustin Martyr, Didymus,</hi> and S. <hi>Thomas</hi> do declare. So that it cannot be one Diuell alone that is to labour this businesse, but they must bee many, and their number must equall the number of the Sorcerers and Witches that are to dreame; and then must they labour and runne in and out, yea and tye themselues vnto a set day and houre; which is as strange as the reality of the fact. For why should the Diuell denie to doe such a thing, but at a set time, and should tye himselfe vnto this day and houre, rather then to any other? It may happen that the Diuels aduantage shall at that very time lie another way, and there may some great occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on offer it selfe to tempt others in matters of a far more execrable nature then these dreames are, so that they cannot attend this, and then it must needs follow, that many of these Sorcerers cannot dreame, because their Diuels are imployed in more diabolicall negotiations, and vse therein both their art and apprehension.

For as S. <hi>Thomas</hi> saith, he cannot make an impression of colours into the phantasie of one that is borne blind, neither can he make the sound of a voyce in one that is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally deafe (which is beyond the power of nature her selfe) yet is he able to moue the phantasie, and to offer vnto it, those obiects which it hath formerly receiued. Now the phantasies of all these kinds of people are not in euery respect alike, neither are they at all times, and vpon all occasions equally disposed; so that it will bee very improbable, to attribute this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fluence of phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies vnto dreames, yea it will bee more incredible, then to affirme that these things are palpablie and really pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised, considering what wee haue already alleaged for confirmation of the same. For there is no absurdity that can follow thereupon, neither is it against the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Fathers, Histories, or reason. But touching the first assertion, that they are but dreames, there are many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences that doe vnauoidably follow vpon it, as we haue in part declared.

He then seeing S. <hi>Augustine</hi> was cleere of opinion, that these things are not alwaies fables, but might fall out indeed; as where <hi>Apuleius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7439:293"/>

                        </gap>osse faults: First he accuseth S. <hi>Augustine</hi> of ignorance, and saith that he read not <hi>Lucian,</hi> because hee cared not for the Greeke language. Secondly, that <hi>Apuleius</hi> had drawne his discourse from <hi>Lucian,</hi> who saith that he had made this of his owne head for sport and pastime. The third fault that he committeth (which is the absurdest of all) is, that whereas S. <hi>Augustines</hi> conclusion is, that these things may either bee fables, or practised truthes (which is the very resolution of our discourse) <hi>Viues</hi> doth oppose against this, and saith, that it cannot be but that all these things are meerely imaginary and fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; and alleageth the authority of <hi>Pliny,</hi> that they are not to be held for true. Touching his accusation, that S. <hi>Augustine</hi> was ignorant, and had not read the workes of <hi>Lucian</hi>; it cannot bee made to appeare that it is so: how many Greeke Authors can wee cite both sacred and prophane,<note place="margin">Aug. lib. Conf.</note> whom Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> hath fitly and to good purpose alleaged? although it be true, that he did naturally hate the Greeke tongue, as himselfe confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth in his bookes of Confessions, and did therefore the more apply himselfe vnto Latine. A Commentatour should not lightly burthen his Author, whom he goeth about to explaine, with ignorance, he should rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him in whatsoeuer may admit of a defence. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other imputation, that <hi>Apuleius</hi> had taken his history from <hi>Lucian,</hi> it is so farre from being true, that it rather appeareth to the contrary. For <hi>Lucian</hi> saith, that those things which he had written were fables de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised by himselfe: but <hi>Apuleius</hi> affirmeth confidently, that what hee had set downe, was a certaine truth: hee goeth further, and reproueth those, that conceiue these things to be dreames, and saith that such do shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be altogether vnpractised in affaires of of such

secresie and importance.<note place="margin">Apul. Apol. 1. &amp; 2.</note> And if <hi>Apuleius</hi> had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that these things were imaginarie onely, why had hee not, when hee was personally cited before the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of Africke for witchcraft, and Magicke, made a short resolution of this doubt in both his Apologies, which hee published to cleere himselfe, and said, that it was but a popular report and a very fable. But we see he doth not so, but endeauoureth to purge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from the suspition of being one of those that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised these things.<note place="margin">Tertul. lib. de Anima. Augustin.</note> Touching the third; either <hi>Viues</hi> had not read, or at the least remembred not the senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Tertullian</hi> and Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> alleaged in the Preface vnto this discourse: by the which it is euinced, that Paynims were blind and ignorant in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and bad Spirits; yet doth <hi>Viues</hi> preferre the opinion of <hi>Pliny</hi> an Infidell and an Atheist, before Saint <hi>Augustines,</hi> who was the most celebrious and learned Doctor of the Church of God. Certainely if <hi>Viues</hi> had continued this fashion down to his last Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, where Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> doth largely proue, that there shall bee a generall resurrection in the same flesh and bones; <hi>Viues</hi> might as well haue said that this was not to bee credited, because <hi>Pliny</hi> is of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion, and might haue ieasted also at this as at a thing full of impossibility and falshood. So that whatsoeuer Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> doth affirme in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, hee did not take the same from the Schooles of Philosophers, but from the Scriptures, and Schooles of Christians, which he calleth the City of God.

In the yeere 1584. a Germane Lawyer, called Mr. <hi>George Goldeman</hi> did first publickly defend by argument (as himselfe declareth) and afterward caused 80. propositions to bee printed, which wholy tended to prooue, that the things which Sorcerers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, are nothing else but dreames and fancies. Vnto which it will be needlesse to make a full and distinct an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, because they are all of them confuted in diuers passages of this discourse. Yet wee shall doe well to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, that hee affirmeth, that before him no man did make the distinction betweene a Magician, a Sorcerer, and a Poysoner, and that the default of this distinction was the cause that none hitherto could resolue this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie. And although hee grant that Magicians and Poysoners are worthy to suffer death, yet hee denyeth that Sorcerers are to be punished with the like, because they haue nothing that is hurtfull in them but meere i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations and illusions: yea, hee is bold to say, that although, when they are awake, they yeeld their assent vnto such imaginations, yet are they no way culpable either before God or men.<note place="margin">Propositione 38. vsque 61.</note> And to excuse them the more colourably, he alleageth that they are drawne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it by the deceite and sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>letie of Satan, and thorow ignorance and feare: but heerein hee sheweth himselfe too zealous and eager in their defence. For, if there bee a consent and delectation in such fantasies, there can not possibly bee a constraint: and if those concupiscentiall and fleshly cogitations which arise from the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7439:295"/>
of our nature bee condemned by the law of God,<note place="margin">Exod. 10. Matth. 5.</note> how much more execrable is that impure carnall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion with Diuels, although there be onely a desire, delectation or contentment in the same. But to confute him in one word, since in his 12. proposition he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth that Magicians doe really renounce God and their Baptisme, and doe adore the Diuell, doing all which hee commandeth them, and putting their whole trust and confidence in him, so farre as to recommend their soules and bodies vnto him at the point of death: wee would aske a reason of him, why Sorcerers should not be as lyable vnto death as those who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he calleth Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians, when they trespasse in the same, or in amore ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ominable manner then the others doe. For example, if a murtherer be guilty of death, much more doth a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide deserue the same, and if a fornicatour be seuerely punished, a far greater degree of castigation ought to be inflicted vpon him that committeth adultery: but it is certaine that Sorcerers are knowen to do whatsoeuer he conceiueth Magicians are able to performe: nay ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tymes they doe a great deale worse, and therefore are more punishable then they. And what letteth it, but that all these things may concurre in one man? since the Scripture itselfe maketh mention of some that were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters, Magicians, Diuiners, Poysoners and Witches altogether, as amongst the rest King <hi>Manasses</hi> for one. So that we shall do wel to call those sentences to minde which wee haue formerly cited to this purpose, as also those which are alleaged in the 6. chapter of this booke. But this mans errour is, in that he thinketh it an impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility, that Diuels should carry men or women in the aire, or should haue carnall knowledge with women, or that such kind of perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s should haue the resembla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of woolfes, doggs or cats, as hee expresseth it in his 68.

And since Satan had liberty to kill not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the sheepe but the sheepheards, and not to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme the house alone, but to wrap vp also those that were within it in those ruines, it is not probable, that he who is bloodily minded, a murtherer of men, and a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uening wolfe, that deuoureth whatsoeuer commeth in his way, would let any one of them escape to bring the newes, especially since it was in his power as well to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer the message, as to commit the riotts and murther, and since he had leaue to do vnto <hi>Iob</hi> whatsoeuer hee would, except one onely thing. <hi>Tantum</hi> (saith God) <hi>ne tang as animam eius.</hi> So that these newes tempting him most, it were no absurditie to say, that the Diuell

was the bringer of them: neither doth the text in reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting these crosses make mention of any one that did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape, but onely that he who brought the newes-said thus and thus: although as the Amalechite told <hi>Dauid</hi> that he had slaine <hi>Saul,</hi>

And this body the Diuell can mooue by a kind of locall motion: yet doth he not viuificate and operate in the same, as the reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble soule doth in a mans body, for this body is not a liue body, but is onely clothed with externall accidents, and seemeth to haue life by the secret working of these Spirits, euen as the celestiall bodies are turned about by a locall motion which proceedeth from the Angels: and yet cannot such bodies be properly said to liue. This is Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> resolution: <hi>Diabolus optat sibi corpus aliquod tanquam vestem</hi>: and in this sort did hee often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times visibly appeare vnto Saint <hi>Anthony</hi> as Saint <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi> reporteth,<note place="margin">Athanas. in Anton.

The Marcionites and <hi>Manicheans,</hi> who thought strange that the Deuill should touch Christ Iesus, denied not that the Deuill did visibly and corporally appeare vnto him, but they rather held that Christ Iesus was not clothed with true flesh, but had a body of the same condition as those are,

which are formed by Spirits.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11.</note> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth vs that Satan transformeth himselfe into an Angell of light: the meaning is, that he sometime taketh a comely humane shape as good Angels vse to do, to familiarise himselfe vnto men:<note place="margin">Matth. 28.</note> as we see in the Gospell that the good Angels, who appeared vnto those godly women that sought Christ Iesus in his sepulcher, were like yong men of 18. or 20. yeeres of age: so that this point is cleere and without controuersie both in the Scripture and amongst the Doctors of the Church. It would therefore appeare to be an ignorance and rashnesse too too grosse, to make doubt of the truth hereof, since there is such a cloud of Histories to giue confirmation of the same vnto vs, as for example: the History recited by <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> of a Magician,<note place="margin">Greg. Nazian. de Orat. Cypr.</note> vnto whom the Diuell spake familiarly, and the like. But that we may not exceede the iust limits of Annotations, it shall suffice that we obserue, that among other predictions of the end of the world Saint <hi>Hippolytus</hi> writeth,<note place="margin">Hippolyt. Ora. de Antichrist.</note> that a great number of Diuels shall appeare vnto men in humane shapes, and being thus disguised in borrowed formes, they shall assemble themselues in mountaines, dennes, and desert places; all which predictions do fitly agree vnto the depositions of Sorcerers. It will not be amisse to note the antiquity and authority of this glorious Martyr, for the better resolution of diuers passages in the fore-cited place, which by some might be offensiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken.

The same happened vnto this holy man, in whom wee may obserue many tracts directly flowing from the Spirit of prophesie, and other vsefull instructions proceeding from his owne iudgement. Amongst this later sort of Reuelations from the Apostles, wee are to place that which he speaketh of Antichrist, whom hee saith shall be a Deuill taking vpon him the shape of a man. And this we may easily see to be his drift, for he speaketh not absolutely, but addeth that for his part he is of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. <hi>Hanc opinor dilecti carnis suae substantiam phantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eam assumet organi vice.</hi>

Therefore S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> doth well obserue,<note place="margin">Esa. 14.</note> that the greatest ambition which the Diuell hath, is that men should performe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

The like may be said of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians and Sabellians, who denyed the three persons in vnity of essence and trinity of persons. Hence it ariseth, that neither the Diuell nor any other creature whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer can be worshipped by a Christian, vnlesse hee first abandon the faith which he hath of the blessed Trinity. So that it is no wonder if the Diuell doth first exact this of Christians in his Synagogue, for if hee should doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, hee could haue no colour to passe further. Whereupon wee may obserue, that there can scarce an heresie bee found, if a man search narrowly vnto the same, which hath retained the full and intire beleefe of the Trinity.<note place="margin">Sanctes doth treat of the blessed Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theismes.

S. <hi>Hippolytus</hi> a very ancient father and Martyr made no difficulty to grant, that the Diuell should at the end of the world visibly appeare to Christians, and should tell them, I will that thou deny thy Baptisme: for he is of opinion that Antichrist shall bee a Diuell, cloathed with the semblance of an humane body, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be not many that adhere to this opinion, because S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth plainly affirme, that hee shall bee a true man,<note place="margin">2.

For since the Diuell is not contented to make men renounce their Baptisme, but will haue them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to renounce their Godfathers and Godmothers, and are desirous to change the name which is giuen them in Baptisme, it is an euident signe that these things are very contrary vnto him. And this is certainely true, for if wee marke, the auncient fathers of the Iewes did giue vnto children their names vpon the day of their circumcision, as appeareth in the Gospell by the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision of Christ and S. <hi>Iohn Baptist:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luc. 1.2.</note> so that then they were wholy deliuered from the bondage of Satan, and were inrolled in the band, and were to fight vnder the banner of the true God, that they might hence foreward manfully combat against his aduersary the Diuell. As therefore souldiers when they are receiued vnder the banner and pay of an Emperour or Captaine, doe presently cause their names to bee registred, that they may be alwaies ready to march when they shall be commanded thereunto, so that in the Monarchie of Roome, <hi>Nomen dare,</hi> did signifie all that which hath bin now said: in like manner in this Sacrament, men doe giue names vnto children, that they may alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, what they haue promised, and vnder what
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7439:303"/>
banner they ought to march. And this was a custome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the very Gentiles,<note place="margin">Hieron. prolog in lib. 1. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheam.</note> as S. <hi>Ierome</hi> hath well noted, who gouerned themselues moraly well according to the law and light of nature, and did not impose idle or friuolous names vpon their children, but rather made choise of certaine names appellatiues, that betokened some vertue, vnto which they would appropriate and dedicate their children, and to admonish them to liue conformeable vnto the signification of their names. Thus wee finde many who haue beene called by these names <hi>Victor, Castus, Commodus, Pius, Probus,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Greekes <hi>Sophronius, Eusebius, Theophilus.</hi> But the fathers of the old Testament obserued another custome: for although many were called by names which signified good manners, as the word <hi>Micah,</hi> which signifieth humilitie, yet for the most part they added vnto their names the appellation of God, as in <hi>Heliseus, Samuel, Abdias, Zacharias, Esayas:</hi> (and this is a generall obseruation to bee noted in Angels, who are called by the names of <hi>Michael, Gabriel, Raphael</hi>) or at the leaft, they reteined the name of some holy man, that their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might imitate his vertues. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those that were present at the circumcision of S. <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> did wonder why they would call him <hi>Iohn,</hi> since that there was neuer any man of that ancient and illustrious family who was so called. Which very wel declareth, that they did more religiously retaine the names of their good auncestors, then they did the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage which was left vnto them.<note place="margin">Chrysost. ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. 12. in 1. ad Corinth. Genes. 45.</note> Heereupon S. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi> did admonish the people not to vse any superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing in Baptisme, but to looke well vnto this rule, to giue no names vnto their children but the names of Saints: and for the children, that they should retaine this name, and not suffer it to bee changed for any other vpon what occasion soeuer. They must doe as <hi>Ioseph</hi> did, who notwithstanding that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had changed his name after the Aegyptian manner, would yet keepe
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7439:303"/>
him still vnto his first name as appeareth when he said, <hi>Ego sum Ioseph frater vester.</hi> And the Scripture it selfe doth euer call him by the name of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and passeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer that prophane appellation which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> imposed vpon him: the same did <hi>Daniel</hi> and his three compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, for although <hi>Nabuchodonosor</hi> had called <hi>Daniel</hi> by the Chaldean name of <hi>Balthasar,</hi> and the other three by the names of <hi>Sidrac, Misac,</hi> and <hi>Abednago,</hi> yet when <hi>Daniel</hi> writeth his booke he euer saith, <hi>Ego Daniel:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Daniel. 3.</note> as also the three children being in the furnace cryed out, <hi>Benedicite Anania, Asaria, Misael Domino,</hi> neither did they acknowledge any other names, but these that were giuen vnto them in Iudea. S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> giueth the reason heereof. These kinde of names, saith hee, were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to children, to put them in minde to imitate holy men whose names they carryed: for if they doe not imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate such and such a Saint, it is an assured truth (as hee said else where) that the prayers and merits of this Saint shall not bee auaileable vnto them for their saluation. From whence this conclusion may be drawne, that it is not lawfull to giue the names of sinfull men vnto chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, although they haue beene famous in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, or haue been our progenitours and ancestours, because such impositions can serue for nothing, but for spurrs in their sides to prick them on to imitate their pride and wicked conuersation. How worthy then of reprehension are those fathers and mothers, who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine the name of Saints, and had rather giue their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the names of Infidels and Idolaters, who are now frying in flames of hell. And it is to be doubted, that if our Lord had specified the name of the rich man in the Gospell, they would rather haue taken it and called their children by the same, then haue giuen the name of <hi>Lazarus</hi> vnto them: but hee would not mention his name for many waighty reasons, and amongst the rest this may serue for one. It is therefore cleere that this is a meere trick and deuise of Satan, because hee abhorreth
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7439:304"/>
the name giuen in Baptisme, and taken (as the vsual cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of Christians is) from Saints, who vpon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion are the readier to aide vs, and to beare a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar fauour vnto vs. The Germanes are obserued to haue for a long tyme retained a barbarous fashion in two things especially: first in eating Bacon without seeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and feeding vpon horse flesh: the second in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Scythian names vnto their children when they were baptised:<note place="margin">Genebrard. in Chronolog.</note> yet at last vpon better instructious they redressed and mended these faults. It is therefore expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to chuse honest people for Godfathers and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers, which is an auncient custome in the Church, and practised euer since the time of Pope <hi>Thelesphorus,</hi> who was but 100. yeeres after the death and passion of Christ Iesus. For in regard that faith in Baptisme is not infused into the childe to operate, but onely to purifie the soule, it behooueth him to haue a Godfather to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct him in the workes of faith, and to protest in his behalfe that he shall beleeue in Christ Iesus, and shall be one of his Church; and this is to be done although the childe be dumbe and deafe, as S. <hi>Ierome</hi> hath it. And further,<note place="margin">Hierou. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. ad Galat.</note> it is to bring him to receiue the Sacrament of Confirmation, where the child, who hath bin baptised, commeth now to ratifie the promise made by his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father and Godmother for him at his baptisme, and by a consequent hee commeth to receiue new grace, that hee may bee strengthened to resist all the assaults and temptations of the Diuell. Hence it commeth that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in these dayes this Sacrament is so vniuersally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, the Diuell doth deceiue so many people, and maketh them with ease to renounce their baptisme, which they haue not yet confirmed: for hee doth no more but make them say, I am not tyed to that which my Godfathers and Godmothers haue promised for me.<note place="margin">Euseb. lib. hist. Eccles. Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. lib.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7439:304"/>
the Sacrament of confirmation. Hereupon ought the Pastors of the Church, and fathers and mothers also to be vigilant in this particular, left it should happen both to the one and to the other as chanced vnto <hi>Hely</hi> and his children, vnto whom <hi>Anna,</hi> and little <hi>Samuel</hi> were directly opposite in their courses. And concerning al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of names, <hi>Magdalene</hi> did affirme that all did change their names in the Synagogues, to the end that they might not be discouered by those who perchance might call them into question for the same.</p>

The same also happened (as it is more at large amplified in the inditement made against the Witches at Auignon) vnto a young man, who by his father was carried to the Synagogue where they were to meete: but when hee saw what abominable villanies they did, hee was much affrighted, and making the signe of the Crosse he spake these words, <hi>Iesu what is the meaning of this</hi>? Whereupon they all vanished away, and the young man remained all alone, and the next day hee came home to the village where he dwelt, which was distant from the Synagogue (as they call it) aboue three leagues, and accused his father for leading of him thither, and euer since those of that Village haue called

He made this interpretation, that when Crosses were enclosed in a Circle, it signified that the religion of Christ Iesus was to bee depressed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished, and that not long after such a signe this should be put in execution. Wee also see that the roaring Lion when hee goeth about to deuoure his prey, doth with his taile expresse a circle, out of which the poore beast that is inuironed with the same, dareth not in any sort to stirre, such is the feare that hee conceiueth of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie.

nor tried <hi>Altitudinem Satbanae.</hi> Last of all, touching the staffe which this Hebrew Doctor doth mention, we see it by experience, that the Sorcerers of our times vse staues, bestriding them, and putting them betwixt their legs. Neither was this opinion of so great and learned a <hi>Rabbi</hi> without the ground and witnesse of the holy Scripture, as <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> hath well obserued.<note place="margin">Osea 4.

As for the oyntment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall they annoint their staues and bodies, it is certaine that the Diuel the better to abuse these people, and to cloake and couer his owne malice doth make a compound of sundry idle and vneffectuall ingredients, as of hearbes, rootes, and the like: for the diuell know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth full well, that this medley is not a whit powerfull to transport their bodies thorow the ayre from one place to another: and experience it selfe doth also sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly auow the same. So that he doth this to couer his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious ends, and his aime is leuelled at no other marke then to commit murthers, and imbrue their hands in sheading of blood, as doth cleerely appeare by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of all Sorcerers, who doe concurre and agree vpon this point, that at the first it sufficeth, if they can borrow oyntment of their neighbours, but when they are at the assembly, the Diuell doth declare vnto them that they are to haue oyntment of their owne, and that it cannot be effectuall and for their purpose, vnlesse they get the grease of young children that haue been stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled by them.

vpon a set place to receiue certaine victuals which are promised vnto them, this is to be vnderstood of the dead bodies, which the Witches do dedicate and set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them in a place that shall be designed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: where they cause them to be sodd and afterward eaten by the whole assembly after an abhominable kind of Anthropophagy: and in all likelie-hood this is done to shake the Article of the Resurrection. For as <hi>Pliny</hi> doth atheistically argue, how can those bodies rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in their owne substance, although God put his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger thereunto, when as now the flesh is eaten by others, and is changed into the substance of those who haue deuoured the same. Besides, by this barbarous and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish manner of seeding, he maketh them to transgresse the very law of nature, and so indeede maketh them like vnto beasts, so that when Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> writeth that the Deuils are very seruiceable vnto those, that will promise vnto him such kind of victuals, it is not to bee conceiued that they do eate any thing, for they are Spirits, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they induce &amp; perswade others to eate of these diabolicall viands, because they know the impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and wickednes of such an execrable diet: for it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly against the first commandement which God gaue vnto man after the flood, to re-establish the law of nature, which by Giants and other wicked people had been much violated and prophaned. I giue you leaue (saith he) to eate of all liuing creatures vpon the face of the earth, but I forbid you to spill the blood of man;<note place="margin">Genes. 9.</note> that is, to eate and deuoure mans flesh. For in this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of Genesis, as the text it selfe declareth it, there was no question or mention of murther, but onely tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the diuersity and vse of meates. So that by this text, Anthropophagy, or eating of mans flesh is expresly forbidden, and therefore the Deuill hath brought vp the practise thereof amongst his people, because it is a thing against humanity and reason: and this is the cause why hee gathereth them together, and inciteth
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7439:311"/>
them to those abominable banquets and meriments. Touching other victuals and refreshments which hee causeth them to take, although in the eating of them they please and giue contentment vnto their tast, yet when these poore wretches returne vnto their owne homes, they are then as much or more hungry then they were before. Conformable hereunto is the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> who saith, that although all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall bodies in respect of motion and quality are vnder the command of Spirits, yet can they not change the substances of them, of which God is the sole creator, but are onely powerfull to make an alteration or change in the accidents. And therefore the Deuill can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make a stone bread: so that we may hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that this is out of the compasse of his naturall power, and that such meates are so onely in apparancy, being clothed with certaine qualities of bread, wine, or flesh: &amp; these qualities are but of short continuance, for as Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> saith, the workes of the Deuill can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be permanent, because they haue not the prop and ground worke of true substances. So that this was it, that shewed Christ Iesus to be the true God, because he had not onely caused fiue thousand to eate, but had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so fed and filled them for a long time after. Thus the bread that was baked in the ashes and eaten by <hi>Helias,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Reg. 19.</note> was framed by the fingar of God, because in the strength thereof he walked 40. dayes and forty nights. The same may be said of the Manna in the deser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

permitted vnto him to inuest himselfe with what forme he will or naturally can take vpon him, but hee is limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto such semblances as God is pleased to permit vnto him: and therefore saith S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> there is no question but he would haue taken a goodlier and more specious resemblance vpon him, then the forme of the Serpent was, if God would haue suffered him so to doe: but God would not haue it so. When hee comes to bee adored, he appeareth not in a humane forme, but as the Witches themselues haue deposed, as soone as they are agreed of the time that he is to mount vpon the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar (which is some rock or great stone in the fields) there to bee worshipped by them, hee instantly turneth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into the forme of a great black Goate, although in all other occasions hee vseth to appeare in the shape of a man: for God will not suffer him thus to abuse the nature of man, because Christ Iesus his onely Sonne is a true man, and worshipped as God and man both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for the Hypostaticall vnion of both natures is so indissoluble and so fast linked one to the other, that there is but one essence or person that ariseth from both natures.

And heereupon it groweth, that the Diuell is so much taken with this filthy and vncleane sensuality, as appeareth by the reasons which we haue alleaged. Neither are we to question whether such a thing may bee practised by the helpe and working of the Diuell, since it is out of all controuersy, that he doth and may take (when he is not in the act of adoration) any externall forme, that he pleaseth to inuest himselfe withall, especially amongst those who haue abandoned themselues vnto him, and haue done him fealty and homage.

And heereupon it is, why the Turkes do not thinke it strange which we haue amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst the Articles of our Creed, that a Virgin should bee
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7439:315"/>
conceiued by the holy Ghost, because they thinke that this may bee easily done vnto all Virgins, since they are assured by experience, that bee there Virgins neuer so closely restrained and kept from the company of men, yet are they many times found to bee with childe: and this is the cunning and practise of the Diuell, <hi>Qui sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripit aes demum in fundit semen.</hi> Moreouer this is shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out vnto vs by the auncient Histories and Poets, who doe frequently mention, that their Gods came downe from heauen to commit folly and vncleannesse with their fairest women, and had often times yssue by them. The like doth <hi>Apuleius</hi> report of his times: and these Gods (as they tearmed them) are nothing else but Diuels, as it is written, <hi>Omnes Dij gentium Daemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi> To conclude this and the precedent Annotation, I should thus remember these kinde of people, that God doth permit the Diuell to appeare vnto them in the forme of a Goate, thereby to put them in minde, that they are to assure themselues they shall bee placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Goates in that great and last day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because they haue leagued and combined them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with Goates in this world, and haue commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted execrable idolatry vnto them, as if they had beene Gods. Wee will onely adde, that the greatest part of the auncient Greeke and Latine Poets are cleare of opinion, that Diuels doe desire and practise to haue carnall knowledge with women: yea S. <hi>Ierome</hi> himselfe vseth these words. <hi>Daemones quibujdam amoribus ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiunt, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> saith that this is not pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to women alone, but is common vnto men also, whereby he doth plainly expresse himselfe, that Deuils doe vary sexes: which is also the opinion of S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine.</hi> For although they, that did labour to interpret and accommodate the sixth chapter of Genesis to this particular, are worthily reproued by him, because the precedent and following passages doe declare, that the mention which is there made, is of men, and not of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7439:316"/>
Angels: as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> well sheweth, yet doth hee not disapproue the opinion of the ancients touching this carnall commixtion, but on the contrary hee affirmeth, that it is an impudency to deny it. <hi>Iustin</hi> the Historian in his 11. Booke relateth, that <hi>Olympias</hi> mother vnto <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, did freely confesse vnto her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, that <hi>Alexander</hi> was no sonne of his, but was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by a serpent, with whom she had carnall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And heereupon did her husband repudiate her as an adultresse, and euer after would <hi>Alexander</hi> stile him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the sonne of the Gods, and not of <hi>Philip.</hi> Hee also reporteth in his 15. Booke, that <hi>Loadice</hi> mother vnto <hi>Seleucus</hi> did affirme, that shee kept company with the God <hi>Apollo</hi> in her sleepe, who (as shee thought in her dreame) gaue a ring vnto her, and when she awoke in the morning, shee found the ring in her bed. But such kinde of women, are full of impiety, and God hath vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly abandoned and giuen them vp vnto themselues.</p>
