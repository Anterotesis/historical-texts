            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE KINGS MOST Excellent Maieſty.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Moſt Gracious and Dread Soveraign,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THough I had the Honour to be very well known to His Majesty of ever Bleſſed Memory, Your moſt Royall Father, and to be a Sufferer in the loſs of a conſiderable Eſtate, for His most Juſt Cauſe, yet I may not be ſo well known to Your Sacred Perſon: however, the ſame Duty that moved Me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to fight for Him, remains in Me to write for You; not out of any Confidence in my Pen (for I am the firſt ſhall judge that my Self) but out of Conſcience and Loyalty to my Soveraign; for whoſe ſake, I reſolve to hazard Cenſure, rather than to be wanting in any Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that may tend to Your Majeſties Intereſt, and indubitate Right.</p>
            <p>The leaſt loſs of Power in a Magiſtrate, is a great Detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his Government, and an Advantage to his Enemies; the leaſt Creep-Window robs the whole Houſe; the least Errour in War not to be redeem'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And as that ever Bleſsed late Martyr ſaid (when He gave his Watch of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:54586:3"/>
to be cleanſed by the too-long Parliament) the leaſt Pin of it being left out, would cauſe a Diſcord in the whole: Therefore might <hi>Solomon</hi> well ſay, <hi>Where the Word of a King is there is Power:</hi> The <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> being Relatives.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Printing</hi> belongs to Your Majeſty, in Your publique and private Capacity, as Supream Magiſtrate, and as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor, I do with all boldneſs affirm; and that it is a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable <hi>Branch</hi> of the <hi>Regal Power,</hi> will no Loyal Perſon deny: for it ties, and unties the very Hearts of the People, as pleaſe the Author: If the <hi>Tongue,</hi> that is but a little Member, can ſet the Courſe of Nature on Fire; how much more the <hi>Quill,</hi> which is of a flying Nature in it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo Spiritual, that it is in all Places at the ſame time; and ſo Powerful, when it is cunningly handled, that it is the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Deity.</p>
            <p>That this Power which is intire and inherent in Your Majeſties Perſon, and inſeparable from Your Crown, ſhould be divided, and divolve upon Your Officers (though never ſo great and good) may be of dangerous Conſequence: You are the Head of the Church, and Supream of the Law; ſhall the Body govern the Head? Men uſe to trust, when they cannot avoid it; but that there may be a Derivative and Miniſterial Power in them, with Appeal to Your Majesty, I do with all Humility admit and propoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Printing</hi> is like a good Diſh of Meat, which moderately eaten of, turns to the Nouriſhment and health of the Body; but immoderately, to Surfeits and Sickneſſes: As the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſo
<pb facs="tcp:54586:3"/>
is very neceſſary, the Abuſe is very dangerous: Cannot this Abuſe be remedied any other way, then by depriving Your Majesty of Your Antient and Juſt Power? How were the Abuſes taken away in Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> and the beginning of King <hi>Charles</hi> his time, when few or no Scandals or Libels were ſtirring? Was it not by Fining, Impriſoning, Seizing the Books, and breaking the <hi>Preſſes</hi> of the Tranſgreſſors, by Order of <hi>Councel-Board?</hi> Was it not otherwiſe when the Juriſdiction of that Court was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by <hi>Act of Parliament, 17 Car.</hi> If Princes cannot redreſs Abuſes, can leſs Men redreſs them? I dare poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the Preſs, was the principal further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cauſe of the Confinement of Your most Royal Fathers Perſon: for, after this <hi>Act,</hi> every <hi>Male-content</hi> vented his Paſſion in Print; Some againſt his Perſon, ſome againſt his Government, ſome againſt his Religion, and ſome againſt his Parts: the Common People that before this Liberty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved even a <hi>Ballad,</hi> becauſe it was in Print, greedily ſuckt in theſe Scandals, eſpecially being Authorized by a God of their own making: the <hi>Parliament</hi> finding the Faith of the <hi>Deceived People</hi> to be implicitely in them, <hi>Printed the Remonſtrance, the Engagement to live and dye with the Earl of</hi> Eſſex, <hi>the Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo totally poſſeſt the Preſs that the King could not be heard: By this means the <hi>Common People</hi> became not onely <hi>Statiſts,</hi> but <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> in the <hi>Parliaments</hi> Cauſe, hearing but one ſide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then <hi>Words</hi> begat <hi>Blows:</hi> for though Words of themſelves are too weak Inſtruments to <hi>Kill a Man;</hi> yet they can direct how, and when, and what Men ſhall be killed: In the Statute
<pb facs="tcp:54586:4"/>
of <hi>21 Jac.</hi> Printing keeps very<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>able Company<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>Salt-Peter, Gun-Powder, Ordnance,</hi> &amp;c. all which are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from being <hi>Monopolies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not to be longer tedious, I too much fear, this late <hi>Act</hi> for two years compleats all the former Conceſſions of the late King: I know it was done in hast, and with a good Intent; but by Your <hi>Majeſties</hi> Gracious Leave and Pardon, even then very conſiderable Perſons in Your <hi>Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> were of Opinion they had nothing to do with it, the Power of the Preſs being ſo wholly in Your <hi>Majeſty.</hi> Indeed, Neceſſity that hath no Law, was the cauſe of this Law, <hi>viz.</hi> to hinder the Growth of Scandalous <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Pamphlets;</hi> but it hath fallen very ſhort of the End: for few or none, of many Printed, have bin brought in by the <hi>Stationers.</hi> I have now diſcharged my Duty to Your <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and if I find I have ſo far prevailed upon Your Royall Goodneſs, as to ask unconcern'd Councel what is beſt to be done, I have my End; I hope Your <hi>Majeſty</hi> will have the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.

then One Thouſand Pounds, in vindicating the Kings Grant of Printing the Common Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and His Lawful Power to grant the ſame, and kept His Title alive even in the worſt of Times (when 'twas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unlawful, becauſe the Kings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) I cannot refrain from defending it, now the King is, or ought to be, reſtored to His Rights again; eſpecially ſince all Perſons are invited by Order to ſpeak their Minds freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Subject: So that there is a Neceſſity upon me to ſpeak now, or for ever hereafter to hold my Peace; this being probably the laſt time of Asking.</p>
            <p>'Tis not unknown to every Member of each Houſe, how little Benefit hath accrued to the Kingdom, by the late Act of Parliament for two years, Entituled, <hi>An ACT for preventing the frequent Abuſes in Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Seditious, Treaſonable, and Unlicenſed Books and Pamphlets,</hi> &amp;c. Which Act determines <hi>June</hi> next: Nor can it be thought, but that there is cauſe enough for another Act to take place, when this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired. The Reaſon why this preſent Act hath operated ſo little is moſt apparent; becauſe the Executive Power is plac'd in the Company of <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners,</hi> who onely can offend, and whoſe Interest it is to do ſo: They are both Parties and Judges, and 'twere a high Point of Self-denial for Men to puniſh themſelves: But they will wipe their Mouthes with <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Harlot, and take it very unkindly, if the ſame, or a greater Power be not continued to them in the next Act to be made: They will promiſe as fair as the Long Parliament did to the late King <hi>(to make Him a Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous King)</hi> and perform it as certainly as they did too.</p>
            <p>Jugglers ſeldome ſhew the ſame Trick twice together; and the <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb is, <hi>If a man deceive me once, 'tis his fault; if twice, it is mine own:</hi> That the Great Councel of this Nation, ſhould further truſt thoſe that have deceived them already, and believe fair Pretences, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Reaſon and Practice, would be a ſad Fate upon Us all; when wofull Experience tells Us, That if the King be taken from being Head of the Law, there will not want a Law to take off His Head in a ſhort time.</p>
            <p>There were a ſort of People in King <hi>David</hi>'s time, which imagined Miſchief as a Law; as in the late King's time, that practiſed Miſchief by a Law: Which might incline the Parliament to frame a ſtrict Law againſt this kind of Miſchief. But I hope the King's Mercy in forgivin ſuch, (by which He imitates His Maker) will find ſo hearty a Converſion, that Ingratitude ſhall never joyn with Rebellion, to provoke a Tyrannical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb facs="tcp:54586:5"/>
over this Kingdom: ſuch Men (if I may ſo call them) are worſe then the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That having not the Law, and doing by Nature the things contained in the Law, are a Law unto themſelves, which ſhew the Law written in their Hearts;</hi> nay, worſe then Beaſts, who by Nature obſerve a Law amongſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>Shall Senſe and Reaſon alone teach Creatures willingly to confine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to certain Rules for the Common Good, and ſhall Profeſsors of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity break them? Shall the Law of Nature command Men to be free from offending; and ſhall the Law of God be thought to command them to be free to offend? Let not our too-near Neighbours the <hi>Turks</hi> have that Advantage againſt Us. But whileſt I declaim againſt others for break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Bounds, I may be thought guilty of committing the ſame Errour myſelf; I ſhall therefore moſt humbly beg your Honours Pardon, and reſt,</p>

            <p>REASON is the great Diſtinction between Man and Beaſt; <hi>Guſman</hi> calls the Man of moſt Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, <hi>A God amongſt Men.</hi> And Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> divides the whole Duty of Man into <hi>Knowledg</hi> and <hi>Practice.</hi> In the Infancy of the World (eſpecially before the Sealing of the Scripture-Canon) God Revealed himſelf and his Will frequently, either Vocally by himſelf, as to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Mount; or elſe by divers and ſundry other manners, As by Dreams, Viſions, Prophecies, Extaſies, Oracles, and other Supernatural means: Nor will I Blow up the Humours of theſe Times ſo high, as to Confine theſe his Miraculous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations to Gods People onely (though to them moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently<note place="margin">Revelation not Confined only to the People of God.</note> and eſpecially), but ſometimes alſo to Hypocrites within the Church, as to <hi>Saul</hi> and others; yea and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even to Infidels, as to <hi>Pharaoh, Balaam, Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar, Abimelech,</hi> &amp;c. But ſince the Writings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, (commonly called the Scriptures) And that the Chriſtian Church by the Preaching of the Goſpel, is become Oecumenical, Dreams and other Supernaturall Revelations, as alſo other things of like nature as Miracles, have ceaſed to be of ordinary and familiar uſe; So as now we ought rather to ſuſpect Deluſion in them, than <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

his Will, in caſe his Written Word ſhould be taken from us, or we from it: But we of this Latter Age have all theſe ſo Lively repreſented to our View, by the benefit of <hi>Printing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The great Benefit of <hi>Printing.</hi>
               </note> as if we our ſelves were perſonally preſent: For <hi>Printing</hi> is of ſo Divine a Nature, that it makes a Thouſand years but as yeſterday, by Prèſenting to our View things done ſo long before; and ſo Spirituall withall, that it flyes into all parts parts of the World without Wearineſs. Finally, 'tis ſo great a Friend to the Schollar, that he may make himſelf Maſter of any Art or Science that hath been treated of for 2000 years before, in leſſe than two years time. But Virtue it ſelf will not want Oppoſers, and Philoſophy is ever odious to ignorant Ears: Nay, there are a ſort of People in the World, that account Ignorance the Mother of Devotion, and therefore out of Conſcience would not have even the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Printed in the Mother Tongue: But I ſhall not go out of my own Way, to bring them unto it, further than by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Theame I have in hand.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54586:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
might ariſe through the miſtake of the firſt Writer only, whoſe Memory I perfectly honour) makes it the harder Task upon me to undeceive the World again: Nor wouldI under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this Work, but under a double notion; As I am a Friend to Truth, and ſo it is unfit to ſuffer one Man to be intituled to the worthy Atchievements of another. And as a Friend to my ſelf, not to loſe one of my beſt Arguments of Intituling the King to this ART in his Private Capacity.</p>
            <p>Hiſtorians muſt of neceſſity take many things upon truſt, they cannot with their own but with the Eyes of others ſee what things were done before they themſelves were, <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardus non vidit omnia;</hi> 'Tis not then impoſſible they ſhould miſtake. I ſhall now make it appear they have done ſo, from their Own, as well as from other Arguments: Mr. <hi>Stowe</hi> his Expreſſions are very dubious, and the matter expreſt very Improbable; He ſaith <hi>PRINTING</hi> was found in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunce,</hi> which preſuppoſes it was practiſed ſome where elſe before, and loſt: And further, That 'twas found in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1459. and not brought into <hi>England</hi> till Eleven years in the ſucceeding Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, being 12 years after, as if it had been loſt again. If this be true, there was as little Rarity as Expedition in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it, the age of 12 years time having intervened, and ſo indeed it might be the Act of a Mercer rather than a more eminent Perſon: But when I conſider what great advantage the Kingdome in general receives by it, I could not but think a Publique Perſon and a Publique Purſe muſt needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in ſo publique a Good. The more I Conſidered of this, the more inquiſitive I was to find out the truth of it: At laſt, a Book came to my hands Printed at <hi>Oxon. Anno Dom.</hi> 1468. which was three years before any of the recited Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours would allow it to be in <hi>England;</hi> which gave me ſome reward for my Curioſity, and encouragement to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed further: And in proſecution of this Diſcovery, the ſame moſt worthy Perſon who truſted me with the aforeſaid Book, did alſo preſent me with the Copy of a Record and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript in <hi>Lambeth</hi>-Houſe, heretofore in his Cuſtody, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54586:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the See (and not to any particular Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury)</hi> the Subſtance whereof was this, (though I hope, for publique ſatisfaction, the Record it ſelf, in its due time, will appear.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Bourchier,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> moved the then King <hi>(Hen.</hi> the 6th) to uſe all poſſible means for procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Printing-Mold (for ſo 'twas there called) to be brought into this Kingdom; the King (a good Man, and much given to Works of this Nature) readily hearkned to the Motion; and taking private Advice, how to effect His Deſign, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it could not be brought about without great Secrecy, and a conſiderable Sum of Money given to ſuch Perſon or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as would draw off ſome of the Work-men from <hi>Harlein</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> where <hi>John Cuthenberg</hi> had newly invented it, and was himſelf perſonally at Work: 'Twas reſolv'd, that leſs then one Thouſand Marks would not produce the deſir'd Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: Towards which Sum, the ſaid Arch-Biſhop preſented the King with Three Hundred Marks. The Money being now prepared, the Management of the Deſign was committed to Mr. <hi>Robert TurnoUr,</hi> who then was of the Roabs to the King, and a Perſon moſt in Favour with Him, of any of his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Mr. <hi>Turnour</hi> took to his Aſſiſtance Mr. <hi>Caxton,</hi> a Citizen of good Abilities, who Trading much into <hi>Holland,</hi> might be a Creditable Pretence, as well for his going, as ſtay in the <hi>Low-Countries:</hi> Mr. <hi>Turnour</hi> was in Diſguiſe (his Beard and Hair ſhaven quite off) but Mr. <hi>Caxton</hi> appeared known and publique. They having received the ſaid Sum of One Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Marks, went firſt to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> then to <hi>Leyden,</hi> not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to enter <hi>Harlein</hi> it ſelf; for the Town was very jealous, having impriſoned and apprehended divers Perſons, who came from other Parts for the ſame purpoſe: They ſtaid till they had ſpent the whole One Thouſand Marks in Gifts and Expences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So as the King was fain to ſend Five Hundred Marks more, Mr. <hi>Turnour</hi> having written to the King, that he had almoſt done his Work; a Bargain (as he ſaid) being ſtruck betwixt him and two <hi>Hollanders,</hi> for bringing off one of the Work-men, who ſhould ſufficiently diſcover and teach
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54586:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this New Art: At laſt, with much ado, they got off one of the Under-Workmen, whoſe Name was <hi>Frederick Corſells</hi> (or rather <hi>Corſellis)</hi> who late one Night ſtole from his Fellows in Diſguiſe, into a Veſſel prepared before for that purpoſe; and ſo the Wind (favouring the Deſign) brought him ſafe to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Twas not thought ſo prudent, to ſet him on Work at <hi>London,</hi> (but by the Arch-Biſhops meanes, who had been Vice-Chancellor, and afterwards Chancellor of the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Oxon) Corſellis</hi> was carryed with a Guard to <hi>Oxon;</hi> which Guard conſtantly watch'd, to prevent <hi>Corſellis</hi> from any poſſible Eſcape, till he had made good his Promiſe, in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to Print: So that at <hi>Oxford</hi> Printing was firſt ſet up<note place="margin">Printing first ſet up at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi>
               </note> in <hi>England,</hi> which was before there was any Printing-Preſs, or Printer, in <hi>France, Spain, Italy,</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> (except the City of <hi>Mentz)</hi> which claimes Seniority, as to Printing, even of <hi>Harlein</hi> it ſelf, calling her City, <hi>Urbem Maguntinam Artis Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pographicae Inventricem primam,</hi> though 'tis known to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that City gaining that Art by the Brother of one of the Workmen of <hi>Harlem,</hi> who had learnt it at Home of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and after ſet up for himſelf at <hi>Mentz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Preſs at <hi>Oxon</hi> was at leaſt ten years before there was any Printing in <hi>Europe</hi> (except at <hi>Harlein,</hi> and <hi>Mentz)</hi> where alſo it was but new born. This Preſs at <hi>Oxford,</hi> was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards found inconvenient, to be the ſole Printing-place of <hi>England,</hi> as being too far from <hi>London,</hi> and the Sea: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the King ſet up a Preſs at St. <hi>Allans,</hi> and another in the Abby of <hi>Westminster,</hi> where they Printed ſeveral Bookes of Divinity and Phyſick, (for the King, for Reaſons beſt known<note place="margin">Printing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with others</note> to himſelf and Council) permitted then no Law-Books to be Printed; nor did any Printer exerciſe that ART, but onely ſuch as were the Kings ſworn Servants; the King himſelf ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Price and Emolument for Printing Books.</p>
            <p>Printing thus brought into <hi>England,</hi> was moſt Graciouſly received by the King, and moſt cordially entertained by the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54586:9"/>
Church, the Printers having the Honour to be ſworn the<note place="margin">None but the Kings ſworn Servants permitted to be Printers.</note> King's Servants, and the Favour to Lodge in the very Boſome of the Church; as in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> St. <hi>Albans, Oxon,</hi> &amp;c. By this meanes the ART grew ſo famous, that <hi>Anno prim. Rich.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. when an Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> was made for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of Aliens, from uſing any Handicrafts here (except as Servants to Natives) a ſpecial <hi>Proviſoe</hi> was inſerted, that Strangers might bring in Printed or Written Books, to ſell at their pleaſure, and Exerciſe the ART of Printing here, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that Act: So that in the ſpace of 40 or 50 years, by the eſpecial Induſtry and Indulgence of <hi>Edw.</hi> the Fourth, <hi>Edw.</hi> the Fifth, <hi>Rich.</hi> the Third, <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> prov'd ſo good Proficients in Print<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing, and grew ſo numerous, as to furniſh the Kingdome with Books; and ſo Skilfull, as to print them as well as any beyond the Seas, as appears by the Act of the 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. which Abrogates the ſaid <hi>Proviſoc</hi> for that Reaſon. And it was further Enacted in the ſaid Statute, That if any perſon bought Forreign Books bound, he ſhould pay 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d. per</hi> Book. And it was further Provided and Enacted, That in<note place="margin">The Price of Books not to be enhauced.</note> caſe the ſaid Printers and Sellers of Books, were unreaſonable in their prices, they ſhould be moderated by the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, Lord Treaſurer, the two Lord Chief Juſtices, or any two of them, who alſo had power to Fine them 3 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> for every Book whoſe price ſhall be enhanced.</p>
            <p>Thus was the ART of Printing, in its Infancy, Nurſed up by the Nurſing Father of us all, and in its riper Age brought up in Monaſteries of greateſt Accompt; and yet were the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments thereof reſtrained from the Evil of enhancing the prices of Books, to the Detriment of their Fellow-Subjects, by the Authority aforeſaid. While they had this Check up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, they were not only Servants to the King, but Friends to the Kingdom: But when they were by Charter Concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated with <hi>Book-Binders, Book-Sellers,</hi> and <hi>Founders</hi> of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, 3 and 4 <hi>Phil.</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> and called the <hi>Company of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners,</hi> the Body forgot the Head, and by degrees, (breaking the Reines of Government) they kickt againſt the Power that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54586:9"/>
gave them Life: And whereas before they Printed nothing but by the Kings eſpeciall Leave and Command, they now (being free) ſet up for themſelves to print what they could get moſt Money by; and taking the Advantage of thoſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiginous Times, of the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> they fill'd the Kingdom with ſo many Books, and the Brains of the People with ſo many contrary Opinions, that theſe Paper-pellets became as dangerous as Bullets, to verifie that Saying of <hi>Tertullian, That Lawyers Gowns hurt the Common-wealth as much as Souldiers Helmets.</hi> Thus was this excellent and deſireable ART, within leſs than one hundred years, ſo totally vitiated, that whereas they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King's Printers and Servants, they now grew ſo poor, ſo numerous, and contemptible, by being Concorporated, that they turn'd this famous ART into a Mechanick Trade for a Livelyhood.</p>

            <p>The Matter of which before I anſwer, I muſt crave leave to give you the ſignification of the Word <hi>Mechanick;</hi> the rather, becauſe the ſeveral ſorts of Trades, of which the Company of <hi>Stationers</hi> are Compoſed (and more particularly the <hi>Book-Sellers</hi> who ſay they are of no Manufacture) do pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily deny themſelves to be <hi>Mechanicks.</hi>

               <hi>Muſick</hi> is not onely an Art, but one of the Liberall Arts practiſed by Princes themſelves, and made inſtrumentall to the Glory of God; yet what Trade is there more deſpicable in the World both in Name and Nature, than a Common Fidler; though he may draw as good a ſound out of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, and have as much Art in Playing and Compoſing as any Gentleman, yet if he get his Living by it, and makes it his Trade, he is ſtill but a Fidler: and herein I pity him more than any of other Profeſſions, becauſe he perverts the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and turns Day into Night; for moſt commonly when ſober Perſons are in Bed, he muſt play to pleaſe the humours of the lighter ſort; And though his Heart be ready to break through Melancholy, he muſt ſing a merry Song to delight the Company, if commanded, or have his Fiddle ſing about his Ears: Is not this Mechanick, think you?</p>
            <p>But to Return where I digreſt; <hi>Printing</hi> became now ſo dangerous to the Common-wealth, That there were more Books Burnt in Ten years, than could be Printed in Twenty: And now it concern'd the Prince altogether as much to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Abuſe, as it was before to Obtain the Uſe of Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; And had there not been a Reſerve of Licenſing ſuch Books as ſhould be Printed ſtill remaining in the Crown, they might have publiſhed the wickedneſs of their own Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with Authority.

            <p>The Truth of this the moſt impudent Opponent will not deny, becauſe the <hi>Patents</hi> themſelves give Evidence againſt them; nor will they deny in words (though they do daily in fact) that the King hath Power to make ſuch Grants.</p>

            <p>I wiſh <hi rend="blackletterType">Corporations</hi> would do but as much as that, and not go out of their Way to deſtroy <hi rend="blackletterType">Monarchy;</hi> for I muſt needs confeſs, that ſhining Shooes and ſet Ruffs were very forward to ſit in Judgment upon the late King's Party, for doing but their Duty to their PRINCE, which they themſelves ought to have done.</p>
            <p>And here I might take occaſion to ſay, That though the <hi rend="blackletterType">Lawes</hi> of GOD be infinite and everlaſting, and fitted for all Times and Perſons, yet the Lawes of Men are like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,<note place="margin">Humane Laws ſubject not only to Imperfection, but Death it ſelf.</note> finite, imperfect, and ſubject to Infirmity, and Death it ſelf, as the makers are: Hence it comes, that ſo many Laws are repeal'd, and others made in their rooms; and hence it may come, that all leſſer Governments under a <hi rend="blackletterType">Monarchy</hi> may by <hi>miſuſer</hi> be wholly taken away, or elſe abated; as was heretofore the <hi rend="blackletterType">Barons</hi> Power by their ſo often taking up Arms againſt the KING; and the two Hundreds of <hi>Dudſon</hi> and <hi>Kings Barton,</hi> who were by this very <hi rend="blackletterType">Parliament</hi> taken out of the Juriſdiction of <hi rend="blackletterType">Gloueeſter,</hi> though enjoy'd by them ever ſince the Times of <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, the Grant
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54586:16"/>
being judg'd unreaſonable; our beſt <hi rend="blackletterType">Lawes</hi> and <hi rend="blackletterType">Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> by Age loſing ſtrength and vigour, as our Bodies do, either by the Crafty Evaſions of the Offendors, or by the alteration of their Vices, or by the male-adminiſtration of Juſtice upon the Malefactors; for the juſt performance of which laſt, none have greater Encouragement than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of a good Conſcience to fortifie them againſt the malice of thoſe they puniſh; who though they Act according to their beſt Judgment, yet by reaſon of ſome doubtful penning of a Law, Offenders are alſo many times taken out of the hand of Juſtice, to the very great encouragement of the Delinquents, and diſcouragement of the Puniſhers; inſomuch, as when <hi>Twyn</hi> was lately arraign'd for <hi rend="blackletterType">Printing Treaſon,</hi> he was condemn'd by the old Law, though there be a new one now Extant for that very purpoſe. And ſo I return to the <hi rend="blackletterType">Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners</hi> again; where I find them very Sollicitous with the <hi rend="blackletterType">Parliament</hi> to Enlarge, or at leaſt Confirm, this Power they have already, (reſolving to have it by <hi>Hook</hi> or by <hi>Crook)</hi> and Promiſing all care and diligence for the future, if they ſhall be once more truſted; ſaying, with <hi rend="blackletterType">Abſolom, O that I were made Judge in the Land, &amp;c. That every Man might have Juſtice:</hi> and what followes, but preſently raiſing an Army againſt King <hi>David,</hi> though his own Father.</p>
            <p>Let not the <hi>Reader</hi> conjecture I lay an <hi>Imputation</hi> upon every particular Member of the Company, (for there are too many of them that groan under the like Burthen, as I my ſelf do,) but againſt the whole Corporation, as a Body Politique (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially as 'tis now governed.)</p>
            <p>I have now ſhewed you the Practices of the Company of <hi>Stationers,</hi> and ſome particular Members thereof, againſt the <hi>King,</hi> and his <hi>Patentees;</hi> who, like Painted Sepulchres, appear Glorious without, but within are full of Rottenneſs and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: I have alſo opened, tented, and ſering'd the Sores of their Body Politique, and tryed them to the quick (which I hope will not prove like the Touch of a Gall'd Horſe-Back, to receive a Kick for my Labour and good-will). But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am not ſo good a Chirurgion, as to cloſe and cure them again my ſelf, I ſhall implore the help of the <hi>Parliament,</hi>

            <p>And if the Brewers, who at moſt can but ſteal away a Fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick part of the King's Revenue, deſerve the ſerious Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Supreme Council of <hi>England,</hi> how much more theſe, that do not onely bereave the King of his Good-Name, but of the very Hearts of His People; between whom there is as much oddes, as between a Pyrate that robs a Ship or two, and <hi>Alexander</hi> that robs the whole World.</p>
