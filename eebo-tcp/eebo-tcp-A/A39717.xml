         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

nothing to do with him; not that I feared what
he cou'd say of me, but only, what I cou'd say
of him, being loth to use the advantage I
had over him; but since he wou'd needs urge
me, and there was no end of his malice: I

BEing to write <hi>Tomaso</hi>'s Life, I know not

too vicions for Raillerie, and not worth a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

Satyrical style, less fit he's for any other; in
that it shall be then.</p>
                  <p>He was one born to discredit all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
he was of; the <hi>Traveller, Courtier,
Soldier, Writer,</hi> and the <hi>Buffoon,</hi> in all: All
which we shall Treat of, severally and

                  <head>Of his Nature and Disposition.</head>
                  <p>HE was so ill Natur'd, as he car'd not
in whose light he stood, so he might
see; nor whom he indamag'd, so he might
gain by it; and if he had a kindness for
any one, 'twas only for being as vicious as
himself: So even his good Nature was
but an effect of his <hi>ill;</hi> and his <hi>ill</hi> in every
thing predominant.</p>
                  <p>He thought all the World made for
<pb facs="tcp:109045:4"/>
him, and he for none; and that all wisdom
consisted in keeping his own, and getting
as much as he could of another Man's.</p>
                  <p>He was another <hi>Titus</hi> reverst; and thought
he had lost a day when he had harm'd and
mischiev'd none; and was so pernicious to
every one, as if that saying be true, that
<hi>one man is a Wolf unto another;</hi> 'twas never
more verified then in him; so as if King
<hi>Lucius</hi> were alive agen, he'd give more for
freeing the Land from him alone, then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
he did for all the <hi>Wolves</hi> together.</p>

                  <head>How he Wandred Abroad.</head>
                  <p>HE talks of <hi>Banishment,</hi> but 'tis well
known he was forc'd to fly his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
for debt, long before any other Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was talked of, and he bandited him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
but as Citizens turn Bankerouts to
couzen their Creditors. <hi>Besides,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To add to his evil nature as evil Arts,
he went abroad, and in <hi>Italy</hi> studied the
<hi>Putana Errante,</hi> the <hi>Picaro</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and
all the <hi>Fripons</hi> and <hi>Friponeries</hi> in <hi>France,</hi>
till he had perfectly learnt all their Arts, and
was compleatly qualified to deboish and
couzen every one.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:109045:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
To tell you of his <hi>Deboisheries</hi> I shou'd
offend all modest ears; and I wou'd I had
some qualifying Term, to call his deceits
and Cozenages by, (for to call every thing
by their proper Names is course, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
of Rusticity;) but be the name
what it will, the thing's the same.</p>
                  <p>'Twere endless to tell you how he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
and coz'ned every one, of all Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Nations, and Religions, <hi>Iews, Italians,
Courtesans, &amp;c.</hi> but especially those of his
own Country; nor was ever any more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted
for't then he, who was flattering and
insinuating, and had learnt of <hi>Lysander,</hi> that
as Children are coz'ned with <hi>Nuts</hi> and
<hi>Apples,</hi> so Men are with <hi>good words</hi> and
<hi>fair promises;</hi> and he was so wrapt up in
craft and dissimulation, as you might sooner
peel a <hi>Bulbus</hi> Root out of all his Rinds, then
unfold him out of all his subtilties; and
sweep an Earthen Flore to its last grain of
dust, then come to an end of his dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
So wandred he up and down, (worse

till finding no more abroad, to cozen and
<pb facs="tcp:109045:5"/>
deboish, without which there was no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
for him; (the one maintaining the
other, and either him,) he return'd home at
last, and might well say with <hi>Buscon</hi> his
fellow-Wanderer:
<q>
                        <l>Con l' Art e con l' Inganno</l>
                        <l>Vivo l' mezzo part l' Anno;</l>
                        <l>Con l' Inganno e con l' Art,</l>
                        <l>Vivo l' Altra mezzo part.</l>
                     </q>
That is in English,
<q>
                        <l>With my Art, and with deceit,</l>
                        <l>Part of my Living I do get,</l>
                        <l>And I get the other part</l>
                        <l>With deceit and with my Art.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being return'd, he fell to practising at
home the Artes he had learnt abroad, and
had a more profitable field for it, though
not so ample as he had before.</p>

                  <head>How he was a Courtier.</head>
                  <p>ALthough he had a better place in
Court, then he deserved, yet he would
needs add the <hi>Buffoon</hi>'s place unto it, as more
suitable to his humour and disposition, and
more priviledge to abuse and raile at every
one: there being none of any Dignity in
<hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State</hi> whom he had not saucily
abus'd with his leud and scurrilous Tongue;
for he was of a bold abusive wit; and whilst
others took care of what they said, he talkt
madly, <hi>dash, dash,</hi> and never car'd how he
be spatter'd others, or defil'd himself, spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
neither his own, nor others shames; and
his impudent boldness was all his wit, with
which he caus'd Laughter, but 'twas rather
forc'd then natural, and as they laught at
mischief, so they laught at him; his Jests
having always somewhat of malice in them,
and he being the worst sort of <hi>Satyr,</hi> not
against <hi>Vice,</hi> but <hi>Vertue;</hi> a profest enemy to
all that were Vertuous, and never pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Vertue in any one.</p>
                  <p>So he was a perpetual Libel in the
Court of others, and to others of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109045:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Court; and they but repeated his bold
speeches, when they wou'd speak ill of it,

                  <p>DUring the Warrs, not to be a <hi>Soldier,</hi>
he made himself a <hi>Captain,</hi> and to
scape fighting, has continued so ever since,
his Sword being so little able to boast its
blood, as all its nobility lyes in the <hi>Hylt</hi> and
<hi>Belt;</hi> and it derives its honour more from
the Scabbard then the Blade.</p>
                  <p>All the Employment he had during the
Warrs, was now and then to bring up a
Convoy of Wenches to the Camp, (a sort
of terrible Engins of War, that do as much
harm and execution by <hi>Land,</hi> as Fire-Ships
do by <hi>Sea</hi>) whence he gain'd the honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

Title of <hi>Pimp-Master General</hi> of the
Army; in which office he continued till
(chiefly for his sins) his side at last being
overcome; he, as from some common
ship-wrack was the first that sav'd himself;
and so he were safe, car'd not what became
of all the rest.</p>

<hi>Cum Privilegio</hi> of <hi>Cavalier</hi> and

to be, <hi>tam marte quam mercurio;</hi> as
good at <hi>Artes</hi> and <hi>Armes;</hi> and so was he,
for he was good at neither; yet he would
needs be writing, though he could not
spell, and be an Author, without <hi>Rhyme</hi>
or <hi>Reason;</hi> and without any other learning,
then only that of <hi>vice</hi> and <hi>debaucherie:</hi>
Whence his writings were so <hi>scurrilous</hi> and
<hi>prophane,</hi> as for less, the <hi>Heathens</hi> ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht
their Writers formerly, and the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>

Poet was damn'd, when forc'd
by the <hi>Furies</hi> to confess his crime, he
only cry'd out <hi>Scripsi,</hi> that <hi>he had
writ:</hi> and whilst others shall have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Books at the latter day pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
against them, he shall only need
his own to condemn him and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
others too; (there's so much
of the <hi>Devil</hi> and of <hi>Tomaso</hi> in
them) but that fevv or none ever

read what he has writ, excepting only such
as are so bad already, his writings cannot
make them worse, and so corrupted, as they
cannot corrupt them more.</p>
                  <p>Which he perceiving, was so impudent to
bring them upon the stage, to infect that
with it too, by which he has frighted all
chast ears from thence, and will all the rest
in time, if he may have but his Playes Acted,
or the appointing of those which are.</p>

had none at all, (having left it long

                  <p>FOr his Diseases I will not touch them,

his <hi>Person,</hi> who being a Monster of a man, I
shou'd shame and dishonour Humanity
to set him forth in any humane shape;
imagine him as ugly as you please, whilst I
declare his ugly qualities.</p>
                  <p>Onely to make an end of depainting
him, He is most commonly pictur'd

and never satisfied, fawning on his greatest
enemies to serve his ends, and those once
serv'd, barking at his dearest friends; by
which <hi>Dog-tricks</hi> of his, as he was an enemy
to all, so he made every one an enemy to
him.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I briefly and in <hi>Epitome,</hi> set
forth his Life, reserving the making his
History more at large, untill I shall hear
that he is not content with this.</p>
