         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

his life, at flat defiance with Rome; and had he been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

Ridley, Latimer, Hooper,</hi> thoſe famous Proteſtant Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
even to the ſtake, and ſealed that doctrine with his bloud,
which his tongue and pen publiſhed to the world.</p>
            <p>Among other Tracts of his now extant, he hath a book forth
againſt <hi>Pelagianiſme</hi> and <hi>Arminianiſme.</hi> The book ſtyled

the Synod of Dort upon a friendly errand: I would to God
this ſolid and honeſt piece of his might helpe to make faire

I can witneſſe
that they are weary of it,
&amp; would gladly be freed
if they could. VVhen we were to yeeld
our conſent to the <hi>Belgick</hi> Confeſſion at
<hi>Dort,</hi> I made open proteſtation in the
Synode, That whereas in the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
there was inſerted a ſtrange conceit
of the parity of Miniſters, to be inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

the Church; That he ordained 12. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
and alſo 70. Diſciples; That the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the 12. was above the other;
That the Church preſerved this order
left by our Saviour. And therfore when
the extraordinary authority of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
ceaſed, yet their ordinary authority
continued in Biſhops who ſucceeded
them, who were by the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
left in the government of the
Church to ordaine Miniſters, and to ſee
that they who were ſo ordained, ſhould
preach no other doctrine; That in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
degree the Miniſters that were
governed by Biſhops, who ſucceeded
the 70. Diſciples; That this order hath
been maintained in the Church, from
the time of the Apoſtles; and herein I
appealed to the judgement of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and to the judgement of any learned
man now living, and craved herein to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113440:4"/>

the cauſe. To this there was no anſwer
made by any; whereupon we concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that they yeelded to the truth of the
Proteſtation. And ſomewhat I can ſay
of mine owne knowledge, for I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with divers of the beſt learned
in that Synode, I told them that the
cauſe of all their troubles was this, that
they had no Biſhops amongſt them,
who by their authority might repreſſe
turbulent ſpirits, that broached novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Every man had liberty to ſpeak or
write what he liſt, and as long as there
were no Eccleſiaſticall men in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to repreſſe and cenſure ſuch contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſpirits, their Church could never be
without trouble: Their anſwer was, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113440:5"/>
they did much honour and reverence
the good order and diſcipline of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and with all their
hearts would be glad to have it eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
amongſt them; but that could not
be hoped for in their State. Their hope
was, that ſeeing they could not do what
they deſired, God would be mercifull to
them if they did what they could. This
was their anſwer, which I thinke is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to excuſe them, that they doe
not openly aime at an Anarchie, and
popular confuſion. The truth is, they
groane under that burden, and would
be eaſed if they could. This is well
