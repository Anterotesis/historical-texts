            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHen I first vndertooke this Poeme, or as some very skilfull in this kind, haue pleased to tearme it, this Herculean labour. I was by some vertuous friends perswaded, that I should receiue much comfort and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement therein; and for these Reasons: First, that it was a new, cleere way, neuer before gone by any; then, that it contained all the Delicacies, Delights, and Rarities of this renowned Isle, interwouen with the Histories of the Britanes, Saxons, Normans, and the later English: And further that there is scarcely any of the Nobilitie, or Gentry of this land, but that he is some way or other, by his Blood interressed therein. But it hath fallen out other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; for instead of that comfort, which my noble friends (from the freedome of their Spirits) proposed as my due, I haue met with barbarous Ignorance, and base De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction; such a cloud hath the Deuill drawne ouer the Worlds Iudgement, whose opinion is in few yeares fallen so farre below all Ballatry, that the Lethargy is incurable; nay some of the Stationers, that had the Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the first part of this Poeme, because it went not so fast away in the Sale, as some of their beastly and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Trash, (a shame both to our Language and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) haue either despightfully left out, or at least care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessely neglected the Epistles to the Readers, and so haue cousoned the Buyers with vnperfected Bookes; which these that haue vndertaken the second Part, haue beene forced to amend in the first, for the small number that are yet remaining in their hands. And some of our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landish, vnnaturall English, (I know not how other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb facs="tcp:22434:203"/>
to expresse them) sticke not to say, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this Island worthy studying for, and take a great pride to bee ignorant in any thing thereof; for these, since they delight in their folly, I wish it may be heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary from them to their posteritie, that their children may bee beg'd for Fooles to the fift Generation, vntill it may be beyond the memory of man to know that there was euer any other of their Families: neither can this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre mee from going on with Scotland, if Meanes and Time doe not hinder me, to performe as much as I haue promised in my first Song:</p>
